The plaintiffs and appellants are a local hospital district, Palomar Pomerado Health System (the District), and nine physicians with whom the District has employment agreements, Alan J. Conrad, M.D., et al. (collectively Appellants). The defendant and respondent is the Medical Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>California (the Medical Board), an administrative agency which has the authority to enforce the Medical Practice Act, which establishes professional regulation and a discipline system for physicians. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2000 et seq., 2004.) Amicus curiae briefs have been filed at the trial and appellate levels by the California Medical Association (CMA), a professional association of physicians, and by several fellow hospital districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The trial court was presented with undisputed facts which raised a question of law as to the proper interpretation of the statutory scheme of which section 32129 is a part. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court ruled in favor of the Medical Board, granting summary judgment and declaratory relief to the effect that local hospital districts could not legally employ physicians, but could only contract with them as independent contractors. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 437c, 1060 et seq.) As we shall show, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of existing law was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\n<em>Arguments on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The main focus of this appeal is section 32129, providing in full: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the Medical Practice Act [(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2000 et seq.)], the board of directors may contract with physicians and surgeons, health care provider groups, and nonprofit corporations for the rendering of professional health services on such basis as does not result in any profit or gain to the district from the services so rendered and as allows the board to ensure that fees and charges, if any, are reasonable, fair, and consistent with the basic commitment of the district to provide adequate health care to all residents within its boundaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">One of the provisions of the Medical Practice Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2000 et seq.) referred to by section 32129 is Business and Professions Code section 2400, providing that corporations and other artificial legal entities \u201cshall have no professional rights, privileges, or powers\u201d; in general, this section embodies a ban on the corporate practice of medicine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the statute contains an exception allowing approval of the employment of licensees on a salary basis \u201cby licensed charitable institutions, foundations, or clinics, if no charge for professional services rendered patients is made by any such institution, foundation, or clinic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>According to Appellants, the introductory phrase in section 32129, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the provisions of the Medical Practice Act,\u201d establishes an express exception to the ban on corporate practice of medicine, allowing the board of directors of a hospital district or health care district<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cto contract with physicians and surgeons,\u201d <em>including entering into an employment contract, </em>for the provision of health care services, so long as the two general restrictions in section 32129 are met: the district may not profit or gain from the services so rendered, and the board must ensure that the fees and charges are reasonable, fair, and consistent with the district\u2019s commitment to provide adequate health care to its constitutents.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">If no express exemption to the corporate practice doctrine is created by statute, then Appellants argue an implied exemption may be found in the legislative history of the statute and its numerous amendments. (See pt. III. D., <em>post.) </em>Appellants then switch gears, arguing in response to the amicus curiae brief of Kaweah Delta Health Care District that it is immaterial whether a particular doctor\u2019s contract is deemed to be one of employment or not, when considering whether section 32129 and the corporate practice doctrine permit any such contract; instead, only the general restrictions of section 32129 should control. Appellants now claim they are not seeking a broad ruling overturning the corporate practice doctrine, in order to allow the District to employ physicians, but rather seek only to establish that section 32129 permits these particular employment agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In contrast, the Medical Board and amicus curiae CMA stoutly defend the corporate practice doctrine against all attacks, direct or indirect, evidently assuming that Appellants\u2019 challenge was a broad one attacking the continued validity of this doctrine. To analyze these arguments and the proper scope of this appeal, we first set forth the background of the corporate practice doctrine, and then apply it to this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\n<em>Corporate Practice Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> The Medical Practice Act prohibition of the corporate practice of medicine is declaratory of a basic public policy against corporate practice of the learned professions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at p. 159.) The doctrine is intended to ameliorate \u201cthe evils of divided loyalty and impaired confidence\u201d which are thought to be created when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>corporation solicits medical business from the general public and turns it over to a special group of doctors, who are thus under lay control. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 158-159.) In that case, striking down one such arrangement, the Supreme Court noted that it had approved that day, in <em>Butterworth </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 140, 148 [82 P.2d 434, 126 A.L.R. 838], a slightly different system adopted by the City and County of San Francisco for the furnishing of medical service to its employees. There, the Supreme Court held that the municipality of San Francisco had the power to act in this field to benefit city employees and, accordingly, their employer. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">As this authority shows, the general ban on the corporate practice of medicine is subject to several exceptions. First, Business and Professions Code section 2400 recognizes that physicians may be employed on a salaried basis by licensed charitable institutions, foundations, or clinics, if patients are not charged for the professional services rendered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 407, 413-414 [263 P.2d 638], the court found no violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine when the county entered into contracts with certain medical schools to provide staffing for county general hospitals, with the doctors and medical students to act as independent contractors who were responsible for the manner in which they performed services for patients. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 410.) It was found significant that the schools were not offering medical services to the public generally, and that the schools played no part in the actual relationship of doctor and patient. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 414.) It was also found significant that the county had the obligation to provide care for the indigent sick, and that these contracts sought to fulfill that aim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 408.) A similar result was reached in <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 519, 524 [284 P.2d 501], where it was held that a county could lawfully enter into a contract with a nonprofit charitable corporation for the corporation to provide medical instruction for staff at the hospital and care and service to patients in the hospital for stated fees. The court stated that these facts met all the requirements laid down in the <em>Pacific Health Corp. </em>case (12 Cal.2d 156, 160) (i.e., that medical services were rendered to a limited and particular group as a result of cooperative membership or association, or employment by a corporation having an interest in its employees\u2019 health; and the doctors were not employed or used to make profits for stockholders, as the institution was organized as a nonprofit corporation or association).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Case law has also illustrated the types of contracts which have been approved as outside the ban on corporate medical practice. For example, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number><em>Blank </em>v. <em>Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Center </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 377, 390 [44 Cal.Rptr. 572], it was held that a contract between a hospital and a physician\u2019s group was not illegal, even though it provided for a percentage split of gross income from fees for diagnostic services provided by the physician\u2019s group, because the doctors retained their freedom of action in conducting their practice. The evidence showed that the portion of the fees received by the hospital was proportionate to the hospital\u2019s expenses incurred in furnishing diagnostic facilities. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the hospital\u2019s contract for a closed staff practice of diagnostic radiology was not an illegal contract. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 390-394.) These were noted to be services customarily provided by hospitals, not only medical services. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 386-387.) Similarly, in <em>Letsch </em>v. <em>Northern San Diego County Hosp. Dist. </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 673, 677 [55 Cal.Rptr. 118], it was held that the hospital district had the authority to operate a closed staff radiology department by contracting with medical providers for such services, and that other physicians not included in the closed staff could not justifiably claim they were deprived of their rights to practice medicine. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">From these authorities, it is evident that there are chinks in the armor of the corporate practice doctrine. Certain medical and other institutions are allowed to enter into certain contracts for employment of physicians, but only under certain circumstances. Appellants\u2019 view is that they, a hospital or health care district which entered into contracts for employment of physicians, should be viewed as equivalent to a municipality or a nonprofit corporation which may properly provide care to patients through physician-employees. Appellants thus claim that their contracts should fall within the scope of section 32129, because no problematic divided loyalties are created. To analyze these arguments, we must look both to the nature of the party seeking to contract with the physicians, i.e., the hospital district/health care district (\u00a7 32000 et seq.), and also the nature of this particular contract, all with reference to the statutory scheme of which section 32129 is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>Application of Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avd\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\n<em>The Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The Medical Board did not dispute any of the undisputed material facts set forth by Appellants in their summary judgment motion. These facts included the identities of the parties and copies of the employment agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>between the District and each of the physicians. The undisputed facts include that the responsible state agency and official, the deputy director of legal affairs of the Department of Consumer Affairs, first issued a written opinion in 1991 that section 32129 created an exception to the corporate practice doctrine, authorizing district hospitals to employ physicians. However, in 1994, the Department of Consumer Affairs reversed its position and notified attorneys for the district that hospital districts may not employ physicians. Although plaintiffs could have faced civil proceedings because of this administrative interpretation, the parties to this action stipulated that there would be no enforcement action taken by the Medical Board during the pendency of this action, and the parties further stipulated that estoppel would not be an issue concerning the initial approval, then disapproval, of these contracts by the responsible state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The copies of the employment agreements in the record show that the employed physicians are required to meet targets of 4,600 patient encounters per year. If the physician does not meet the target, and if 45 percent of the fees generated by the physician are less than his or her base salary, then the employment contract will not be extended. The employment contract also provides for an incentive fund which represents additional compensation which the physician may receive from the surplus funds remaining after the employee-physicians\u2019 base salaries are deducted from a certain percentage of the collections made by the hospital\u2019s adult medicine division, the physicians\u2019 employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Pursuant to stipulation, the trial court deemed the Medical Board\u2019s opposition to Appellants\u2019 summary judgment motion to be a cross-motion for summary judgment, and took amicus curiae briefing from the Southern Mono Hospital District and the Association of California Hospital Districts. The CMA also filed an amicus brief. Judgment was rendered for the Medical Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>Standards on Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Interpretation and application of a statutory scheme to an undisputed fact pattern is a question of law, subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>(Rudd </em>v. <em>California Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 948, 951 [268 Cal.Rptr. 624].) \u201cThe general principles which guide interpretation of a statutory scheme are equally settled. Our function is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the .purpose of the law. [Citation.] To ascertain such intent, courts turn first to the words of the statute itself <em>(ibid.), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>and seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] When interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted. [Citation.] The language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole, keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute [citation], and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rudd </em>v. <em>California Casualty Gen. Ins. Co., supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Where statutory provisions are unclear, they should be interpreted to achieve the purpose of the statutory scheme and the public policy underlying the legislation. <em>(Sutco Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Modesto High School Dist. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1231 [256 Cal.Rptr. 671].) \u201cAn important aid in this regard is the legislative history of the statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Statutory Interpretation: Overall Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">With these standards in mind, we examine three aspects of section 32129: its plain language, its placement within an overall statutory scheme, and its legislative history. First, there are two general areas of ambiguity in section 32129: its introductory clause, \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of the Medical Practice Act. . . ,\u201d and the use of the term \u201cmay contract with,\u201d as not specifying what type of contract was contemplated. According to Appellants, the introductory clause creates an exception to the Medical Practice Act to permit such employment contracts; the Medical Board responds that this clause should instead be read, \u201cDespite the restrictions in the Medical Practice Act.\u201d Since the statute can reasonably be read either way, we turn to the next part of our inquiry, reading the statute in context with related provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u201cAnother principle of statutory construction is pertinent here. Where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Yoffie </em>v. <em>Marin Hospital Dist. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 743, 753 [238 Cal.Rptr. 502].)  Section 32129 sets forth one means by which the board of directors of a hospital/health care district may exercise its powers. The overall statute setting forth the powers of such a district, section 32121, includes two provisions using the word \u201cemploy,\u201d pertaining to the district\u2019s power to \u201cemploy legal counsel\u201d (\u00a7 32121, subd. (f)) and to \u201cemploy any officers and employees, including architects and consultants.\u201d (\u00a7 32121, subd. (g).) However, in subdivision (r) of section 32121, the general statement is made, \u201cNothing in this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>shall authorize activities that corporations and other artificial legal entities are prohibited from conducting by section 2400 of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d From this we may first conclude that the Legislature knew how to authorize employment of professionals, but did so in only two instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">A similar, reference to section 2400 of the Business and Professions Code (referring to the prohibition on professional activities by corporations and other artificial legal entities) appears in section 32126.5, pertaining to the district\u2019s board of director\u2019s powers to assure the provision of adequate health care in the district by entering into contracts with health provider groups, community service groups, and independent physicians, surgeons, and podiatrists. (\u00a7 32126.5, subd. (b).) The appearance of this clause in sections 32121 and 32126.5 makes it clear that the corporate practice doctrine was intended to continue to apply to hospital/health care districts, at least as far as the activities mentioned in these two sections are covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Moving on to the activity mentioned in section 32129, the rendering of professional health care services, the restrictions are stated that (a) the district may not profit or gain from the services so rendered and (b) the board must ensure that fees and charges are reasonable and appropriate. This language looks familiar, as the case law makes clear that various entities which are not subject to the corporate practice doctrine are also subject to similar restrictions: (a) there may be no profit or gain by reason of the doctors\u2019 services, and (b) the fees charged for the doctors\u2019 services must be appropriate (or waived, e.g., where charitable groups or membership/employer entities are serving their own constituents and have an interest in the welfare of those constituents). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at pp. 160-161.) Thus, section 32129 places the same type of restrictions on the District as have already been placed on other organizations that are exempt from the application of the corporate practice doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">However, this similarity does not in itself mean that the District is likewise exempt from the doctrine. Instead, one must look to the nature of the District and this particular contract. This District and this contract do not qualify under the type of restrictions approved by the Supreme Court in the <em>Pacific Health Corp. </em>or <em>Butterworth </em>cases (12 Cal.2d 156; 12 Cal.2d 140). Specifically, Appellants did not show that these professional services would be restricted to a membership group or some other subset of the public, rather than the entire public, as was required in <em>Butterworth </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at pages 146-148, and referred to in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at page 160. Rather, section 32129 expressly states that the district has a basic commitment to provide adequate health care to all residents within its boundaries. Similarly, another important restriction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>absent: that specified in Business and Professions Code section 2400, that no charge may be made by employee doctors for their professional services, rendered through a charitable foundation or clinic; this particular arrangement is not a charity operation directed at certain recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Further, the district is not the type of public entity, a municipality, which the Supreme Court recognized could employ physicians to render care to its employees. <em>(Butterworth </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at pp. 146-148.) The Legislature may authorize a public corporation to build and operate a hospital as a business, pursuant to the local hospital district law. <em>(Paso Robles etc. Hospital Dist. </em>v. <em>Negley </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 203, 204 [173 P.2d 813]; \u00a7 32000 et seq.) A district hospital board is not a constitutional legislative body, but rather operates under specific statutory authorization. <em>(Rosner </em>v. <em>Peninsula Hospital District </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 115, 121 [36 Cal.Rptr. 332], disapproved in other part in <em>King </em>v. <em>Meese </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1217, 1234-1235 [240 Cal.Rptr. 829, 743 P.2d 889]; <em>Yoffie </em>v. <em>Marin Hospital Dist., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 743, 750; \u00a7 32000 et seq.) Thus, it is not correct to consider a hospital/health care district to be a public entity in the same sense that a municipality is a public entity and, even though it is a governmental creation, it is not entitled to the same powers as were outlined in <em>Butterworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We next turn to related statutes dealing with the relationship of doctors and hospital districts. Section 32121.3, subdivision (a) sets forth the power of a hospital district, through its board of directors, to offer incentives to physicians and surgeons to practice in the communities served by the district, such as minimum income guarantees and reduced rental rates. This section shows that it is not necessary to <em>employ </em>doctors in order to attract them to the hospital district\u2019s community, since the Legislature has afforded another means to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In contrast, the health care service plan legislation, applicable to health maintenance organizations (HMO\u2019s), specifically authorizes plans licensed under that chapter to <em>employ </em>medical professionals to deliver professional services. (\u00a7\u00a7 1340 et seq., 1395, subd. (b).) However, the district is not a health care service plan licensed under that chapter, but rather operates under its own statutory scheme. (\u00a7\u00a7 1340 et seq., 32000 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">It is also of some interest that the Legislature has created an emergency medical services fund authorization in section 1797.98a et seq., providing for establishment of a fund to reimburse physicians and hospitals for charges incurred by patients who do not make payments for emergency services received. A doctor who is on salary would have no need for such reimbursement for services rendered. This indicates that doctors are still normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>considered to be independent contractors rather than employees. (Also see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14088, subd. (b), referring to the ability of \u201ccounties or other political subdivisions\u201d to employ doctors; as noted above, a hospital district is not considered a political subdivision, but rather a statutory entity.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Having compared these companion statutes to section 32129, we conclude its reference to \u201ccontracting\u201d with physicians and surgeons represents a reference by the Legislature to the historic practice of treating doctors who work for any entity which renders service to the public, rather than to a defined employee, membership, or charitable group, as independent contractors, not employees. We also conclude the introductory language of section 32129, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the Medical Practice Act,\u201d does not create an exception to the corporate practice doctrine, but rather was intended to clarify that this particular practice of treating physicians as independent contractors in this context remains permissible and is not in conflict with the Medical Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Our examination of the legislative history of section 32129 leads to a similar conclusion. As originally enacted in 1947, section 32129 stated that local hospital districts shall not have authority to render professional services either directly or through persons employed by the district. Although each hospital district had to comply with the prohibition on corporate practice (then found in Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2008), the board of directors of the hospital district was authorized to contract with physicians for professional services rendered in the hospital, under the direction or request of attending physicians of patients in the hospital, on a basis not resulting in any profit or gain to the district from the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">However, in 1972, this section 32129 was repealed and a new section 32129 was added, beginning with the \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of [then section 2008 of the Business and Professions Code, now section 2400]\u201d language. This amendment was accomplished through Senate Bill No. 998, 1972 Regular Session, whose purpose was to expand the kind of services a local hospital district could provide by permitting nonhospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>health care services to be operated. Thus, when the language referring to the \u201cdirection or request of attending physicians of hospital patients\u201d was dropped from the section, that change had nothing to do with whether physicians could be employed, but rather referred generally to authorizing nonhospital services by hospital districts. The legislative history shows a letter by the CMA complaining that the proposed 1972 amendment might eliminate the ban on the corporate practice of medicine, but there is no showing of any response to this concern by the Legislature or its committees. Accordingly, the raising of this concern by CMA does not of itself show that any change in the applicability of the corporate practice doctrine was .accomplished. The legislative materials do not show any intent to permit employment of physicians. The traditional meaning of \u201ccontracting\" with physicians and surgeons thus remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In 1988, section 32126.5, stating the powers of the district\u2019s board of directors, was amended to add the reference to Business and Professions Code section 2400 to clarify which additional services could be provided by the district, such as entering into contracts with health provider groups, etc. No change in the law to authorize employment of physicians directly by hospital/health care districts was accomplished by this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In 1990, sections 32121 (describing the district\u2019s powers) and 32128 (describing rules of the hospital) were amended. In section 32121, language was added emphasizing that nothing in this section permitted a violation of Business and Professions Code section 2400. The amendments did not make substantive changes, but rather made technical changes and clarified certain powers and rules of district hospitals. No new authorization of employment of physicians by hospital/health care districts was accomplished by this amendment. Overall, we have been given no reason to treat section 32129 differently from its related sections, 32121 or 32126.5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Finally, to the extent that appellants are attacking the corporate practice doctrine as outmoded or inappropriate for today\u2019s medical community, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>response is that we do not make policy, but rather apply existing rules to the facts presented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Along these lines, the observations made by the Supreme Court in 1938 in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp., supra, </em>12 Cal.2d at pages 160-161 are still apropos: \u201cThe other question raised by defendant\u2019s proffered materials is whether the time has come, as indicated by the movement for health insurance and group medicine, to reverse the long-settled policy against corporate medical practice and declare it legal and proper. A simple answer would be that the few extracts from the opinions of writers which we find in the briefs furnish us with no evidence whatsoever of a widespread change in social viewpoint sufficient to repudiate the existing law of practically all the states. All that we have before us is the proof of a controversy which has raged for years, between medical men, sociologists and others, as to the future course of medical practice. The desirability of present methods and the suggested reforms, including various kinds of insurance and group treatment, are hotly debated. [Citation.] Public policy may change, and doubtless where statutes do not cover the field, the court may follow such changes, but the court must, in such case, declare the <em>public </em>policy, the social view of people generally, and not merely its own private choice among hopelessly conflicting views of desirable reform of settled practices or principles in this field. In the present circumstances there can be no true declaration by this court that a change in social viewpoint now requires the abandonment of the rule against corporate practice of medicine. Such a drastic change should come from the legislature, after the full investigation and debate which legislative organization and methods permit. Though certainly aware of the controversy, and with presumed knowledge of our decisions preventing corporate practice [citation], the legislature thus far has not acted, and until it does we deem it proper to follow the existing law.

The \u201cprincipal evils\u201d thought to spring from the corporate practice of medicine are \u201cthe conflict between the professional standards and obligations of the doctors and the profit motive of the corporation employer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 160.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Under section 32000, any reference to local hospital districts shall be deemed a reference to local health care districts, and the terms may be used interchangeably.

Sess.) which amended various portions of the hospital district law (e.g\u201e \u00a7 32121). The argument is that the bill originally contained language repealing certain language barring the corporate practice of medicine, although that amendment designed to repeal the bar was eventually deleted. CMA has not provided legislative history material of which we may take judicial notice on this point, nor does it make any citation to the record to support the point. In any case, unpassed bills or rejected provisions have little value as evidence of legislative intent. <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1396 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) The version of Senate Bill No. 1169 that was eventually passed retains the language referring to Business and Professions Code section 2400 in the amended version of section 32121. (Stats. 1994, ch. 696, \u00a7\u00a7 6 &amp; 7.) Thus, this point is not helpful to the CMA/Medical Board position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-4\">To support their position, appellants have requested and obtained an order from this court taking judicial notice of two law review articles criticizing the corporate practice doctrine. (Wiorek, <em>The Corporate Practice of Medicine Doctrine </em>(1987) 8 J. Legal Med. 465; Chase-Lubitz, <em>The Corporate Practice of Medicine Doctrine: An Anachronism in the Modern Health Care Industry </em>(1987) 40 Vand. L.Rev. 445.) The Wiorek article indicates California is now in a minority of states following the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. (Wiorek, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 471-483; see also <em>St. Francis Reg. Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(1994) 254 Kan. 728 [869 P.2d 606,618], holding that Kansas law does not prohibit a licensed hospital from contracting for the services of a physician/employee.) Appellants have also raised several arguments on appeal that were not before the trial court: the corporate practice doctrine is an illegal restraint of trade, and federal HMO law should preempt the corporate practice doctrine. In response to the Medical Board\u2019s objections to these new arguments, appellants explain that these are merely illustrations of why the corporate practice doctrine should be considered outmoded. Since statutory interpretation rules are dispositive, we need not reach any of these policy questions in this case, even if they were properly before this court. <em>(Estate of Coate </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 982, 986 [159 Cal.Rptr. 794].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
