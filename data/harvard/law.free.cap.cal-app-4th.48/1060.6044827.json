Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/187; statutory references, unless otherwise noted, are to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>Penal Code), two counts of mayhem (\u00a7 203), found true a great bodily injury allegation (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) and three deadly/dangerous weapon allegations (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)). They found appellant not guilty of attempted robbery (\u00a7\u00a7664/211) and aggravated mayhem (\u00a7205) and hung on an attempted murder charge (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Three prior felony conviction allegations (\u00a7\u00a7 288, subd. (b), 286, subd. (c), and 487, former subd. 2) were bifurcated, jury was waived, all were found true, two as \u201cstrikes\u201d (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)) and five-year priors (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)), all three as state prison priors (\u00a7 667.5). Appellant was sentenced to state prison for 62 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is the trial court improperly restricted defense counsel\u2019s examination of the defense psychiatrist. We find this and appellant\u2019s other contentions meritless and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">It was conceded that appellant had repeatedly bludgeoned Diane T. and her 13-year-old daughter V. As defense counsel stated in his opening statement: \u201cWhat our defense concerns is why this nightmare took place toward those two innocent people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The issue at trial was whether appellant was so incapacitated from drugs and alcohol that he could not and did not have the <em>specific intent </em>required for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">We summarize the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">On September 6, 1994, Diane T., a 49-year-old psychiatric geriatric social worker, lived in an apartment at 8532 Saturn Street, West Los Angeles, with her 13-year-old daughter V. and 5-year-old daughter L. Her parents lived in the same building on the floor above hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Appellant, 41 years old, his mother, half brother, and sister lived in an adjacent apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The T.\u2019s and appellant had been neighbors and casual acquaintances for seven years. They had never argued. Once, while the T.\u2019s were away, appellant had walked their dog. Once appellant had helped Diane T. color her hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Appellant\u2019s mother (Delores Alvarez) had heart trouble and neighbors, like Diane T., knew of her condition because emergency ambulances came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>there. But on September 6, 1994, appellant\u2019s mother felt fine. She went to church early that morning, had some duties there, and stayed all day. She returned home about 5:30 p.m. Her phone was in good working order and later that evening she used it to dial 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">At 9 p.m. on September 6, 1994, L. and V. were in their bedroom. Its sliding glass door was triple locked and nailed shut. They were in separate beds, L. asleep and V. reading. When the front doorbell rang, V. sat up.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Diane T. was in the living room when the doorbell rang. She walked to her double locked front door and asked who was there. Appellant responded \u201cMark\u201d and, recognizing his voice, Diane T. unlocked the door, opened it slightly, and asked what was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">V. heard appellant identify himself, and curious what he might want, got out of bed and walked through the hall to the living room doorway.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Appellant answered Diane T. by saying \u201cI need to use your phone. Our phone\u2019s out of order and I think something has happened to my mother, maybe she\u2019s having a heart attack or something. She\u2019s real sick, can I use the phone?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Diane T. was shocked, stepped back, and pointed to the phone. Appellant entered and went to the phone. Diane T. left the door unlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">When V. asked \u201cWhy don\u2019t you lend him your car?\u201d her mother told her to go back to bed. V. returned to her bedroom, sat on her bed, and listened.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">As appellant used the phone Diane T. stepped to her couch and sat down. Suddenly, from behind his back, appellant \u201cpulled out . . . this giant pipe . . .\u201d [it was a jack handle] and, standing facing her, raised it overhead with both hands and, in a chopping motion, struck her on the head. Appellant then swung the jack handle like a baseball bat, striking Diane T. in the head a second time. He struck her in the head a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Appellant told Diane T., and she remembered his exact words, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you and then I\u2019m going to get your kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">V., sitting on her bed, heard \u201cloud moaning . . . pounding noises . . . blows . . . .\u201d She noticed \u201cthat Mark wasn\u2019t saying anything.\u201d She hesitated two or three seconds and then went to the living room doorway. She saw appellant, his back to her, standing over her mother, between the coffee table and couch, as her mother went through convulsions on the floor. V. \u201cstood there for about a second [and] didn\u2019t know what was happening . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>Then appellant turned and said \u201c[V.], your mom\u2019s really sick, call 911. Go, go, go, just do something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">V. ran to the phone in her bedroom, sat on her bed, dialed 9, dialed 1, was about to dial the second 1 when she \u201csuddenly saw [appellant] standing in front of [her] holding a long metal pipe.... He held it high above his head . . . and then pounded it down on [her] head before [she] could even scream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In V.\u2019s words: \u201cI was still conscious, I was totally\u2014I was in excruciating pain and I was completely shocked. This was a neighbor we had known all this time and I had never expected such a thing. I screamed, \u2018What are you doing, what are you doing?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Appellant \u201craised ... the pipe again, but before he let it down on top of [her] head again, he took one hand off. . . and placed ... his forefinger on his lips and said, \u2018shh, shh . . . .\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">V. was about to scream but stopped \u201cbecause [she] thought maybe if [she] quieted down he would stop . . . .\u201d Appellant again holding the jack handle with both hands \u201craised it as high as he could [and] pounded it down [on (V.)\u2019s] head.\u201d V. screamed and tried to shield her head with her hands. Appellant struck her again. She crawled around his legs and gripped a dresser drawer. Appellant struck her in the head twice more.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">V.\u2019s little dog barked at appellant when he struck V. so he paused, bent over, petted the dog, and said \u201c \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">V. let go of the dresser drawer, saw \u201cblood all over the floor,\u201d tried to close her eyes, thought she was \u201cgoing to die,\u201d and was in a \u201cfetal position\u201d when appellant left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Five-year-old L. remained asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">After a time, V. struggled to her feet and \u201cholding onto the sides of the walls for support . . . stumble[d] through the hall . . . into the doorway . . . [and] saw [appellant] standing over [her] mother with the pipe hitting her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">V. stumbled and crawled to the front door, tried to open it but couldn\u2019t because, now, it again was double locked. Appellant grabbed her hair, dragged her into the hall, struck her in the face with the jack handle, choked her with one hand and when she tried to pry his hand loose, hit her on the head with the jack handle. V. then lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Neighbors, including Diane T.\u2019s elderly father, heard the screams and pounding and came to her front door. When one of her neighbors, Sandy H., heard Diane T. say \u201csomebody help, somebody help,\u201d he tried to open the door, could not, and knocked it open with his shoulder. He saw Diane T. in a pool of blood, half on, half off the sofa, her skull gashed open and a finger hanging off. He \u201cran to her . . . saw that her head was open . . . [and] [s]o [he] closed it up with [his] hand and [he] noticed she was saying \u2018the children, the children\u2019.\u201d When Mr. H. saw Diane T.\u2019s dangling finger he \u201cput it back and [continued] to hold it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Mrs. H. went to the children\u2019s bedroom, took five-year-old L. in her arms, and carried her upstairs to her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Mr. H. saw appellant holding a bloody towel wrapped around something.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Diane T.\u2019s father, who was now in the apartment, also saw appellant with a bloody towel. He saw appellant drop the towel <em>and </em>his daughter\u2019s purse. When appellant tried to leave the apartment saying, \u201cI need some air,\u201d appellant\u2019s brother and mother stopped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Police arrived, arrested appellant, and seized the jack handle and a knife blade and broken handle. Paramedics transported the unconscious victims to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Diane T. was unconscious for about a month. She had multiple head and skull fractures, brain clots and contusions. She also was slashed across her breast and chest. Her injuries were life threatening and some were permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">V. T. was unconscious for two days and hospitalized for about two weeks. She had multiple scalp lacerations, a fracture in the right frontal sinus, a cerebral contusion, and bruising of her brain. Her injuries were not life threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court improperly restricted defense counsel\u2019s examination of the defense psychiatrist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">A psychiatrist, Dr. William Vicary, was called as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Appellant claims the trial court improperly restricted defense counsel\u2019s examination of Dr. Vicary in two ways. First, by preventing defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>from eliciting Dr. Vicary\u2019s opinion concerning whether appellant, when committing the crimes, <em>had </em>specific intent. Second, by preventing defense counsel from eliciting appellant\u2019s statements to Dr. Vicary, statements upon which Dr. Vicary relied in forming his opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument (that the trial court erred) is lengthy (35 pages of his opening and reply briefs are devoted to this argument) and elaborate. He parses sections 22, 25, 28, and 29 and analyzes numerous appellate decisions construing those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We need not address the substance of appellant\u2019s argument because the premise upon which it is based is mistaken. The trial court did <em>not </em>restrict defense counsel\u2019s examination of Dr. Vicary. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Prior to trial, at defense counsel request, the trial court appointed a psychiatrist to examine appellant. The appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Vicary, saw appellant twice for a total of six hours. He wrote a four-page confidential report in which he informed defense counsel that appellant was legally sane at the time of the offenses. He also concluded that appellant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and drugs had <em>not </em>produced \u201csettled insanity.\u201d Further, he concluded or implied<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant <em>had </em>specific intent during the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Notwithstanding these adverse conclusions, defense counsel determined to call Dr. Vicary as a defense witness, so informed the prosecutor, and provided the prosecutor Dr. Vicary\u2019s report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The basis for that determination was most lucidly stated by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\u201cA psychiatrist, under the current law, may testify to a person\u2019s <em>ability </em>to form an intent. They may not testify that the person <em>did </em>form the intent. But they are competent to testify that in their professional opinion this person <em>is capable </em>of forming a certain intent under given circumstances. It\u2019s for the trier of fact as to whether the person <em>did </em>form a specific intent at a particular time in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201cIf Mr. Bencangey (defense counsel) believes that the doctor\u2019s testimony would tend to either prove something that the defense is seeking to prove and is relevant under the law, or would tend to disprove something which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>People are trying to prove as part of their case, then the doctor can certainly testify.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Thus, despite Dr. Vicary\u2019s opinion that appellant <em>had </em>specific intent, defense counsel could usefully call Dr. Vicary and elicit from him factors which tend to <em>negate </em>specific intent: drug addiction, alcohol consumption, decompensation, and self-destructiveness. Defense counsel, then, could urge the jury\u2014which would not have heard Dr. Vicary\u2019s contrary opinion\u2014to find appellant lacked specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">This delicate defense strategy <em>depended </em>upon the exclusion of Dr. Vicary\u2019s opinion concerning appellant\u2019s specific intent. The record leaves little doubt concerning this strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">During one of the many bench conferences, this one before Dr. Vicary testified, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201cHe [Dr. Vicary] can be called to testify to whatever mental disease, defect or disorder the defendant had in his opinion which might have contributed to an ability to form a specific intent. He can\u2019t testify that he had it or he didn\u2019t have it. He\u2019s not allowed to go either way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I can\u2014I am certainly allowed to question him on the factors that would lead him to a conclusion that an individual\u2014for instance, in this particular case, he\u2019s going to say the alcohol and drugs would diminish this particular person\u2019s ability to form the specific intent. I think that\u2019s what his testimony could\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cMr. Bencangey: Could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201cThe Court: [ ] Could. Not would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re certainly entitled to ask him \u2018what other factors would you look at, Doctor, to determine whether in fact he had done so in a particular instance.\u2019 \u2018I would look at what he did, what he said, and how he did it.\u2019 That\u2019s what you are arguing to the jury. But when he said I\u2019m going to kill you and he gave a ruse that he was planning and premeditating \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>\u201cMr. Bencangey: I had no argument with any of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cThe Court: I mean, you got to understand something, and I use\u2014it\u2019s not exactly hyperbole, my analysis of this situation, the defense is grasping at straws, but I can\u2019t take the straws away from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cI mean\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a subject of common knowledge, for example, what would the effect of\u2014what possible effect would the taking of half a gram of cocaine daily for a month be on a person\u2019s ability to form a specific intent? I don\u2019t think the jury can answer that question on the basis of common knowledge. But a medical doctor or someone skilled in that area can tell us that. Whether it applies in this case or not, that\u2019s for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cIs there evidence here that this guy was taking a half a gram of cocaine every day, and even if there is, is there other evidence indicative of what he said and did that would indicate that even so, he was capable of and did form an intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201cMr. Bencangey: That\u2019s exactly\u2014all I want is the opportunity to bring those factors out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">In accordance with this strategy defense counsel called Dr. Vicary, established his expertise concerning drugs and their effects, and elicited that heroin, cocaine, and alcohol all <em>could </em>reduce a person\u2019s ability to form intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Additionally, defense counsel succeeded in having Dr. Vicary testify that appellant \u201chad a very profound history of alcohol and drugs and that he was a drug addict.\u201d Dr. Vicary also testified \u201cI think that there\u2019s very strong evidence that in the two weeks prior to the crime that he\u2014decompensated. I mean, he was told that his blood test was positive for HIV, he thought he had AIDS and he just became very depressed and despondent and he started drinking heavily and shooting those speedballs and doing PCP too. And his own words, he said, T was suicidal, I wanted to kill myself by an overdose.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Vicary added, \u201cI mean, he just kept doing\u2014drinking and drugs with a vengeance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>We conclude appellant\u2019s contention is meritless because the trial court did not restrict defense counsel\u2019s examination of Dr. Vicary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in not giving CALJIC No. 17.01.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In its third amended information the prosecution alleged appellant had \u201cpersonally used a deadly and dangerous weapon(s), to wit, knife <em>and </em>a jack handle . . . within the meaning of Penal Code Section 12022(b).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The trial court instructed the jury \u201cA deadly or dangerous weapon means any weapon, instrument or object that is capable of being used to inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d (CALJIC No. 17.16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">CALJIC No. 17.01 (see fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>was not requested nor given.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">In recording their guilty verdicts and true findings the jury used forms provided to them. Concerning the weapons use allegation the form stated \u201c. . . the said defendant . . . personally used ... a knife <em>and/or </em>a jack handle . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cTrue\u201d was indicated on all three guilty verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Appellant argues that use of a knife and use of a jack handle are different acts and the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury they \u201cmust agree that [the defendant] committed the <em>same </em>act.\u201d (CALJIC No. 17.01.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">A jury must unanimously agree on guilt and on allegations enhancing guilt. They need <em>not </em>unanimously agree on theories of guilt or \u201con the precise factual details\u201d of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 250 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Snead </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1095-1096 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 922]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phan </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1464-1465 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 364].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>\u201c[I]t. . . is well established that a trial court is not obligated to give an instruction\u2014either requested or sua sponte\u2014if the evidence presented at trial is such as to preclude a reasonable jury from finding the instruction is applicable. ... \u2018A unanimity instruction is required only if the jurors could otherwise disagree which act a defendant committed and yet convict him of the crime charged.\u2019 ... In other words, \u2018[i]f under the evidence presented such disagreement is not reasonably possible, the instruction is unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Muniz </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1508, 1518 [262 Cal.Rptr. 743], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the circumstances of this case, where it was conceded appellant had personally used a jack handle and that it was a deadly and dangerous weapon\u2014and where the knife use allegation was surplusage\u2014the trial court did not err in omitting CALJIC No. 17.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">3. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to state reasons for a sentence choice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The trial court imposed both the personal weapon use enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) <em>and </em>the great bodily injury enhancement (\u00a7 12022.7). Doing so was a sentence choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Appellant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to state reasons for this sentence choice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Although \u201c[t]he court shall state the reasons for its sentence choice on the record at the time of sentencing\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (c)), no particular form of statement is required. Although the trial court did not \u201citem by item\u201d specify each reason for each sentence choice, it was not essential he do so. The trial court, in unmistakable language, stated the reasons for his sentence choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">He said: \u201cIn a real sense, there is no adequate punishment for the crime committed ....[*][] We can talk about the defendant\u2019s use of drugs and alcohol, but obviously there is something very necessary in the brain pattern that constitutes a human being as opposed to merely a Homo sapien that is missing from this defendant. ...[*][]... [T]his defendant went from his residence in a very calculated fashion, not to just the nearest apartment, to a specific apartment, to unleash the fury of this attack. . . . fiO And it was a calculated attack. . . . [H This man\u2019s getting sixty-two years to life.

However, it is not thoughts or feelings of revenge or hatred that motivate me to speak to you today, rather it is the fear that what happened to me and to my child could happen to someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201cI have no doubt that our justice system must and does serve to protect our citizens and other residents from harm, but I am also aware that criminals sometimes slip through the cracks, so to speak, and repeat and repeat their anti-social behavior. I fear that this could happen with Mark and that next time his victims might not be as fortunate as we were. We survived, we did not die, and as damaged as we might still be, we do have a chance to rebuild our lives. The next victims may not be so lucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201cI want to give you some information that was not presented at the trial, not presented because I would not allow my already traumatized five-year-old daughter to testify. [L.], who was five at the time of the assault, her actions that night probably saved my life and also that of my daughter [V.]. She awakened after [V.] and I were already rendered unconscious by Mark\u2019s vicious attack. She screamed and continued to do so, which alerted our neighbors who broke down my door, called 911, and set in motion the arrival of the paramedics and police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cThe reason [L.] kept on screaming, in spite of her terror, was that although her unconscious sister was lying in pools of her blood with her jaw, cheekbones and skull fractured, her ear severed, my daughter [L.] saw Mark squatting over [V.]\u2019s severely damaged body with a knife at her throat. The knife, although a threat to [L.] herself was more of a threat to [V.]. I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that had [L.] not awakened when she did and had her blood-curdling screams not persisted, that Mark would have slit [V.]\u2019s throat and then killed [L.] as well. We all would have died and Mark would never have been caught.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201cAlthough we were so fortunate to survive, we have all been profoundly damaged. I am still ill with permanent brain injury; [V.] still has seizures; and we all, including [L.], had suffered immense psychological harm. [L.] still does not sleep through the night. Both my children are terrified of people and their innocence has\u2014their innocence has been stripped from them. They will get better as will I with years of trauma therapy, but we will never get over what happened to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u201cMy children are young, with long lives ahead of them, but lives that will forever bear the scars of this horrendous damage inflicted upon our family.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cI am a psychiatric geriatric social worker. I have worked full-time since the death of my husband three and a half years ago struggling and succeeding to both work, support, nuture and raise my children. I don\u2019t know when or if I\u2019ll be well enough to return to work and if my chosen profession will ever again be possible for me, as a social worker with permanent short-term memory loss is a poor job candidate. My disability insurance will be depleted in about six weeks and my savings are gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u201cAlthough I have my life, I have my children, I have lost all else. Financial security, financial stability, a sense of identity through my work, my view of life, I\u2019ve lost most of my friends, I\u2019ve lost a sense of safety and peace of mind. Like my children, I too will get better. But the pain I endure and will continue to do for some time is too often unbearable.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>\u201cPlease, Your Honor, don\u2019t take a chance that this could happen again to someone else, that another child might be killed because the maximum sentence of incarceration for Mark was not imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u2018Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\">During a pretrial conference the prosecutor said \u201cthe doctor\u2019s ultimate conclusion based on his expert opinion is that the defendant had the requisite intent to fulfill these crimes . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Trial court exhibit 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Defense counsel\u2019s response was: \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In addition to Dr. Vicary\u2019s description of appellant\u2019s severe drug use, appellant\u2019s brother (Elias Rocha) testified to appellant\u2019s consumption of alcohol, cocaine, and heroin on the crime date and the preceding 10 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b488-13\">The instruction reads; \u201cThe defendant is accused of having committed the crime of_ [in Count_].
