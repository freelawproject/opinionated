J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">Petitioner, the Attorney General of the State of California, seeks a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its judgment entered August 2, 1996, insofar as it compels the Attorney General to revise the ballot title and ballot label for Proposition 209 consistent with the statements of respondent superior court made during the August 1,1996, hearing to \u201creflect that the chief purpose of the measure is to prohibit affirmative action programs by public entities that are inconsistent with the prohibition in the measure.\u201d To preserve our jurisdiction, on August 7, 1996, we issued an order staying respondent court\u2019s judgment and any proceedings thereon, pending further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">We conclude there is no legal or factual basis for respondent court\u2019s interference with the exercise of petitioner\u2019s statutory duties. We shall therefore order a peremptory writ of mandate to issue and continue our stay order pending finality of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In its judgment, respondent court granted in part and denied in part the mandate petition of real party in interest. That judgment is appealable. (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 79, p. 103, citing <em>Healdsburg Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>Healdsburg </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 444, 456 [129 Cal.Rptr. 216].) However, since printing of the ballot must commence on August 12, 1996, the Attorney General\u2019s remedy by appeal is inadequate. Accordingly, we shall consider the merits of the Attorney General\u2019s writ petition. (Cf. <em>Andal </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 358, 360-361 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Proposition 209, popularly known as the California Civil Rights Initiative, is an initiative constitutional amendment which will appear on the ballot at the November 1996 General Election. The pertinent operative provisions of Proposition 209 would amend article I of the California Constitution to add section 31 in part as follows: \u201cThe state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The Legislature has invested the Attorney General with the authority and obligation to provide a ballot title for initiative measures which \u201cshall express ... the purpose of the measure\u201d and \u201cshall give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure in such language that the ballot title shall neither be an argument, nor be likely to create prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\u201d (Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9051, 9052.) In addition, the Attorney General must provide a ballot label for the proposition, which \u201cshall be a condensed statement of the ballot title prepared by him . . . .\u201d (Elec. Code, \u00a7 13281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">As relevant to this proceeding, the Attorney General submitted the following for inclusion in the ballot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201cBallot Title and Summary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cProhibition Against Discrimination or Preferential Treatment by State and Other Public Entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">Initiative Constitutional Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cProhibits the state, local governments, districts, public universities, colleges, and schools, and other government instrumentalities from discriminating against or giving preferential treatment to any individual or group in public employment, public education, or public contracting on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cBallot Label</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">Prohibition Against Discrimination or Preferential Treatment by State and Other Public Entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Initiative Constitutional Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cGenerally prohibits discrimination or preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">On July 26, 1996, real parties in interest Fran Packard, president, League of Women Voters of California, and the No on 209 Campaign (hereafter opponents) petitioned respondent superior court for a writ of mandate. In that proceeding, the opponents asserted the ballot title and ballot label provided by the Attorney General are misleading in that they fail to describe the true purpose of Proposition 209 which the opponents argue is to prohibit affirmative action by state and local government. Concurring with that argument, respondent superior court entered judgment commanding the Attorney General to revise the ballot title and ballot label.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The Secretary of State shall prepare a ballot pamphlet (Elec. Code, \u00a79081) which shall contain several items with respect to each initiative measure on the ballot, including the official summary prepared by the Attorney General (Elec. Code, \u00a7 9086). Section 9092 of the Election Code provides in pertinent part: \u201cNot less than 20 days before he or she submits the copy for the ballot pamphlet to the State Printer, the Secretary of State shall make the copy available for public examination. Any voter may seek a writ of mandate requiring any copy to be amended or deleted from the ballot pamphlet. A peremptory writ of mandate shall issue only upon clear and convincing proof that the copy in question is false, misleading, or inconsistent with the requirements of this code or Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 88000) of Title 9 of the Government Code, and that issuance of the writ will not substantially interfere with the printing and distribution of the ballot pamphlet as required by law. . . .\u201d (See also Gov. Code, \u00a7 88006.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u201cThe title and summary inform the public of the general purpose of the [measure].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 74, 83 [223 Cal.Rptr. 465], citing <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 248, 252 [60 P.2d 457, 106 A.L.R. 549].) \u201c \u2018[T]he title and summary need not contain a complete catalogue or index of all of the measure\u2019s provisions and \u201cif reasonable minds may differ as to the sufficiency of the title, the title should be held sufficient.\u201d [Citation.] As a general rule, the title and summary prepared by the Attorney General are presumed accurate, and substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>compliance with the \u201cchief purpose and points\u201d provision is sufficient. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tinsley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 90, 108 [197 Cal.Rptr. 643], quoting <em>Amador Valley Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 243 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 187 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587].) Stated otherwise, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he title need not contain a summary or index of all of the measure\u2019s provisions. Within certain limits what is and what is not an important provision is a question of opinion. Within those limits the opinion of the attorney-general should be accepted by this court.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>(Brennan </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 87, 92 [177 Cal.Rptr. 677], quoting <em>Fox etc. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 136, 145 [222 P.2d 879].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Of course, \u201c[t]he Attorney General\u2019s statement must be true and impartial, and not argumentative or likely to create prejudice for or against the measure. [Citation.] The main purpose of these requirements is to avoid misleading the public with inaccurate information. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 243.) The ballot title and summary \u201cmust reasonably inform the voter of the character and real purpose of the proposed measure.\u201d <em>(Tinsley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 108, citing <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 468, 472 [35 P.2d 533].) Still, \u201c \u2018[o]nly in a clear case should a title ... [or summary] be held insufficient.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brennan </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d at pp. 92-93, quoting <em>Epperson </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 61, 66 [82 P.2d 445].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Here, the brevity of the operative language of Proposition 209 lends itself to the formulation of a title and summary of the initiative measure in its very own words. Those words bear repeating: \u201cThe state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d The Attorney General titles the measure: \u201cProhibition Against Discrimination or Preferential Treatment by State and Other Public Entities.\u201d The Attorney General summarizes the measure: \u201cProhibits the state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>local governments, districts, public universities, colleges, and schools, and other government instrumentalities from discriminating against or giving preferential treatment to any individual or group in public employment, public education, or public contracting on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. . . .\u201d In the ballot label, the Attorney General describes the measure: \u201cGenerally prohibits discrimination or preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Insofar as relevant here, the title, summary and label provided by the Attorney General are essentially verbatim recitations of the operative terms of the measure. The Attorney General has added nothing, omitted nothing and the words used are all subject to common understanding. The electorate can hardly be deceived by this essentially verbatim recital of the straightforward text of the measure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Nevertheless, the respondent court interjected itself into the ballot pamphlet preparation process, concluding the Attorney General \u201chas not fully stated the main purpose or chief point of the initiative, ... to effect changes or stop the affirmative action programs within the [Sjtate of California. . . .\u201d As one of the stated rationales for its ruling, the court relied upon its perception that \u201cthe proponents have not shown any embarrassment whatever for their intention to repeal affirmative action programs . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so stating, it appears respondent court considered statements allegedly made by supporters of Proposition 209 which were contained in exhibits to the opponents\u2019 writ petition. For example, an article in the San Francisco Examiner purports to quote University of California Regent Ward Connerly, a supporter of the initiative, that \u201cthe public\u2019s going to end affirmative action in November,\u201d presumably by approving Proposition 209. Another article in The Hotline purports to quote Governor Wilson, also a supporter of the initiative, concerning defeat of a legislative bill to eliminate race and gender as criteria in state hiring, contracting and university enrollment: \u201c[The bill\u2019s defeat] effectively blocks any further serious discussion in the Legislature of the value of affirmative action. ... It is increasingly apparent that the Democratic majority in the Legislature is unwilling to confront the issue of reverse discrimination arising from affirmative action programs. Fortunately the people of California will get that opportunity at the ballot box.\u201d The opponents also tendered the ballot argument submitted in favor of Proposition 209 signed by Governor Wilson and Regent Connerly. The argument refers to \u201caffirmative action\u201d twice, asserting that the preferences which Proposition 209 will eliminate \u201cmasquerade as affirmative action\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cReal \u2018affirmative action\u2019 originally meant no discrimination and sought to provide opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The court erred in relying on these extraneous materials. The mandate to the Attorney General is to state the purpose and effect of the measure, not to reiterate selectively fragments of public commentary and debate on the measure. In any event, \u201c[t]he term \u2018affirmative action\u2019 ... is rarely defined . . . so as to form a common base for intelligent discourse.\u201d <em>(Dawn </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 588, 593 [154 Cal.Rptr. 186] (conc, opn. of Paras, J.).) Most definitions of the term would include not only the conduct which Proposition 209 would ban, i.e., discrimination and preferential treatment, but also other efforts such as outreach programs. (See, e.g., Random House Dict. of the English Language (2d ed. 1987) p. 34, col. 1 [\u201cthe encouragement of increased representation of women and minority-group members, esp. in employment.\u201d]; American Heritage Dict. (New College ed. 1976) p. 22, col. 1 [\u201cAction taken to provide equal opportunity, as in hiring or admissions, for members of previously disadvantaged groups, such as women and minorities, often involving specific goals and timetables.]; Black\u2019s Law Dict. (5th ed. 1983), p. 29, col. 2 [\u201cEmployment programs required by federal statutes and regulations designed to remedy discriminatory practices in hiring minority group members; <em>i.e. </em>designed to eliminate existing and continuing discrimination, to remedy lingering effects of past discrimination, and to create systems and procedures to prevent future discrimination . . . .\u201d]; Garner, Dict. of Modern Legal Usage (2d ed. 1995), p. 36, col. 1 [\u201cThe phrase is sometimes used genetically to denote \u2018a positive step taken,\u2019 as well as more specifically to denote \u2018an attempt to reverse or mitigate past racial discrimination. . . .\u201d]; see also 59 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 87, 90-91 (1976).) Accordingly, any statement to the effect that Proposition 209 repeals affirmative action programs would be overinclusive and hence \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d (Elec. Code, \u00a7 9092.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We recognize respondent superior court accorded the Attorney General discretion, in complying with its judgment, to modify the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d by reference to \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d Although, as so qualified, the term would not be overinclusive, we fail to see why the term <em>must </em>be added to describe \u201cthe character and real purpose of the proposed measure.\u201d (See <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 108.) The Attorney General accurately and completely describes the measure as prohibiting, in public employment, education or contracting, discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Even if we assume that much, most or all of the impact of the prohibition will be borne by programs commonly associated with the term \u201caffirmative action,\u201d we cannot fault the Attorney General for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>refraining from the use of such an amorphous, value-laden term in the ballot title and ballot label.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">By essentially repeating the operative language of Proposition 209, the Attorney General has complied with the mandate that he provide the electorate with \u201ca true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure . . . .\u201d (Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9051, 9052.) Respondent superior court was not authorized to require more.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s petition prays for issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance. The opponents have been served and have filed opposition to the petition. The procedural requirements delineated in <em>Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893], having been satisfied, we are authorized to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its judgment entered August 2, 1996, insofar as the judgment compels the Attorney General to revise the ballot title and ballot label for Proposition 209 to \u201creflect that the chief purpose of the measure is to prohibit affirmative action programs by public entities that are inconsistent with the prohibition in the measure,\u201d This decision is final forthwith. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24(d).) The previously issued stay shall remain in effect pending finality of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Opponents contend there should be no deference accorded to the Attorney General because he co-authored the official Rebuttal to the Arguments Against 209. As an elected state constitutional officer, the Attorney General is not only entitled to an opinion on matters of public importance, he is entitled to state that opinion publicly. It is immaterial whether the Attorney General supports or opposes Proposition 209. (Cf. Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9002, 9003.) Rather, the issue is whether the title, summary and label submitted for the ballot \u201cgive a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure in such language that the ballot title shall neither be an argument, nor be likely to create prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\u201d (Elec. Code, \u00a7 9051.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The court did not explain why, as its statement implies, the proponents should be embarrassed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b219-8\">SIMS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">As the majority point out, the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cBallot Title and Summary\u201d and \u201cBallot Label\u201d track verbatim the substantive language of the initiative and therefore cannot be false or misleading. (Elec. Code, \u00a7 9092.) This is sufficient to decide the case. I do not reach the question whether the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d would be overinclusive or whether the term could be fairly used to describe the initiative had the Attorney General chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The petition of real parties in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 12, 1996.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
