(Leonard) claims he is entitled to the rights and services accorded a \u201cpresumed father.\u201d In an earlier appeal, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1650\">*1650</page-number>court ruled the trial court had erred by terminating Leonard\u2019s parental rights without first according him a hearing on his claim that he was Spencer\u2019s presumed father. <em>(In re Spencer W. </em>(Apr. 25, 1995) D022067 [nonpub. opn.]; hereafter <em>Leonard I.) </em>On remand, the trial court conducted a hearing and ruled that under the totality of the circumstances Leonard was not Spencer\u2019s presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Leonard claims the facts show he was a presumed father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From that predicate, he argues the department of social services (the Department) was obliged but failed to produce \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">1. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Because Leonard challenges the judgment on the basis it is not supported by adequate evidence, we review the facts most favorably to the judgment, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all conflicts in favor of the order. <em>(In re Misako R. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 538, 545 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 217].) We do not reweigh the evidence but instead examine the whole record to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found for the respondent. <em>(In re Angelia P. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 924 [171 Cal.Rptr. 637, 623 P.2d 198].)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Spencer was bom December 7, 1989. At that time, Leonard and Spencer\u2019s mother (mother) shared an apartment but were not married. Leonard was present at Spencer\u2019s birth. Although Leonard claimed to be Spencer\u2019s biological father, he admitted he was not living with mother at the time Spencer was conceived. He also admitted there was evidence the biological father could have been anyone because mother had been a prostitute prior to Spencer\u2019s conception. Leonard did not have his name placed on the birth certificate as Spencer\u2019s father when Spencer was bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Leonard shared an apartment with mother and Spencer from December 1989 through January 1992. Leonard was basically unemployed for this entire period, and he and mother lived on mother\u2019s aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1651\">*1651</page-number>During this two-year period, Leonard was equivocal in asserting his parental relationship to Spencer. Leonard testified he told his friends, relatives and neighbors that he was Spencer\u2019s father and that Spencer called him \u201cdaddy.\u201d Leonard also took Spencer on outings, provided child care and disciplined Spencer. However, Leonard never contacted AFDC officials to inform them of his relationship to Spencer. He never sought to have his name put on Spencer\u2019s birth certificate, and took no other legal action during this period to establish paternity. Indeed, when a social worker visited the apartment in July 1991 to investigate an incident involving Spencer\u2019s falling from a window, Leonard specifically told the social worker he was <em>not </em>Spencer\u2019s father. Leonard testified he denied paternity to that social worker to avoid reducing mother\u2019s AFDC income.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Mother was arrested for prostitution and jailed from November 1991 through mid-January 1992. Leonard stayed at the apartment, the rent for which came from mother\u2019s AFDC checks, and took care of Spencer and Spencer\u2019s sister during this time. Leonard collected mother\u2019s AFDC check and paid the rent from those funds. When mother was again incarcerated in February 1992 and the AFDC payments were stopped, Leonard separated from mother. He took Spencer and Spencer\u2019s sister to, and left them with, a friend of mother\u2019s. He returned the next day to the home of the mother\u2019s friend and was told the children had been taken to live at the home of the maternal grandmother. He testified he made an attempt to visit Spencer but was rebuffed by the maternal relatives. Leonard then decided to wait the 90 days until mother was released from jail to try again to visit Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">During the period the children were living with the grandparents, Leonard took no steps to assert paternity, and he provided them no monetary support. On May 9, 1992, mother was released from jail and Leonard helped her, Spencer and Spencer\u2019s sister move from the grandparents\u2019 house into a friend\u2019s home. He left them there and was arrested the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Leonard was incarcerated from May 10, 1992, until August 24, 1994. During July 1992 he telephoned the social worker handling Spencer\u2019s case and claimed to be the father, but the social worker gave him no information because mother claimed Leonard was not the father. Other than this occasion (and perhaps two similar phone calls) Leonard showed no interest in pursuing his parental rights during this two-year period. Although Leonard learned from a friend that the Department had intervened and Spencer had been made a dependent of the court, Leonard never asked the friend to contact the Department or the court, and he never asked the friend for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1652\">*1652</page-number>information about Spencer\u2019s whereabouts or circumstances. He never called the court and never had any contact or correspondence with Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Prior to these proceedings, Leonard never sought custody of Spencer. He never paid any child support. Indeed, in August 1995 when the trial court ordered Leonard to participate in a paternity blood test, he failed to cooperate with the Department\u2019s efforts to arrange for the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">2. <em>Leonard Had the Burden of Establishing He Was Entitled to Presumed Father Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">California law provides that a man is presumed to be the father of a child if he \u201creceives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u201d (Fam. Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 7611, subd. (d).)  As explained in <em>Adoption of Michael H. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1043 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 898 P.2d 891]: \u201cAn unwed father\u2019s rights and duties . . . substantially depend on whether he is a \u2018presumed father\u2019 within the meaning of section 7611. <em>([Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992)] 1 Cal.4th 816, 823 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] [\u2018Whether a biological father is a \u201cpresumed father\u201d ... is critical to his parental rights [in adoption proceedings.\u2019]; see also <em>In re Zacharia D. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 435, 448-449 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 862 P.2d 751] [only \u2018presumed fathers\u2019 are entitled to custody and reunification services].) Under section 7611, a man who has neither legally married nor attempted to legally marry the mother of his child cannot become a presumed father unless he <em>both </em>\u2018receives the child into his home <em>and </em>openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u2019 (\u00a7 7611, subd. (d), italics added.) . . . Therefore, to become a presumed father, a man who has neither married nor attempted to marry his child\u2019s biological mother must not only openly and publicly admit paternity, but must also physically bring the child into his home.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1050-1051, some italics original, some italics deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Leonard argues that because he lived with mother and Spencer for two years and told some people he was Spencer\u2019s father, the presumption set forth in section 7611, subdivision (d) arose, and under section 7612, subdivision (a) the burden of rebutting the presumption by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence was shifted to the Department. However, Leonard\u2019s argument regarding the burden of proof rests on an erroneous assumption that as a matter of law he was entitled to the benefit of the presumption. For the rebuttable presumption to arise, Leonard had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that there were present two elements necessary to invoke the presumption: reception into the father\u2019s home and openly and publicly acknowledging paternity. <em>(Xebec Development Partners, Ltd. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1653\">*1653</page-number><em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 501, 544-546 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 726] [to obtain benefit of presumption, proponent of presumption bears burden of establishing foundational facts by preponderance of evidence].)  As the court explained in <em>United Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Reeder Dev. Corp. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 282 [129 Cal.Rptr. 113]: \u201cThe proponent of the presumption has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the foundational facts of the presumption. As in the case of all presumptions, the opponent may introduce evidence tending to establish the nonexistence of the foundational facts, or the presumed fact, or both. HD [When] the opponent of the presumption offer[s] evidence that [the foundational facts are not present], the attack is <em>not </em>upon the existence of the presumed fact, but upon the existence of the foundational facts of the presumption. Hence, the trier of fact in this situation is required to determine only whether the proponent of the presumption has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of the foundational facts. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300, italics original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Thus, the burden of proof rested on Leonard to show that he received the child into his home and that he openly and publicly acknowledged paternity. It was for the trier of fact to determine whether the foundational facts were established by a preponderance of evidence. <em>(Xebec Development Partners, Ltd. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">3. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Rejection of Leonard\u2019s Claim to Presumed Father Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The trial court rejected Leonard\u2019s claim to presumed father status. It reasoned that the totality of the circumstances failed to show Leonard demonstrated a consistent commitment to assume the burdens of parenthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The evidence here would permit a trier of fact to conclude that neither foundational element necessary to presumed father status was present. First, Leonard was required to receive Spencer into his home. The evidence permitted the conclusion that Leonard did not receive the child into <em>his </em>home, but instead that mother permitted Leonard to reside in <em>her </em>home, and that Leonard\u2019s residence with Spencer was not demonstrative of Leonard\u2019s commitment to the child but reflected that Leonard acted out of personal convenience and self-interest. This conclusion is amply supported by these facts: (1) mother paid for the apartment (and apparently most other expenses); (2) she supported an unemployed Leonard; and (3) when mother\u2019s funding ceased Leonard stopped residing with Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Second, a trier of fact could conclude Leonard\u2019s actions, as a whole, were not sufficient to satisfy the requirement that Leonard <em>\u201copenly and publicly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1654\">*1654</page-number>admit paternity.\u201d <em>(Adoption of Michael H. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1043, 1051 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 898 P.2d 891].) The evidence showed Leonard claimed paternity to his friends and family but was unwilling to proclaim paternity when there might have been some cost to him (i.e., reduced AFDC payments). Leonard also failed to take formal steps to place his name on the birth certificate, to establish paternity by legal action, or to assume the financial obligations for child support. Leonard took no steps to assert his parental rights when the maternal grandparents denied Leonard access to Spencer. (Cf. <em>Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 849 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] [unwed biological father to obtain presumed father status must promptly attempt to assume full parental responsibilities, and particularly show \u201c \u2018a willingness himself to assume full custody of the child\u2014not merely to block the adoption by others.\u2019 \u201d].) Finally, except for a few phone calls Leonard made to a social worker, his years in prison were marked by an indifference toward establishing or maintaining a parental relationship with Spencer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Leonard quotes <em>People </em>v. <em>Vega </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 706, 710 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 479] as holding that to attain presumed father status he need only show \u201csome familial relationship.\u201d We do not believe that \u201csome\u201d familial relationship suffices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We perceive the holding in <em>In re Sarah C. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 964 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 414] to reflect more accurately what is required to establish presumed father status. There the claimant had told some people he was the father; however, he took no steps to have his name put on the child\u2019s birth certificate; he never took formal steps to identify her to governmental agencies as his daughter; he lived with her and her mother only because he needed a place to stay; he provided her little economic support; and he made negligible efforts while imprisoned to contact her or establish a relationship with her. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 972-973, 977.) In <em>Sarah C. </em>the court reasoned that presumed father status is earned based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1655\">*1655</page-number>commitment toward developing a \u201csubstantial familial relationship to the child,\u201d and that the trial court had ample basis for denying presumed father status even to the biological father on the facts of the case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 974-975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The reasoning of <em>Sarah C. </em>applies here. The trial court had ample basis on which to conclude Leonard failed to show by a preponderance of evidence the existence of either foundational element required for presumed father status. Therefore, it was unnecessary for the Department to rebut the presumption. The trial court correctly declined to confer \u201cpresumed father status\u201d on Leonard.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Benke, Acting P. J., and Huffman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 23, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Leonard also appears to argue, by implication from quotations from <em>Leonard. I, </em>that this court held he was entitled to presumed father status. However, because this court expressly stated it did not decide that issue <em>(Leonard I, supra, </em>D022067), there is no \u201claw of the case\u201d principle applicable to this issue. <em>(Estate of Baird </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 225, 239 [223 P. 974].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Leonard claimed he earned money from \u201codd jobs.\u201d He also claimed he held a cashier\u2019s job for a four-month period in 1991, although the credibility of this claim was questionable because he had originally denied having any jobs after December 1989. After being cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1651\">*1651</page-number>examined about not providing financial support to Spencer, he suddenly remembered having a cashier\u2019s job.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">All further references are to the Family Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Leonard argues the trial court improperly relied on his inactivity while incarcerated to find he had \u201cabandoned\u201d Spencer, because a presumed father will be deemed to have abandoned the child and to have forfeited rights only if his failure to communicate is willful <em>(Adoption of Christopher S. </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 433, 436 [242 Cal.Rptr. 866]), and here the failure to communicate was not \u201cwillful\u201d because he was refused information by the social worker. Leonard misconstrues the trial court\u2019s reasoning. The trial court examined his inaction not as a basis to forfeit rights but rather to evaluate whether he had shown the level of diligent commitment required to attain rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We note the <em>Vega </em>court\u2019s reference to \u201csome\u201d familial relationship is not controlling because the court was concerned with an entirely different issue (i.e., when a defendant can be held liable under a criminal statute for corporal injury to spouse), and had no occasion to evaluate the level of familial contact necessary for presumed father status. (33 Cal.App.4th at pp. 709-711.) Moreover, to the extent <em>Vega </em>could be read for the proposition that any familial relationship (however sporadic or equivocal) is sufficient, <em>Vega </em>would be inconsistent with <em>Adoption of Michael H., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 1043 and <em>Adoption of Kelsey S., supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th 816.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
