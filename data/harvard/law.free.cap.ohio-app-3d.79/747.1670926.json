Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered on April 26, 1991 by the Washington County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, on motions filed by Doris Ann Postell, appellant herein and daughter of the decedent, against Executor Merrill H. Clapsaddle, appellee herein and son of the decedent. Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">First Assignment of Error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-15\">\u201cThe order is contrary to the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">Second Assignment of Error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-17\">\u201cAbuse of descretion [sic] by trial judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">Sarah Clapsaddle died testate on May 10, 1990 at the age of 81. Prior to her death, she was unable to manage her affairs. On January 26, 1989, the court appointed her son, appellee, to serve as her guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-19\">During his tenure as guardian, appellee changed his mother\u2019s five certificates of deposit from a Florida bank to an Ohio bank. The crux of this appeal involves the fact that when appellee deposited the money in Ohio, he listed four of the new certificates of deposit as payable on death equally to appellant and her two children, and he listed the fifth new certificate of deposit as payable on death to himself. When the certificates of deposit were deposited at a Florida bank, some of the certificates were listed in the decedent\u2019s name alone and other certificates were listed in the decedent\u2019s name and payable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>death to her spouse, Herbert Clapsaddle. Appellee explained he listed the certificates of deposit in this manner to insure that upon his mother\u2019s death, the money would pass in the same amounts and to the same people as specified in his mother\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On November 20, 1990, the court admitted the decedent\u2019s April 3, 1986 will to probate and appointed appellee as executor. On January 31, 1991, appellee filed an inventory and appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On February 25, 1991, appellant filed three motions. In the first motion, appellant alleged the inventory incorrectly listed $1,877.01 rather than $2,082.62 as the amount in a certain checking account, and alleged \u201cother negligent or intentional acts or omissions with respect to said inventory.\u201d In the second motion, appellant alleged appellee is unsuitable to serve as executor. In the third motion, appellant requested the court to suspend all further action in the estate. On March 8, 1991, the court ruled on the third motion and ordered appellee to refrain from selling the personal property in the estate until April 5, 1991, the date set for hearing the first two motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The court heard the first two motions as scheduled on April 5, 1991. Although appellant did not mention the certificates of deposits in either motion, the hearing focused on the fact that when appellee brought his mother\u2019s money to Ohio, he listed the certificates of deposit as payable on death. Appellee listed four of the certificates of deposit payable on death to appellant and to her children. Appellee listed one certificate of deposit payable on death to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Appellant\u2019s attorney raised two main arguments during the course of the hearing. First, he argued that because appellee improperly listed the five certificates of deposit as payable on death, appellee must be ordered to reimburse the estate for the proceeds from the certificates. Second, appellant\u2019s attorney argued that because appellant did nothing wrong, she should be able to keep the proceeds from the four certificates of deposit appellee improperly made payable on death to her and her children. Appellant\u2019s attorney rejected the notion that his client should reimburse the estate for the money she should not have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">During the hearing, the following exchange occurred among appellant\u2019s attorney, Mr. Phillips, appellee\u2019s attorneys, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis, and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">\u201cMR. ELLIS: Is it true that your client got the majority of that money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: I think that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-12\"><em>&lt;{ </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-13\">\u201cMR. ELLIS: What you\u2019re asking is, what you\u2019re telling the court is that these certificates are supposed to be an [sic] estate assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: If the court determines whether they\u2019re estate assets you\u2019ll give them back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: I don\u2019t have control of those assets at this time Mr. Ellis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your client is a party to these proceedings, he\u2019s a party to these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you two people agree that those were estate assets then I will order each of you to return the money right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: Well we don\u2019t have all of the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You better have because you\u2019re the one, she\u2019s the one who has to pay it back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">\u201cMR. PHILLIPS: Well she isn\u2019t the one who set up this fraudulence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: It makes no difference who set it up, she has taken the money and has been unjustly enriched if in fact what you say is true. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">On April 26, 1991, the court found, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) appellee did not intend to defraud the estate when he listed the certificates of deposit as payable on death, (2) appellee listed the certificates of deposit in accordance with the terms of the decedent\u2019s will, (3) the effect of the payable on death listings was to keep the certificates out of the estate, and (4) the certificates of deposit are properly part of the estate. The court ordered appellant and appellee, the people who received proceeds from the certificates of deposit, to return the proceeds to the estate. Appellant filed a notice of appeal on May 21, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">On July 17, 1991, appellant filed a brief bearing both the number of this case and the number of our appellate case No. 91-CA-13, involving the guardianship of the decedent. Appellee filed a similar brief in response on September 5, 1991. On September 10, 1991, we consolidated the two cases for purposes of oral argument only, and we directed the parties to file five additional copies of their briefs to ensure that a complete set of briefs appears in each appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">On September 17, 1991, appellant filed a reply brief bearing both case numbers and containing many attachments which were not part of the record transmitted on appeal. On September 24, 1991, appellee moved to strike the attachments and portions of the brief unsupported by the record transmitted on appeal. We denied the motion at that time, but wrote that we would consider the relevance of the attachments and the unsupported portions of appellant\u2019s reply brief when we considered the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>At this juncture, we grant appellee\u2019s motion to strike the attachments and the unsupported portions of appellant\u2019s reply brief. We note appellant does not dispute appellee\u2019s assertion that the attachments are not part of the record transmitted on appeal. App.R. 9(A) limits our consideration to \u201coriginal papers and exhibits thereto <em>filed </em>in the trial court * * (Emphasis added.) App.R. 9(B) places an affirmative duty upon appellants to ensure that all documents and other evidence necessary for appellate review are included in the record transmitted on appeal. Where portions of the trial court record are omitted from the record transmitted on appeal, the appellate court has no choice but to presume the validity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings and affirm. <em>Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 197, 15 O.O.3d 218, 400 N.E.2d 384; <em>Baker v. Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga Cty. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 59, 572 N.E.2d 155; <em>Volodkevich v. Volodkevich </em>(1989), 48 Ohio App.3d 313, 549 N.E.2d 1237; <em>State v. McLaughlin </em>(1988), 55 Ohio App.3d 141, 562 N.E.2d 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We further find the April 26,1991 judgment in the case <em>subjudice </em>is a final appealable order. Final appealable orders affect a substantial right and either \u201cdetermine the action and prevent a judgment\u201d or were \u201cmade in a special proceeding.\u201d See R.C. 2505.02. In <em>Sheets v. Antes </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 278, 14 OBR 307, 470 N.E.2d 931, the court held that orders sustaining exceptions to inventories affect a substantial right and were made in a special proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In her first assignment of error, appellant asserts the court\u2019s judgment is contrary to R.C. 2109.50, 2109.52, and 2109.53. Appellant argues those statutes require the court to find appellee \u201cguilty,\u201d and require the court to enter judgment against appellee for the amount of all five certificates of deposit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>R.C. 2109.52 grants the accused the right to a jury upon request. The trier of fact must determine whether the accused is guilty. If the accused is found guilty, the court must render judgment against the accused for the amount of money involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">R.C. 2109.50 <em>et seq. </em>creates a special proceeding which enables interested parties to recover concealed, embezzled, and conveyed assets of an estate. <em>In re Estate of Coleman </em>(1988), 55 Ohio App.3d 261, 264, 564 N.E.2d 116, 118. The proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature. <em>Ukrainiec v. Batz </em>(1982), 24 Ohio App.3d 200, 24 OBR 323, 493 N.E.2d 1368; <em>In re Estate of Howard, </em>(1947), 79 Ohio App. 203, 34 O.O. 537, 72 N.E.2d 502. The specific procedural requirements of R.C. 2109.50 must be followed to effect a recovery. <em>In re Estate of Meyer </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 454, 579 N.E.2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant asserts the court erred by failing to find appellee guilty of concealing assets of the estate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">First, we note appellant failed to follow the procedural requirements set forth in R.C. 2109.50 <em>et seq. </em>Appellant did not file a R.C. 2109.50 complaint; appellant merely filed three motions in an existing probate action. Moreover, none of the motions mentioned the certificates of deposit. Proof of an allegation in a R.C. 2109.50 complaint is a necessary prerequisite to rendering a money judgment under R.C. 2109.53. <em>In re Estate of Howard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Second, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the proceeding below was a R.C. 2109.50 proceeding and that this issue is properly before us, we find no error with the trial court\u2019s refusal to find appellee guilty. When reviewing evidence presented at trial, an appellate court must not re-weigh the evidence. In <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 262, 376 N.E.2d 578, 579, the Ohio Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">\u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d See, also, <em>Vogel v. Wells </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 91, 566 N.E.2d 154; <em>Ross v. Ross </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 203, 18 O.O.3d 414, 414 N.E.2d 426; <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 24 O.O.3d 150, 434 N.E.2d 1356; <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">An appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court when there exists competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. <em>In re Stackhouse </em>(Mar. 11, 1991), Athens App. No. 1456, unreported, 1991 WL 37940. In <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 410, 461 N.E.2d 1273, 1276, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201cThe underlying rationale of giving deference to the findings of the trial court rests with the knowledge that the trial judge is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">In <em>In re Estate of Meyer, supra, </em>and in <em>Ukrainiec, supra, </em>the court held that mere possession of an estate asset does not constitute concealment. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find the record contains sufficient competent, credible evidence to support a finding that appellant lacked the intent necessary for a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">In her second assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court abused its discretion by allowing appellee to continue as executor. Appellant argues appellee is a \u201cliar,\u201d and liars should not be permitted to be executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">To support her argument appellant relies upon a July 24, 1990 transcript of a trial court hearing in our case No. 91 CA 13. Appellant contends that the transcript demonstrates appellee committed perjury during the April 5, 1991 hearing in the instant case. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>App.R. 9(A) limits our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>consideration to \u201coriginal papers and exhibits thereto <em>filed </em>in the trial court * * We may not consider the July 24, 1990 transcript from case No. 91 CA 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">R.C. 2109.53 provides that if a judgment is rendered against a fiduciary under R.C. 2109.52, the fiduciary shall be removed by the probate court. Thus, R.C. 2109.53 creates a mandatory duty on a trial court that once a fiduciary is found guilty of embezzlement or concealment pursuant to R.C. 2109.52, the fiduciary must be removed forthwith. See <em>Schultz v. Franklin </em>(Feb. 15, 1985), Lucas App. No. L-84-379, unreported, 1985 WL 8396.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we again note appellant failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in R.C. 2109.50 <em>et seq. </em>Further, the record contains sufficient competent, credible evidence to support a finding that appellee lacked the intent necessary for a finding of guilt. See R.C. 2109.52. Therefore, because a judgment against the fiduciary under R.C. 2109.52 is not appropriate in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant is precluded from asserting that R.C. 2109.53 requires that the fiduciary be removed by the probate court. A judgment under R.C. 2109.52 is a necessary prerequisite to invoking the remedies set forth in R.C. 2109.53. See R.C. 2109.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We further note that R.C. 2109.24 addresses the removal of a fiduciary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Removal under that provision is an issue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>In re Estate of Jarvis </em>(1980), 67 Ohio App.2d 94, 21 O.O.3d 411, 425 N.E.2d 939. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment which denies a request for the removal of an executor, an appellate court\u2019s inquiry shall focus on whether the trial court abused its discretion. Absent a showing that there is a clear abuse of that discretion, an appellate court will not reverse the decision of the probate court on a motion for the removal of an executor. <em>Jarvis, supra; In re Estate of Bost </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 147, 10 OBR 199, 460 N.E.2d 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. See <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 566 N.E.2d 1181; <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140; <em>Worthington v. Worthington </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 73, 76, 21 OBR 371, 373, 488 N.E.2d 150, 153; <em>Sandusky Properties v. Aveni </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 15 OBR 408, 409, 473 N.E.2d 798, 800; <em>Klever v. Reid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>Bros. Express, Inc. </em>(1951), 154 Ohio St. 491, 43 O.O. 429, 96 N.E.2d 781, paragraph two of the syllabus. When applying the abuse of discretion standard, a reviewing court is not free to merely substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1, supra; Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>after a review of the record submitted for our consideration, we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s judgment to deny appellant\u2019s motion to remove appellee from his position as executor. Although appellee made some mistakes, we agree with the trial court that no evidence exists in the record which would require appellee\u2019s removal from his position as executor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b789-8\">Grey and Harsha, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">.
