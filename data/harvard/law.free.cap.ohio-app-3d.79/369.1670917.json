Appellant asserts four assignments of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\u201cI. The Trial Court erred in granting the Motion of the Defendant Harding Hospital for Summary Judgment, finding that Defendant Harding Hospital owed Plaintiff no duty in the interpretation of his health insurance coverage under a group health policy issued by Defendant Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u201cII. The Trial Court erred in granting the Motion of Harding Hospital for Summary Judgment, finding that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case on its claims for estoppel against Defendant Harding Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">\u201cIII. The Trial Court erred in granting the Motion of Defendant Harding Hospital for Summary Judgment on its Counterclaim for payment of all hospital and physician charges incurred for the treatment of Plaintiff\u2019s daughter, Jane Doe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">\u201cIV. The Trial Court erred in denying the Motion of Plaintiff for Partial Summary Judgment against Defendant Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio seeking a declaration as to the meaning of certain terms utilized by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio in its health insurance contract under which Plaintiff was insured.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Upon a motion for summary judgment, Civ.R. 56 requires that the trial court examine the evidence, drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and determine whether: (1) the moving party has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of any material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law; and (3) whether reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion is made, after having construed the evidence most strongly in his favor. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Due to the complicated nature of this case, we will state the facts before proceeding to a specific analysis of each of the remaining assignments. of error. This case involves a dispute over insurance coverage for medical expenses incurred by appellant\u2019s minor daughter, Jane Doe, during her inpatient mental health treatment at Harding Hospital, a private psychiatric hospital in Worthington, Ohio. Blue Cross administered the group health insurance policy provided by appellant\u2019s employer. The portions of the policy, which are primarily the subject of appellant\u2019s appeal of his claim against Blue Cross, but which are relevant to his case against Harding, basically provide insureds with one hundred percent hospitalization coverage, including room and board, after application of the deductible and co-pay provisions. Another portion of the policy, however, limits \u201cinpatient mental health\u201d care to thirty-one days per year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Appellant\u2019s evidence established that he and his wife, Mary Doe, admitted their teenage daughter, Jane Doe, to Harding Hospital\u2019s Emergency Services Unit on the evening of September 14, 1988, following her attempted suicide. Upon Jane\u2019s admission to Harding Hospital\u2019s Emergency Services Unit, Jane and John Doe signed an admission form which contained an assignment of insurance benefits and the following financial responsibility statement: \u201cThe undersigned assumes responsibility for payment of all hospital and physician charges incurred on behalf of the above-named patient * * There is no other admission form contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Mary Doe\u2019s deposition testimony was that Jane\u2019s first consultation at Harding Hospital was with a clinical social worker who advised the Does that a psychiatric evaluation, as well as a determination by the secretary on duty of the extent of Jane\u2019s insurance . coverage, was necessary to ascertain whether Jane required an overnight stay in the emergency unit. There is no testimony that Harding asked for or that the Does offered a copy of their insurance policy upon Jane\u2019s initial admission to the emergency unit on September 14, 1988. Ultimately, a psychiatrist advised Mrs. Doe to admit Jane to Harding\u2019s South Berkley Facility for a more complete short-term evaluation. The purpose of Jane\u2019s short-term inpatient care was to complete a diagnosis and develop a comprehensive long-term treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The next day the Does were informed by Harding\u2019s clinical social worker in its emergency services, Susan Shwed, that Jane\u2019s inpatient emergency care at the South Berkley Facility was covered by Mr. Doe\u2019s employee benefit plan with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio. Shwed claimed that she obtained appellant\u2019s insurance information from a form letter prepared by another Harding employee, Janet Porter, which recited in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cDear Mr. Doe,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cThis is to confirm your insurance coverage as it was interpreted to us by Miss Thurman at Blue Cross and Blue Shield N.E. OH carried by yourself through * * * Co. Inc. According to them, coverage is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">\u201cComprehensive Policy $100 deductible per cal yr/person; 80% usual &amp; cus- . for Hospital and Profes- tomary rates until $500 out of pocket, then 100% usual sional: &amp; customary rates <em>2lh </em>million life maximum for psych which is considered same as any other illness under the comprehensive plan per Miss Thurman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO\">\u201cPlease keep in mind that this was only a verbal confirmation with the insurance company, not a guarantee of payment. We cannot be held liable if the insurance company rules contrary to this coverage at a later date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201cBased on the above coverage, present rates at the hospital, and depending on prior claims submitted for treatment, your liability, after insurance is likely to be: $600 for deductible and co-insurance plus any charges over the usual &amp; customary rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">\u201cWe must expect your portion upon receipt of your monthly statement, and if your insurance company does not respond within 45 days, we will expect payment in full from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">\u201cYour balance is due on receipt after the insurance company has made its final payment. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">\u201cBy my signature I agree to be financially responsible for treatment for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">\u201cJane Doe * * V\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Appellant signed this letter on September 15, 1988, and a time stamp reveals that it was received by Harding\u2019s Admission Office on October 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">Blue Cross telephone records, however, indicate a very different account of the telephone conversation between its employee, Ms. Thurman, and Harding Hospital on September 15, 1988. Thurman testified about the procedure followed by Blue Cross phone operators when medical providers routinely called to verify a patient\u2019s insurance coverage prior to hospital admission or emergency treatment. The procedure requires phone operators to record in writing the substance of the information requested of and given by Blue Cross as a result of every provider inquiry call. Thurman testified from her telephone records of September 15, 1988, that she recorded the call from Harding which inquired about the extent of medical coverage available to Jane Doe for inpatient care at a psychiatric hospital. The phone record, which was admitted into evidence, recites that Thurman told Harding representatives that Jane was covered \u201cthirty-one days at 80% for inpatient medical psych.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Mrs. Doe testified that, by the fourth day after Jane\u2019s arrival at Harding, Shwed twice met with the Does for therapy. At the first meeting, Shwed allegedly requested that the Does deliver a copy of the policy to her so that Harding\u2019s patient accounts manager, Anna Pfeiffer, could determine whether Jane\u2019s insurance benefits qualified her for admission to long-term care at Harding. Mrs. Doe testified that her husband delivered a copy of the policy to Harding for that purpose, and that Harding\u2019s offer to determine the Does\u2019 insurance coverage was consistent with its radio advertisements. At their second meeting with Shwed, Shwed allegedly told the Does that Anna Pfeiffer had determined that their insurance policy provided up to 2.5 million dollars for Jane\u2019s hospitalization. The Does testified that Harding\u2019s guarantee specifically induced them to allow Harding to begin the procedure for Jane\u2019s admission to Harding\u2019s long-term care facility known as \u201cStratford East.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Harding denies ever having asked for the policy as a condition of Jane\u2019s admission. Nevertheless, the testimonial accounts of the Does\u2019 clearly indicate that they, as well as Harding, conditioned Jane\u2019s admission to long-term care, initially estimated to cost $15,000 per month for at least six months, on the availability of adequate insurance coverage, and that Harding promised to find out if Jane had adequate insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Jane remained in Harding\u2019s South Berkley Facility for approximately thirty days until Harding fully developed a long-term treatment plan and until a bed was available at Stratford East. Blue Cross paid Harding for its inpatient emergency care of Jane, and it is undisputed that Mr. Doe\u2019s policy provided for payment of Jane\u2019s first thirty-one days of inpatient health care at Harding Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Jane\u2019s long-term treatment plan was executed by a team of Harding professionals who conducted weekly group evaluations of Jane\u2019s case. Jane\u2019s treatment plan required Mr. and Mrs. Doe to attend weekly family therapy sessions conducted by Harding\u2019s family therapist, Mary Griffith. The sessions began in mid-October 1988 and continued throughout Jane\u2019s eleven-month stay at Stratford East. Mrs. Doe testified that the subject of the extent of Jane\u2019s insurance coverage was frequently discussed as part of Griffith\u2019s routine update of Jane\u2019s weekly evaluation, and that Griffith assured them repeatedly that Jane\u2019s doctor was in constant communication with Blue Cross regarding payment for her treatment. The Does claim that they often confirmed through Griffith that Harding regularly received payment from Blue Cross. Pfeiffer acknowledged that there was no delinquency in appellant\u2019s account through April 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">On October 12, 1988, Mr. Doe personally visited Anna Pfeiffer for the purpose of obtaining a written confirmation of his insurance benefits. Pfeif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>fer correctly explained to Mr. Doe that it was not the business practice of most insurance companies, including Blue Cross, to issue written confirmations of a patient\u2019s coverage to medical providers. Thus, Pfeiffer offered to obtain another oral confirmation of Jane\u2019s benefits from Blue Cross. Pfeiffer testified according to her business records which indicate that she called Blue Cross on October 12, 1988. Pfeiffer admitted that she specifically asked Ms. Thurman if the 2.5 million dollar figure given Harding by her on September 15, 1988 was correct, and that Ms. Thurman responded to her that it was. There is conflicting testimony whether Pfeiffer had the policy in front of her during this conversation with Mr. Doe and Ms. Thurman. Blue Cross\u2019 records, as discussed in Ms. Thurman\u2019s deposition, again directly contradict Pfeiffer\u2019s testimony because they indicate a complete absence of provider inquiry calls to Thurman on October 12, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In short, the Does testified that, consistent with Harding\u2019s radio advertisements, they were continually reassured by Harding officials that Jane\u2019s treatment was paid entirely by Blue Cross and that they had nothing to worry about except the health of their child. Thus, they perceived no immediate need to ignore Harding\u2019s assurances and to call Blue Cross themselves to determine the coverage available.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">According to Mrs. Doe, Mary Griffith was the first to mention, in May 1989, the nonpayment of Jane\u2019s hospital and professional services costs by Blue Cross since February 1989. Nevertheless, letters between appellant\u2019s attorney and Blue Cross, which were authenticated by affidavit, clearly proved that appellant was actually aware, as of January 31, 1989, despite the fact that Blue Cross was still paying Harding for Jane\u2019s care, that a discrepancy in the separate policy provisions regarding major medical hospitalization, versus inpatient mental health care, existed. Moreover, Harding\u2019s hospital biller noted the thirty-orie-day limit on Jane\u2019s file on January 1, 1989, but Pfeiffer crossed it out and wrote \u201cincorrect\u201d next to the notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Furthermore, the letter from Blue Cross to appellant\u2019s counsel, dated February 22, 1989, assured appellant that Blue Cross considered its liability for Jane\u2019s inpatient mental health care at Harding to be limited to thirty-one-days per year. Finally, on March 24, 1989, Blue Cross informed appellant\u2019s attorney that it would discontinue payments to Harding and seek a reimbursement of all payments it made in excess of the thirty-one-day per year limitation. Consequently, Harding billed appellant directly for all past and future services received by Jane in excess of the thirty-one-day per year limit in the Does\u2019 policy pursuant to the financial responsibility statement signed by John Doe on September 15, 1988. Appellant instigated this lawsuit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Harding and Blue Cross to avoid individual liability for Jane\u2019s unpaid medical costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">From the inception of this litigation, estoppel has been the primary theory advanced by appellant in support of his complaint against Harding. Thus, we will first discuss appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, which squarely presents the issue whether the trial court correctly applied the principles of estoppel in this case to grant summary judgment for Harding.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s claim that Harding was estopped by its alleged misrepresentations of the extent of Jane\u2019s insurance benefits from assessing appellant the total cost of Jane\u2019s past and future medical expenses. The court relied on the case of <em>Pedler v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 7, 23 OBR 6, 490 N.E.2d 605, which conditions application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel against an insurance company on the insured\u2019s ignorance of the true extent of his benefits and on the absence of any convenient available means of his ascertaining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>Pedler, supra, </em>the insured\u2019s employer provided him $50,000 life insurance coverage. The insured received an insurance booklet explaining his insurance coverage and a plan summary which outlined various options available under the insurance policy. One of the options outlined in the plan summary and contained in the master life insurance contract allowed employees with two years of service to purchase additional supplemental coverage at their own expense. Both the plan summaries and master contract clearly stated that an employee was eligible for supplemental coverage only if the employee had completed two full years of employment. Nevertheless, the insured purchased supplemental coverage, evidenced by a certificate of insurance, after only two months of employment. The insured died within his first year of employment. The insurance company denied the beneficiary\u2019s claim for supplemental benefits due to the insured\u2019s ineligibility for coverage. The beneficiary sued the insurance company for those benefits on the theory of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the beneficiary\u2019s claim and held that an insurer is estopped from denying the full val\u00fae of coverage stated on the insurance certificate, based upon limitations or exclusions contained in the master policy, where the insured bargained and paid for such coverage, unless the insured knew or should have known of his ineligibility. Moreover, the court conditioned the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel on the absence of any convenient available means from which the claimant could acquire the true extent of coverage if he lacked personal knowledge of it. In <em>Pedler, </em>the court considered the insurance booklet, plan summary, and the certificate of insurance alternative means by which the insured could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>obtained knowledge of the limitation on the availability of supplemental coverage. Thus, the court concluded that the failure of the insured to specifically note the limitation was not sufficient to estop the denial of coverage by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the instant case, the trial court decided, as a matter of law, that appellant could not recover on an equitable estoppel theory due to his failure to prove good faith reliance on Harding\u2019s alleged misstatements. Specifically, the court found that appellant had actual knowledge of Jane\u2019s limited coverage under the policy due to his status as a small business owner, as well as his wife\u2019s experience as a clinical social worker. Moreover, the court found that the policy itself was an available alternative means from which appellant had constructive notice that his daughter\u2019s insurance coverage for inpatient mental health care is limited to thirty-one days per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We disagree with the trial court that <em>Pedler, supra, </em>is determinative of this case. First, the focus of this appeal is appellant\u2019s estoppel claim against the medical provider, not the insurance company. The dispute at this level is limited to whether appellant created material questions of fact that his reliance on Harding\u2019s representations were reasonable and in good faith. The trial court concluded that appellant could not prove any justifiable reliance on Harding\u2019s statements because his insurance contract clearly limited Jane\u2019s coverage for all costs associated with her inpatient care at Harding to thirty-one days per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">A prima facie case for equitable estoppel requires a plaintiff to prove four elements: (1) that the defendant made a factual misrepresentation; (2) that it is misleading; (3) induces actual reliance which is reasonable and in good faith; and (4) which causes detriment to the relying party. <em>First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Perry\u2019s Landing, Inc. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 135, at 145, 11 OBR 215, at 227, 463 N.E.2d 636, at 648. In assessing these four elements in the context of a particular case, relevant factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201c * * * [ (a) ] the nature of the representation; (b) whether the representation was in fact misleading; (c) the relative knowledge and experience of the parties; (d) whether the representation was made with the intent that it be relied upon; and (e) the reasonableness and good faith of the reliance, given all the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">To determine whether appellant\u2019s reliance on Harding\u2019s alleged or possible misrepresentations was unreasonable as a matter of law under his set of facts, we must initially ascertain which misrepresentations he claims- to have relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In his first amended complaint, appellant alleged his reliance was on Harding\u2019s representations to him that Blue Cross told it that the 2.5 million dollar lifetime limit would cover all medical expenses incurred by Jane at Harding. This allegation would not, in itself, be sufficient to estop Harding from enforcing its services contract against appellant. The first confirmation of Jane\u2019s benefits was in the form letter prepared by Janet Porter. The letter specifically stated that it contained merely a verbal confirmation of the information provided by the insurance company and was not a guarantee of payment. Moreover, the letter contained a financial responsibility statement which appellant signed. The disclaimer and financial responsibility would render any continued reliance on the amounts stated therein unreasonable, absent further misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">However, the verbal confirmation of benefits which appellant received from Pfeiffer in October 1988 was allegedly the result of a phone call to Blue Cross made by Pfeiffer in appellant\u2019s presence. According to Blue Cross, the correct information about coverage was provided to Harding (and miscommunicated to appellant, if appellant\u2019s testimony is credible). Obviously, appellant relied (if there were reliance) upon Pfeiffer\u2019s statement that Blue Cross affirmed that there was coverage, rather than upon what Blue Cross told Pfeiffer since appellant did not hear that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that Harding\u2019s radio advertisements contained factual misrepresentations, which provided some inducement to admit Jane to Harding, is without merit. The ads merely say that Harding will help its patients find out their insurance benefits. Thus, the ads themselves are not false misrepresentations of anything. Moreover, Mary Doe testified that the ads were not a deciding factor in her choosing Harding. Jane Doe was taken to Harding from St. Anthony Hospital upon a recommendation to Mary from Jane\u2019s pediatrician. The ads do, however, support appellant\u2019s statements that coverage information was obtained by and provided to appellant by Harding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Appellant\u2019s estoppel argument is primarily based on his reliance on Harding\u2019s cumulative assurances and guarantees of Jane\u2019s extended coverage that caused him to forgo personal contact with Blue Cross prior to Jane\u2019s admittance to Stratford East in late October 1988. Appellant\u2019s evidence is that he, as well as Harding, conditioned Jane\u2019s admittance to Stratford East on the availability of adequate insurance coverage. Appellant specifically claims that Shwed requested that he deliver a copy of his insurance policy to Pfeiffer to ascertain the extent of coverage available for Jane\u2019s treatment. Subsequently, the Does contend that Harding\u2019s assurance that the benefits existed induced the Does to admit Jane to Stratford East. Moreover, appellant contends that Harding\u2019s continued assurances caused him to forgo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>contacting Blue Cross himself. Finally, Mary Doe testified that she, in fact, did read the insurance policy and decided that it did not contradict anything Harding had previously told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Since we are reviewing a summary judgment, we must accept as a fact for purposes of reviewing the summary judgment that Harding acted as appellant averred even though Harding denies those facts. Appellant\u2019s main claim is that Harding promised to determine Jane\u2019s benefits as a condition of her admission to Stratford East and that they did so, relating that Blue Cross stated that there was coverage after an employee personally checked the policy and confirmed coverage with Blue Cross. The misrepresentations alleged were the facts of coverage and not just promissory.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Reliance is also a necessary element of estoppel, which reliance must be reasonable and made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Material factual questions exist from the conflicting evidence of the substance of the communications between Harding and appellant. Whether Harding promised the Does, subsequent to September 15, 1988 and in contemplation of Jane\u2019s transfer to Stratford East, to determine the extent of Jane\u2019s insurance coverage as a prerequisite to her admittance to long-term inpatient care is a question to be answered by the trier of fact. Likewise, whether Harding requested a copy of appellant\u2019s insurance policy for its officials to review, and thereby was estopped from applying the provision in its services contract which disclaimed its liability for any errors contained in its confirmations of Jane\u2019s extended coverage subsequent to its receipt of the policy, are questions which render summary judgment inappropriate. Finally, whether it was foreseeable that Harding\u2019s promise would cause the Does to forgo personal contact with Blue Cross, or closer scrutiny by them, or an independent adviser to determine the extent of coverage, is a question for the trier of fact. The financial responsibility statements signed by appellant would not necessarily defeat application of the doctrine of estoppel because their terms do not contain a merger clause or any other limitation on Harding regarding a subsequent promise to appellant to help determine the extent of Jane\u2019s benefits as a condition of her admission to Stratford East.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The factual misstatement upon which appellant primarily relies to attach liability against Harding on the theory of estoppel is that Harding had itself determined and represented to appellant that Jane actually had 2.5 million dollars of available insurance coverage for her stay at Stratford East, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>despite allegedly contrary information provided by Thurman at Blue Cross.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This confirmation was allegedly made many times subsequent to the letter of September 15, 1988 by Jane\u2019s treating physician through Mary Griffith. Harding\u2019s continual reassurances, combined with Mary Griffith\u2019s guarantee that the Does had nothing to worry about except the health of their child, if proved, are sufficient to present a genuine issue of fact that appellant\u2019s reliance was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The policy provisions herein are not so easily determined from reading the policy as to render any reliance on false statements that there was coverage beyond thirty-one days unenforceable under the <em>Pedler </em>doctrine. Harding was or should have been aware that the Does would rely on their statement that Jane had adequate insurance coverage, particularly since a Harding employee allegedly conveyed that message to appellant while in possession of the policy and after talking privately to Blue Cross. It is also significant that the Does specifically told Harding that they could not afford to admit Jane to Stratford East unless there was adequate insurance coverage. Therefore, Harding\u2019s alleged statements were made with the intent that they be relied upon. The experience or knowledge of appellant in insurance matters was not sufficient to defeat reliance as a matter of law. Doe\u2019s experience is only a factor to be considered by the trier of the fact. Balanced against that experience is the traumatic situation faced by the Does and their claimed reliance upon Harding to assist them in obtaining correct information about coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial court also found that appellant\u2019s reliance on any of Harding\u2019s statements was unreasonable because appellant actually knew from his attorney\u2019s correspondence with Blue Cross that Jane\u2019s inpatient mental health care coverage was limited to thirty-one days per year. The letters reveal that February 22, 1989 was the pivotal date from which appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>actual knowledge that Blue Cross had denied Jane\u2019s coverage and would seek a reimbursement of medical expenses paid in excess of the thirty-one-day per year limit from Harding. Appellant, however, does not claim that he relied on any statements made by Harding after 1988 in deciding whether to admit Jane to long-term care. Appellant does argue, however, that, when he finally knew that Blue Cross denied coverage for Jane\u2019s treatment at Stratford East and would seek reimbursement, Jane\u2019s condition was such that it made it impossible for him to remove Jane from Harding and to place her in a less expensive facility.. Thus, the letters raise only an issue of the extent of damages rather than of liability, since costs beyond thirty-one days had already been incurred at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Having determined that appellant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to raise genuine issues of facts making possible a recovery by appellant against Harding based upon estoppel, we hereby sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error addresses the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for Harding on appellant\u2019s alternative negligence claim. John Doe\u2019s complaint based Harding\u2019s alleged negligence on its misrepresentation of Jane\u2019s insurance benefits. Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s memoranda contra to Harding\u2019s motion for summary judgment failed to cite any case which discussed the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Rather, appellant argued that Harding breached an \u201cassumed duty\u201d to correctly interpret appellant\u2019s insurance policy for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s alternative negligence claim because it concluded, as a matter of law, that any duty to correctly interpret an insurance policy must derive from the insurance contract itself. The trial court specifically stated that the lack of contractual privity between appellant and Harding, as far as the insurance policy was concerned, prevented a finding that Harding breached a duty to correctly interpret the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On appeal, however, appellant\u2019s opposition to the trial court\u2019s summary judgment is confined to an analysis of 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1987) 126, Section 552 (hereafter \u201cSection 552\u201d), which defines the tort of negligent misrepresentation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\u201c\u00a7 552. Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">\u201c(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c(2) Except as stated in Subsection (3), the liability stated in Subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">\u201c(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201c(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The alternative facts of this case must be considered before it can be determined whether negligent misrepresentation is a viable theory for relief. First, if Harding made no statements that Blue Cross confirmed long-term coverage, there was no misrepresentation, negligent or otherwise. Second, if Harding accurately relayed the statement of Blue Cross that there was coverage, there was no misrepresentation and the party that could be es-topped was Blue Cross. Third, if Blue Cross told Harding\u2019s employees that there was no long-term coverage and Harding miscommunicated that information to appellant, Harding could be estopped, as explained previously. It would not matter whether the misrepresentation was negligent or not. The same requirement of reliance is applicable in any event. Thus, inserting the doctrine of negligent misrepresentation will add nothing and only potentially cloud the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Appellant argues, however, that Harding is liable under Section 552 for its own misrepresentations to the Does. Those misrepresentations were allegedly contained in its advertisements which promised that Harding would help its patients find out how much they could count on their medical benefits. Again, we reject appellant\u2019s arguments that the ads were deceptive or contained any false guarantee that Harding would unilaterally ascertain the availability of insurance benefits. Thus, no liability can result from the radio ads.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">More important, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is focused on his argument that Harding is liable for negligent misrepresentation based on its \u201cassumption of duty\u201d to interpret appellant\u2019s insurance contract. The duty element in Section 552 is to use reasonable care in obtaining and communicating information in a business setting, whether done gratuitously or not. Appellant\u2019s \u201cassumption of duty\u201d theory to establish negligence liability in this case is misplaced. Appellant is really asserting that Harding promised to find out from Blue Cross the extent of Jane\u2019s benefits as a condition of her transfer to Stratford East. There was no reliance upon the ads as a guarantee to interpret the policy and appellant\u2019s allegations make clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the information to be relied upon was to come from Blue Cross, not Harding\u2019s unilateral interpretation of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for Harding on its counterclaim against appellant for his alleged breach of contract for failure to pay Jane\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">For the reasons previously discussed, we find that appellant presented genuine issues of fact whether Harding is estopped from enforcing its services contract against appellant, either in part or in whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled. Appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further procedure consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-11\">Bowman and Strausbaugh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<author id=\"b417-12\">Dean Strausbaugh, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting and hearing the appeal pursuant to active duty prior to his retirement, and assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, subsequent to his retirement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\">. We dismissed appellant's appeal against Blue Cross/Blue Shield on August 9, 1991 for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final appealable order. Thus, appellant's fourth assignment of error is not ripe for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. The relevant policy provisions specifically provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cMAXIMUMS PER BENEFIT PERIOD PER COVERED PERSON \u201cInpatient Mental Health Care, Drug Abuse and Alcoholism Services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF4\">\u201c31 days of stay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">\"Outpatient Mental Health Care Services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">\u201c$1,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\u201cMAXIMUM BENEFIT PAYABLE PER LIFETIME</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">\u201cFor all Covered Services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apx\">\"$2,500,000 per Covered Person</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">Under the description of Health Care Benefits, Mental Health Care Services are described specifically as individual psychotherapy, psychological counseling and family counseling without a distinction of whether the treatment is inpatient or outpatient. Moreover, the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201cBenefits After Termination of Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\"If you are an Inpatient of a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the day your coverage stops, the benefits listed under the Inpatient Services section, subsections Bed, Board and General Nursing Services and Ancillary Services only, subject to any changes in your Group benefits, will continue until the earliest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\" \u2014 we pay your maximum benefits; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A75\">\" \u2014 you leave the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">\" \u2014 the end of the Benefit Period in which your coverage stopped; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATm\">\" \u2014 you have other group health coverage for the condition that requires your Inpatient</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A79\">Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">\"Inpatient\u201d is distinguished from \u201coutpatient\u201d in the definitional section of the policy as a beneficiary \"for whom a room and board charge is made.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Finally, in describing how benefits are paid, the policy contains the following disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADn4\">\"If we have erroneously paid for services and it is later discovered that we have paid for services which are not considered Covered Services under this Certificate, then we have the right to recover and you are responsible to repay such amounts when requested to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\">. Technically, there has not been a final judgment which resolves the issue of whether Jane's inpatient medical treatment at Harding was limited to thirty-one days per year, or whether another portion of the policy would provide extended coverage, at least for room and board. Since this is the primary issue in appellant\u2019s breach of contract claim against Blue Cross pending at the common pleas court (see footnote 1), Civ.R. 54(B) most likely should have prevented the trial court from rendering final judgment for Harding prior to reaching a judgment on appellant\u2019s claim against Blue Cross. Nevertheless, the trial court's decision of April 18, 1991 interpreted the insurance contract against appellant. The trial court specifically concluded that the policy provided for only thirty-one days of inpatient mental health care, including room and board, per year. Thus, a factual statement that Jane was covered up to 2.5 million dollars for her stay at Harding would be false for purposes of the first element of appellant\u2019s claim of equitable estoppel. Since that determination, even if correct, has not been made binding in the claim against Blue Cross, it should not be held to be found in favor of Harding as that issue should be appealed at a time when all parties would be equally affected.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
