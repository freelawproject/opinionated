(\u201cMorton\u201d), American Cyanamid Company (\u201cCyanamid\u201d), and Thiokol Corporation (\u201cThiokol\u201d) on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under an excess-liability policy of insurance issued by Harbor. Harbor advances on appeal two assignments of error in which it challenges the denial of its motion for a change of venue or for dismissal on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>and the entry of partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Thiokol is the successor by merger to the assets and liabilities of Southwest Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cSouthwest\u201d). Morton is the successor by assignment of the rights and liabilities of Thiokol with respect to Southwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In November 1974, Southwest entered into an agreement with Cyanamid to produce an herbicide for Cyanamid at Southwest\u2019s Newell, West Virginia, plant. In March 1975, Southwest engaged Browning Ferris Industries (\u201cBFI\u201d) to dispose of the waste generated in the manufacture of the herbicide. From February 1975 through November 1976, BFI transported the waste to the Summit National Services Deerfield Dump Site (\u201cSummit site\u201d), a waste-disposal facility that was licensed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cOhio EPA\u201d) and located in Portage County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The Summit site closed in 1979. As part of the governmental efforts to recoup the site\u2019s environmental clean-up costs, Morton\u2019s corporate predecessor and other potentially responsible parties were named in 1981 as defendants in an action brought by the Ohio EPA in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, in 1987, as respondents to a \u201cSection 106 Order\u201d demanding corrective action issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cU.S. EPA\u201d), and in 1990 as defendants in a U.S. EPA action in federal court (hereinafter, \u201cSummit claims\u201d). In 1987, Morton\u2019s corporate predecessor paid $25,000 toward settlement of the Section 106 order, and, in June 1991, a \u201cFinal Consent Order,\u201d under which the liability of Morton and Cyanamid was estimated to be between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000, was entered in the Ohio EPA and U.S. EPA actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Southwest was a named insured under an excess-liability insurance policy issued by Harbor to Southwest\u2019s corporate parent for the three annual coverage periods from August 29, 1975, to August 29, 1978. Cyanamid was added as a named insured under the policy by an endorsement found by the trial court to be effective not later than March 5, 1976. The position taken by the plaintiffs\u2019 primary and excess-liability insurers, including Harbor, that their policies imposed no obligation on the insurers to indemnify the plaintiffs for amounts paid in settlement of the Summit claims, prompted the institution of the action underlying the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Harbor, in its first assignment of error, challenges the denial of its motion for a change of venue or for dismissal on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>The challenge is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Civ.R. 3 governs the matter of venue. Civ.R. 3(C)(1) empowers a trial court to transfer an action commenced in a county where venue is improper to a county where venue is proper upon the timely-filed motion of a defendant pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(3). Civ.R. 3(B) defines where venue is proper, providing in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201c(B) Venue: Where Proper. Any action may be venued, commenced, and decided in any court in any county. * * * Proper venue lies in any one or more of the following counties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\u201c(6) The county in which all or part of the claim for relief arose * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">When venue is proper under Civ.R. 3(B) as to one party or one claim for relief, it is proper as to all. Civ.R. 3(E). An action may be transferred from a county where venue is proper only \u201cwhen it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in the county in which the suit is pending.\u201d Civ.R. 3(C)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Morton alleged in its amended complaint that \u201cstatements of position\u201d issued by Harbor\u2019s co-defendant Select Insurance Company which \u201c[gave] rise to [Morton\u2019s] action were sent to Morton\u2019s representatives in Hamilton County.\u201d Thus, pursuant to Civ.R. 3(B)(6), Hamilton County was a proper venue. Harbor has not alleged, either on appeal or in the proceedings below, that a fair and impartial trial could not be had in Hamilton County. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Harbor\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Under the common-law doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>as adopted in Ohio, \u201ca court may resist imposition upon its jurisdiction even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of a general venue statute.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 123, 126, 519 N.E.2d 370, 372-373 (quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert </em>[1947], 330 U.S. 501, 507, 67 S.Ct. 839, 842, 91 L.Ed. 1055, 1062). The disposition of a motion to dismiss an action on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. On appeal, a reviewing court is not required to reweigh the public and private interest factors relevant to the trial court\u2019s disposition of the motion and must give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>lower court\u2019s decision when its balancing of these factors is \u201creasonable.\u201d An appellate court\u2019s scope of review is thus limited to a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Id,., </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 127, 132-133, 519 N.E.2d at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Upon consideration of the public and private interest factors set forth in <em>Chambers, supra, </em>we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Harbor\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>We, therefore, overrule Harbor\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In its second assignment of error, Harbor challenges the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. We find this challenge to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">A party seeking to recover upon a claim may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment in his favor on all or any part of the claim. Civ.R. 56(A). A motion for summary judgment may be granted if the court, upon reviewing the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts set forth in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, and affidavits in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion determines:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">(1) that no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">(2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">(3) that the evidence demonstrates that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse, to the party opposing the motion. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The insurance policy issued by Harbor to Southwest\u2019s corporate parent required Harbor to provide indemnification in excess of primary insurance coverage \u201cfor all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability * * * imposed upon the Insured by law * * * for damages on account of * * * Property Damage * * * caused by or arising out of each occurrence * * * during the policy period.\u201d The policy defined \u201cthe Insured\u201d to include a \u201cNamed Insured,\u201d and the term \u201cDamages\u201d to include \u201cdamages or loss of use of property resulting from property damage.\u201d The phrase \u201cProperty Damage,\u201d as used in the policy, was defined to include \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom * * The policy defined an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in * * * property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>damage * * * neither expected not <em>[sic </em>] intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The property-damage liability coverage provided under the policy was subject to the policy\u2019s \u201cpollution exclusion\u201d and \u201cpetroleum exclusion.\u201d The petroleum exclusion excluded from coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201c(h) * * * property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of * * * (ii) oil or other petroleum substance or derivative (including any oil refuse or oil mixed with wastes) into or upon any watercourse or body of water, whether or not such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental but only with respect to [specified] operations [, including] * * * Chemical Manufacturing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The pollution exclusion excluded from coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201c(h) * * * property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of: (i) smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water. * * # <em>if</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The policy provided an exception to the pollution exclusion \u201cif such discharge, dispersal, release or escape [was] sudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The entry of partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs against Harbor consisted of a declaration that Harbor was obligated under the policy to indemnify the plaintiffs for amounts paid in settlement of the Summit claims in excess of an aggregate amount of $300,000 and a declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees and the costs incurred in securing indemnification. The declaration of Harbor\u2019s obligation of indemnification was predicated upon the trial court\u2019s determination (1) that the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claims constituted \u201cProperty Damage\u201d and, being \u201cunexpected and unintended\u201d from the standpoint of the plaintiffs and their predecessors, arose out of an \u201coccurrence\u201d; (2) that the amounts paid or to be paid by the plaintiffs in settlement of the Summit claims constituted \u201csums\u201d that the plaintiffs have or will become \u201cobligated to pay by reason of liability imposed upon [the plaintiffs] by law\u201d as \u201cdamages\u201d because of \u201cProperty Damage\u201d arising out of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d within the meaning of the policy; and (3) that neither the pollution exclusion nor the petroleum exclusion operated to bar coverage of the Summit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">In support of its challenge on appeal to the entry of partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs, Harbor contends (1) that the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claims did not constitute \u201cProperty Damage\u201d; (2) that the amounts paid in settlement of the claims did not constitute sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the plaintiffs were obligated by law to pay as \u201cdamages\u201d; (3) that issues of fact remained as to whether the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claims was \u201cneither expected [nor] intended from the [plaintiffs\u2019] standpoint\u201d and thus arose out of an \u201coccurrence\u201d; (4) that issues of fact remained as to whether coverage was excluded under the pollution exclusion or the petroleum exclusion; and (5) that issues of fact remained as to the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to an award of attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Our decision in <em>Kipin Industries, Inc. v. American Universal Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 228, 535 N.E.2d 334, compels the conclusion that, for purposes of the Harbor policy, the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claims constituted \u201cProperty Damage\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 settlement payments constituted sums payable as \u201cdamages.\u201d The evidentiary material submitted by Harbor on the motion for summary judgment in no way controverts the plaintiffs\u2019 substantiated assertion that they \u201cneither expected [nor] intended\u201d the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claims. Therefore, the damage must be said to have arisen out of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d as that term is defined in the Harbor policy. See <em>id. </em>at 231, 535 N.E.2d at 337-338. Our determination that no issue of fact remained as to whether the environmental damage alleged in the Summit claim was either expected or intended is also, under <em>Kipin, supra, </em>dispositive of Harbor\u2019s contention that coverage was excluded under the pollution exclusion. See <em>id. </em>at 231, 535 N.E.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Harbor asserts, however, that conflicts between Ohio law and Texas law give rise to a choice-of-law problem, that Ohio choice-of-law principles mandate the application of Texas law, and that, with respect to the pollution exclusion, the application of Texas law would yield a result contrary to that mandated by <em>Kipin, supra. </em>We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In <em>Kipin, supra, </em>we held that the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to a pollution exclusion virtually identical to the pollution exclusion contained in the Harbor policy was, in essence, a restatement of the definition of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d under which coverage is afforded when the damage was \u201cneither expected nor intended.\u201d Accord <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Liberty Solvents &amp; Chemicals Co. </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 127, 17 OBR 225, 477 N.E.2d 1227. Thus, it follows that, if the environmental damage was unexpected and unintended from the standpoint of the polluter and, therefore, arose out of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d the \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of pollutants was also \u201csudden and accidental\u201d and the pollution exclusion, by virtue of its \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception, will not operate to exclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>A review of Texas law yields no authoritative interpretation of the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion. Harbor maintains that an Ohio court required by Ohio choice-of-law principles to apply Texas law must interpret the pollution exclusion as would a Texas court and that a Texas court would follow those state courts that find the language of the pollution exclusion to be unambiguous and read the exclusion to bar coverage unless the discharge of pollution is \u201cboth sudden, meaning abrupt and lasting only a short time, and accidental, meaning unexpected.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Lower Paxton Twp. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1989), 383 Pa.Super. 558, 557 A.2d 393, 399. We find, however, that, even if we accept for the sake of argument Harbor\u2019s proposition that a conflict exists between Ohio law and Texas law which gives rise to a choice-of-law problem, we are unable to conclude that the trial court\u2019s application of the law of this jurisdiction to interpret the pollution exclusion constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In Ohio, the analysis and resolution of a choice-of-law problem must be based upon the principles set forth in Section 188 of 1 Restatement of the Law 2d (1971), Conflict of Laws. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ferrin </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 43, 21 OBR 328, 487 N.E.2d 568; <em>Gries Sports Enterprises, Inc. v. Modell </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 284, 15 OBR 417, 473 N.E.2d 807, certiorari denied (1985), 473 U.S. 906, 105 S.Ct. 3530, 87 L.Ed.2d 654. With respect to the Summit claims, Ohio is the place of performance and the situs of the subject matter of the Harbor policy. Under the principles set forth in Section 188, Ohio may fairly be said to bear the most significant relationship to the policy. Compare <em>Morton Internatl., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(Oct. 2, 1991), Hamilton App. No. C-900283, unreported, 1991 WL 201651. Therefore, our decision in <em>Kipin, supra, </em>is controlling and, upon the state of the record before us, compels the conclusion that no issues of fact remain as to whether coverage was excluded under the pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The petroleum exclusion, unlike the pollution exclusion, can operate to exclude coverage under the Harbor policy regardless of whether the \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d of pollutants was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d It need only be demonstrated (1) that the \u201cproperty damage\u201d for which coverage under the policy is afforded \u201c[arose] out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of * * * oil or other petroleum substance or derivative (including any oil refuse or oil mixed with wastes)\u201d; (2) that the pollutant was \u201cdischarge^], dispersed], release[d] or escape[d] * * * into or upon any watercourse or body of water\u201d; and (3) that the exclusion is being invoked with respect to one of the \u201coperations\u201d specified therein, including \u201cChemical Manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>It is beyond cavil that Southwest was engaged in \u201cChemical Manufacturing.\u201d The evidence before us also supports a positive finding on the exclusion\u2019s requirement of a \u201cdischarge * * * [or] release\u201d of pollutants \u201cinto or upon any watercourse or body of water\u201d and on the requirement of a causal link between the \u201cproperty damage\u201d and the \u201cdischarge * * * [or] release\u201d of pollutants when the U.S. EPA\u2019s complaint against Morton, Cyanamid and other potentially responsible parties, submitted by the plaintiffs in support of their motion for partial summary judgment, alleged environmental damage resulting from the release and discharge of hazardous substances from the Summit site \u201cinto groundwater and surface water on, under and adjacent to the [site] * * * and into surface waters on, adjacent to and flowing from the [site].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the deposition testimony of Donald Georgeoff, former president and sole shareholder of the corporate entity that operated the Summit site, and of Walter Hladky, Henry Clancy and Stephen Levy, employees of the plaintiffs or their corporate predecessors, gives rise to an issue of fact as to whether the waste generated in Southwest\u2019s manufacture of Cyanamid\u2019s herbicide and shipped to the Summit site consisted of \u201coil or other petroleum substance or derivative (including any oil refuse or oil mixed with wastes).\u201d We, therefore, hold that summary judgment in the. form of a declaration that Harbor was obligated to indemnify the plaintiffs was improvidently entered when there remained triable issues relevant to the determinative issue of whether the petroleum exclusion operated to bar coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Turning to Harbor\u2019s challenge to the declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs, we note that an entitlement to fees and costs is contingent upon a determination that coverage was afforded under the policy. The declaration of the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to attorney fees and costs is, therefore, vitiated by our determination that issues of fact remain relevant to whether coverage is barred under the petroleum exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Upon our determination that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs in the form of declarations that the policy imposed upon Harbor an obligation of indemnification and that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees and costs, we sustain Harbor\u2019s sole assignment of error, reverse the judgment entered below and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-6\">Shannon, P.J., Hildebrandt and Utz, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">.
