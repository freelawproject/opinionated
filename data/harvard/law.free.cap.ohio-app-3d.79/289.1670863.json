The plaintiff-appellant, Sales Consultants, appeals from the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas which granted the defendant-appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The appellant\u2019s appeal is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">On June 5, 1989, the appellant filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas which alleged that the appellee had breached an employee recruitment contract. The following facts formed the basis of the appellant\u2019s complaint: (1) the appellant was an executive management recruiter who provided information to potential employers of possible employees; (2) the appellant was an Ohio corporation; (3) the appellee was a Pennsylvania corporation which specialized in the milling, cutting and preparation of lumber; (4) the appellee was in need of an employee who was a \u201cdimension\u201d specialist; (5) the appellee placed an advertisement in a trade publication which sought a \u201cdimension\u201d specialist; (6) the appellant contacted the appellee with regard to a potential candidate, Ed Ewald, for the position of \u201cdimension\u201d specialist; (7) several-conversations by telephone occurred between the appellant and the appellee with regard to the employment of Ed Ewald as a \u201cdimension\u201d specialist; (8) Ed Ewald, the potential employee, submitted his own resume and application to the appellee; (9) the appellee did hire Ed Ewald as a \u201cdimension\u201d specialist; and (10) the appellee refused to pay to the appellant the sum of $13,500 which was allegedly due as a result of the employment of Ed Ewald.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">On May 16, 1991, the appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2). On July 1, 1991, the appellant filed a brief in opposition to the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. On September 23, 1991, the trial court granted the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Thereafter, the appellant timely filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The appellant, through its sole assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss as based upon a lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. The appellant specifically argues that the appellee transacted business in the state of Ohio, which established \u201cminimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>contacts\u201d and thus allowed the trial court to obtain <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">R.C. 2307.382, which defines a trial court\u2019s ability to exercise <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201c(A) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201c(1) Transacting any business in this state[.] * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In addition, the Supreme Court of Ohio has examined the issue of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction <em>vis-a-vis </em>R.C. 2307.382 and has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201cIt is well-established that \u2018 * * * due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment <em>in personam, </em>if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have <em>certain minimum contacts </em>with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \u2019 <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 316 [66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 101]. Ordinarily, this requires that a party \u2018purposefully * * * [avail] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State * * *.\u2019 <em>Hanson v. Denckla </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 235, 253 [78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, 1297], In judging minimum contacts, a court properly focuses on \u2018the relationship among the defendant, the forum and the litigation * * *.\u2019 <em>Shaffer v. Heitner </em>(1977), 433 U.S. 186, 204 [97 S.Ct. 2569, 2579, 53 L.Ed.2d 683, 697].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">\u201cCourts have consistently held that foreseeability is one of the primary factors to be considered in determining whether there are sufficient minimum contacts. \u2018 * * * [T]he foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis * * * is that the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u2019 <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 286, 297 [100 S.Ct. 559, 567, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 499]. Thus, where the defendant \u2018has created \u201ccontinuing obligations\u201d between himself and residents of the forum, <em>Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia </em>[1950], 339 U.S. [643] at 648 [70 S.Ct. 927, 930, 94 L.Ed. 1154, 1161], * * * he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by \u201cthe benefits and protection\u201d of the forum\u2019s laws, it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not <em>physically </em>enter the forum State.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.) Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 475-476 [105 S.Ct. 2174, 2183-2184, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, 542-543].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Anilas, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>v. Kern </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 163, 164, 31 OBR 366, 367, 509 N.E.2d 1267, 1268.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Finally, this court in <em>Erie Shore Indus., Inc. v. Cumberland Steel, Inc. </em>(June 7, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57053, unreported, 1990 WL 75221, held that \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d involves the following five factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">1. established activity by the non-resident in the forum state;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">2. the non-resident takes advantage of the privileges and benefits of the forum state;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">3. the non-resident solicits business through agents or advertising reasonably calculated to reach the forum state;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">4. it is foreseeable that the non-resident will litigate in the forum state; and</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">5. the convenience to the litigants and the fairness of requiring the nonresident to come to the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">A review of the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>fails to demonstrate that the appellee had \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d with the state of Ohio. The affidavit attached to the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, as provided by the appellee\u2019s president, established that: (1) contacts and negotiations between the appellant and the appellee were conducted by telephone or fax machine; (2) the appellant made the initial contact with the appellee and also initiated the majority of telephone conversations; (3) the appellee never transacted or solicited business within the state of Ohio nor was the appellee authorized to do business within the state of Ohio; (4) the appellee had no office or place of business within the state of Ohio; (5) the hired employee was a resident of the state of Pennsylvania; and (6) the appellee never traveled to Ohio to interview the potential employee or to negotiate with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The affidavit and other evidentiary material attached to the appellant\u2019s brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss did not establish the existence of \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d on the part of the appellee with the state of Ohio. Also, the appellant\u2019s affidavit and the evidentiary material clearly shows that it was the appellant who initially contacted the appellee. Finally, the appellant\u2019s affidavit and the evidentiary materials fail to establish: (1) activity by the appellant in the state of Ohio; (2) the appellee took advantage of the privileges and benefits of the state of Ohio; (3). the appellee solicited business within the state of Ohio; (4) it was foreseeable that the appellee would litigate within the state of Ohio; and (5) it was convenient to the litigants and fairness required the appellee to come to the state of Ohio. Cf. <em>Friedman v. Speiser, Krause &amp; Madole, P.C. </em>(1988), 56 Ohio App.3d 11, 565 N.E.2d 607; <em>Ohio State Tie &amp; Timber, Inc. v. Paris Lumber Co. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 236, 8 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>309, 456 N.E.2d 1309; <em>Culp v. Polytechnic Inst. of New York </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 352, 7 OBR 451, 455 N.E.2d 698. Thus, the trial court did not err as a result of granting the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction and the appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-6\">Matia, C.J., Francis E.
