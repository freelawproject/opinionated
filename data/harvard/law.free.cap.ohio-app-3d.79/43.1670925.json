(\u201cBFA\u201d or \u201cappellee\u201d), from judgments rendered by the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On October 7, 1974, the Ressallats (\u201cappellants\u201d) entered into an agreement with BFA for the purchase of a burglar alarm system for their home. The system was designed to alert the Ressallats, both via warning lights and the sounding of a horn, when an unauthorized person had entered the house. The burglar alarm system was linked with the telephone system so that, simultaneous with the sounding of the alarm, a call was placed through the telephone lines to BFA\u2019s \u201ccentral monitoring station.\u201d The Ressallats paid a monthly fee for these services.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On the advice of BFA\u2019s salesperson, the Ressallats arranged with the telephone company to have the phone cable, from the pole to the house, buried. However, in 1985 the Ressallats began having problems with the telephone lines. Although General Telephone Company (\u201cGTE\u201d) resolved the difficulties with the phone lines, the cable was not reburied. Instead, it was strung directly from the pole to the Ressallats\u2019 house, suspended just a few feet above the ground. Although Dr. Ressallat contacted GTE several times about reburying the phone cable, the company took no action until after the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">In September 1986, the Ressallats\u2019 home was burglarized. The burglar apparently obtained unimpeded access to the house by cutting the exposed telephone wires so as to prevent transmission of the alarm. Inside the house, wires to the burglar alarm horn were severed at the electric service box. Jewelry and coins worth over $100,000 were stolen from the house. The Ressallats\u2019 insurance company, Physicians\u2019 Insurance Company of Ohio (\u201cPICO\u201d), reimbursed the Ressallats in the amount of $17,125.37, the maximum payable on their homeowners\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>In September 1988, the Ressallats filed suit against BFA and others. However, on November 17, 1988, that suit was voluntarily dismissed, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A). This suit was timely re-filed on November 13, 1989. See R.C. 2305.19 (\u201csavings statute\u201d allowing suit voluntarily dismissed to be refiled within one year). The complaint sounded in contract and tort, alleging that BFA had breached its express warranty on the burglar alarm system, had negligently sold, installed, and maintained the system, and had breached the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness. In addition, the Ressallats sued GTE, and BFA\u2019s parent company, Connecticut Consolidated Industries, Inc. Although appellants stated in their brief that they were also suing BFA for misrepresentation, the complaint does not allege facts supporting that claim. Appellant PICO was joined in this action as a subrogee to the rights of the Ressallats.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">On November 7, 1990, appellee BFA filed a motion for summary judgment on the following bases: (1) that the Ressallats\u2019 claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations; (2) that BFA had effectively disclaimed all warranties under its contract with appellants, thus barring them from any related causes of action; and (3) that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be litigated. Along with their response to appellee\u2019s motion, the Ressallats filed a motion for \u201cpartial summary judgment,\u201d requesting a declaration from the trial court that the disclaimers of warranty relied on by BFA were \u201cinconspicuous as a matter of law,\u201d and thus invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The trial court denied the Ressallats\u2019 motion, ruling that BFA\u2019s warranty disclaimer was, as a matter of law, <em>conspicuous. </em>The court sustained BFA's motion in part, and denied it in part, finding that the action had been timely filed, and that there were no issues of fact to be resolved, in that no action on the part of BFA could be found to be the proximate cause of the Ressallats\u2019 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">After the Ressallats filed their notice of appeal, and BFA filed its cross-appeal, the trial judge transferred this case to \u201cinactive status,\u201d pending the appeal. The parties each filed three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">We will first address appellee\u2019s assignments of error on its cross-appeal, the first two of which were argued together:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the first claim and second claim of the amended complaint of the plaintiffs-appellants Medhi M. Ressallat and Judith L. Ressallat and the cross-claims of defendant-appellant Physicians Insurance Company of Ohio that were respectively filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>against defendant-appellee Burglar &amp; Fire Alarms, Inc. were commenced within the appropriate limitations of time permitted by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cB</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the action accrued on the date of injury or damage and not the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In its motion for summary judgment, appellee first maintained that the Ressallats failed to bring their claims within the time specified by the appropriate statutes of limitations. The trial court denied summary judgment on that basis, finding that \u201cthe actions are brought within the appropriate time limitations, in that the [cause of] action accrued on the date of the injury or damage, and not the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">.Although appellants could possibly have brought their case as a contract action based on their contract for \u201cservices\u201d with BFA, they chose to frame the action as a breach of contract for the sale of goods under the Uniform Commercial Code (R.C. 1301.01 <em>et seq.), </em>and in products liability, claiming breach of warranty, negligence, and breach of an implied warranty in tort. See <em>Langhals v. Holt Roofing Co. </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 114, 547 N.E.2d 401 (Article Two of UCC not applicable if service aspect of contract predominates over the sales aspect). Although a fifteen-year statute of limitations governs contract actions in general, see R.C. 2305.06, the \u201cStatute of limitations in contracts for sale,\u201d R.C. 1302.98, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201c(A) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201c(B) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance, the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Therefore, unless a warranty is explicitly extended by contract, a breach under the UCC occurs at or around the time of the sale. A suit on the contract must be brought within four years after \u201cdelivery.\u201d R.C. 1302.98(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The trial court specifically found no facts in this case that would give rise to an extended warranty, thus delaying accrual of a cause of action. The court also found, however, that the suit was timely filed, even though the burglary occurred approximately twelve years after the Ressallats\u2019 purchase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>burglar alarm. It must follow, then, that the judge did not base his ruling on an analysis of the case under the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The court\u2019s holding that \u201cthe action accrued on the date of the injury or damage, and not the sale,\u201d does find support in Ohio law, however. State and federal courts have looked to the substance rather than the form of a cause of action in interpreting Ohio\u2019s statutes of limitations. Thus, whether a suit is brought in contract or tort, when the \u201cessence\u201d of an action is wrongful harm to person or personal property, the R.C. 2305.10 statute of limitations is the appropriate one to apply. See, <em>e.g., Mahalsky v. Salem Tool Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1972), 461 F.2d 581 (two-year statute of limitations on injury to personal property applies to claim of breach of express and implied warranties arising out of sale of alleged defective goods), citing <em>Andrianos v. Community Traction Co. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 47, 50-51, 44 O.O. 72, 74, 97 N.E.2d 549, 551-552; <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Truck &amp; Concrete Equip. Co. </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 244, 50 O.O.2d 480, 257 N.E.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">R.C. 2305.10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cBodily injury or injury to personal property. An action for bodily injury or injuring personal property shall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Ressallats brought their original action within a two-year period after the burglary took place. Therefore, we overrule appellee\u2019s first and second assignments of error on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Appellee\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201cC</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cThe court erred in not concluding as a matter of law that the Ressallats and PICO\u2019s tort claims failed to state valid causes of action on which relief can be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">For the reasons which follow, we conclude that a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) defense (or motion) is not the proper vehicle for resolution of the Ressallats\u2019 suit against appellee. Appellee appears to be asserting that appellants had no cause of action against it, based on the law in two Ohio cases which we find inapposite to the situation before us on appeal. In <em>Chemtrol Adhesives, Inc. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 40, 537 N.E.2d 624, the Supreme Court held that \u201cin the absence of injury to persons or damage to other property, the commercial buyer may not recover for economic losses premised on tort theories of strict liability or negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 537 N.E.2d at 635. See, also, <em>Avenell v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>(1974), 41 Ohio App.2d 150, 70 O.O.2d 316, 324 N.E.2d 583. There is nothing in the <em>Chemtrol </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>holding quoted by appellee in support of its assignment of error that is relevant to this action. First of all, appellants herein are not \u201ccommercial buyers.\u201d Appellee argues that, because of his extensive education (in the medical field), Dr. Ressallat should be considered more sophisticated than an ordinary consumer when choosing a burglar alarm system appropriate for his home. Appellee further argues that, therefore, under UCC standards, the Ressallats should be considered commercial buyers, or \u201cmerchants,\u201d and should be allowed no tort remedies. Appellee\u2019s argument is without merit. The Uniform Commercial Code drafters clearly indicated that only someone who has \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d or skills as to the goods at issue or as to relevant business practices will be held to have dealt at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d with a seller, thereby waiving many of the available remedies for having been sold a defective product. See R.C. 1302.01, Official Comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Appellee also cites <em>Avenell, supra, </em>in support of its assignment of error. In <em>Avenell, </em>two commercial entities negotiated freely for the sale of a turbine generator, which was \u201ca specialized piece of equipment, familiar to both buyer and seller.\u201d <em>Avenell, </em>41 Ohio App.2d at 159, 70 O.O.2d at 321, 324 N.E.2d at 589. The purchaser in that case was not seeking damages for any bodily injury or injury to personal property, but requested compensation for consequential, or \u201ceconomic,\u201d losses. Appellee argues that the Ressallats have no claim against it because they were claiming only \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d as were the purchasers in <em>Avenell </em>and <em>Chemtrol. </em>However, appellee is in error to call the Ressallats\u2019 loss of their personal property an \u201ceconomic loss\u201d under Ohio law, and also errs in asserting that there is no recovery allowed for economic losses in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In support of his argument, appellee cites <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos. v. Burns Electronic Security Serv., Inc. </em>(1980), 93 Ill.App.3d 298, 48 Ill.Dec. 729, 417 N.E.2d 131, an Illinois appeals court case in which recovery of an economic loss under theories of tort was denied. It is puzzling that appellee was, as it stated, \u201cunable to locate a case in Ohio like ours,\u201d since the <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>case pointedly notes that Ohio law differs from Illinois law on the issue. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>93 Ill.App.3d at 300, 48 Ill.Dec. at 731, 417 N.E.2d at 133, fn. 1 (\u201ceconomic loss can be recovered in Ohio under strict liability in tort\u201d). The Illinois court cites <em>Mead Corp. v. Allendale Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1979), 465 F.Supp. 355, 367, a case which thoroughly discusses Ohio law and \u201ceconomic\u201d damages. Furthermore, <em>Mead Corp. </em>has since been cited as authority on the issue of economic loss by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Chemtrol, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 43, 537 N.E.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Contrary to appellee\u2019s assertion, the Ressallats are not seeking damages for an economic loss. The Supreme Court in <em>Chemtrol </em>described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>types of injury which may be compensable due to a product defect. The court defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201ceither damage to the defective product itself or damage to other property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 537 N.E.2d at 628. However, \u201ceconomic loss\u201d refers either to the decreased value of the product itself, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe difference between the actual value of the defective product and the value it would have had had it not been defective (\u2018direct\u2019 economic loss),\u201d or to consequential losses such as \u201cthe value of production time lost and the resulting lost profits (\u2018indirect\u2019 economic loss).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 537 N.E.2d at 628-629. Clearly, appellants are not seeking damages for \u201ceconomic loss\u201d as defined by Ohio courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that appellee\u2019s third assignment of error is groundless. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">' We now turn to appellants\u2019 assignments of error on appeal. The first two assignments state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">\u201cI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment to appellee and holding that appellee\u2019s exclusion of warranties is conspicuous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u201cII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Essentially, both of these assignments claim error in the trial court\u2019s finding that the disclaimer of warranties in the sales contract is conspicuous. In their motion for summary judgment, appellants asked the court to declare the disclaimer \u201cinconspicuous as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Under R.C. 1302.29, unless exclusions or disclaimers of warranty are part of the parties\u2019 \u201cbargain in fact,\u201d a purchaser of goods in Ohio receives, in addition to any express warranty (which generally only provides for repair or replacement of defective goods), an implied warranty that the goods shall be merchantable and \u201cfit\u201d for their intended purpose. See R.C. 1302.27 and 1302.28. Although courts generally uphold disclaimers of implied warranties between parties who have equal bargaining power, they are reluctant to afford validity to such disclaimers when a purchaser is simply a consumer, rather than a commercial entity. As stated by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">\u201c * * * [Disclaimers of implied warranties * * * must be a part of the parties\u2019 bargain in fact. If it is contained in a printed clause which was not conspicuous or brought to the buyer\u2019s attention, the seller had no reasonable expectation that the buyer understood that his remedies were being restricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to repair and replacement.\u201d <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Automatic Sprinkler Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 91, 96-97, 21 O.O.3d 58, 61, 423 N.E.2d 151, 154-155. Further, R.C. 1302.29(B) requires compliance with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201c * * * Subject to division (C) of this section, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The code itself defines \u201cconspicuous,\u201d and provides that a determination of conspicuousness is a matter of law for the court to decide. R.C. 1301.01(J) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201c(J) \u2018Conspicuous.\u2019 A term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it. A printed heading in capitals (as: NONNEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous. Language in the body of a form is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color. * * * Whether a term is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 or not is for decision by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The disclaimer of warranties at issue herein appears on the back page of the sales contract, which was signed on the front by both parties. The disclaimer is buried in the middle of a full page of small type, in a style identical to the rest of the text on the page. There are no outstanding headings alerting a purchaser to the disclaimer, and there is no mention of \u201cmerchantability\u201d as required by R.C. 1302.29. Furthermore, Dr. Ressallat testified in his deposition that the disclaimer was not mentioned by the salesman at the time of the sale of the burglar alarm system, nor was it brought to his attention that anything was printed on the back page of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We believe the court erred in concluding that the disclaimer of warranties in these parties\u2019 contract was conspicuous. First, the disclaimer fails to mention \u201cmerchantability,\u201d a requirement of the code which must be fulfilled if a disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability is to be found valid. Additionally, we find that the trial court ignored the statutory language and applied an improper standard in determining that the disclaimer was conspicuous. In making that determination, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cThese warranties and conditions are not hidden, but clearly spelled out in common understandable language which leaves no doubt as to what is and what is not covered, and when.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">While we agree that the common, ordinary definition of \u201cconspicuous\u201d can be \u201cnot hidden,\u201d or \u201cclearly spelled out,\u201d the code explicitly sets forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>what the term means under the circumstances of this case. One\u2019s understanding of the terminology bears no relation to conspicuousness under the code. In the disclaimer at issue, there are no prominent headings, and there is no print of a different style or color that would draw one\u2019s attention. The disclaimer wording blends in with the surrounding \u201cterms\u201d and \u201cconditions\u201d and is in no way more noticeable. We find that the disclaimer in the contract is, as a matter of law, inconspicuous. See <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am., supra, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 96-97, 21 O.O.3d at 61, 423 N.E.2d at 154-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The first two assignments of error are well taken. However, although we sustain the assignments of error, we find that in this case the court\u2019s error was harmless, and not prejudicial to appellants. Absent evidence or testimony supporting the breach of warranty claims, the disclaimers are irrelevant, and thus provide no ground for reversal of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cHI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred as matter of law in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and holding that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to the issue of proximate causation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Appellants contend that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \u201cwhether the burglary was foreseeable by Appellee and whether Appellee\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the Ressallats\u2019 injury.\u201d Before the issue of proximate cause is even reached in a negligence analysis, it must be determined that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff. Appellants claim that appellee had a duty to rectify appellants\u2019 problem with the exposed telephone cable. They maintain that the repairman who serviced the alarm system shortly before the burglary must have noticed that the cable was no longer buried, and that appellee\u2019s failure to act on that knowledge was negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Dr. Ressallat himself testified that BFA had advised him at the time of the burglar alarm purchase to have the telephone lines buried for the sake of security. Further, after GTE had dug up the lines for repair purposes, it failed to rebury them despite several requests from appellants. Burial of the telephone cable was never a duty assumed by BFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Appellants appear to be claiming that BFA\u2019s negligence stems from its failure to take responsibility for burial of the phone wires. Appellants make no other allegations of negligence except that in selling, maintaining or servicing the system, BFA must have been negligent, or that false representations were made by the salesman on which appellants relied in their decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>to purchase appellee\u2019s system. Appellants present no evidence of failure or defect in the actual system or its components. There is simply no evidence that BFA breached any duty it could possibly have had to appellants. Appel-' lants offer no facts evidencing how any warranty was breached, nor do the complaint, transcript, or affidavits indicate that any action of appellee was the proximate cause of the burglary. Furthermore, BFA\u2019s evidence that the alarm system was functioning properly immediately before and after the robbery was unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Therefore, construing all the evidence and allegations in appellants\u2019 favor, which the court is required to do under Civ.R. 56, we conclude that no reasonable person could find that BFA sold appellants a defective alarm system or failed in its duty to maintain and repair the system under the parties\u2019 contract, thereby becoming liable for appellants\u2019 loss of property. Indeed, sellers of goods are not required to be insurers of property, absent assumption of such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">A party responding to a summary judgment motion must set forth specific facts on all material issues upon which it bears the initial burden of proof. The non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings, designating specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. See <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 322-323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, 273. Appellants have not satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Having found no evidence as to BFA\u2019s negligence or breach of warranties sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment, and having found no error prejudicial to the appellants and cross-appellants herein, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-8\">Hadley, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
