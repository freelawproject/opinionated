Hollowell also appeals from the circuit court\u2019s subsequent order denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in challenging the validity of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Hollowell argues the circuit court erred, first, in not striking the entire regulatory scheme upon concluding that part of it was unlawful; and, second, in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030 based on rulings that he \u201cdid not substantially prevail on the merits of the case\u201d and that VMRC\u2019s position \u201cwas substantially justified.\u201d For the following reasons, we conclude Hollowell\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s decision to set aside only part of 4 VAC 20-1140-20 has been rendered moot, and we thus dismiss that portion of this appeal. We agree with Hollowell, however, that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030, and remand this claim to the circuit court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D), as last amended in 1996, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">It is unlawful to use a dredge for catching crabs between April 1 and December 1; however, the Commission, when in its judgment it is advisable due to weather conditions or for purposes relating to the conservation of the blue crab and it is not contrary to the public interest, may close a season in its entirety, may open any season as early as November 16, may delay opening any season, may extend any season until April 16 and may close any season early.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The effect of the statute is to legalize the dredging of crabs for the period from December 1 until March 31 from year to year, commonly referred to as \u201ccrab dredging season,\u201d absent authorized action by VMRC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Based on Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D), VMRC promulgated a new set of regulations, designated as Chapter 1140, and consisting of 4 VAC 20-1140-10 through 4 VAC 20-1140-30 (the \u201cnew regulations\u201d), which became effective on April 30, 2008. In VMRC\u2019s summary of the new regulations at the time they were published in \u201cFinal\u201d form, as set forth in the Virginia Register of Regulations, Volume 24, Issue 19, p. 2763 (May 26, 2008), VMRC stated, \u201cThe chapter prohibits crab dredging in Virginia\u2019s tidal waters.\u201d The primary regulation, 4 VAC 20-1140-20, entitled \u201cCrab dredging prohibited,\u201d provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">The season to use a dredge for catching crabs is closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use a dredge for catching crabs from the waters of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">4 VAC 20-1140-20(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Hollowell, a commercial waterman, filed a \u201cpetition for appeal\u201d in circuit court in May 2008 challenging the new regulations, pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-215.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>circuit court\u2019s April 3, 2009 letter opinion, Hollowell\u2019s position was that Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) granted VMRC \u201cthe authority to prohibit dredging for crabs for one period of December 1\u2014 March 31 at a time.\u201d Yet, 4 VAC 20-1140-20 \u201cread as a whole,\u201d according to Hollowell, \u201cprohibit[ed] the dredging of crabs for an indefinite period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to VMRC\u2019s position, it agreed with Hollowell that the dredging \u201cprohibition\u201d in the regulation was \u201cnot limited to the period of December 1, 2008\u2014March 31, 2009, but applie[d] to subsequent years as well.\u201d VMRC, however, contended that the enabling statute authorized VMRC to promulgate a single regulation that was of open-ended duration to prohibit the dredging of crabs in the waters of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The circuit court agreed with Hollowell\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D), and rejected VMRC\u2019s interpretation. The court held that the statute only gave VMRC \u201cthe authority to close any individual one of the annually occurring crab-dredging seasons,\u201d i.e., one crab dredging season at a time vis-a-vis one regulation at a time. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">Had the General Assembly intended to give the VMRC unlimited power to prohibit crab dredging for multiple seasons at a time without the necessity of further action or public hearings, it could have done so in very plain simple language.... This makes sense in that the limitation of the VMRC\u2019s power to closing one annual season at a time only serves to require annual review and annual Commission action. It still allows for multiple consecutive seasons to be closed within that administrative framework.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The circuit court also agreed with Hollowell that 4 VAC 20-1140-20 \u201cexceeded] the authority granted by Virginia Code Section 28.2-707 in that [subsection B of the regulation] prohibited] crab dredging indefinitely beyond the period of December 1, 2008\u2014March 31, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Consistent with the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 2009 letter opinion, it ordered on the same day \u201cthat 4 VAC 20-1140-20.B be set aside,\u201d and \u201cremand[ed] the matter to [VMRC] to amend 4 VAC 20-1140-10 <em>et seq. </em>by striking the current version of 4 VAC 20-1140-20.B and ... clarifying that 4 VAC 20-1140-20.A pertains only to the December 1, 2008\u2014March 31, 2009 crab-dredging season.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Hollowell subsequently filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4030. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">In any civil case ... in which any person contests any agency action [as in this case], such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency ... reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust. The award of attorneys\u2019 fees shall not exceed $25,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). By order dated April 22, 2009, the circuit court denied the motion, finding that Hollowell did not substantially prevail on the merits of the case and that VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">On May 4, 2009, Hollowell filed his notice of appeal to this Court. In this appeal, Hollowell contends the circuit court erred (i) in not striking the new regulations entirely, given its holding that the primary regulation, 4 VAC 20-1140-20, was unlawful, and (ii) in denying Hollowell\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>On June 1, 2009, VMRC finalized amendments to 4 VAC 20-1140-20 consistent with the circuit court\u2019s ruling by prohibiting crab dredging in Virginia waters only for the upcoming crab dredging season. <em>See </em>Virginia Register of Regulations, Vol. 25, Issue 21, p. 3793 (June 22, 2009). As amended, subsection B of the regulation was struck in its entirety, and subsection A was changed to read: \u201cIn accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 28.2-707 of the Code of Virginia, the crab dredging season of December 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010 is closed, and it shall be unlawful to use a dredge for catching crabs from the waters of the Commonwealth during that season.\u201d 4 VAC 20-1140-20(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">II. MOOTNESS OF CHALLENGE TO CIRCUIT COURT\u2019S DISPOSITION OF REGULATION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In response to Hollowell\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s decision to set aside only part of 4 VAC 20-1140-20 rather than all three of the new regulations in their entirety, after determining that 4 VAC 20-1140-20 was unlawful, VMRC asserts that this issue was rendered moot by VMRC\u2019s amendments to the regulation, which were finalized after Hollowell filed this appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">It is this Court\u2019s duty \u201c \u2018to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrison v. Ocean View Fishing Pier, LLC, </em>50 Va.App. 556, 570, 651 S.E.2d 421, 428 (2007) (quoting <em>Potts v. Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 225, 181 S.E. 521, 533 (1935)). A \u201ccase is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s AM., </em>529 U.S. 277, 287, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 1390, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[djismissal is the proper remedy\u201d when an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that renders it moot\u2014that is, \u201c \u2018renders it impossible\u2019 \u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>this Court to grant appellant the relief requested. <em>Jackson v. Marshall, </em>19 Va.App. 628, 635, 454 S.E.2d 23, 27 (1995) (quoting <em>Hankins v. Town of Virginia Beach, </em>182 Va. 642, 644, 29 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Hollowell challenged 4 VAC 20-1140-20 on the grounds that it prohibited dredging of crabs for an indefinite period of time, whereas the enabling legislation, Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D), only authorized VMRC to prohibit such dredging one season at a time\u2014extending from December 1 until March 31 from year to year. Agreeing with this interpretation of both Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) and 4 VAC 20-1140-20, the circuit court ordered VMRC to amend the regulation, which VMRC proceeded to do. But the amended regulation did not go into effect until nearly a month after Hollowell filed this appeal. Nevertheless, in light of those amendments to the regulation, \u201cthe regulation at issue [below] is no longer in force,\u201d <em>Princeton Univ. v. Schmid, </em>455 U.S. 100, 103, 102 S.Ct. 867, 869, 70 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982) (per curiam) (holding that university\u2019s amendments to its subject regulation made moot a challenge to the earlier version of the regulation), and by those amendments the \u201cchallenged features\u201d of the regulation were removed, <em>Coalition for the Abolition on Marijuana Prohibition v. City of Atlanta, </em>219 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A \u201csuperseding statute or regulation moots a case ... to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law.\u201d <em>Id.; see Citizens for Responsible Gov\u2019t State Political Action Comm. v. Davidson, </em>236 F.3d 1174, 1187 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that amendments to Colorado\u2019s Fair Campaign Practices Act while appeal was pending mooted appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the Act); <em>Camarena v. Texas Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>754 S.W.2d 149, 151 (Tex.1988) (holding that amendments to the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act mooted petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge to the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The portion of Hollowell\u2019s instant appeal challenging the fact that the circuit court did not set aside the entire regulation, after it determined that a material part of it was unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ful, is, therefore, moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We thus dismiss the portion of this appeal challenging the extent to which the circuit court set aside the regulation after concluding it was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">III. CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Hollowell next challenges on appeal the circuit court\u2019s rejection of his claim for attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030, contending the court erred in ruling that he \u201cdid not substantially prevail on the merits of the case\u201d and that VMRC\u2019s position \u201cwas substantially justified,\u201d either of which would have negated his claim under the statute. In response, VMRC contends this challenge is also moot. VMRC further asserts that Hollowell is otherwise not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees because he did not meet the statutory requirements for such an award. We conclude that (a) this claim is not moot, and (b) the circuit court erred, as a matter of law, in not awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Hollowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">A. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">(i) <em>Time of Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">VMRC argues its subject amendments to the regulation also mooted Hollowell\u2019s appeal of his claim for attorney\u2019s fees. VMRC cites no Virginia authority on point, nor have we found any. By way of analogy, however, VMRC cites <em>Coady v. Strategic Resources, Inc., </em>258 Va. 12, 15-16, 515 S.E.2d 273, 274 (1999), for its discussion of three of the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cearlier decisions applying what is now Code \u00a7 17.1-604, which allows the recovery of [appellate] costs ... by the \u2018party substantially prevailing.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those decisions, the Supreme Court explains in <em>Coady, </em>\u201crecognize the principle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>when a case becomes moot while an appeal is pending, the controversy ceases to exist and there is no prevailing party\u201d under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 515 S.E.2d at 274. But in one of those decisions, <em>Ficklen v. City of Danville, </em>146 Va. 426, 131 S.E. 689 (1926), the Court recognized and applied an exception to that general principle, which would apply by analogy here. In <em>Ficklen, </em>as in this case, the issue on appeal was rendered moot due to actions taken by the appellees during the pendency of the appeal\u2014with appellees \u201cin effect yielding to the contention of the appellants\u201d and \u201cabandon[ing] [their own] contention made before the lower court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 131 S.E. at 692. Under those circumstances, the Court concluded that \u201cthe appellants should be held to have substantially prevailed in this [C]ourt, although the appeal is dismissed, and therefore they are entitled to recover costs against the appellees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 131 S.E. at 692.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The view of numerous courts in other jurisdictions, in decisions more directly on point, is that mootness of an underlying claim below does not preclude a statutory award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d where those fees have already been incurred. <em>See, e.g., Ford v. Wilder, </em>469 F.3d 500, 506-07 (6th Cir.2006) (remanding to district court for consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees where defendants were responsible for mooting the case while it was pending on appeal); <em>Citizens for Responsible Gov\u2019t State Political Action Comm., </em>236 F.3d at 1183 (\u201c \u201cWhile a claim of entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees does not preserve a moot cause of action, the expiration of the underlying cause of action does not moot a controversy over attorney\u2019s fees already incurred.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Dahlem, v. Board of Educ. of Denver Pub. Schs., </em>901 F.2d 1508, 1511 (10th Cir.1990))); <em>Young v. City of Chicago, </em>202 F.3d 1000, 1000-01 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201cA defendant cannot defeat a plaintiffs right to attorneys\u2019 fees by taking steps to moot the case after the plaintiff has obtained the relief he sought, for in such a case mootness does not alter the plaintiffs status as a prevailing party.\u201d); <em>Bishop v. Committee on Prof'l Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>686 F.2d 1278, 1290 (8th Cir.1982) (\u201c[I]t has been generally held that the dismissal on appeal of the underlying claims on the merits on the grounds of mootness [does not] preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d); <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201c[A] determination of mootness does not prevent an award of attorney\u2019s fees on remand.\u201d); <em>Merriam v. AIG Claims Servs., Inc., </em>183 Vt. 568, 945 A.2d 882, 885 (2008) (holding that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cpresented] a live controversy\u201d on appeal even though the underlying claim became moot while the appeal was pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Based on this authority, we reject VMRC\u2019s argument that Hollowell\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on his claim for attorney\u2019s fees was rendered moot as a result of VMRC\u2019s <em>own </em>decision to amend the regulation in accordance with the judgment of the circuit court, rather than defend it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">(ii) <em>Expiration of 2008-2009 Crab Dredging Season</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">VMRC argues in the alternative, in contesting Hollowell\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, that this case, in fact, became moot even before the circuit court\u2019s ruling on his petition for appeal. According to VMRC, \u201cthe principal substantive issue decided by the circuit court\u201d was \u201cthe validity of the regulation closing the 2008-2009 crab dredging season,\u201d which would have extended from December 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009. But the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 2009 order, VMRC further asserts, was \u201centered too late to provide [Hollowell] any meaningful relief,\u201d as \u201cthe crab dredging season for which relief was requested had ended.\u201d Thus, \u201cthere no longer remained a justiciable controversy between the parties and the circuit court could do nothing to remedy [Hollowell\u2019s] inability to dredge for the season by then past.\u201d \u201cConsequently,\u201d VMRC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>concludes, Hollowell\u2019s \u201crequest for fees is also moot and must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">VMRC\u2019s reasoning is flawed because \u201cthe principal substantive issue\u201d presented in Hollowell\u2019s petition for appeal was in no way limited to the 2008-2009 crab dredging season. Hollowell\u2019s petition, filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-215, sought judicial review of the newly promulgated regulations, 4 VAC 20-1140-10 through 4 VAC 20-1140-30, and in particular 4 VAC 20-1140-20, based on the claim that this regulatory scheme was unlawful in that, contrary to the enabling legislation, it prohibited crab dredging indefinitely. Thus, the fact that the period for the 2008-2009 crab dredging season had passed when the circuit court ruled that 4 VAC 20-1140-20 was unlawful, in establishing an open-ended prohibition of crab dredging, did not mean that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d for the court to provide Hollowell \u201cany meaningful relief.\u201d Hollowell\u2019s legal challenge to the regulation was the same both before and after that period. The principal dispute between the parties over whether VMRC could prohibit crab dredging indefinitely under the regulation indeed remained a \u201clive\u201d dispute until VMRC chose not to challenge the circuit court\u2019s April 3, 2009 order, but, instead, to amend the regulation pursuant to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Therefore, we reject VMRC\u2019s alternative argument that Hollowell\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees became moot before the circuit court ruled on his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">B. Code \u00a7 2.2\u20144030(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We now turn to the circuit court\u2019s determination that Hollowell was not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030. Subsection A of the statute expressly provides that a person contesting agency action \u201cshall be entitled to recover from [the] agency ... reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if [1] such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and [2] the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless [3] special circumstances would make an award unjust.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). The circuit court ruled that Hollowell did not substantially prevail in this action and that VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(i) <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u201c \u2018[Although the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019\u201d Department of Med.

The actual amount of an award of fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) remains, of course, within the \u201cbroad discretion afforded to the trial court ... based upon what is reasonable and just.\u201d <em>Beverly Healthcare of Fredericksburg, </em>268 Va. at 286 n. 3, 601 S.E.2d at 608 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">(ii) <em>Substantially Prevailing Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) does not define what is meant by its first requirement for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, i.e., that the contesting party must \u201csubstantially prevail[ ] on the merits,\u201d nor has the term been defined in any Virginia case law. Our Supreme Court has, however, defined the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the context of a party\u2019s entitlement to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under a contractual provision. In <em>Sheets v. Castle, </em>263 Va. 407, 559 S.E.2d 616 (2002), the Court, in reaching an interpretation of the term, said that \u201c[w]e need not go farther than <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>for its common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>meaning: \u2018A party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 559 S.E.2d at 620 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1145 (7th ed. 1999)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court went on to state that the prevailing party was thus <em>\u201c </em>\u2018the party in whose favor the decision or verdict in the case is or should be rendered and judgment entered, and in determining this question the general result should be considered, and inquiry made as to who has, in the view of the law, succeeded in the action.\u2019\u201d Id. at 414, 559 S.E.2d at 620 (quoting <em>Richmond v.

After reversing the judgment of the trial court on the merits of the underlying dispute, the Court set aside the award of attorney\u2019s fees. In doing so, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Court indicated that, with regard to the fee award under the statute, a \u201c \u2018prevailing party* \u201d should be equated with a \u201c \u2018successful party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 621 S.E.2d at 121 (quoting <em>Chase v.

Under the terms of the Act, we look to the order terminating the action to determine whether the plaintiff was \u2018successful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court thus concluded that the plaintiff consumer was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute because \u201c[t]he final judgment order in this case expressly state[d] that judgment [was] awarded to the defendant, DaimlerChrysler.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Finally, in <em>RF &amp; P Corp. v. Little, </em>247 Va. 309, 322-23, 440 S.E.2d 908, 917 (1994), the Court addressed the issue of whether the petitioner, Little, was entitled to a statutory award of attorney\u2019s fees as the \u201csubstantially prevailing]\u201d party under the terms of Code \u00a7 2.1-346 of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In affirming the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Little in his FOIA action against a holding company and its chairperson, the Court noted that its decision was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">not altered by the fact that Little did not prevail on each theory he advanced to the trial court. To obtain an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.1-346, Little was required to show that he substantially prevailed on the merits of the case, not that he prevailed on every issue he raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 323 n. 5, 440 S.E.2d at 917 n. 5. <em>See Commonwealth v.

To do so, Hollowell did not have to \u201cprevail ] on every issue he raised.\u201d <em>RF &amp; P Corp., </em>247 Va. at 323 n. 5, 440 S.E.2d at 917 n. 5. Rather, he was required to obtain a judgment in his favor on a significant issue in dispute. He did so by obtaining the trial court\u2019s order (i) setting aside a portion of 4 VAC 20-1140-20 as unlawful, in that, contrary to the authority given to VMRC in the enabling legislation, the regulation prohibited crab dredging indefinitely; and (ii) directing VMRC to amend the regulation so as to affect only a single crab dredging season\u2014which VMRC proceeded to do for the upcoming crab dredging season.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In holding Hollowell did not substantially prevail on the merits of this case, the circuit court made the same error VMRC made in arguing that the case became moot before the circuit court issued its April 3, 2009 decision on the merits. That is, the court erroneously focused on the fact that the 2008-2009 crab dredging season had passed at the time of its decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As discussed above, by definition, Hollowell\u2019s chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lenge to the lawfulness of 4 VAC 20-1140-20 in prohibiting crab dredging indefinitely was in no way limited to the 2008-2009 crab dredging season. It is true, as the circuit court observed, that had it ruled as early as January or February of 2009 and set aside the entire regulation, Hollowell and other watermen may have been able to utilize the last month or two of what would have been left of the 2008-2009 crab dredging season. But even if such an opportunity had arisen, it simply would have been an incidental benefit derived by the water-men from Hollowell\u2019s primary claim\u2014that 4 YAC 20-1140-20 was unlawful on its face. The nature of this claim was the same before and after the end of the 2008-2009 crab dredging season. Thus, the timing of the circuit court\u2019s decision did not alter the nature of the claim, upon which Hollowell ultimately prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The circuit court, therefore, erred as a matter of law in ruling that Hollowell did not substantially prevail in his challenge to the lawfulness of the regulation pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-215. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">(iii) <em>Justification of Agency\u2019s Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As with the first requirement under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, no definition is set forth in the statute for the second requirement, i.e., that the \u201cagency\u2019s position is not substantially justified.\u201d This Court has held that an agency\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the statute upon concluding that its \u201cposition was not unreasonable.\u201d <em>Jones v. West, </em>46 Va.App. 309, 333-34, 616 S.E.2d 790, 803 (2005). Looking to federal case law, we find additional guidance, as this same requirement or standard for justification of a governmental agency\u2019s position is used in the parallel federal fee-shifting statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), and there we find an established interpretation of this standard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>As recently explained in <em>United States v. Cox, </em>575 F.3d 352, 355 (4th Cir.2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">The government\u2019s position is substantially justified if it is \u201c \u2018justified in substance or in the main\u2019\u2014that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, [2550] 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). The government\u2019s position must be \u201cmore than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 566 [108 S.Ct. at 2550], and must instead have a \u201c \u2018reasonable basis both in law and fact,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 565 [108 S.Ct. at 2550].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Further, under this standard, the government \u201cmust demonstrate the reasonableness not only of its litigation position, but also of the agency\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, </em>353 F.3d 962, 967 (D.C.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Halverson v. Slater, </em>206 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.Cir.2000)). Of course, what is ultimately determined to be reasonable or unreasonable will be different in different circumstances. <em>Halverson, </em>206 F.3d at 1208 (holding that government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the EAJA).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Applying the above-stated interpretation to the second requirement of Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A), which is consistent with <em>Jones, </em>we conclude that VMRC\u2019s position was unreasonable, and thus not substantially justified, as a matter of law. We reach this conclusion because 4 YAC 20-1140-20, the regulation VMRC promulgated under the purported authority of Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D), and defended in circuit court, was \u201c \u2018manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marcus v. Shalala, </em>17 F.3d 1033, 1038 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 541, 110 S.Ct. 885, 897, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990)) (affirming award of attorney\u2019s fees under EAJA after plaintiffs successfully challenged regulations adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services governing eligibility for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>disability benefit programs under the Social Security Act); <em>cf. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd. v. Morgan, </em>38 Va.App. 665, 672, 568 S.E.2d 378, 381 (2002) (denying award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) where agency\u2019s construction of statute was, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csubstantially plausible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Extending back to 1910, through Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) and its predecessors, the General Assembly has established crab dredging seasons for a specified duration on a recurring annual basis. <em>See </em>Acts of the Virginia General Assembly 1910, Chapter 145 \u00a7 2086(13) (setting forth the crab dredging season established by the General Assembly for the first time). As the circuit court correctly determined, the authority delegated to VMRC to alter the established statutory time frame to engage in this pursuit\u2014whether by restricting or extending it\u2014is limited to \u201ca\u201d season. Indeed, the statute expressly states that, at most, VMRC \u201cmay close <em>a </em>season in its entirety.\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) (emphasis added). The legislature has expressly sought by this statute to strike a balance between \u201cpurposes relating to the conservation of the blue crab\u201d and the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It stands to reason, the circuit court went on to rightly conclude, that had the legislature \u201cintended to give the VMRC unlimited power to prohibit crab dredging for multiple seasons at a time without the necessity of further action or public hearings\u201d <em>(see </em>4 VAC 20-340-10 through 4 VAC 20-340-40, setting forth \u201cPublic Participation Guidelines\u201d applicable to VMRC\u2019s promulgation of new and amended regulations), it would have done so by using \u201cvery plain simple language\u201d to that effect. This means that VMRC could not have reasonably read the empowering provision of the statute to authorize it to promulgate a regulation prohibiting crab dredging indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The circuit court\u2019s reading of the scope of Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) is the same as ours and yet the court ruled that VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified when it considered Hollowell\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Our resolution of this issue nevertheless rests on the same reading of the statute\u2014that it sets forth clear parameters for VMRC\u2019s regulatory action limited to one crab dredging season at a time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In light of these limitations, VMRC knew or should have known that its action was in violation of the statute. Therefore, assertions of VMRC and the circuit court to the contrary notwithstanding, a review of the statute vis-a-vis the action taken by VMRC in promulgating 4 VAC 20-1140-20, and defending it in the face of Hollowell\u2019s challenge to the regulation, does not present a \u201cclose case\u201d such as to render VMRC\u2019s position substantially justified. We thus reject the proposition, as VMRC urges, that, \u201c \u2018although wrong, [VMRC\u2019s] position was not unreasonable\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jones, </em>46 Va.App. at 333-34, 616 S.E.2d at 803).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">As we said in <em>Beverly Healthcare of Fredericksburg, </em>41 Va.App. at 494, 585 S.E.2d at 871, \u201cthe \u2018mischief at which Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) is directed [in providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees] is the unjustified action of an agency.\u201d In promulgating and defending a regulation that prohibited crab dredging indefinitely, contrary to the clear limits of its legislative grant of authority, VMRC engaged in such mischief. VMRC\u2019s unlawful regulatory action, if not challenged in this case, would have, <em>inter alia, </em>enabled the agency to minimize its accountability to the public under its \u201cPublic Participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Guidelines,\u201d 4 VAC 20-340-10 <em>et seq., </em>which are triggered when VMRC promulgates a new or amended regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Accordingly, as to the second requirement for awarding attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A), the circuit court erred in ruling that VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">(iv) <em>Consideration of Special Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Finally, neither Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) nor any Virginia case law sets forth the kind of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that would make an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cunjust,\u201d under the terms of the third prong of the statute\u2019s three-part test. Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). We need not delve into that issue here, however, as VMRC presents no circumstances that would necessitate further consideration; nor did the circuit court find any such circumstances. VMRC merely restates its arguments that we have addressed above, and rejected, as the basis for asserting that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Hollowell would be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We thus conclude there are no special circumstances presented in this case that would make it unjust to award attorney\u2019s fees to Hollowell under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">For the above-stated reasons, we dismiss, as moot, Hollowell\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s decision to set aside only part of 4 VAC 20-1140-20. As to the remainder of Hollowell\u2019s appeal, we hold that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030, and remand this claim to the circuit court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\n<em>Dismissed, in part, and remanded, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. The remaining portion of 4 VAC 20-1140-20, consisting of subsection C, set forth several existing regulations \"pertaining] to the crab dredge fishery or activities associated with crab dredging,\u201d which were thereby repealed. As to the other two new regulations, 4 VAC 20-1140-10 stated the purpose of the regulations as follows: \"This chapter promotes conservation of the blue crab resource, especially female crabs that constitute mostly all of the crab dredge harvest. The provisions in this chapter are in response to the reduced abundance of the blue crab resource and its overexploitation, especially female crabs.\" The remaining regulation, 4 VAC 20-1140-30, set forth the penalties for violating the chapter: \u201cAs set forth in \u00a7 28.2-903 of the Code of Virginia, any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor, and a second or subsequent violation of any provision of this chapter committed by the same person within 12 months of a prior violation is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-11\">.

Accordingly, Hollowell requested in his petition that the circuit court: (1) find that the new regulations were unlawful; (2) find the regulations unenforceable; (3) enter a temporary injunction against enforcement of the regulations during the pendency of the appeal; and (4) enter a permanent injunction against enforcement of the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">.

Indeed, Hollowell\u2019s counsel conceded at oral argument that, due to the amendments to the regulation, the only remedy left for Hollowell to seek on appeal is reversal of the circuit court\u2019s denial of his request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">.

In asserting that VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified, the dissent misconstrues <em>Morgan, </em>38 Va.App. 665, 568 S.E.2d 378, by indicating this Court concluded in <em>Morgan </em>that the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board\u2019s position, though wrong, was substantially justified simply because its position \" \u2018had never been tested in court' \u201d (quoting <em>Morgan, </em>38 Va.App. at 672, 568 S.E.2d at 381). What we actually concluded in <em>Morgan </em>was that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the subject statute \"was substantially plausible and was based on the Board\u2019s longstanding practice, which had never been tested in court.... Consequently, Morgan [was] not entitled to attorney's fees for the proceedings in the trial court.\" <em>Id. </em>at 672, 568 S.E.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We further note that the determination as to whether an agency's position was substantially justified, for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030, cannot be based solely on the fact that its position had \"never been tested in court.\u201d Such a rule would mean that no matter how arbitrary and capricious an agency's position happened to be, attorney\u2019s fees could never be awarded when the position was challenged in court for the first time. Thus, as in the instant case, Hollowell was not barred from being awarded attorney\u2019s fees simply because he was the first litigant to challenge VMRC\u2019s interpretation of its enabling authority under Code \u00a7 28.2-707.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b139-11\">HUMPHREYS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that the issue of whether the circuit court erred in its decision not to set aside the entire regulation is now moot. However, because I disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>majority\u2019s conclusion that the circuit court erred in denying Hollowell\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, I respectfully dissent from the judgment and analysis of the majority with regard to that issue. While I agree with the majority that Hollowell substantially prevailed on the merits of his case, I believe VMRC\u2019s position was not unreasonable and thus, substantially justified. Therefore, I would affirm the circuit court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The heart of this appeal concerns VMRC\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to close the winter crab-dredging season. As expressly noted by the circuit court, the interpretation of Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) is an issue of first impression in Virginia. VMRC argued that Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) gave it the authority to close the winter crab-dredging season until such a closure is no longer justified by \u201cthe conservation of the blue crab.\u201d Although VMRC\u2019s interpretation of the statute was ultimately found to be incorrect, it was not so unreasonable as to warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees. As the circuit court noted in its denial of Hollowell\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO2\">[TJhis was a case of first impression. It involved statutory construction. It involved defining words and phrases and trying to glean intent and not only just for the statute, but also looking at the regulation as well. And I think VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified ... it was one that needed to work its way through the courts to a court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In my view, to hold as the majority implicitly does, that nonfiivolous issues of first impression cannot provide \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for an administrative appeal, frustrates the clear intent of the statute and conflicts with our own established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>precedent. <em>See Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd. v. Morgan, </em>38 Va.App. 665, 672, 568 S.E.2d 378, 381 (2002) (holding that the Board\u2019s position, although incorrect, was substantially justified as it \u201chad never been tested in court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Our rationale in <em>Morgan </em>is precisely the rationale used by the circuit court in this case. Nevertheless, in reversing the circuit court on this issue, the majority redefines the term \u201csubstantially justified\u201d from the meaning previously given it by this Court, and equates it to a federal statutory standard of \u201cmanifestly contrary to the statute,\u201d as adopted by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Marcus v. Shalala, </em>17 F.3d 1033, 1038 (7th Cir.1994). My problem with the majority\u2019s approach in this regard is that the award of attorney\u2019s fees in a state administrative appeal is not governed by federal law but by the application of a statutory test consistent with the precedent of both this Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia. To obtain an award of attorney\u2019s fees from an administrative agency in Virginia, Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) mandates the application of a three-part test. To succeed, a party must \u201csubstantially prevail on the merits,\u201d the agency\u2019s legal position must not be \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d and \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d must not make such an award unjust.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In my view, by equating the statutory term \u201csubstantially justified\u201d to the phrase \u201cmanifestly contrary to statute,\u201d the majority ignores our own precedent, which defines the term \u201csubstantially justified\u201d as the equivalent of the phrase \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Jones v. West, </em>46 Va.App. 309, 333-34, 616 S.E.2d 790, 803 (2005) (concluding that, although wrong, the Commissioner\u2019s position was not unreasonable and therefore \u201csubstantially justified\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>While the majority acknowledges the existence of <em>Morgan </em>and <em>West, </em>it ignores their particular relevance to the issue at hand and instead \u201cfinds additional guidance\u201d in federal cases interpreting the attorney\u2019s fees provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In so doing, the majority today effectively modifies, without any attempt to distinguish, our existing precedent and thereby creates a clear conflict in our own jurisprudence on this point. Furthermore, since it is axiomatic that no party should \u201csubstantially prevail\u201d whose position is \u201cmanifestly contrary to statute,\u201d the majority also effectively eliminates one component of the three-part statutory test for the award of attorney\u2019s fees, such that any party who \u201csubstantially prevails\u201d is now entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as a matter of law, so long as special circumstances do not make such an award unjust. Given the plain language of the statute, I do not believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the General Assembly intended such a result. Thus, I would honor our own existing precedent and affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. Code \u00a7 28.2-707(D) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It is unlawful to use a dredge for catching crabs between April 1 and December 1; however, the Commission, when in its judgment it is advisable due to weather conditions or for purposes relating to the conservation of the blue crab and it is not contrary to the public interest, may close a season in its entirety, may open any season as early as November 16, may delay opening any season, may extend any season until April 16 and may close any season early.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b141-5\">. Because I believe VMRC\u2019s position was substantially justified, I need not and do not address the issue of whether special circumstances would make an award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">. Moreover, and consistent with our holding in <em>West, </em>I note that the reasonableness of a party\u2019s legal position is also the test used by the United States Supreme Court in several different contexts for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. For example, in civil rights cases, the standard for the award of attorney\u2019s fees is whether a party's legal position is \"frivolous, <em>unreasonable, </em>or without foundation,\" <em>Christiansburg Gar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>ment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), while the standard for the award in a removal action is whether \u201cthe removing party lacked an <em>objectively reasonable </em>basis for seeking removal,\u201d <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 141, 126 S.Ct. 704, 711, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005) (emphasis added). Indeed, in construing the federal statute that the majority looks to for \"guidance,\u201d the Supreme Court has expressly noted that Congress did not want the \"substantially justified\u201d standard to \"be read to raise a presumption that the Government position was not substantially justified simply because it lost the case.\u201d <em>Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 415, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 1866, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b142-5\">. I hesitate to quibble with the majority\u2019s characterization of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 as a \"parallel federal statute,\u201d but while the Equal Access to Justice Act uses the term \"substantially justified,\u201d it does not mandate the award of attorney\u2019s fees as does Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). Rather, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 only permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the district court's discretion. This distinction is important because, as the Supreme Court of the United States has noted, the \"abuse of discretion\u201d standard of appellate review inherent in the federal statute permits deferential review to afford \"the district court the necessary flexibility to resolve questions involving \u2018multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization.\u2019 \u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 99, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (internal citations omitted). It seems to me that the very lack of such flexibility in Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) militates against the use of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 for \"guidance.\u201d Thus, and because I find our own precedent in this regard to be unambiguous and controlling with respect to this issue, I see no need to look elsewhere for \"guidance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
