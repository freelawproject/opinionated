Adcock, appellant, appeals an order entered July 8, 2009, denying his statute of limitations defense and awarding a judgment in favor of Mildred A. Houchens, appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $73,629.10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> principal and interest. On appeal, Adcock contends the trial court erred in ruling the statute of limitations did not bar the recovery of past due child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>support payments nor accrued interest. For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The facts relevant to this analysis are uncontested. The parties were divorced by decree of the Corporation Court of the City of Alexandria on October 20, 1966. In that decree, appellant was ordered to pay $30 per week child support for three minor children. Child support would continue \u201cuntil all such children attain their majorities or became otherwise emancipated or further decree of this court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s child support obligation terminated on June 24,1982, when the youngest child attained his majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On June 14, 2006, appellee applied for the services of the Division of Child Support Enforcement (hereafter DCSE) to enforce the October 20, 1966 child support order. DCSE, by motion filed July 7, 2008, moved the circuit court to establish arrearage and interest for unpaid child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment on February 20, 2009, arguing the statute of limitations barred recovery. After hearing evidence and argument, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against appellant for $73,629.10, finding the twenty-year statute of limitations did not bar enforcement of the 1966 child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Appellant contends the twenty-year statute of limitations set forth in Code \u00a7 8.01-251<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> bars appellee\u2019s enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the 1966 child support order. Appellee argues the twenty-year limitation only applies to a liquidated money judgment, not, as here, to an unliquidated ongoing support obligation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Appellant notes that Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">In any determination of support obligation under this section, the support obligation as it becomes due and unpaid creates a judgment by operation of law. Such judgment becomes a lien against real estate only when docketed in the county or city where such real estate is located. Nothing herein shall be construed to alter or amend the process of attachment of any lien on personal property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Appellant therefore concludes that because the child support order is a judgment, the twenty-year statute of limitations of Code \u00a7 8.01-251(A) bars enforcement of the 1966 child support order. He contends the twenty-year period began to run on June 24, 1982, when his youngest child reached the age of majority and his child support obligation ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, *we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Our inquiry, then, is whether the twenty-year statute of limitations of Code \u00a7 8.01-251(A) applies to an unliquidated, ongoing child support order, such as we have here, or if the statute is limited to a liquidated money judgment. Appellant contends there is no distinction for the purpose of Code \u00a7 8.01-251(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Appellee argues <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Social Services, 15 </em>Va.App. 135, 422 S.E.2d 458 (1992), controls. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In <em>Bennett, </em>we held the limitations under Code \u00a7 8.01-252<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did not apply to the enforcement of a New Jersey spousal support order under Code \u00a7 20-88.20 of the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 15 Va.App. at 147, 422 S.E.2d at 465. The New Jersey order was an ongoing, unliquidated support obligation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We noted the distinction between \u201csupport orders that adjudicate an ongoing, unliquidated spousal support obligation and those that adjudicate a sum certain or liquidated amount due and owing for spousal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 422 S.E.2d at 461. We further noted the distinction between a \u201csupport order,\u201d a \u201cjudgment,\u201d and a \u201cmoney judgment\u201d in a statute of limitations context. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 422 S.E.2d at 462. We concluded that the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 8.01-252 (now \u00a7 8.01-251) applies only to a \u201cjudgment for a sum certain or liquidated amount for spousal support rendered in another state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If, however, the ongoing unliquidated foreign support order was reduced to a liquidated amount in Virginia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>then the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 8.01-251 would govern. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 422 S.E.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><em>Bennett </em>made it abundantly clear that \u201cno time limitation is placed upon the obligee spouse within which to obtain a judgment for accumulated arrearages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 422 S.E.2d at 463. In fact, we stated \u201can obligee spouse under a Virginia spousal support order may delay for years without limit before seeking a judgment for arrearages accumulated under that order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Appellant argues the <em>Bennett </em>analysis, addressing the difference between an unliquidated support order and a liquidated money judgment, is <em>dicta. </em>We disagree. Rather, this distinction is essential to the central <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the opinion. <em>See Deiter v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 771, 775, 139 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1965) (noting that <em>dicta </em>is language that is \u201cnot responsive to the question presented and ... not necessary to a disposition of the case\u201d). Indeed, without the distinction between unliquidated and liquidated support judgments, this Court could not decide the applicability of the statute of limitations. Therefore, it is not <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appellant further attacks <em>Bennett, </em>contending we misapplied <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>14 Va.App. 642, 418 S.E.2d 900 (1992). Specifically, appellant points to language in <em>Bennett </em>that characterized the D.C. support order in the <em>Taylor </em>case as a \u201cliquidated\u201d support order. <em>Taylor </em>found that laches barred appellant\u2019s claim for support arrearages. 14 Va.App. at 648, 418 S.E.2d at 903. After discussing whether the Code \u00a7 8.01-252 statute of limitations barred enforcement of the foreign support order, this Court in <em>Taylor </em>concluded that the applicability of the statute of limitations is \u201cmooted by the trial court\u2019s invocation of the doctrine of laches ... a ruling we uphold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648-49, 418 S.E.2d at 904. Clearly, any analysis of the applicability of Code \u00a7 8.01-252 in <em>Taylor </em>is pure <em>dicta. </em>Thus, it is irrelevant in the <em>Bennett </em>analysis whether the D.C. support order was liquidated or unliquidated. The <em>Bennett </em>analysis of the statute of limitations is not based on <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>We also disagree with appellant\u2019s further efforts to distinguish <em>Bennett. </em>He posits that <em>Bennett </em>is based on New Jersey law, which provides that support payments do not vest and are subject to retroactive modification, unlike Virginia law. He also argues <em>Bennett </em>is limited to the enforcement of foreign judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The fact that New Jersey law may not vest support payments is unrelated to the <em>Bennett </em>analysis. It has no bearing on whether the support order is liquidated or unliquidated. The fact that in New Jersey a support order or arrearage may be modified does not alter the <em>Bennett </em>analysis. Appellant\u2019s argument is premised on the fact that the <em>Bennett </em>Court considered the New Jersey law on non-vesting. However, a review of <em>Bennett </em>refutes this premise. <em>Bennett </em>does not mention the New Jersey law of non-vesting. Thus, it could not have been a consideration in the <em>Bennett </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Further, <em>Bennett </em>has a much wider scope than appellant suggests. While the issue before us in <em>Bennett </em>was whether the ten-year statute of limitations (now twenty-year) of Code \u00a7 8.01-252 barred the enforcement in Virginia of a New Jersey support order under URESA, the analysis and decision have broader implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The discussion of the liquidated and unliquidated judgment, while in a URESA context, was not limited to a URESA proceeding. <em>Bennett </em>addressed the nature of Virginia spousal support orders. This Court acknowledged that the initial entry of a spousal support order \u201cestablishes the monetary amount of an ongoing support obligation. It is in that sense an order requiring the payment of money and is a judgment embraced within the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-426.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>15 Va.App. at 141, 422 S.E.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">However, we opined an ongoing support order \u201cis not, and cannot be, a judgment for a sum certain or liquidated amount of money. Time and circumstances of the parties will determine ultimately the total amount to be paid under an initial, or subsequently modified, spousal support order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, our analysis of the distinction between an ongoing, unliquidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>support order and a liquidated money judgment under Virginia law transcends a URESA proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Appellant contends a support judgment does not have to be reduced to a liquidated amount for enforcement procedures to be initiated. Appellant refers to DCSE\u2019s collection of $6,507.57 in arrearage prior to the entry of the liquidated judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, reasons appellant, an ongoing unliquidated support order is enforceable upon entry of that order. We acknowledge that under Title 19, Child Support Enforcement, Code \u00a7 63.2-1900 <em>et seq., </em>DCSE can enforce support orders without having the amount due reduced to a sum certain. However, the statutory authority to do so does not alter the clear mandate of <em>Bennett, </em>as previously discussed, as it relates to the statute of limitations. Appellant\u2019s argument addresses whether <em>Bennett </em>was decided correctly. While we believe it was, we are bound by that decision. <em>See Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003) (discussing that a \u201cdecision of one panel \u2018becomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis\u2019 </em>and cannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">While <em>Bennett </em>addresses spousal support, we see no principled reason why the analysis does not apply to child support. Rather, logic suggests that the analysis would apply to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-458, creating a lien on real estate by a support order, makes no distinction between child and spousal support. Rather, it addresses the implications of \u201cany judgment for money rendered in this Commonwealth by any state or federal court or by confession of judgment.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 addresses child and spousal support together, and subsection (c), creating a judgment for due and unpaid support, encompasses both spousal and child support, drawing no distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>between them. Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1900 through 63.2-1960 authorize the DCSE to enforce child support and spousal support under certain circumstances. Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-88.32 through 20-88.82, the UIFSA, provides for the enforcement of both foreign child and spousal support orders. Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.2-531, compensation benefits are subject to spousal and child support claims. Thus, it is clear that both the legislature and this Court intended, for enforcement purposes, to equate child support with spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The dissent acknowledges that <em>Bennett </em>controls this case, but opines that the principles of <em>Bennett </em>\u201cdo not necessarily dictate the result reached by the majority.\u201d The dissent then attempts to distinguish <em>Bennett. </em>However, the dissent\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Bennett </em>is based on two faulty premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The dissent contends first, that child support and spousal support orders lead to different statute of limitations analyses, and second, that emancipation of the child converts an unliquidated child support order to a fixed sum certain. The dissent attempts to distinguish <em>Bennett </em>primarily because it addresses an ongoing spousal support award and not child support that has terminated by operation of law. The dissent therefore concludes that while the ongoing award is unliquidated, the child support award becomes fixed and ascertainable when it terminates by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The dissent attempts to differentiate spousal support and child support because \u201cthere is a significant fundamental difference\u201d as to when spousal support and child support terminate by operation of law. The dissent contends that child support terminates when the child attains the age of majority. However, at some point, both child support and spousal support terminate and cease to be an \u201congoing\u201d award. Spousal support terminates by operation of law when either party dies or the obligee remarries. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-109. Further, it is important to note that under certain circumstances, child support does not necessarily terminate upon the age of majority; for example, if the child is severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and permanently mentally or physically disabled, or if the child is a full-time high school student and under the age of nineteen. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Finally, the dissent concludes that emancipation automatically converts any child support arrearage from an unliquidated, ongoing order to a fixed and ascertainable sum certain. Thus, it concludes, the statute of limitations begins to run when the arrearage is fixed and ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The dissent takes the <em>Bennett </em>language, \u201ca judgment for a sum certain or liquidated amount\u201d out of context. <em>Bennett, </em>in analyzing when the statute of limitations begins to run, clearly speaks of a liquidated judgment. We noted the distinction between \u201csupport orders that adjudicate an ongoing unliquidated spousal support obligation and those that adjudicate a sum certain or liquidated amount due and owing.\u201d The dissent ignores this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We, therefore, reject the dissent\u2019s equating \u201cascertainable\u201d with \u201cliquidated.\u201d They are two distinct concepts. To \u201cascertain\u201d is \u201cto discover through examination or experimentation; find out\u201d or \u201cto make certain and definite.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, New College Edition </em>76 (1982). A \u201csum certain\u201d is defined as \u201cany amount that is fixed, settled, or exact.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1573 (9th ed. 2009). The latter is the same as a liquidated amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">We must, then, inquire how emancipation of a child instantly converts an undetermined amount of arrearage to a fixed amount, one that is exact, without further court intervention. The fact that child support is no longer \u201congoing\u201d does not \u201cfix\u201d the amount due. The dissent concludes that upon emancipation, any arrearage due is a \u201csum certain\u201d because it can be readily computed. While the amount may be \u201creadily computed,\u201d it does not follow that the sum is fixed. The amount becomes a \u201csum certain\u201d only when the trial court enters an order liquidating the obligation. The <em>Bennett </em>analysis, again, is premised on a fixed or liquidated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The dissent further maintains an ongoing support order cannot be liquidated because future payments are still owed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>To the contrary, courts routinely determine the amount of arrearage for ongoing support payments. Evidence is produced, and the court enters judgment for a sum certain. The amount of any award is always ascertainable, whether \u201congoing\u201d or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In summary, we conclude that the twenty-year statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 8.01-251 only applies to a liquidated money judgment. In this case, the child support order was ongoing, rather than a liquidated money judgment. Therefore, the statute of limitations provided in Code \u00a7 8.01-251 does not bar enforcement of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The trial court properly ruled that the statute of limitations did not bar the recovery of past due child support payments and accrued interest. Finding no error, we therefore affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-12\">.

Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 135, 422 S.E.2d 458 (1992), the majority \u201cconclude[s] that the twenty-year statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 8.01-251 [to bring an \u2018action ... on a judgment\u2019] only applies to a liquidated money judgment.\u201d Thus, because the spousal support decree in <em>Bennett </em>established an award that was ongoing and continued to accumulate periodically until the wife or obligor spouse died or remarried and further was subject to modification by the trial court, the amount due was unliquidated until such time that an arrearage had been determined. Accordingly, the majority reasons, that like the situation in <em>Bennett, </em>where, as here, the child support arrearage had not been reduced to a money judgment, the amount of child support owed by appellant was an \u201cunliquidated, ongoing child support order,\u201d and, therefore, the Code \u00a7 8.01-251 twenty-year statute of limitations likewise does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>While I agree with the majority that our holding in <em>Bennett </em>contains the principles that govern resolution of this case, in my view, those precepts do not necessarily dictate the result reached by the majority. Because there is a significant fundamental difference as to the ongoing unliquidated support order in <em>Bennett </em>and a child support obligation that terminated and became fixed by operation of law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that difference allows for and dictates a different result, in my opinion. Where I differ from the majority is the legal impact that the youngest child\u2019s emancipation, or any other support obligation that is terminated and becomes fixed by operation of law, had on appellant\u2019s child support obligation. Also, I disagree that no principled reason exists to treat a fixed child support obligation different from an ongoing, unliquidated spousal support obligation. In my view, the youngest child having attained the age of majority converted the arrearages, by operation of law, from an \u201cunliquidated, ongoing child support order\u201d to a fixed and ascertainable sum certain. Thus, because that sum certain was due, payable, ascertainable, and not modifiable as of June 24, 1982, I would hold the twenty-year limitation of Code \u00a7 8.01-251(A) bars DCSE\u2019s claim to recover the past due child support obligations and accumulated interest on behalf of the 42-year-old youngest child. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Initially, I acknowledge that child support \u201cpayments are fixed according to the needs of the child or children,\u201d <em>Fearon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>v.

However, \u201c[statutes of limitations are designed to insure fairness to defendants by preventing the revival of stale claims in which the defense is hampered by lost evidence, faded memories, and disappearing witnesses, and to avoid unfair surprise.\u201d <em>Johnson v.

Indeed, without limitations on actions, defendants could find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous plaintiffs who hoard evidence that supports their position while waiting for their prospective opponents to discard evidence that would help make a defense. In light of the policy that surrounds statutes of limitations, the bar of such statutes should not be lifted unless the legislature makes unmistakably clear that such is to occur in a given case. Where there exists any doubt, it should be resolved in favor of the operation of the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>Thus, courts are obligated to enforce statutes of limitation strictly and to construe any exception thereto narrowly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><em>Westminster Investing Corp. v. Lamps Unlimited, </em>237 Va. 543, 547, 379 S.E.2d 316, 318 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Different jurisdictions have juxtaposed these competing principles in various ways where child support is at issue to accommodate the needs of the child as well as the fairness to the obligor parent. Some states allow \u201cthe statute of limitations ... to run as against each installment that becomes due,\u201d others \u201cprovide that such a limitations period does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>begin to ran until the child becomes of age and the duty to support has come to an end,\u201d or, \u201cwhere there has been a judgment for arrearages, when the judgment was entered.\u201d 24A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>\u00a7 980 (2008) (citing cases). Still others have held \u201cproceedings to enforce alimony and child support orders are equitable proceedings that are not barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Brumby v. Brumby, </em>647 So.2d 330, 331 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994). Here, the majority holds based upon <em>Bennett, </em>that as to the spousal support obligation the twenty-year statute of limitations period begins to ran only upon the entry of a liquidated money judgment establishing the arrearages. While <em>Bennett </em>provides significant instruction as to how Virginia courts are to treat support obligations in light of Code \u00a7 8.01-251,1 believe that different factors come into play with the support obligation <em>in this case </em>and the <em>Bennett </em>decision does not preclude the statute of limitations period from beginning to run upon the emancipation of the child as well as when a money judgment for arrearages is entered either as to spousal or child support.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The primary issue in <em>Bennett </em>was whether to apply the statute of limitations to a spousal support order whose final obligation remained uncertain so long as ongoing future periodic payments will continue to accrue. Under the facts presented to the <em>Bennett </em>panel, a spousal support order could take on two forms: (1) an \u201congoing, unliquidated spousal support obligation [or (2) ] one that adjudicates a sum certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>or liquidated amount due and owing.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>15 Va.App. at 140, 422 S.E.2d at 461. <em>Bennett, </em>dealing with spousal support rather than child support, had no reason to contemplate or address a third scenario, which we have in the instant case, where a child support decree ceases to be \u201congoing\u201d by operation of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When considering a child support order, a \u201c\u2018parent has the legal obligation to support his [or her] children <em>only during their </em>minority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goldin v. Goldin, </em>34 Va.App. 95, 103, 538 S.E.2d 326, 330 (2000) (quoting <em>Cutshaw v. Cutshaw, </em>220 Va. 638, 641, 261 S.E.2d 52, 54 (1979)) (emphasis added). Unless otherwise provided,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the jurisdiction of the divorce court to provide for a child\u2019s support and maintenance terminates once the child reaches the age of majority. <em>Eaton v. Eaton, </em>215 Va. 824, 827, 213 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1975). Accordingly, a support obligation that terminates upon the emancipation of a child is no longer an \u201congoing\u201d obligation because the obligee parent does not continue to accrue payments due to him or her under the support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Once the support obligation ceases it is no longer \u201congoing,\u201d but in order for the statute of limitations to begin to run the amount owed must also be \u201cliquidated.\u201d The majority mistakenly reads <em>Bennett, </em>in my opinion, to say that a liquidated amount can only be rendered by a judgment for arrearages calculated and rendered by the court. We explicitly held in <em>Bennett </em>that \u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-252 [now Code \u00a7 8.01-251] embraces an order for a sum certain <em>or </em>liquidated amount for spousal [or child] support.\u201d 15 Va.App. at 142, 422 S.E.2d at 462 (emphasis added). In addition to a judgment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>arrearage, which may be entered periodically as arrearages accrue, a \u201csum certain\u201d of support due and owing also falls under the mandate of Code \u00a7 8.01-251 and the twenty-year limitation period. An ongoing support order cannot be \u201cliquidated\u201d because future payments are still owed, and the possibility exists that a court may modify the amount of future payments. <em>See Cofer v. Cofer, </em>205 Va. 834, 140 S.E.2d 663 (1965) (permitting the trial court to modify future support payments). Thus, so long as the obligor parent continues to owe periodic support payments, the total amount due \u201ccannot be determined by a fixed formula\u201d even though the court may determine and enter a judgment for arrearages due at the time. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>419 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cunliquidated damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">However, once the child attains the age of majority, the \u201c[t]ime and circumstances of the parties [have] determine[d] ultimately the total amount to be paid under [the] ... support order.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>15 Va.App. at 141, 422 S.E.2d at 462. The support obligation is then a \u201csum certain\u201d since the entire final amount of the obligation can be \u201creadily computed, based on an agreement\u2019s terms [or the support award].\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 949. It is well settled that \u201c[n]o support order may be retroactively modified.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>see Riggins v. O\u2019Brien, </em>263 Va. 444, 447, 559 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002). Furthermore, payments due under a support order vest once they become due and cannot be modified. Once the child reaches the age of majority, the obligor parent owes no further payments under the support order and the amount owed is a sum certain due and payable. Accordingly, I believe that because the support obligation became a \u201csum certain\u201d when the child was emancipated, the <em>Bennett </em>rationale for not applying the statute of limitations to an ongoing unliquidated support order was obviated. I thus would hold the statute of limitations \u2018\u201cwould not begin to run until such time as the [arrearage] was reduced to a lump sum payment or <em>until emancipation of the child, whichever was the former.\u2019\u201d Harvey v. McGuire, </em>635 S.W.2d 8, 9 (Ky.Ct.App.1982) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Schmidt v. Forehan, </em>549 S.W.2d 320, 323 (Ky.Ct.App.1977)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In summary, I believe the majority\u2019s characterization of appellant\u2019s obligation under the 1966 child support order as \u201can unliquidated, ongoing child support order\u201d is inaccurate since the amount was a sum certain by operation of law when the child became emancipated. Appellant\u2019s support obligation was not \u201congoing\u201d because, as the majority concedes, appellant was no longer required under the 1966 decree to pay child support as of June 24, 1982, when the youngest child attained the age of majority. Further, it cannot be said appellant\u2019s obligation is \u201cunliquidated.\u201d Because appellant owed no more payments after June 24, 1982, and all previous payments were not subject to modification, appellant\u2019s obligation under the support order was a sum certain or became a liquidated amount\u2014that is \u201ca figure readily computed, based on an agreement\u2019s terms [or the court\u2019s award].\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 949. Accordingly, in my view, the statute of limitations should have begun to run on June 24, 1982. DCSE did not file its petition to enforce the 1966 child support order until July 7, 2008. Therefore, I would hold that the twenty-year limitation under Code \u00a7 8.01-251 barred recovery of all arrearages as of June 24,1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Finally, I observe that by allowing the statute of limitations to begin to run upon the emancipation of the minor child would not, in a very significant respect, treat child support payments differently from spousal support payments. Indeed, unless otherwise indicated in the support order, both child and spousal support automatically cease by operation of law upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109, a spousal support obligation \u201cshall terminate upon the death of either party or remarriage of the spouse receiving support,\u201d and similarly child support ceases upon the child reaching the age of majority except when the child is disabled or until he or she finishes high school. In my view, our holding in <em>Bennett </em>would not permit a spouse who has remarried to collect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>spousal support arrearages more than twenty years after having remarried.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>. </em>Notably, and in contrast to the facts in <em>Bennett, </em>a spousal support obligation becomes fixed and ascertainable as a sum certain when either the obligee spouse remarries or either spouse dies, Code \u00a7 20-109, and, in my view, the statutory bar of Code \u00a7 8.01-251 would prohibit any action to recover those past due amounts after twenty years from the date that the sum certain became fixed and ascertainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. I agree with the majority that under <em>Bennett, </em>of which I was a panel member, \"our analysis of the distinction between an ongoing, unliquidated support order and a liquidated money judgment under Virginia law transcends a URESA proceeding.\u201d Further, the majority correctly holds it is inconsequential for the present determination that the facts in <em>Bennett </em>involved another state\u2019s law where support payments do not vest immediately upon becoming due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b395-5\">. We need not address the propriety of the other options, as we have rejected creating a new statute of limitations period for each individual support payment as it vests and becomes due. <em>Bennett, </em>15 Va.App. at 144, 422 S.E.2d at 463 (\"Because of the ongoing nature of a spousal support order, no time limitation is placed upon the obligee spouse within which to obtain a judgment for accumulated arrearages.\u201d). On the other hand, we have recognized situations where the statute of limitations applies to support payments. <em>See Carter, </em>232 Va. at 173, 349 S.E.2d at 99 (applying the ten-year statute of limitations period to a lump sum foreign spousal support); <em>Sheffield v. Sheffield, </em>207 Va. 288, 292, 148 S.E.2d 771, 774 (1966) (\"The entry of judgment for accrued arrearages is generally recognized as a method of enforcing payment of the amount due.\u201d); <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>14 Va.App. 642, 648, 418 S.E.2d 900, 903-04 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b396-5\">. It would have been inappropriate to do so in that case because the wife filed her URESA petition less than ten years after she remarried. Thus, the termination of the spousal support obligation by operation of law did not fall under the purview of the statute of limitations period. <em>See Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (\u201c \u2018[C]ourts are not constituted ... to render advisory opinions ... or to answer inquiries which are merely speculative.' \" (quoting <em>City of Fairfax v. Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229-30, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1964))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.2 (extending a child support obligation for a disabled child or until the child finishes high school).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b399-18\">. As I understand the majority\u2019s construction and application of the <em>Bennett </em>holding, had she not sought a judgment for arrearages and had remarried, she could nevertheless seek to enforce the support obligation and collect the arrearage even after twenty years from having remarried.
