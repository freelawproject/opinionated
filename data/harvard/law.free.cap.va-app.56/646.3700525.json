On appeal, Joyce contends the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress, admitting into evidence a prior conviction order and a report obtained from the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN), and finding the evidence proved his prior convictions. In our opinion, the trial court did not err in any of these respects. We thus affirm Joyce\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 288 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). We apply the same standard when reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In February 2008, Norfolk police conducted surveillance in the 600 block of Liberty Street, an area of the city with a notorious reputation for being \u201cinfested with narcotics.\u201d Based on the officers\u2019 prior experience, they set up a surveillance post opposite a Shop \u2018N Go convenience store. As one officer explained, \u201cthere\u2019s always drug activity going on at the side of the Shop \u2018N Go.\u201d The officer had made about thirty narcotics arrests in the general area, many involving firearms. For this reason, the management of the store posted no trespassing signs on the side of the building. The store management also filed a letter with the police department requesting enforcement of its trespassing ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">During the surveillance, the officer observed Joyce walk up to the side of the Shop \u2018N Go convenience store. The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">Q: Specifically with regard to the side of the building that you saw the defendant standing on, was there a no-trespassing sign at that location?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">A: He was <em>standing right under a no-trespassing sign, </em>yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Q: You said standing right under. Approximately how far away was the no-trespassing sign from the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">A: Where he was standing, <em>it was actually above him. </em>Posted above him was a white sign with red letters that said: \u201cNo trespassing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">(Emphasis added.) Joyce did not go in or out of the store. Nor did he attempt to do so. There were no doors at the side of the store and, thus, no reason for any customer to loiter there. Shortly after Joyce\u2019s arrival, the officer watched another male approach Joyce. After the two men conducted a hand-to-hand transaction, they left the convenience store traveling in opposite directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Having witnessed Joyce trespassing, and suspecting him of also making a drug transaction, the officer pulled up next to Joyce as he rode his bicycle away from the convenience store. \u201cHey, can I talk to you for a second,\u201d the officer asked. \u2018Tes,\u201d Joyce replied. The officer asked him what he was doing at the side of the convenience store. Joyce answered, \u201cjust buying blunts.\u201d Joyce could not, however, provide a receipt for the purchase. The officer asked for Joyce\u2019s consent to search him for weapons. Joyce agreed. As the officer began the search, Joyce twice pulled his hand out of the officer\u2019s grasp and reached toward his waistband. Fearing Joyce was reaching for a weapon, the officer searched Joyce\u2019s crotch area and discovered instead a bag containing fifty-seven capsules of suspected heroin packaged in five or six bundles. The officer placed Joyce under arrest for trespassing. The Commonwealth later indicted Joyce for possession of heroin with intent to distribute, third or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Prior to trial, Joyce filed a motion to suppress seeking to exclude from evidence the recovered heroin. Joyce claimed the officer did not have probable cause to arrest him for trespassing or to search him incident to that arrest. Without addressing whether the search was consensual, the trial court denied the motion holding the circumstances provided probable cause for the officer to arrest Joyce for trespassing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>side of the convenience store. Thus, the search incident to that arrest (albeit immediately preceding it) was entirely valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">At trial, the Commonwealth offered two orders into evidence showing Joyce had twice been convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Joyce objected to one of the orders, a Norfolk Circuit Court order from 1992, claiming it was irrelevant because it did not identify him as the defendant. In reply, the Commonwealth sought to introduce a VCIN report proving the defendant named in the 1992 order was one of Joyce\u2019s many aliases. Joyce objected claiming the VCIN report should be excluded as hearsay. The trial court sustained the objection \u201cat this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Later in the trial, a Norfolk police investigator testified about the use of VCIN reports by law enforcement and explained they were routinely and regularly relied upon by police officers. Citing <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986), the Commonwealth again sought to introduce the VCIN report into evidence for the limited purpose of proving the name of the defendant on the 1992 conviction order matched an alias Joyce had previously used. Joyce again objected. The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the VCIN report for the purpose offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Sitting as factfinder, the trial court found the evidence proved Joyce possessed heroin with intent to distribute. On appeal, Joyce argues the court erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress, admitting into evidence his prior convictions and a VCIN report, and finding the evidence proved his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">A <em>Search Incident to Arrest for Trespassing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Though the ultimate question whether an officer violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>appellate scrutiny, \u201cwe defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u2018historical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 105, 582 S.E.2d 448, 449-50 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (recognizing that this standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers\u201d (citation omitted)). In addition, when afiirming a suppression decision, we \u201cconsider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Testa v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 279, 685 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Under the Fourth Amendment, \u201c[w]hen officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime in their presence, the Fourth Amendment permits them to make an arrest, and to search the suspect in order to safeguard evidence and ensure their own safety.\u201d <em>Virginia v. Moore, </em>553 U.S. 164, 178, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008), <em>rev\u2019g, </em>272 Va. 717, 636 S.E.2d 395 (2006). Consequently, the \u201cstandards traditionally governing a search incident to lawful arrest are not, therefore, commuted to the stricter <em>Terry </em>standards by the absence of probable fruits or further evidence of the particular crime for which the arrest is made.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 234, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Because a legally justifiable arrest is itself a \u201creasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d it follows that \u201ca search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In addition, when \u201cthe formal arrest follow[s] quickly on the heels of the challenged search,\u201d it is not \u201cparticularly important that the search preceded the arrest rather than vice versa,\u201d <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 2564, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980), \u201cso long as probable cause existed at the time of the search,\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 108, 582 S.E.2d at 451. A constitutionally permissible search incident to arrest \u201cmay be conducted by an officer <em>either before or after </em>the arrest.\u201d <em>Italiano v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 334, 336, 200 S.E.2d 526, 528 (1973) (emphasis in original). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>It does not matter whether the search occurs \u201cat the moment the arresting officer takes the suspect into custody or when he announces that the suspect is under arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 200 S.E.2d at 528 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">When the probable cause for an arrest exists independently of what the search produces, the fact that the search precedes the formal arrest is immaterial when the search and arrest are nearly simultaneous and constitute for all practical purposes but one transaction. To hold differently would be to allow a technical formality of time to control when there has been no real interference with the substantive rights of a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 337, 200 S.E.2d at 528-29 (citation omitted); <em>see also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 414, 418 n. 1, 620 S.E.2d 760, 762 n. 1 (2005) (finding it inconsequential that the officer searched the suspect \u201cbefore officially arresting him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In this case, we need not address whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe Joyce was armed and dangerous for purposes of a <em>Terry </em>frisk if\u2014as the trial court found\u2014the officer had probable cause to arrest Joyce for trespassing prior to his search. \u201cIf an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.\u201d <em>Atwater v. Lago Vista, </em>532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 1557, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001). The power to arrest is invariably coupled with the power to search incident to arrest. <em>Moore, </em>553 U.S. at 178, 128 S.Ct. at 1608. We thus turn to the question whether the officer had probable cause to arrest Joyce for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">As the United States Supreme Court has recently emphasized, the \u201cvery phrase \u2018probable cause\u2019 confirms that the Fourth Amendment does not demand all possible precision.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 695, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). We thus employ a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d not a \u201chypertechnieal, rigid, and legalistic analysis\u201d when reviewing probable cause determinations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242Va. 413, 421, 410 S.E.2d 662, 666 (1991). The standard is not calibrated to \u201cdeal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 106, 582 S.E.2d at 450 (citation omitted). Nor does it \u201cdemand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (plurality)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u201cFinely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the probable-cause decision.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 371, 124 S.Ct. 795, 800, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (citation and internal brackets omitted). Not even a \u201cprima facie showing\u201d of criminality is required. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2330, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, probable cause \u201crequires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, <em>not an actual showing of such activity.\u201d Id. </em>at 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 n. 13 (emphasis added). \u201cThe Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested.\u201d <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). As we explained in <em>Slayton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201cThe substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt. And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.\u201d <em>Brinegar v.

Waters, </em>81 F.3d 429, 434 (4th Cir.1996)). Unlike a factfinder at trial, \u201creasonable law officers need not \u2018resolve every doubt about a suspect\u2019s guilt before probable cause is established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Torchinsky v. Siwinski, </em>942 F.2d 257, 260 (4th Cir.1991)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 107, 582 S.E.2d at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Consistent with these principles, the trial court correctly held the factual circumstances of this case justified the arresting officer\u2019s belief that Joyce was trespassing at the side of the convenience store. \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-119 criminalizes trespass by those who go on the property of another \u201cwithout authority of law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after \u2018having been forbidden to do so\u2019 by a lawful possessor.\u201d <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 577, 582, 652 S.E.2d 144, 147 (2007) <em>(en </em>bane). The warning can be by \u201ca sign or signs\u201d posted by the lawful possessor. Code \u00a7 18.2-119. Joyce loitered at the side of the convenience store in an area clearly marked \u201cno trespassing.\u201d There were no doors on that side of the store. While the officer saw Joyce approach the side of the convenience store from a parallel street, he never observed Joyce attempt to enter or exit the store. Nor did Joyce\u2019s actions suggest he intended to do so. Joyce had no legitimate reason for entering the no-trespassing area and engaging in a suspicious hand-to-hand transaction with another trespasser certainly did not give him one.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The convenience store expressly requested the police department to enforce the store\u2019s no-trespassing policy, no doubt to discourage exactly what Joyce was doing. To be sure, the store could do little more to protect its interests than what it did\u2014post a no-trespassing sign and request police enforcement. By arresting Joyce, the police officer was simply doing what he was sent there to do\u2014enforce the no-trespassing statute against loiterers who have no legitimate business on the convenience store\u2019s property. The trial court, therefore, did not err when it denied Joyce\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>B. <em>Admission of 1992 Conviction &amp; VCIN Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Joyce contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the 1992 order because it convicted a defendant named \u201cLamont Joyce\u201d with a birth date of October 9, 1971. Joyce does not affirmatively claim he is not the individual listed on the conviction and sentencing order. Instead, he argues the Commonwealth failed to prove he used this name as an alias. Thus, he concludes, the 1992 order was both irrelevant and immaterial and should not have been admitted into evidence for purposes of establishing the second predicate offense for the recidivism provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We agree with Joyce\u2019s logic but not his conclusion. The 1992 order would be irrelevant absent evidence that it convicted Joyce, not someone else with a similar name. The trial court, however, admitted into evidence a VCIN report on Joyce that specifically stated he used \u201cLamont Joyce\u201d as an alias. The VCIN report also indicated multiple birth dates and social security numbers Joyce had previously used. Joyce concedes on appeal the VCIN report\u2014if admissible\u2014would establish an evidentiary link between the 1992 order and him. Oral Argument at 11:19. He nonetheless contends the VCIN report is inadmissible because the Commonwealth failed to lay a satisfactory foundation for admitting it as a business record under <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In <em>Frye, </em>a defendant found guilty of capital murder argued that the admission of a report from the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) violated the hearsay rule. <em>See Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 567-68, 680 S.E.2d 361, 365-66 (2009) (summarizing <em>Frye </em>analysis). The NCIC report stated \u201cFrye was wanted for escape from a West Virginia correctional facility,\u201d a fact relevant to the murder charge. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 680 S.E.2d 361, 680 S.E.2d at 365-66. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>There was no dispute that an official acting within his authority made the report entry. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 680 S.E.2d at 366. A West Virginia prison official testified that an escape warrant had been filed with the NCIC, thus generating the statement in an NCIC report identifying the defendant as an escapee. <em>Id. </em>The trial court admitted the NCIC report into evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Applying the \u201cbusiness records exception\u201d to the hearsay rule, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>This exception, <em>Frye </em>acknowledged, \u201cgenerally limits admission of such evidence to facts or events within the personal knowledge and observation of the recording official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal brackets omitted). In <em>Frye, </em>however, there was no evidence the prison official had personal knowledge that the defendant escaped from the West Virginia prison. As we emphasized in <em>Cooper, </em>54 Va.App. at 567-68, 680 S.E.2d at 366, <em>Frye </em>nevertheless pointed out that the personal knowledge limitation must sometimes yield to practical necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">In certain cases, where verification of the recorded facts is not possible through the personal knowledge of the record keeper, <em>practical necessity nevertheless requires admission of recorded evidence which has a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness; </em>this guarantee is provided where evidence shows the regularity of the preparation of the records and reliance on them by their preparers or those for whom they are prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"><em>Frye, </em>231 Va. at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 279-80 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The next sentence of <em>Frye </em>held: \u201cThe NCIC printout, <em>therefore, </em>also comes within the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 280 (emphasis added). That conclusion, <em>Frye </em>added, was particularly true given the fact that \u201crecords of the NCIC are routinely used and relied on by the Virginia State Police in the regular course of business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the foundation requirement for <em>Frye </em>does not require personal knowledge of the record keeper. It is enough that the circumstances demonstrate trustworthiness by showing \u201cthe regularity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>preparation of the records and reliance on them by ... those for whom they are prepared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Whether an adequate foundation has been laid for a hearsay exception involves an exercise of discretion by the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Abney v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 337, 347, 657 S.E.2d 796, 801 (2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not review foundation issues <em>de novo </em>but rather under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>See generally Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 285, 322 S.E.2d 216, 223 (1984) (\u201cWhether the foundation is sufficient is a question within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d). \u201cOnly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (quoting in parenthetical <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding an adequate foundation existed for the admission of the VCIN report just as it did for the admission of the NCIC report in <em>Frye. </em>The police investigator testified he used VCIN reports \u201cevery day\u201d in the performance of his duties as a police officer. Officers routinely use these reports, he added, for running warrant checks, investigating driver\u2019s licenses, and retrieving the criminal histories of arrestees.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The police investigator\u2019s testimony exactly parallels the statutory scheme governing VCIN reports. Information regarding convictions in Virginia must be electronically reported to the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE), a section of the Virginia Department of State Police. <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-387 to 19.2-392.02. By statute, an \u201c[electronic report\u201d to the CCRE must include among other things \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>name of the person convicted and all aliases\u201d which he is known to have used. Code \u00a7 19.2-390. The Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) provides the electronic network of \u201cinformation systems,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-390(B), for state and local criminal justice agencies to obtain arrest and conviction information maintained by the CCRE. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 52-12 to 52-15, 19.2-389(A)(1). It necessarily follows that VCIN reports, like NCIC reports, \u201care routinely used and relied on by the Virginia State Police in the regular course of business.\u201d <em>Frye, </em>231 Va. at 387, 345 S.E.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">C. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004) (citation omitted). \u201cIf reasonable jurists could disagree about the probative force of the facts, we have no authority to substitute our views for those of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 180, 186, 571 S.E.2d 906, 909 (2002). This deferential standard \u201capplies not only to the historical facts themselves, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>but the inferences from those facts as well.\u201d <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). Thus, a factfinder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citations omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur\u201d Thomas, </em>48 Va.App. at 608, 633 S.E.2d at 231 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In this case, Joyce challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for possession of heroin, third or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C). The second offense, triggering the recidivism penalty for the instant offense, was the 1992 conviction. Even with the admission of the VCIN report, Joyce argues, the trial court had insufficient evidence to conclude the 1992 order identified him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The 1992 order, entered by Norfolk Circuit Court on February 25, 1992, convicted and sentenced \u201cLamont Joyce\u201d of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (as well as illegal possession of a firearm and, ironically, use of an assumed false name). It identifies the date of offense (abbreviated \u201cDOO\u201d) as September 27,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The VCIN report identifies one of Joyce\u2019s alias names as \u201cLamont Joyce\u201d and lists a host of different birth dates and social security numbers. The VCIN report indicates Joyce was convicted and sentenced by the Norfolk Circuit Court on February 25, 1992, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, with an offense date of September 27,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The VCIN report also identifies <em>another </em>order, entered by the Norfolk Circuit Court on June 10, 2005, finding Joyce guilty of a drug offense with an offense date of March 5, 2004. This matches exactly the 2005 conviction and sentencing order admitted into evidence (without objection by Joyce) that irrefutably identified Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Both the 1992 and 2005 orders identified on the VCIN verified Joyce\u2019s identity by fingerprint matches. The VCIN report attests: \u201cAll arrest entries contained in this record are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>based on fingerprint comparison and pertain to the same individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Given the credible corroboration of the VCIN report and Joyce\u2019s criminal record, the trial court had ample evidence to conclude the 1992 order identified Joyce. His assertion to the contrary would have required the trial court to believe someone other than Joyce, by pure happenstance, was also convicted of the same drug charge on the same day in the same court using an alias also used by Joyce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court did not err by rejecting this hypothesis of innocence. Due process requires the prosecution to prove Joyce\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Fiore v. White, </em>531 U.S. 225, 228-29, 121 S.Ct. 712, 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 629 (2001). This essential safeguard of liberty, as stringent as it is, does not ignore the axiom that \u201c[ejvidence is seldom sufficient to establish any fact as demonstrated and beyond all doubt.\u201d <em>Harris v.
