As he faded in and out of consciousness, he identified the shooter as Darin Satterwhite. Joyner later died from gunshot wounds. A jury found Satterwhite guilty of murdering Joyner. At trial and on appeal, Satterwhite argues the victim\u2019s statements were inadmissible both under state evidentiary and federal constitutional law because the victim was not present at trial and thus was unavailable for cross-examination. Affirming the trial court, we hold Joyner\u2019s statements constituted dying declarations admissible under the common law and categorically outside the reach of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On October 19, 2005, Tanisha Naar left work on a lunch break and returned to her apartment. She found her boyfriend, Joyner, lying on her bathroom floor. He was covered in blood. Naar called out to Joyner, but he did not answer. She went over to Joyner and knelt down beside him as he gasped for breath. Joyner faded in and out of consciousness. He appeared limp and unable to feel anything. Because Joyner was bleeding so profusely, Naar could not identify the entry wounds. When she asked him where he had been shot, Joyner replied, \u201ceverywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Naar called 911. Joyner had been bleeding for about half an hour by this time. The 911 operator asked Naar what happened. While still on the phone, Naar asked Joyner \u201cwho did it?\u201d Breathing heavily, Joyner replied, \u201cDarin Satterwhite did it.\u201d He said it loudly enough for the 911 operator to overhear the statement. Joyner added that Satterwhite had shot him inside Naar\u2019s apartment at around 12:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Paramedics arrived within minutes and found Joyner conscious but in critical condition. He had three gunshot wounds to the chest and one to the head. Joyner had no feeling in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>legs. Police detectives also arrived on the scene. They, too, asked Joyner what happened. He told them Satterwhite had shot him. The paramedics rushed Joyner to the hospital where he was admitted for emergency surgery. The gunshots had damaged his spine and led to renal failure, liver failure, sepsis, pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and coagulopathy. Joyner died in the hospital six weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">At Satterwhite\u2019s jury trial, his counsel expressly denied that Joyner falsely identified Satterwhite as the shooter. \u201cThere\u2019s no motive for him to say that falsely,\u201d counsel argued, \u201cthey were friends.\u201d Instead, counsel asserted, Joyner was simply mistaken. The jury disagreed and convicted Satterwhite of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">By admitting into evidence Joyner\u2019s statements identifying him as the shooter, Satterwhite argues, the trial court violated his right to cross-examination both under common law hearsay principles and under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">A. Dying Declarations under the Common Law</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Unless displaced by statute or constitutional principles, the common law \u201cshall continue in full force\u201d and \u201cbe the rule of decision\u201d in Virginia courts. Code \u00a7 1-200 (recodifying former Code \u00a7 1-10).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Though the common law generally prohibited hearsay evidence, it uniformly excepted from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>general rule the dying declarations of a homicide victim. \u201cNot surprisingly, nearly as soon as we find a hearsay rule, we also find an exception for dying declarations.\u201d 2 Kenneth S. Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 309, at 363 (6th ed. 2006). The common law admitted dying declarations when the victim found herself in a \u201cstate of mortality as would inevitably oblige her soon to answer before her Maker for the truth or falsehood of her assertions,\u201d <em>Giles v. California, </em>- U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2685, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (quoting <em>King v. Woodcock, </em>168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353-54, 1 Leach 500, 503 (1789)), because the \u201csense of impending death is presumed to remove all temptation to falsehood, and to enforce as strict an adherence to the truth as would the obligation of an oath,\u201d <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 244, 15 S.Ct. 337, 340, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Virginia precedent fully conforms to common law principles governing dying declarations. \u201cWithout referring in detail to the numerous adjudications that have taken place in England, and in this country, upon the question, we consider it settled, that declarations in <em>articulo mortis </em>by one who is conscious of his condition, are admissible evidence\u201d in homicide cases. <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 594, 608 (1845).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is a sufficient reason, as the English cases explain, to admit dying declarations because the \u201cusual witness in occasions of other felonies, namely, the party injured himself, is gotten rid of.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Pippin v. Commonwealth, </em>117 Va. 919, 925, 86 S.E. 152, 154 (1915); 1 E. East, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>\u00a7 124, at 353 (1806).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">To qualify as a dying declaration, the victim\u2019s statement must be made \u201cunder a sense of impending death\u201d without any \u201cexpectation or hope of recovery\u201d from his mortal wounds. <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 287, 291, 367 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1988) (citation omitted). But the victim need not verbalize his sense of impending death. \u201c[S]uch words are (fortunately) not essential.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-13, at 758 (6th ed. 2003) (citing <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>89 Va. 171, 177, 15 S.E. 517, 519 (1893) (\u201cIt is not necessary, however, that they should be stated, at the time, to be so made.\u201d)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Consequently, \u201cthe fact of such consciousness may be established otherwise than by the statements of the decedent: as by the character and nature of the wound, his appearance and conduct, &amp; c.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>43 Va. (2 Gratt.) at 608; <em>see, e.g., Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 474, 482, 351 S.E.2d 42, 46 (1986) (holding victim\u2019s state of mind can be inferred from the fact that he had been shot in the chest and was breathing with difficulty), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>235 Va. 287, 367 S.E.2d 483 (1988); <em>see generally </em>Friend, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 18-13, at 758 (noting victim\u2019s state of mind can be inferred from the severity of the wounds and the \u201cobvious extremity\u201d of his condition). A trial court may also take into account \u201cthat during the whole time from the infliction of the wound until his death, [the victim] never expressed the opinion or belief that he would survive.\u201d <em>Pippin, </em>117 Va. at 929, 86 S.E. at 155 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Moreover, if the circumstances show a reasonable basis for the victim\u2019s sense of impending death at the time of his statements, \u201cthe length of time between the declarations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the death of the declarant is an immaterial matter.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>89 Va. at 177, 15 S.E. at 519. It does not matter \u201cthat death did not ensue until a considerable time after the declarations were made\u201d if, when made, the victim had reason to believe he faced imminent death. <em>Swisher v. Commonwealth, </em>67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 963 (1875). Put another way, \u201cthe <em>actual period of survival </em>after making the declaration is immaterial. The necessary element is a subjective one\u2014the declarant\u2019s expectation; and the subsequent duration of life, whatever it may turn out to be, has no relation to his state of mind when speaking.\u201d <em>Batten v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 235, 241-42, 56 S.E.2d 231, 234 (1949) (emphasis in original) (quoting 5 John Henry Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1441, at 235 (3d ed. 1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the trial court, the party offering the dying declaration must establish the evidentiary basis for admitting it if another party objects on hearsay grounds. <em>See Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 198, 204, 403 S.E.2d 362, 366 (1991). On appeal, we review under an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard the trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence. <em>Avent v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 175, 197, 688 S.E.2d 244, 256 (2010). Applying this standard, \u201cwe do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. Rather, we consider only whether the record fairly supports the trial court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (citation omitted). This deferential standard applies to a trial court\u2019s decision to admit statements under the dying declarations exception to the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">Much weight ought always to be given to the opinion of the court below in determining this question. The duty by law is devolved on him to determine, not only from the proofs, but from all the circumstances of the case, whether the declarations are admissible. That court has all the witnesses in its presence, hears them speak, can judge of their credibility, is cognizant of all the circumstances of the case, and to its judgment the law refers the determination of the question whether the declarations were admissible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>If that judgment is clearly erroneous, it may be reviewed like any other judgment. But ... [t]he judgment must be clearly erroneous before it will be interfered with by the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Swisher, </em>67 Va. (26 Gratt.) at 974 (citation omitted). \u201cThe circumstances of each case will show whether the requisite consciousness existed,\u201d Professor Wigmore concurs, \u201cand it is poor policy to disturb the ruling of the trial judge upon the meaning of these circumstances.\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 1442, at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Governed by these principles, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Joyner\u2019s statements under the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule. Found in a pool of blood, Joyner had taken three gunshots to the chest and one to the head. He went in and out of consciousness, was partially paralyzed, and had difficulty breathing. Though he did not verbalize a sense of death coming over him, he did not need to. \u201cThe fact that the wounds were severe is, in itself, circumstantial evidence that the declarant must have realized that there was no hope, and the obvious extremity of his condition is also evidence that he must have known what lay ahead.\u201d Friend, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 18-13, at 758 (footnote omitted). Given the severity of his injuries, we find it unremarkable that nothing in the record suggests Joyner \u201cexpressed the opinion or belief that he would survive,\u201d <em>Pippin, </em>117 Va. at 929, 86 S.E. at 155 (citation omitted), at the time of his challenged statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Satterwhite makes much of the fact that Joyner did not die immediately. Emergency medical care kept him alive for several weeks following the shooting. Like the trial court, we find this observation misses the point. To be sure, \u201cthere seems to be no case in which the time of survival was deemed to exclude the declaration; and various periods have been passed upon as not too long.\u201d 5 <em>Wigmore, supra </em>\u00a7 1441, at 235; <em>see Batten, </em>190 Va. at 242, 56 S.E.2d at 234-35; <em>Hall, </em>89 Va. at 177, 15 S.E. at 519; <em>Swisher, </em>67 Va. (26 Gratt.) at 970-71. It is an immaterial fortuity that modern medicine extend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ed Joyner\u2019s life as long as it did, particularly given the extent of his injuries. The only issue is whether his <em>in extremis </em>condition at the time of his statements warranted the trial court\u2019s conclusion that they came within the scope of the dying declaration exception. Because \u201c[m]uch weight ought always to be given to the opinion of the court below in determining this question,\u201d <em>Swisher, </em>67 Va. (26 Gratt.) at 974, and sufficient evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we find no basis for overturning the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B. The Confrontation Clause &amp; Dying Declarations</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Citing <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Satterwhite argues the trial court violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. He contends Joyner\u2019s statements were both accusatorial and testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny. If <em>Crawford </em>applied, we might agree. We hold it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Virginia settled this issue 150 years ago in <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 594 (1845). In that case, the appellant argued \u201c[t]hat the admission of the dying declarations in evidence, is a violation of the [Virginia] bill of rights: the 8th article of which secures to every citizen charged with crime the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Rejecting this argument, <em>Hill </em>found it wholly incompatible with tradition and history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">Is such evidence contrary to the bill of rights? If this question is to be answered affirmatively, then for nearly 70 years past, the Courts of this Commonwealth have been in the constant practice of violating the bill of rights in a most important particular. We admit that the practice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Courts, however long, and uniform, is not of itself a valid answer to the objection; and that this Court is bound to decide it now; not upon practice, but upon principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">The question then arises, what was the doctrine of the common law as it regarded this rule of evidence? Without attempting to ascertain the antiquity of the earliest decisions of the British Courts affirming the rule, it is sufficient to state, that long anterior to the year 1776, the period of the declaration of the bill of rights, the rule of evidence was well established. And it is remarkable, that in all the commentaries it underwent in England, it was never supposed that the rule was a violation of the rights of the subject as secured by Magna Charta [sic]. The rule is one of necessity____ We are therefore of opinion, that the admission of dying declarations as evidence, is not repugnant to the bill of rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\"><em>Hill, </em>43 (2 Gratt.) Va. at 607-08. <em>See Robertson v. State, </em>63 Tex.Crim. 216, 142 S.W. 533, 544 (Tex.Crim.App.1911) (noting \u201cthe Virginia court adheres to the rule announced in all the other States, that if the testimony was admissible in England at the date of the Declaration of Independence the testimony is admissible, and is not violative of the Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Interpreting the Federal Bill of Rights (which the Framers based in large part on the Virginia Declaration of Rights adopted over a decade earlier),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court came to a similar conclusion in <em>Mattox v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895). Its analysis began with the observation that \u201c[m]any of its provisions in the nature of a Bill of Rights are subject to exceptions, recognized long before the adoption of the Constitution, and not interfering at all with its spirit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 15 S.Ct. at 340. As an example, <em>Mattox </em>pointed to dying declarations. \u201c[F]rom time immemorial,\u201d <em>Mattox </em>declared, dying declarations \u201chave been treated as competent testimony, and no one would have the hardihood at this day to question their admissibility. They are admitted, not in conformity with any general rule regarding the admission of testimony, but as an exception to such rules, simply from the necessities of the case, and to prevent a manifest failure of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 15 S.Ct. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The question remains whether <em>Crawford </em>shifted the legal paradigm so profoundly as to render this longstanding precedent unreliable. We think not. For all its novelty, <em>Crawford's </em>holding left intact many aspects of the conventional understanding of the Confrontation Clause. <em>See, e.g., Blackman v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 633, 644, 613 S.E.2d 460, 466 (2005) (holding <em>\u201cCrawford </em>confirms the traditional view that the Confrontation Clause \u2018does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). To be sure, though <em>Crawford </em>did not involve dying declarations, it made a point of steering clear of the subject by acknowledging: \u201cAlthough many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those that clearly are____ If this exception must be accepted on historical grounds, it is <em>sui generis.\u201d Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56 n. 6, 124 S.Ct. at 1367 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In a later application of <em>Crawford, </em>the Court stated it had \u201cpreviously acknowledged that two forms of testimonial statements were admitted at common law even though they were unconfronted.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2682. \u201cThe first of these were declarations made by a speaker who was both on the brink of death and aware that he was dying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2682-83 (citing with approval, among other cases, <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. 78, 80-81 (Gen.Ct.1817)). Like <em>Mattox, Giles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>accepted in <em>dicta </em>that dying declarations fit \u201cwithin this historic exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2683.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For these reasons, we hold <em>Crawford </em>did not upend the traditional view that dying declarations serve as an exception both to the common law hearsay rule and the constitutional right of a defendant to confront his accusers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence Joyner\u2019s statements identifying Satterwhite as the shooter.
