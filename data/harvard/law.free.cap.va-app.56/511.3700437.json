Wife contends the trial court abused its discretion in approving that transfer as complying with its equitable distribution award. She also contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees and her expert witness\u2019 fees. Both parties request attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to husband, the party prevailing below, \u201cand grant all reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>able inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>29 Va.App. 673, 678, 514 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On March 27, 2009, wife was granted a final divorce on the grounds of adultery. As part of its equitable distribution award, the trial court decreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">[Husband] shall pay to [wife] a monetary award in the amount of One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000.00). The award will be payable over a period of ten (10) years in equal amount of One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000.00) payable on the 1st day of June of each year commencing June 1, 2009. <em>Subject to approval of the Court, [husband] may satisfy the award through the conveyance of property.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">On June 24, 2009, wife filed a petition for rule to show cause asserting that husband had not paid the first installment of the monetary award due June 1, 2009. On July 6, 2009, husband filed a motion to transfer property to satisfy monetary award, asking the trial court to approve a transfer of $120,000 of his marital share of his Charles Schwab Rollover IRA and his Diakon Logistics 401(k) in satisfaction of the first installment of the monetary award due wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">On August 17, 2009, the trial court heard the parties\u2019 evidence and argument. Husband testified that he did not have $120,000 in cash and that the retirement accounts were the sole assets available to him to transfer at that time. Wife testified that she needed the money to pay various bills and debts and would have to liquidate any property transferred to her in order to do that. Wife\u2019s accountant, qualified as a tax expert, testified that if wife were to \u201ccash[ ] out\u201d the retirement accounts husband sought to transfer to her to satisfy the required installment payment, she would only \u201cnet\u201d $60,736 after taxes and penalties. The tax expert testified that if wife were to cash out the retirement accounts, the funds she received would be treated as income to her for tax purposes and that she would also incur a ten percent early withdrawal penalty. He testified that husband would have to transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>retirement accounts valued at $231,200 for wife to \u201cnet\u201d $120,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">After considering the testimony and argument of counsel, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">[E]quitable distribution is not a substitute for spousal support or child support. It is a matter a [sic] property interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">And when I ordered that in this case the award could be satisfied by the transfer of property, I think that intended to mean the value of the property. It was $120,000. What she decides to do with it is up to her. And I don\u2019t think the Court should take any consideration of the fact that she\u2019s going to say she wants to cash out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">I think he\u2019s under an obligation to transfer the $120,000 represented in these retirement accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The trial court granted husband\u2019s motion to transfer $120,000 of his marital share of his retirement accounts to satisfy the first installment of the monetary award, found that this transfer complied with its final decree of divorce, and declined to order husband to pay wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AHO\">A. Transfer of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Wife contends the trial court abused its discretion in permitting husband to transfer $120,000 of his marital share of his retirement accounts to her in satisfaction of the first installment of the monetary award. She argues that transfer to her would net her only $60,736 after taxes and early withdrawal penalties, whereas the installment payment of the monetary award due her on June 1,2009 was $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D), relating to the equitable distribution of marital property, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">[B]ased upon (i) the equities and the rights and interests of each party in the marital property, and (ii) the factors listed in subsection E, <em>the court has the power to grant a mone</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>tary award, payable either in a lump sum or over a period of time in fixed amounts, to either party. The party against whom a monetary award is made may satisfy the award, in whole or in part, by conveyance of property, subject to the approval of the court. </em>An award entered pursuant to this subsection shall constitute a judgment within the meaning of [Code] \u00a7 8.01-426 and shall not be docketed by the clerk unless the decree so directs. The provisions of [Code] \u00a7 8.01-382, relating to interest on judgments, shall apply unless the court orders otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aax\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We have previously held that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) provides that \u201c[o]nce a monetary award has been made, the party against whom it was made may satisfy the award by conveyance of property with the court\u2019s approval.\u201d <em>Venable v. Venable, 2 </em>Va.App. 178, 185, 342 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APF\">The obvious reason for this provision [of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D)] is to enable the parties to make payment of a monetary award by adjustment of their property. The legislature gave the option of this method of payment to the \u201cparty against whom a monetary award is made.\u201d The statute makes no mention of consent, approval or acceptance by the party to whom the property is to be conveyed. However, it does make such a transfer subject to the court\u2019s approval. We believe this provision serves to prevent unilateral action by the party seeking to make payment by the transfer of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Payne v. Payne, </em>5 Va.App. 359, 366, 363 S.E.2d 428, 432 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We have held that \u201ceither the granting or the withholding of court approval of the transfer must reflect the exercise of sound judicial discretion in the light of all of the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sound \u201cjudicial discretion mandates a careful consideration of all of the pertinent circumstances to determine whether the approval of the transfer of the ... property was an appropriate method of payment of the [monetary] award....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 363 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Wife asserts that our holding in <em>Payne </em>supports her contention that here the trial court abused its discretion in approving the transfer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Payne, </em>the wife appealed the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award, as well as its approval of a transfer of property to the wife pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) in satisfaction of part of that award. 5 Va.App. at 364-65, 363 S.E.2d at 431. There, the trial court approved of the husband\u2019s transfer of real estate located in California, \u201cseveral thousand miles\u201d away from the wife\u2019s residence, in satisfaction of its monetary award to wife. <em>Id. </em>at 367, 363 S.E.2d at 432. The wife argued that the trial court\u2019s approval of the transfer of that property to her required her to assume a mortgage debt against that property for which she had previously been absolved of all liability. The wife also \u201cwas <em>required </em>to assume the burden of selling the property which [the husband] had been unable to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 363 S.E.2d at 433 (emphasis added). On appeal, we found that, under those circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion by requiring the wife to accept that property in satisfaction of its monetary award to her as part of its equitable distribution award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Here, unlike the property transferred in satisfaction of the equitable distribution monetary award in <em>Payne, </em>wife\u2019s ability to access the retirement accounts would not be difficult, though her immediate conversion of those accounts to cash would result in a net value to her less than the value to husband at the time of the transfer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In granting husband\u2019s motion to transfer his marital share of his retirement accounts, valued at $120,000, to wife in satisfaction of the $120,000 installment of the equitable distribution monetary award due June 1, 2009, the trial court stated: \u201c[W]hen I ordered that in this case the award could be satisfied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>transfer of property, I think that intended to mean the value of the property. It was $120,000____I think he\u2019s under an obligation to transfer the $120,000 represented in these retirement accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">It is firmly established that \u201c\u2018trial courts have the authority to interpret their own orders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albert v. Albert, </em>38 Va.App. 284, 297-98, 563 S.E.2d 389, 396 (2002) (quoting <em>Fredericksburg Constr. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc., </em>260 Va. 137, 144, 530 S.E.2d 148, 152 (2000)). \u201cOn appeal, \u2018\u201cwhen construing a lower court\u2019s order, a reviewing court should give deference to the interpretation adopted by the lower court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Morrill v. Morrill, </em>45 Va.App. 709, 718, 613 S.E.2d 821, 825 (2005) (en banc) (quoting <em>Albert, </em>38 Va.App. at 298, 563 S.E.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Fredericksburg Constr. Co., </em>260 Va. at 144, 530 S.E.2d at 152; <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 (1999) (en banc))).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Here, the trial court interpreted its own final order of equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 marital assets, particularly the provision in that order stating that, \u201c[s]ubject to approval of the Court, [husband] may satisfy [installments of the monetary] award through the conveyance of property.\u201d On this record, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in interpreting its own order approving husband\u2019s transfer of property to wife, which had a value of $120,000 at the time of the transfer, as satisfying the June 1, 2009 installment payment of its monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">B. Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expert Witness\u2019 Fees in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">In her second question presented, wife contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees and her expert witness\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">\u201cWhether to award attorney\u2019s fees \u2018is a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ble on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 375, 585 S.E.2d 349, 354 (2003) (quoting <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 199-200, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002)). \u201cWe will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision whether to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party only where the record shows a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>West v. West, </em>53 Va.App. 125, 136, 669 S.E.2d 390, 396 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The record on appeal does not contain any information regarding any attorney\u2019s fees incurred by wife in the trial court. Moreover, the trial court determined that husband\u2019s transfer of property, valued at $120,000 at the time of transfer, satisfied its prior order. On this record, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to award attorney\u2019s fees to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Wife also asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to award her expert witness\u2019 fees incurred in that court. However, wife\u2019s brief contains no argument or legal authority in support of her assertion that she was entitled to an award of expert witness\u2019 fees. Rule 5A:20(e) provides, in part, that the opening brief shall include \u201c[t]he principles of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u201d \u201cIf the parties believed that the circuit court erred, it was their duty to present that error to [the Court of Appeals] with legal authority to support their contention.\u201d <em>Fadness v. Fadness, </em>52 Va.App. 833, 851, 667 S.E.2d 857, 866 (2008); <em>see also Parks v. Parks, </em>52 Va.App. 663, 664, 666 S.E.2d 547, 548 (2008). Because wife\u2019s failure to comply with the mandates of Rule 5A:20(e) is significant, that portion of her second question presented, contending that the trial court erred in refusing her request for expert witness\u2019 fees, is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">C. Attorney\u2019s Fees Incurred on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Both parties seek an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). After considering the record before us, we decline to award either party attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">. Here, wife did not appeal the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award. Only the approval by the trial court of the transfer of property pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) in satisfaction of the June 1, 2009 installment of the monetary award is before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
