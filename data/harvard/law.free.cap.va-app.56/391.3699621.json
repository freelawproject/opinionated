Evans should be vacated because in 2002 Billy Joe Brown, who was convicted of these same crimes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> confessed that he acted alone in killing Evans. This Court remanded the matter to the circuit court to certify findings regarding factual issues in dispute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The circuit court conducted a hearing in this matter and supplied this Court with its certified findings of fact, including its finding that Brown was \u201ccredible in his assertion that he acted independently in murdering the victim and ... Turner played no role in the murder or in the restraining of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">A divided panel of this Court held that Turner met his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the recantation was truthful and that, had the statement been produced at trial, \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt [of felony murder and abduction with intent to defile] beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d granted his petition for a writ of actual innocence, vacated Turner\u2019s convictions for first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile, and remanded the matter to the circuit court with instructions to modify the order of conviction to reflect Turner\u2019s conviction for being an accessory after the fact. <em>See Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 458, 680 S.E.2d 312 (2009). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold that Brown\u2019s credible recantation does not provide this Court with clear and convincing evidence that no rational fact finder could have found that Turner used deception to abduct Evans with the intent to have sexual intercourse with her against her will. Therefore, we dismiss Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence and vacate the August 4, 2009 order issued by a panel of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">On June 18, 1995, Brown, a Navy SEAL trainee, spent much of the day drinking. Over the course of the day, Brown consumed six beers and eight to ten shots of Jim Beam in his room at the barracks. That night, Brown decided to go to a Virginia Beach nightclub called The Bayou with Turner, a fellow trainee. While Turner drove to the nightclub, Brown drank six more beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>That same night, Jennifer Evans, who was vacationing in Virginia Beach with her Mends, Michelle McCammon and Andria Burdette, decided around 11:00 p.m. to go to The Bayou. While at the nightclub, Evans noticed Turner, whom she had not previously met, and began talking with him. Throughout the remainder of the night, she alternated between socializing with her Mends and speaking with Turner. Though Evans met Brown briefly, she did not spend time talking with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Around midnight, Burdette wanted to leave, but Evans stalled to continue talking with Turner. Turner and Evans appeared to be getting along very well, so well that at one point Turner sat in a chair while Evans perched on the armrest. About an hour later, Evans finally agreed to leave but not before writing the phone number at the home where she was staying on a napkin for Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Burdette and McCammon then left the nightclub with Turner and Evans trailing behind. As the women entered their vehicle, Turner leaned against the back door and continued talking to Evans through the open window. Turner offered to drive Evans home, but Burdette refused. Burdette and McCammon eventually agreed to leave Evans at the nightclub and return at 2:00 a.m. to take her home. After this agreement was reached, Turner opened Evans\u2019 door with \u201csurprising force.\u201d Evans appeared happy with this arrangement and returned to the nightclub with Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Around 1:15 a.m., Turner approached Karen Bishop, Brown\u2019s ex-girlMend, and asked her to give Brown a ride home if Turner did not return to the bar before it closed. Bishop reluctantly agreed. Between 1:15 and 1:30 a.m., the lights came on signaling that it was almost closing time. After the lights came on, Julio Fitzgibbons, a Navy SEAL who had met Brown and Turner that night, approached Turner to see whether Turner had any plans for that night.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Turner said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that he and Brown were going to have a threesome with Evans. Evans was approximately fifteen yards away at this time. Within a few seconds of this, Evans approached and Turner introduced her to Fitzgibbons as she stood next to Brown. Fitzgibbons then gave them the thumbs up sign, which Turner returned with a smile on his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">At approximately 1:35 a.m., Bishop saw Turner and Evans, who were holding hands, leave the nightclub. Brown was with Bishop and one of her friends at this time. At approximately 1:45 a.m., Brown indicated that he wanted to leave, but Bishop told him that she needed to wait a few minutes for her friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Brown had consumed an additional eight to ten beers, eight to ten shots, and twelve mixed drinks while at the nightclub. He was noticeably intoxicated and on the verge of losing consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Brown, indicating an unwillingness to wait for Bishop\u2019s friend, left the nightclub. Bishop followed him out of the bar at approximately 1:50 a.m. and told him that she would wait for a few minutes to give him a ride home in case he was unable to find Turner. Around 2:10 or 2:15 a.m., Bishop went back inside the bar, found her friend, and went to her car. Bishop and her friend drove around the parking lot looking for Brown but left after not seeing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">When Burdette and McCammon returned to the nightclub at approximately 1:50 a.m., Evans was not in the parking lot where she had promised to meet them. They searched for several hours but could not find Evans. The women filed a missing persons report with the police the next day. After reading about Evans\u2019 disappearance, Bishop contacted the police to tell them that she had seen Turner and Brown with Evans on the night Evans disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">At approximately 9:00 p.m. on June 21,1995, Special Agents Thomas L. Carter and Robert Elliott of the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Turner to try to determine what Turner did the weekend Evans disappeared. Notably, Turner told the agents that on Sunday night, he and Brown went to The Bayou where they stayed until closing time before re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>turning to the barracks by themselves. When asked for more details, Turner said he had a conversation with some other SEAL trainees that he met there. He also told the agents that he met two women that evening: one was a tall woman whose name he could not recall and the other was a woman, who the agents later learned was Evans, who was at the nightclub with two female friends. The agents specifically asked Turner about the second woman, and he said he could not recall her name but that they talked for a while. He said that her two companions decided to leave and return around closing time to pick her up. Turner said he continued to talk with her for a while before he left to speak with other people that he knew. He told the agents that he spoke to her again around last call. The woman told him that she would be there for the week and wanted him to call her. She wrote her name and phone number on a cocktail napkin for him. Turner said that he and Brown left while she was waiting for her friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">After the agents suggested several possible names for the woman, Turner said he might be able to provide her name because he thought that he still had the cocktail napkin in his barracks. Then, Turner and Special Agent Elliott went to Turner\u2019s barracks so that Turner could retrieve the napkin. The napkin had the name Jennifer and a phone number written on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Once the agents verified that Turner had spent time with Evans, they continued to question him about her, and he repeated that he had met her and her friends at the bar. He told the agents that at some point in the evening, he believed that Evans might agree to leave the bar with him. Based on this belief, he asked Brown to ride home with Bishop so that he was free to leave with Evans. Turner said that Brown told him that he did not want to ride home with Bishop. Turner told investigators that when he realized that he would not be able to be alone with Evans that night, he told her that he would try to contact her later in the week. He stated that he left Evans standing at the bar and returned to the barracks with Brown. Turner told the investigators that neither man had been drinking. He stated that they woke up around 9:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>a.m. on Monday and jointly signed a lease on an apartment before driving back to the base. During the entire interview, the agents thought that Turner was very calm and collected and that his answers seemed very forthright.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Sergeant Thomas Baum, a member of the Virginia Beach Police Department\u2019s homicide unit, participated in a subsequent interview of Turner at FBI headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. During that interview, Turner said he and Brown went to The Bayou, where he saw some other SEALS and spent most of the night talking with one of them, a Mexican or Puerto Rican man whose name Turner did not know. Turner also said that Bishop and one of her friends were there. He said he didn\u2019t start talking to Evans until around midnight or 12:80 a.m. Turner told the sergeant that he introduced himself to Evans while she was standing with her friends. Turner said they spoke for only a few minutes before he returned to Brown and the other SEALS.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Turner told Sergeant Baum that he resumed talking with Evans around 1:00 a.m. while her friends were still there. Soon, her friends wanted to leave, so he walked the women to their car. Evans sat in the back seat, but the door was not closed. He said that he told Evans and her friends that they should stay because the nightclub closed in one hour. Evans agreed to stay, and her friends agreed to pick her up in front of The Bayou at closing. He said that he and Evans returned inside to talk as her Mends drove away. When the lights came on in the nightclub, he asked Evans for her number. Turner told Sergeant Baum that he spoke with Evans for a few more minutes before returning to Brown. He said that he saw Evans talking with two unknown men. Turner told Sergeant Baum that he and Brown left around 1:45 or 2:00 a.m. without Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Shortly after Sergeant Baum finished interviewing Turner, Detectives John T. Orr and Al Byrum, also of the Virginia Beach Police Department, interviewed Turner. The detectives noticed that as they did so, Turner\u2019s original story began to change and \u201chis denials became weaker and weaker.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Eventually, Turner said that he would speak to the detectives after he talked with his chief warrant officer. After allowing him to do so, the detectives asked Turner where they could find Evans\u2019 body, and Turner agreed to take them to it. In response to direct questioning, Turner stated that he was not the person who killed Evans but that he was present when Brown killed her in Turner\u2019s car. He explained that Brown choked Evans until she was dead while they were in the parking lot of The Bayou. Turner agreed to provide police with his car and clothing from that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">When Brown was interviewed, he told investigators that Turner spent the entire night talking with Evans but that Brown was not interested. Brown stated that Turner indicated that he was \u201chooking up\u201d with Evans, and he confirmed that Turner had arranged for Bishop to give Brown a ride home. Brown did not want a ride home from Bishop because he was concerned that he would have sexual intercourse with her and that would ruin his current relationship. Brown said that when he left the nightclub and headed out into the parking lot, he saw Turner jump out of his car and order Brown to get into the car. Brown saw Evans laying in the backseat with blood coming out of her nose and her clothes torn open. According to Brown, Turner told him, \u201cI think I fucking killed her.\u201d Turner then implemented a plan to dispose of Evans\u2019 body and cover up the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Turner\u2019s trial for murder and abduction with intent to defile began in August of 1996. Charlotte Lowe, the forensic supervisor who analyzed the crime scene, testified that Evans\u2019 body was in an advanced state of decomposition and skeletalization, such that many of her bones were exposed. The vest Evans had been wearing on the night she disappeared was pulled back and her bra was pushed up, exposing her breasts. Her shorts and underwear had been pulled down so that they were around only one leg. Lowe examined Turner\u2019s vehicle for semen, urine, fingerprints, and other physical evidence but found nothing of forensic value in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Dr. Leah Bush, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Virginia in the Tidewater district, performed the autopsy on Evans\u2019 body and opined that it was impossible to determine Evans\u2019 exact cause of death due to the severe skeletalization but concluded that manual strangulation was a possibility. Dr. Bush described the various chokeholds that could have led to Evans\u2019 death and how long each method would likely take to have killed her. Dr. Bush conclusively ruled out a broken neck as a cause of death because Evans\u2019 spinal cord did not show signs of fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Todd Ehrlich, a Navy SEAL who completed some training with Brown and Turner, also testified against Turner. He told the jury about Turner and Brown\u2019s reputations for engaging in group sexual encounters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, he testified that he recalled seeing the two men socializing with two women on June 16, 1995. According to Ehrlich, Turner alternated between talking to one of the young women and then talking to Brown to give him a \u201cprogress report.\u201d He could not recall the specifics of the conversation between Turner and Brown but said it involved the two of them attempting to get the young women to go home with them. Ehrlich testified that the two women left together without Turner and Brown. Ehrlich further testified about an incident where he witnessed Brown and Turner engage in group sexual intercourse with a woman while the three were stationed in California. Ehrlich told the jury that he later had a conversation with Turner and Brown in which they bragged about repeating the group sexual intercourse with that woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Turner took the stand in his own defense and declared that he never intended to have sex with Evans. According to Turner, his original plan was to take Evans to the beach to continue talking. He testified that he abandoned that idea because it would have been impossible to do so and still return by 2:00 a.m. to meet Evans\u2019 friends. Turner testified that, instead, he and Evans went to his vehicle to wait for Evans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>friends. While waiting, Turner saw Brown approach and told Evans to \u201cpay no attention to this guy. He\u2019s drunk. Don\u2019t believe a word he says.\u201d Brown then entered the vehicle and sat in the back seat directly behind Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Brown began cursing and making belligerent remarks about Turner and Bishop. Although Turner stated that he could not remember many details of the night, he recalled that Brown shifted his attention towards Evans and began making crude remarks to her. Specifically, Brown asked her whether she was a virgin and whether she had ever had sex with a \u201cfrogman.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, Turner saw Brown touch Evans, and she slapped his hand away. At that moment, Turner saw Brown reach around and make a jerking motion with both arms. According to Turner, Brown had both arms locked around Evans\u2019 neck and was making a squeezing motion. Turner testified that he tried to pry Brown\u2019s arms from her neck but could not. After a minute, Brown let go, and Turner checked Evans\u2019 vital signs but could not find a pulse. Brown yelled at Turner to drive, and Turner complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">As Turner drove away, Brown reached beneath Evans\u2019 shorts until Turner yelled at him to stop. Brown then passed out. Turner drove to a secluded area near some woods where he and Brown removed Evans\u2019 body from the vehicle. Turner went back to the vehicle to look for a shovel, and when he returned, he found Brown lying on top of Evans\u2019 body. Turner pulled Brown off, and Brown said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because I couldn\u2019t get it\u2014a hard on anyway.\u201d They left after covering Evans\u2019 body with leaves. Before returning to the military base, they went to a diner. The next day, Turner and Brown signed a lease to be roommates for the coming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In response to Ehrlich\u2019s testimony about group sexual intercourse in California, Turner stated that \u201cit all centered] around one incident and bragging about that one incident.\u201d He confirmed talking to Fitzgibbons on the night of June 18, 1995, but he denied talking about engaging in a threesome with Brown and Evans. Turner reiterated that he \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>actively try to sleep with [Evans]\u201d because \u201cshe wasn\u2019t that type of girl at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">On September 5, 1996, the jury, after having been instructed on the legal theories of concert of action as well as principal in the first and second degrees, found Turner guilty of abduction with intent to defile, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48, and murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32. The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 82 years. Both this Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia denied Turner\u2019s petitions for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On July 2, 2002, Brown, who did not testify at Turner\u2019s trial, provided a tape-recorded interview in which he avowed that he had lied to investigators about Turner\u2019s involvement in Evans\u2019 death and testified falsely about those events at his own trial. Brown stated that he spontaneously choked Evans and then blamed Turner because Turner had betrayed him by telling investigators what happened and where Evans\u2019 body was hidden. On February 28, 2003, Brown signed an affidavit that memorialized this interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Based on Brown\u2019s affidavit, Turner filed a petition for a writ of actual innocence based upon newly-discovered, non-biological evidence. In his petition, Turner relied upon Brown\u2019s 2002 admission and 2003 affidavit in which Brown stated that he alone killed Evans and that Turner played no part in it. Turner asserted that other evidence in the record supported Brown\u2019s statement absolving Turner. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss Turner\u2019s petition, alleging that the petition was without merit because Brown\u2019s confession was not credible and even if it was credible, the other evidence against Turner was sufficient to find him guilty either as a principal in the second degree or under the felony-murder doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Upon consideration of Turner\u2019s petition, the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss, Turner\u2019s reply thereto, and the record, this Court denied the motion to dismiss and remanded the matter to the circuit court to certify findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>regarding factual issues in dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, this Court instructed the circuit court to answer four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">1) whether Brown\u2019s recanted testimony is credible in his assertion that he testified falsely at his own trial,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">2) if the answer to Question # 1 is \u201cyes,\u201d did Brown testify falsely as to any material fact,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">3) if the answer to Question # 1 is \u201cyes,\u201d was Brown\u2019s recantation testimony unknown or unavailable to the petitioner or his counsel at the time the conviction became final, or could such recantation testimony, through the exercise of diligence, have been discovered or obtained before the expiration of 21 days following entry of the final order of conviction, [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">4) is Brown credible in his assertion that he acted independently in murdering the victim and that Turner had no role in the murder or any restraint of the victim?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>On May 28, 2008, the circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing in which Brown testified that on the night of June 18, 1995, he did not want to engage in sexual intercourse and purposefully consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. He stated that he recalled briefly talking to Evans and claimed he did not know Turner\u2019s intentions concerning Evans aside from Turner\u2019s wanting to spend more time with her. Brown confirmed Turner\u2019s prior testimony that Bishop was to give Brown a ride home but that Brown did not want to wait for Bishop\u2019s friend to arrive. Brown admitted that, by this point, he was extremely intoxicated and on the verge of passing out. He testified that he found Turner\u2019s vehicle and climbed into the back seat behind Evans. Brown recalled saying something vulgar but could not remember specifically what he said. Brown testified that \u201cone minute [he] was normal and the next minute [he] snapped and [he] started choking [Evans,]\u201d by putting his left arm against her neck and holding it with his right arm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Brown testified that when he realized that Evans was dead, he instructed Turner to drive. He further told the circuit court that he removed Evans\u2019 vest and pulled her pants down before passing out. Brown also testified that he attempted to have sex with Evans\u2019 body after he and Turner placed it in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Brown acknowledged having given conflicting accounts of how the murder occurred. He admitted that he lied to the police and that he repeated the lies at his own trial. He testified that he fabricated Turner\u2019s involvement in the murder because he was angry with Turner for telling the police where Evans\u2019 body was located. He stated that at the time, he perceived no difference between telling one lie and telhng several lies. In explaining his recent recantation, Brown stated that his conversion to Christianity was his primary reason for his coming forward. Brown said that as long as he truthfully confessed to what had happened that night, he did not care whether his testimony would help exonerate Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Upon considering the testimony from the evidentiary hearing and the transcripts from the original trials of Turner and Brown, the circuit court found that Brown \u201cis credible in his assertion that he testified falsely at his own trial,\u201d that Brown \u201ctestified falsely as to a material fact in the case,\u201d that \u201cBrown\u2019s recantation of his earlier testimony was unknown and unavailable to the petitioner in this proceeding ... at the time of his conviction and at the time his conviction became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>final,\u201d and that Brown \u201cis credible in his assertion that he acted independently in murdering the victim and that ... Turner played no role in the murder or in the restraining of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10 confers original jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals of Virginia to consider a petition for a writ of actual innocence based on newly-discovered, non-biological evidence filed by any individual \u201cconvicted of a felony upon a plea of not guilty.\u201d <em>See also Carpitcher v.

The parties agree that the newly-discovered, non-biological evidence at issue in this case is Brown\u2019s confession that he alone restrained and killed Evans.

These observations are available only through live witness testimony. This Court is not authorized to hear testimony and, as a result, we are not equipped to judge the credibility of a witness\u2019 testimony based on his demeanor. Despite our original jurisdiction and the unique nature of the writ, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>simply cannot sit as a fact finder in the same sense that a jury or circuit court does. Therefore, like the Supreme Court of Virginia when it sits with original jurisdiction in habeas corpus cases and reviews factual findings made by a circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-654(0,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we must accept the circuit court\u2019s factual findings made pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12 unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.

Thus, as previously stated, the initial panel that decided to refer Turner\u2019s case to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing implicitly denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss and made preliminary determinations as to materiality and relevance. On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we may reject the initial panel\u2019s legal conclusions related to relevance and materiality but not the factual findings made by the circuit court at the panel\u2019s instruction. <em>See Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 342-43, 641 S.E.2d at 490; <em>Johnson, </em>273 Va. at 323, 641 S.E.2d at 485. Therefore, we are bound to accept the circuit court\u2019s determinations that Brown \u201cis credible in his assertion that he testified falsely at his own trial,\u201d that Brown \u201ctestified falsely as to a material fact in the case,\u201d that \u201cBrown\u2019s recantation of his earlier testimony was unknown and unavailable to the petitioner in this proceeding ... at the time of his conviction and at the time his conviction became final,\u201d and that Brown \u201cis credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in his assertion that he acted independently in murdering the victim and that ... Turner played no role in the murder or in the restraining of the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Moreover, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were fatally incomplete and conelusory. On referral to the circuit court for factual findings, \u201c[tjhere is no mandatory formula for a circuit court\u2019s consideration of the credibility of a particular witness.\u201d <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>son, </em>273 Va. at 323, 641 S.E.2d at 485 (citations omitted). Here, the circuit court clearly answered, albeit briefly, the four questions referred by this Court and thus Mfilled its obligations under Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12. Having fully considered the record in this case, we cannot say that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them and, therefore, we are bound by these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>B. Turner\u2019s Role in Evans\u2019 Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Next, we must consider whether Brown\u2019s credible confession, \u201cwhen considered with all of the other evidence in the current record, ... prove[s] that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii). Turner was convicted of abduction with intent to defile, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48, and murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, under the felony-murder doctrine. Thus, Brown\u2019s recantation must obviate Turner\u2019s participation in killing Evans and sever the causal connection between Brown\u2019s conduct and the underlying crime that gave rise to Evans\u2019 murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Turner argues that we cannot arbitrarily disregard Brown\u2019s recantation and that all other evidence must be viewed in the context of Brown\u2019s assuming sole responsibility for the murder. To that end, Turner asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against him is merely circumstantial and does not exclude the reasonable hypothesis of innocence that Brown acted independently in murdering Evans and that Turner had no role in the murder or restraint of Evans. The Commonwealth responds that, based on all of the evidence, a reasonable fact finder could find that Turner abducted Evans with the intent to defile her and, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Before this Court may properly grant the writ of actual innocence that Turner seeks, he must demonstrate by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and convincing evidence that based on all of the evidence in the record, <em>\u201cno </em>rational trier of fact <em>could </em>have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii) (emphasis added); <em>accord Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 344, 641 S.E.2d at 491. This analysis is not as simple as merely accepting the circuit court\u2019s determination that Brown testified credibly that he acted alone when he physically committed the murder and that Turner played no role in murdering or restraining Evans.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The relevant question is not whether Brown acted alone in killing Evans, but whether Turner abducted her with the intent to defile her.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If he did, the fact that Brown may have acted alone in restraining Evans and in murdering her does not absolve Turner of his guilt. In order to be granted a writ of actual innocence, Turner must produce clear and convincing evidence that he did not abduct Evans with the intent to defile her and, therefore, that he is not guilty of felony murder. It is this Court\u2019s statutory duty to examine the entire record, including Brown\u2019s credible confession to Evans\u2019 murder, to determine whether Turner has met his burden. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.11 to 19.2-327.14. Having examined the entire record,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that Turner has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>met his statutory burden. From the record, a rational fact finder could have found that Turner abducted Evans by deception\u2014meaning no finding of force or restraint would have been required\u2014and that the abduction ended with Evan\u2019s murder. Therefore, we dismiss Turner\u2019s request for a writ of actual innocence and deny his request to vacate his convictions for murder and abduction with intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">A defendant is guilty of first-degree murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-32 where the killing occurs \u201cin the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate or animate sexual penetration, robbery, burglary or abduction.\u201d This legislation codifies the common law doctrine of felony murder and \u201celevate[s] to murder a homicide committed during the course of a felony by imputing malice to the killing.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 351, 354, 368 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1988). \u201c[T]he felony murder statute applies where the initial felony and the homicide were parts of one continuous transaction, and were closely related in point of time, place, and causal connection.\u201d <em>Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 279, 286, 451 S.E.2d 41, 45 (1994) (holding that a fact finder could reasonably infer that an abduction with intent to rape continued until the victim\u2019s death and, therefore, felony murder occurred). Abduction is a continuing offense and \u201c \u2018it [is] for the fact finder to determine in each case ... whether the [abduction] had been terminated within the purview of [Code \u00a7 18.2-32].\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes v.

Thus, to determine whether Turner committed felony murder, we must first decide whether the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the record is such that a rational finder of fact could conclude that Turner abducted Evans with the intent to defile her.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A person commits abduction when he \u201c[b]y force, intimidation or deception and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such person of his personal liberty----\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-47.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Abduction requires proof of asportation or detention, either of which may be accomplished by force, intimidation, or deception. <em>Jerman v.

Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 683, 688, 537 S.E.2d 592, 595 (2000) (holding that the appellant accomplished the abduction through the use of both deception and intimidation). The Supreme Court of Virginia made no men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tion of any \u201crestraint\u201d upon the victim in the first abduction in <em>Jerman; </em>rather, the fact that the victim was tricked into getting into the vehicle and traveling with the co-conspirator was enough to prove abduction. 267 Va. at 439, 593 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Similarly in <em>Kent, </em>the defendant kidnapped the victim with intent to extort money for pecuniary benefit. 165 Va. at 842, 183 S.E. at 178. The evidence showed that the defendant induced the victim to accompany him to Washington, D.C., on the assurance that he would obtain money to satisfy a debt he owed her. <em>Id. </em>at 842, 183 S.E. at 177-78. The defendant argued that he could not be found guilty of kidnapping because the evidence failed to show any force or restraint was used by the accused in taking the victim with him. <em>Id. </em>at 841, 183 S.E. at 177. The Supreme Court of Virginia disagreed with the defendant and held that he was guilty of kidnapping because the evidence showed that the accused took the victim with him under \u201csuch circumstances [that] amounted to fraud and coercion on [the defendant\u2019s] part and for the purpose of pecuniary benefit____\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 842, 183 S.E. at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Thus, if based on all of the evidence before this Court, any rational fact finder could have concluded that Turner deceived Evans into leaving the club while at the same time intending to defile her, then a writ of actual innocence should not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The intent to defile element requires proof that the perpetrator intended to engage in sexual contact against the victim\u2019s will. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-61 (rape), 18.2-67.1 (forcible sodomy), 18.2-67.3 (aggravated sexual battery), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>18.2-67.1 (sexual battery). To prove that Turner abducted Evans with the intent to defile, the Commonwealth was required to prove that he had the specific intent to sexually molest her. <em>Simms v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 614, 617, 346 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1986). \u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind which may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Ridley v.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47 and 18.2-48 do not require that the deception be verbalized and, certainly, it is well settled that one\u2019s intention, such as the intent to deceive, may and often must be proven through the use of circumstantial evidence. <em>See Williams v.

Indeed, Brown\u2019s confession only establishes what occurred after he got into the car with Turner and Evans.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, Brown\u2019s confession does not change the evidence of Turner\u2019s intent to defile that was before the jury in Turner\u2019s trial. The jury was instructed that abduction with the intent to defile could be accomplished by, <em>inter alia, </em>deception and could have found that Turner deceived Evans into leaving the bar, his nefarious intent unbeknownst to her.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>cannot be said that <em>no </em>rational trier of fact <em>could </em>have found Turner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as the jury did.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Moreover, contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention that \u201cthe record is devoid of any evidence that Turner ever engaged or intended to engage in any sexual activity <em>against the will </em>of\u2019 Evans, a review of the entire record before this Court reveals that it is replete with evidence from which a rational finder of fact could reach a conclusion that Turner deceived Evans into leaving the club with him for stated innocent purposes while his true intent was to defile her. Turner testified that he only wanted to talk with Evans and that he had no sexual interest in her. Turner\u2019s actions and, more tellingly, his own words, belie his claim that he did not intend to have sex with Evans. Turner arranged for Bishop to give Brown a ride home if Turner did not return to the club by closing time. During that conversation, Bishop asked Turner if she needed to give Brown a ride home because Turner \u201cwas going home with [Evans], and [Turner] said yes.\u201d When Bishop warned Turner that \u201cif that\u2019s what [he\u2019s] going to do, use a condom,\u201d Turner just smirked and laughed in response.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The most telling piece of evidence is Turner\u2019s conversation with Fitzgibbons in which Turner stated that he and Brown were going to have a \u201cthreesome\u201d with Evans.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Within a few seconds of this, Evans approached and Turner introduced her to Fitzgibbons as she stood next to Brown. Before leaving, Fitzgibbons gave them the thumbs up sign, which Turner returned with a smile on his face.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">While Turner denies having made this statement, his petition for a writ of actual innocence supports this sequence of events and the fact that there was an exchange with him, Brown, and Fitzgibbons regarding a \u201cthreesome.\u201d In paragraph forty-seven of his petition, Turner states under oath</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB7\">Petitioner was happy with Bishop\u2019s response and he went to tell Brown about the arrangements. Petitioner remarked that the plan was if he wasn\u2019t back by 2:00 a.m., Bishop should take Brown home. Brown asked Petitioner where he was going with \u201cthat chick,\u201d and Petitioner explained. Brown was slurring his words and asked Petitioner what the chances were for him to \u201cget it on with her <em>too.\u201d </em>At that moment, [Fitzgibbons] walked up to them and asked what their plans were for the night. Brown said something to the effect, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a threesome going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOf\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Turner confirms that he talked with Brown after he arranged for Bishop to take Brown home. Based on Turner\u2019s own version of events, it is clear that Turner planned to have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>sexual encounter with Evans as Brown\u2019s response was to inquire about the chances for him to \u201cget[ ] it on with her <em>too.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The evidence is also clear that the plan was formulated for both Turner and Brown to have sex with Evans as Fitzgibbons was told that they were going to have a \u201cthreesome.\u201d While Turner tries to attribute the \u201cthreesome\u201d comment to Brown, Fitzgibbons was clear that it was a declaration made by Turner. Clearly, Brown and Turner made a plan before either left the club to have sex with Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Turner\u2019s intent to have sex with Evans despite that he did not believe Evans would agree is also clear from Evans\u2019 character. Evans\u2019 friend, Burdette, described Evans as a woman who would not speak to anyone using sexual overtures. Burdette also testified that she believed that Evans would not have been speaking to Turner had he made any sexual invitations to Evans. Evans\u2019 other friend, McCammon, similarly believed that Evans had no intent to have a \u201cromantic interlude\u201d that night. As further proof of his intent to defile Evans, Turner confirms these descriptions of Evans. He testified that during the course of the evening, he never discussed sex with her. He also echoed Evans\u2019 friends with regard to her character. Specifically, he stated that in the short time he spent with her, Evans was not the kind of woman who would have engaged in a \u201cthreesome.\u201d Yet, he spoke to two different people about having sex with her, although she and he had not discussed it. Moreover, he unreservedly declared that he was going to have a \u201cthreesome\u201d with Evans and Brown, even though he did not believe she would have willingly engaged in a \u201cthreesome.\u201d From this, a rational trier of fact could conclude that Evans was unaware of Turner\u2019s sexual plans for her and would not have willingly engaged in a \u201cthreesome,\u201d despite that being his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The record also contains evidence of Turner\u2019s aggressive nature, especially when things were not going his way. Burdette testified that Turner was \u201cexceptionally rude\u201d to her and McCammon and that he spoke to them in a \u201chorribly belligerent tone[.]\u201d Burdette told the jury that Turner \u201cpulled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>[car] door open with surprising force\u201d when he and Evans finally prevailed in devising the plan for Evans to stay with Turner for one additional hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Moreover, statements and conduct of an accused after the events that constitute the charged crime also are relevant circumstantial evidence of intent. <em>See Canipe v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 629, 645, 491 S.E.2d 747, 754 (1997). Here, Turner\u2019s callous disregard for Evans, displayed after her murder, is consistent with a finding that he intended to defile her before she was murdered. The evidence demonstrates that within minutes of Brown Wiling Evans, Turner <em>alone </em>took the lead in finding an isolated spot to dispose of her body, as both men testified that Brown passed out seconds after he killed Evans. Rather than maWng known what occurred, Turner drove from Virginia Beach to a secluded area in a Newport News city park where it was unlikely that Evans\u2019 body would be found. After finding the appropriate spot, he then woke Brown up to assist him in moving and covering Evans\u2019 body. The day after Turner witnessed Brown end a young woman\u2019s life without any provocation, Turner still desired to rent an apartment with Brown. Additionally, a few days after the police and FBI agents interviewed Turner and Brown at the naval base, Turner and Brown had occasion to peruse the current, local newspaper covering Evans\u2019 death. One of the newspapers contained a composite sketch purportedly of Turner. Throughout the meal, Turner and Brown repeatedly laughed and joked that the sketch looked nothing like Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Turner\u2019s aptitude for being convincing even when being deceptive is also demonstrated by the record. An FBI agent interviewing Turner found him to be \u201cvery calm, very collected\u201d and his answers seemed very forthright while Turner repeatedly lied to police and FBI officials about leaving the club separately from Evans. Another police officer present for the interview said that Turner \u201cseemed calm, cool. Had his thoughts about him and talked very straightforward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Thus, the record provides ample evidence of Turner\u2019s art of deception, determination to spend time with Evans, aggressive demeanor toward her friends, and unremorseful reaction after witnessing Brown end Evans\u2019 life. There is also significant, contradictory evidence of Turner\u2019s claim that he had no interest in having sexual relations with Evans and his attempts to facilitate such relations. The evidence further proves that Turner walked Evans to his car on the pretext of waiting for her friends. He did not disclose to her his stated intention to Fitzgibbons to have a \u201cthreesome\u201d -with her and Brown. Certainly, the act of engaging in a \u201cthreesome\u201d does not, in and of itself, provide evidence of Turner\u2019s intent to defile Evans. However, the evidence in the record when considered as a whole\u2014including Turner\u2019s belief that Evans would not be receptive to sexual advances, Turner\u2019s claims that he had no interest in having sexual relations with Evans, and his declaration to Fitzgibbons that he intended to have a \u201cthreesome\u201d with Evans\u2014enables a rational trier of fact to infer that Turner intended to have sexual relations with Evans against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">As discussed above, the record <em>in toto </em>provides more than sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that Turner deceived Evans into going to his car with the true intent of both he and Brown having a \u201cthreesome\u201d with Evans against her will. Moreover, the fact finder could also reasonably find that this was a shared intent as Brown was present when Turner told Fitzgibbons that he and Brown intended to have a \u201cthreesome\u201d with Evans. The evidence also demonstrates that when Turner saw Brown approaching, he cautioned Evans not to believe a word Brown said. The evidence further shows that when Brown joined Evans and Turner in Turner\u2019s car, Brown asked Evans whether she was a virgin and whether she had ever had sex with a \u201cfrogman\u201d immediately before \u201csnapping\u201d and killing her. From all of this evidence, a rational trier of fact <em>could </em>conclude that Brown and Turner intended to forcibly have sexual relations with Evans and that Brown killed Evans when she rebuffed his advances. The trier of fact could have found that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of this shared sexual desire, the abduction had not ended prior to Evans\u2019 murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Based on all of the evidence in the record, it cannot be said that Brown\u2019s credible recantation provides this Court with clear and convincing evidence that no rational fact finder could have found that Turner used deception to abduct Evans with the intent to have sexual intercourse with her against her will. Therefore, Turner was properly convicted of abduction with intent to defile and murder. Accordingly, we dismiss his petition for a writ of actual innocence and vacate the August 4, 2009 order issued by a panel of this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-15\">. Brown was also convicted of the attempted rape of Evans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. Fitzgibbons admitted that he was drinking that night, but could not remember how much he consumed other than less than twelve beers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. Several other witnesses also testified that Turner and Brown had a reputation for having group sexual encounters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. The concurring opinion states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">[p]rior to its decision to grant the writ of actual innocence, the three-judge panel of this Court made two preliminary decisions that were critical to the ultimate outcome. The first was to defer ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss. The second was to remand the case to the circuit court for a factual finding regarding the credibility of the testimony of Billy Brown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">This opinion repeatedly refers to \u201cthe panel.\" As set forth by statute, \"[ejach panel [of this Court] shall hear and determine, <em>independently </em>of the others, ... the other cases assigned to that panel.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-402(C) (emphasis added). Thus, it must be noted that the divided panel that granted Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence was a separate panel from the one that referred the matter to the circuit court for factual findings. The concurring opinion relies upon the position that the first panel did not rule on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss. Contrary to this position, the referring panel did not defer ruling on the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss. \"Motion to Dismiss\u201d is the style that the Commonwealth gave its response to Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence. Indeed, the relief sought by the Commonwealth was that this Court \"should not order an evidentiary hearing but should dismiss the petition.\u201d Thus, by referring the matter to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing and ultimately sending the matter on to be heard on its merits, the referring panel implicitly denied the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\">. This Court posed this fourth question to the circuit court upon a motion by Turner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b455-5\">. It appears that there are two versions of an affidavit signed by Brown. In one version, which was notarized and presented in support of Turner\u2019s petition, Brown stated that Evans died instantly, and in the other, Brown stated that she revived and he choked her a second time killing her. At oral argument, the Commonwealth asserted that the existence of the two differing versions was critically important to the circuit court\u2019s determination of Brown's credibility. Specifically, the Commonwealth argued that it was entirely possible that the circuit court would have found Brown not to be credible if it had known of the two versions. Even though both versions of the affidavit were not physically before the circuit court, the fact that a discrepancy existed between them was before the circuit court. The Commonwealth questioned Brown at the evidentiary hearing about the version of the affidavit in which Brown said that he had to strangle Evans twice to kill her and his earlier testimony at the hearing that Evans died instantly. More specifically, during cross-examination, the following was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">[Commonwealth:] Let me read you a few sentences of this affidavit you signed----He did not encourage me in any way and, in fact, I remember one instance while I was choking Jennifer!,] Dustin tried to pull my hands away. Jennifer became unconscious and I believed she was dead. I fell back in the seat, and she woke up. I then choked her again until blood came out of her nose and am certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>she was dead at that time. We were still in the parking lot. I do not know why I did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">That statement reflects, does it not, that she was not killed instantly or rendered helpless instantly but, in fact, revived and you had to choke her a second time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">[Brown:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Brown then responded affirmatively when asked by the Commonwealth: \u201c[W]as there a period where [Evans] was seemingly unconscious or worse and then revived and then you had to assault her a second time?\"</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Despite these contradictions, the circuit court found that Brown\u2019s testimony in that proceeding was credible, and we are bound by that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. The concurrence avers that \"the new evidence must <em>conclusively </em>show that the petitioner\u2019s guilt is <em>a factual impossibility.\" </em>(Emphases added). It attempts to draw a distinction based on the level of certainty of guilt provided by DNA evidence as compared to what it views as the lesser degree of certainty provided by testimonial evidence. The concurring opinion views after-discovered testimonial evidence as \"uncertain\" because \"when a witness testifies to a fact,\" he \u201ccould be telling the truth as he understands it, but he could be mistaken due to poor eyesight or poor memory,\" or he \"[could] appear entirely credible[ ] but actually be lying.\" It posits, as a result, that \"testimony can be credible\u2014that is, believable\u2014without being factually dispositive of the issue of innocence.\u201d Although this statement is certainly true in the abstract, the concurrence implies that the circuit court's finding on referral that Brown\u2019s testimony is credible does not mean we must accept Brown\u2019s testimony over other evidence, presented at trial, with which it conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">What the concurrence fails to acknowledge is that both our legal system in general and the actual innocence statutes in particular equate credibility with truth. If the fact finder\u2014in this case the circuit court to which the matter was referred for additional findings\u2014concludes the testimony given on referral is credible, we treat that testimony as \"the truth.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 315, 323-24, 641 S.E.2d 480, 484-85 (2007) (using the terms \"truth\u201d and \"credibility\u201d interchangeably in analyzing the impact of the circuit court\u2019s findings on referral); <em>see also, e.g., Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 666, 671, 636 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2006) (holding that on direct appellate review, \"we must \u2018regard as <em>true </em>all the <em>credible </em>evidence favorable to [the parly who prevailed below]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphases added))). Further, no practical distinction exists in our jurisprudence between \"truth\" based on testimonial evidence and \"truth\u201d based on scientific evidence such as DNA. Just as the accuracy of eyewitness testimony depends on factors such as perception, memory, and credibility, DNA evidence depends upon the qualification and credibility of the analyst and the quality control and other procedures of the laboratory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. This confession is a recantation because it unequivocally repudiates the version of events implicating Turner that Brown gave to investigators in 1995 and under oath at his own trial in 1996. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1295 (8th ed.2004) (defining the term \"recant\u201d as \"[t]o withdraw or renounce <em>prior statements </em>or testimony formally or publicly\u201d) (emphasis added). It is immaterial that Brown did not testify at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Turner\u2019s trial, especially in light of the sworn testimony Brown had previously given at his own trial, which clearly demonstrated his intent to incriminate Turner if he were called. Brown's recantation testimony was unavailable at the time of Turner\u2019s original trial, and the Commonwealth does not contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. The concurrence asserts that it was unnecessary to remand this matter to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing. As previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>mentioned, two separate panels addressed different issues in this case. It is the decision by the second panel, the merit panel, that is before this Court sitting <em>en banc. </em>As set forth by the General Assembly, this Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4b\">shall sit en banc (i) when there is a dissent in the panel to which the case was originally assigned and an aggrieved party requests an en banc hearing and at least four judges of the court vote in favor of such a hearing or (ii) when any judge of any panel shall certify that in his opinion a decision of such panel of the court is in conflict with a prior decision of the court or of any panel thereof and three other judges of the court concur in that view. The court may sit en banc upon its own motion at any time, in any case in which a majority of the court determines it appropriate to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Code \u00a7 17.1\u2014402(D). Contrary to the view expressed by the concurrence, the issue of whether the referring panel needlessly sent the matter back to the circuit court for factual findings is not an issue on which either party sought review, nor is it an issue granted by this Court for consideration <em>en banc. </em>The panel's decision to remand the case for factual findings was unanimous, and no judge has certified that the panel decision was in conflict with a prior decision of this Court. Moreover, this Court has made no motion, joined by a majority of the Court, to sit <em>en banc </em>to reconsider the referring panel\u2019s decision to remand the matter to the circuit court. Therefore, the referring panel\u2019s decision is not before this Court sitting <em>en banc. </em>To determine at this juncture that the decision to remand was improper, without complying with Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D), or allowing the parties to brief the issue, would be inappropriate. This case is in a different procedural posture from that of <em>Startin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 26, 690 S.E.2d 310 (2010) <em>(en banc), </em>in which this Court most recently overruled a prior panel decision. In <em>Startin, </em>this Court was specifically asked on brief to consider the continuing viability of <em>Sprouse v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 548, 453 S.E.2d 303 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">. Because the concurrence asserts that it was unnecessary to remand this matter to the circuit court, it further contends that the credibility determinations made by that circuit court are irrelevant. Specifically, in footnote 36, the concurring opinion states that in <em>Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>at 342-43, 641 S.E.2d at 490, the Supreme Court of Virginia recited \"the standard of review that <em>it </em>would apply in its appellate function of reviewing this Court\u2019s dismissal of an actual innocence petition\u201d and held that the circuit court\u2019s \"factual findings pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12 are only binding if they are approved by the Court of Appeals.\u201d This interpretation of <em>Carpitcher </em>considers only part of the pronouncement by the Supreme Court of Virginia and ignores the analytical framework clearly outlined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Contrary to the concurring opinion\u2019s position that the Supreme Court of Virginia was referring only to the standard of analysis that it would apply to factual findings as approved by this Court, clearly the Supreme Court was also indicating that because factual findings referred to and made by the circuit court under the Writ of Actual Innocence code sections are similar to those in habeas corpus cases, the same standard of deference, i.e., that findings are binding unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, applies to our treatment of the circuit court\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-654(C)(1) confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of Virginia to consider and award writs of habeas corpus in cases where the petitioner is held under a sentence of death. In such cases, the Supreme Court of Virginia may order the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to make necessary factual findings as instructed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\"><em>. </em>Although the <em>en banc </em>Court may revisit the legal significance of the circuit court\u2019s findings on referral, the concurrence's position that the statute requires us to view Brown\u2019s recantation testimony as \"just another piece of evidence that the jury would have considered\u201d strips the statute of its primary purpose in allowing for referral to the circuit court and flies in the face of the holdings in <em>Carpitcher </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>A fundamental issue in dispute at this stage of our review of Turner\u2019s petition is our treatment of the circuit court's findings. This Court is bound by the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13, which dictates that we are to give \u201cconsideration\u201d to \u201cany findings certified from the circuit court pursuant to an order issued [under Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12].\u201d <em>See Marble Techs., Inc., </em>279 Va. at 418, 690 S.E.2d at 88. We, therefore, must consider, at this stage of the proceedings, the circuit court\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of Brown's confession, along \"with all of the other evidence in the current record,\u201d to reach our ultimate decision of whether Turner has \u201dprove[d] that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11. In other words, we may not simply ignore the circuit court's findings as though they had never been made, as the concurrence advocates. Upon our referral, <em>the circuit court </em>acted as the fact finder to determine whether Brown\u2019s most recent statement was his definitive testimony regarding what happened rather than just \"one more in a series of conflicting and unreliable tales.\u201d The concurring opinion, in noting it is \u201cquite reasonable to conclude that a hypothetical juror would have chosen to ignore Brown\u2019s testimony in its entirely and decide the case on the same evidence considered by the original jury,\u201d mistakenly ignores the fact that the circuit court, with regard to the questions referenced from this Court, became the fact finder, i.e., the hypothetical juror of which the concurrence speaks\u2014a substitute for the original trial jury\u2014and concluded that Brown\u2019s recantation testimony should be credited in the context of the questions posed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Here, because the circuit court found Brown\u2019s recantation testimony that he alone restrained and killed Evans to be credible in the context of the entire record, we must evaluate the record by rejecting all evidence that is in conflict with the circuit court\u2019s findings before assessing whether \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d upon the evidence that remains.

The dissent states that \"[i]f X says that he did it and that Y did not participate in any way, and the jury believes X, there is no legal way to convict Y.\u201d This analysis grossly oversimplifies the question of Turner\u2019s guilt because the fact finder in Turner\u2019s original trial was instructed as to felony murder, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that this is a novel theory, and Brown\u2019s most recent recitation of events that has been accepted as credible states only that Turner did not participate in restraining or murdering Evans. Brown\u2019s confession is silent, as it necessarily must be, as to <em>Turner's intent at the time that he left the club with Evans. </em>Thus, based on the theory of this case presented to the fact finder\u2014i.e., felony murder predicated on Turner\u2019s abduction of Evans with the intent to defile her\u2014it cannot be said that there is \"no legal way to convict\u201d Turner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. The dissent's determination that \"[t]he circuit court, by referring to the murder and the restraint in the disjunctive, contemplated Brown\u2019s recantation in light of both the actual killing and the underlying crime of abduction\" is unsupported and requires an inferential leap.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">. We have received correspondence from the Commonwealth alleging that it has discovered evidence that would call into question the credibility of Brown\u2019s recantation and tend to support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Turner\u2019s guilt. The Commonwealth has neither made a formal motion nor asked anything of this Court in light of this alleged evidence. Assuming, without deciding, that this information is credible, it would only strengthen our position. Therefore, even if the Commonwealth properly asked this Court to consider the alleged new evidence, it would at best be cumulative and not change the disposition of Turner's petition for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">.

The dissent refers to <em>Kent </em>and <em>Jerman </em>as cases where the appellants told \"specific lies\u201d to accomplish the abductions. However, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47 and 18.2\u201448 do not require that the deception be verbalized and, certainly, it is well settled that one's intention, such as the intent to deceive, may and often must be proven through the use of circumstantial evidence. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 194, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (reiterating that \"[a]bsent a direct admission by the defendant, intent ... must necessarily be proved by circumstantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. When Kent was convicted the then in effect statute stated, \"[i]f any person seize, take or secrete any other person with intent to extort money, or pecuniary benefit, he shall be punished with death, or within the discretion of the jury be confined in the penitentiary not less than eight nor more than twenty years.\u201d The holding in <em>Kent </em>points out the error in the dissent\u2019s position that every abduction necessarily includes restraint. Indeed, that was the very defense advanced by Kent\u2014that he could not be found guilly of kidnapping because the evidence failed to show force or restraint. The Supreme Court of Virginia disagreed, holding that the evidence was sufficient because he took the victim by fraud or coercion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. In his confession, Brown reiterates his prior statements that he did not intend to have sex that night. His recent confession, however, has no bearing on what a reasonable fact finder could conclude about Turner\u2019s and Brown\u2019s sexual intent prior to Brown joining Evans and Turner in Turner\u2019s car because Brown\u2019s confession and the credibility finding made by the circuit court focused on the details of how he killed Evans and what followed after he met them in the car. Indeed, Brown\u2019s protestations that he was not sexually interested in Evans are belied by his interview with Turner\u2019s attorney and by his own testimony at the evidentiary hearing where he recounted his sexual overtures toward Evans immediately upon getting into Turner\u2019s car and admitted to trying to have intercourse with Evans\u2019 corpse twice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. Though the record, unfortunately, is devoid of the closing arguments made to the jury in Turner\u2019s trial, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s ruling on Turner\u2019s motion to strike and from the jury instructions specifically stating that Turner could have used \"force, intimidation or deception [to] seize, take, transport, detain or secrete ... Evans\u201d that the abduction by deception theory was advanced in the trial court. In ruling on Turner\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court held that there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>evidence from which a fact finder could conclude that Evans did not \"knowingly and willingly [go] with ... Turner to the parking lot or to his car for the purposes of engaging in a threesome or what has been discussed as group sex with [Turner] and ... Brown; but we certainly know from the evidence in this case that that was the defendant\u2019s intent----It\u2019s clear from all the circumstances in evidence in this case that the defendant had a sexual mode; and, of course, his specific intent to defile or sexually molest ... can be derived not only from his conduct <em>but from his statements as well.\" </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">. Bishop testified as such in Brown\u2019s trial. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(C) permits the Commonwealth\u2019s response to a petition for a writ of actual innocence to \"contain a proffer of any evidence pertaining to the guilt of the petitioner that is not included in the record of the case, including evidence that was suppressed at trial.\u201d Moreover, \u201d[t]he Court of Appeals may inspect the record of any trial or appellate court action, and the Court may, in any case, award a writ of certiorari to the clerk of the respective court below, and have brought before the Court the whole record or any part of any record.\" Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(D). Here, the Commonwealth requested and the circuit court ordered, without objection from Turner\u2019s counsel, that the entire record in Brown\u2019s trial be made a part of the record in Turner\u2019s petition for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>writ of actual innocence. Thus, all of the testimony given in Brown's trial may be considered by this Court when determining whether a writ of actual innocence should issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">.

Therefore, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Before we can address the merits of Turner\u2019s petition, I believe that we must address the distinct procedural posture of this case. Prior to its decision to grant the writ of actual innocence, the three-judge panel of this Court made two preliminary decisions that were critical to the ultimate outcome. The first was to defer ruling on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss. The second was to remand the case to the circuit court for a factual finding regarding the credibility of the testimony of Billy Joe Brown. Before this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can address the merits of the petition, we must address whether those two decisions are binding upon the full court. For me, the answer to that question is no. I believe that once this Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>it did more than just stay the panel\u2019s decision that the writ should issue. I believe our grant of rehearing <em>en banc </em>also effectively vacated the other two decisions made by the panel. Thus, I believe that the full Court is bound by neither the panel\u2019s decision that further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>development of the facts by way of a remand is required, nor the panel\u2019s order to the circuit court setting out the specific factual findings to be made by that court. For this reason, I believe that Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence as well as the motion to dismiss filed by the Attorney General are now before this Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>for our <em>de novo </em>consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I further conclude that in considering Turner\u2019s petition and the supporting affidavit, we are bound by the General Assembly\u2019s manifest intent that the writ was to be an extraordinary measure granting extraordinary relief. The General Assembly did not choose to call this the \u201cwrit of more likely than not innocent,\u201d or even the \u201cwrit of probably innocent.\u201d It chose the phrase the \u201cwrit of actual innocence\u201d because it intended for this writ to issue only when the newly-discovered evidence was of such a compelling nature that no reasonable juror would disagree that the defendant was both factually and legally innocent. Because I believe that the evidence that Turner has offered falls woefully short of the extremely high burden of proof established by the General Assembly, I believe this Court need go no further than to grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">I. Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">At the outset, I note that both the majority and the dissent refer to the \u201cstandard of review\u201d to be used in analyzing this case. This is an example of how this Court has conflated our traditional appellate role with our role as the court having original jurisdiction in this case. There is no \u201cstandard of review\u201d because we are not reviewing anything. We, the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc, </em>are charged by statute with assessing the weight to be assigned to the evidence before us and making the initial decision on whether the writ should issue.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Neither the majority nor the dissent have addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>this unique procedural posture\u2014how does a multi-panel appellate court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>consider a matter of original jurisdiction? I believe that this fundamental procedural Gordian knot must be unraveled before we can begin to consider the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In doing so, we need to recognize why this case is unique among other cases that come before us. First, the General Assembly vested this Court\u2014not the circuit court\u2014with original jurisdiction over cases involving actual innocence petitions based on non-biological evidence. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Original jurisdiction is the \u201cjurisdiction to take cognizance of a case at the outset, to try it, and to decide the issues.\u201d Bryan A. Gamer, <em>A Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage, </em>626 (2d ed.1995). One group of issues we are responsible for deciding are the factual findings that ultimately determine the outcome of the case. These factual findings include both the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (The trier of fact has \u201cthe responsibility ... fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d). And, the term \u201c[t]he weight of the evidence refers to a determination [by] the trier of fact that a greater amount of credible evidence supports one side of an issue or cause than the other.\u201d <em>Tibbs v. Florida, </em>457 U.S. 31, 37-38, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 2216, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To be clear, the General Assembly\u2019s grant of original jurisdiction to decide cases involving writs of actual innocence to this Court means that this Court sits as a trial court in these cases.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Just like the Supreme Court of Virginia, when exercising its original jurisdiction, this Court \u201cconsiders the evidence and makes factual determinations <em>de novo.\u201d Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm\u2019n v. Lewis, </em>264 Va. 401, 405, 568 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2002). Thus, it is this Court\u2019s ultimate responsibility to make both the findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to determine whether a writ should issue.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Additionally, when this Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>it vacated the panel opinion in this case. <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 423 n. 3, 642 S.E.2d 282, 287 n. 3 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cThe grant of <em>en banc </em>review <em>vacates </em>the prior panel opinion <em>in toto.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added), <em>cited with approval in Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 747, 755, 668 S.E.2d 150, 155 (2008). This view of the effect of a grant of a rehearing <em>en banc </em>is consistent with that employed by a majority of the United States Courts of Appeals, which employ an <em>en banc </em>process similar to that employed by this Court. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c); Fed. R.App. P. 35 <em>with </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D) (setting forth the procedures for <em>en banc </em>review in the United States Courts of Appeal and this Court, respectively); see <em>also </em>Hon. George C. Pratt, 20A-355 <em>Moore\u2019s Fed. Practice\u2014Civil </em>\u00a7 335.11 (\u201cThe effect of an order granting <em>en banc </em>rehearing on the panel\u2019s decision depends on local practice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The Fourth Circuit falls within this majority, <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cGranting of rehearing <em>en banc </em>vacates the previous panel judgment and opinion.\u201d), along with eight other federal circuits. <em>See, e.g., SEC v. Tambone, </em>597 F.3d 436, 450 (1st Cir.2010) (reinstating portions of panel opinion that were vacated upon grant of rehearing); <em>Guilmette v. Howes, </em>591 F.3d 505 (6th Cir.Ct.App. 2010) (granting rehearing <em>en banc, </em>and noting that Local Rule 35(a) of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals provides that \u201c[t]he effect of granting a hearing <em>en banc </em>shall be to vacate the previous opinion and judgment of this court, to stay the mandate and to restore the case on the docket sheet as a pending appeal\u201d); <em>Wis. Cmty. Servs. v. City of Milwaukee, </em>Rec. No. 04-1966 (7th Cir.Ct.App. Aug. 31, 2005) (granting rehearing <em>en banc, </em>vacating the panel\u2019s decision and judgment, staying the mandate, and restoring the case to the docket as a pending appeal); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1186 n. 8 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe Court\u2019s decision to rehear a case <em>en banc </em>effectively means that the original three-judge panel never existed---- [T]he <em>en banc </em>court acts as if it were hearing the case on appeal for the first time.\u201d); 5th Cir. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>41.3 (\u201cUnless otherwise expressly provided, the granting of a rehearing <em>en banc </em>vacates the panel opinion and judgment of the court and stays the mandate.\u201d); 11th Cir. R. 35.11 (\u201cUnless otherwise expressly provided, the effect of granting a rehearing <em>en banc </em>is to vacate the panel opinion and to stay the mandate.\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180 (2d Cir.N.Y.2008) (noting that the panel opinion was vacated <em>after </em>the <em>en banc </em>hearing); 10th Cir. R. 35.6 (\u201cThe grant of rehearing <em>en banc </em>vacates the judgment, stays the mandate, and restores the case on the docket as a pending appeal. The panel decision is not vacated unless the court so orders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Because the decision to rehear a case <em>en banc </em>\u201ceffectively means that the original three judge panel never existed,\u201d <em>Socop-Gonzalez, </em>272 F.3d at 1186 n. 8, logic dictates that decisions of the panel that were critical to the ultimate outcome of the case are vacated as well. Otherwise, those members of this Court who were not members of the panel would be precluded from exercising their independent judgment regarding the merits of the entire petition. Hence, this Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>is not bound by any of the panel\u2019s decisions in this case. All of those decisions were a component of the panel\u2019s final order that was nullified by this Court\u2019s decision to grant a rehearing in this case. Therefore, as the Court with original jurisdiction, this Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>has both the authority and the duty to decide the issues presented in this case as if the panel proceedings had never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The majority\u2019s reliance on what appears to be an application of the interpanel accord doctrine,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>see supra </em>at 406, n. 4, 694 S.E.2d at 258, n. 4; 411-12 n. 9, 694 S.E.2d at 261-62 n. 9, ignores the fact that this case is before us for consideration by the full court. The majority notes that the panel that determined to certify this case for a credibility finding was separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>from the panel that ultimately granted the writ in this case, and to address the first panel\u2019s decision at this time would be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While it is true that two separate panels were involved in this case, it cannot be said that the first panel\u2019s decision was final or binding. This was an interlocutory order reflecting the initial panel\u2019s decision to take further evidence, not a disposition of the case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Further, even if the initial panel\u2019s remand order were a final decision, this Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>\u201cmay overrule any previous decision by any panel or of the full court.\u201d Code 17.1-402(D). And it matters not whether the decision to be overruled is from the case on which we granted <em>en banc </em>review, or a previous decision of another panel. <em>Startin v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 26, 39-40, 690 S.E.2d 310, 316 (2010) (Powell, J.) (finding \u201ca mistake exist[ed] in our prior decisions\u201d and \u201cexercising] our authority under Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D) [to] overrule [that decision]\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Thus, I believe that my colleagues\u2019 position that we are now bound by the original panel\u2019s decision to certify this case to the circuit court for a credibility determination, as well as the results of that credibility determination, is mistaken. The Commonwealth petitioned this Court to rehear the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>When we granted that petition, we completely vacated the panel\u2019s order. Upon the grant of rehearing <em>en bam:, </em>the panel\u2019s decision, and all that went along with it, was nullified, and we must determine this case anew. Accordingly, I conclude that this case is in the same posture before this Court <em>en bane </em>as a misdemeanor conviction appealed from a district court to a circuit court\u2014we start over.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In 1996, a jury convicted Dustin Turner of acting in concert with Billy Joe Brown in the abduction with intent to defile and the murder of Jennifer Evans. In an earlier jury trial, Brown had been convicted of the same crimes, as well as one count of attempted rape. This Court affirmed Brown\u2019s convictions, <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 315, 504 S.E.2d 399 (1998), and, in an unpublished order, denied Turner\u2019s petition for appeal on the issues of sufficiency and admissibility of evidence, <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 0381-97-1 (Va. Ct.App. Jan. 23, 1998). The Virginia Supreme Court also denied both Turner and Brown\u2019s petitions for appeal. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 980220 (Va. May 29, 1998); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 982174 (Va. Feb. 23,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Four years later, Brown provided a new version of the events of the crime that was inconsistent with his testimony at his own trial and the sundry other versions of the crime to which he had previously subscribed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At that time, in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>interview with Turner\u2019s attorney, Brown stated that he acted alone in killing Jennifer Evans. This newest version of the facts was consistent with, and apparently based on, Turner\u2019s testimony at Turner\u2019s trial. At that time, Turner testified that he and Jennifer Evans had been sitting together in the front seat of his car, which was parked in a busy parking lot of a bar. Brown came out of the bar and sat in the back seat behind Evans. According to Turner, Brown became enraged and suddenly reached around the seat and choked Jennifer Evans until she died. Turner testified that he was in shock, had made a futile attempt to pull Brown\u2019s arms off of Evans, and, when commanded to by Brown, had driven away. Turner maintained that Evans died almost instantaneously.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The transcript of Brown\u2019s 2002 interview was filed by Turner as support for his petition. It begins with Brown explaining that during the days and weeks leading up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>murder, he engaged in heavy alcohol, steroid, and marijuana use. On the actual day of the murder, Brown consumed a large quantity of alcohol as well. Because of Brown\u2019s self-destructive behavior, he could only remember \u201cbits and pieces\u201d of the events on the night Jennifer Evans died, both because of his impaired memory and because he had blacked out several times that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">While Brown\u2019s new statement is consistent with Turner\u2019s testimony at Turner\u2019s trial, it is important to note that this \u201cnewly discovered testimony\u201d is simply a version of the facts that had been presented to, and rejected by, Turner\u2019s jury. In fact, three times in his recorded statement, Brown indicated that portions of his \u201cmemories\u201d of that night came from reading Turner\u2019s statement. First, Brown could not recall how he came to be in Jennifer Evans\u2019 presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">I left [the bar] and went to find [Turner]. I saw him in the car, him and Jennifer was [sic] sitting in the car. I had gotten in the car and they let me in the back seat and I began talking with them and <em>I read Dustin </em>[sic] testimony and honestly I don\u2019t remember all the bits and pieces, I only remember bits and pieces, I don\u2019t remember all the details.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUM\">(Emphasis added). Second, when Turner\u2019s attorney asked Brown what he, Turner, and Evans discussed while all three of them were in the car, Brown\u2019s memory failed him: \u201cHonestly I vaguely remember. I think I was making rude comments to her. What [sic] <em>I read the report that Dusty had given </em>and I was making comments to her.\u201d (Emphasis added). Finally, when Turner\u2019s attorney asked Brown what Turner was doing while Brown was choking the victim\u2014a critical question considering that Turner\u2019s conviction was predicated on a concert of action theory\u2014Brown responded, \u201cHonestly, I vaguely remember a little bit <em>but I read in his [Turner\u2019s] report </em>that he had tried to pull my hand away and I think I do recall, I believe at one point, I believe I recall his hand on my arm.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Turner\u2019s attorney subsequently had the recorded statement reduced to an affidavit for the purposes of Turner\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>for actual innocence. In the version of the affidavit<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that was submitted with the petition for actual innocence, Brown described the act of Evans\u2019 murder as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">I left the bar and went to find Dusty. I saw him in the parking lot. He and Jennifer were sitting in the car. I had gotten in the car and they let me in the back seat and I began talking with them. I was being vulgar and I vaguely recall [sic]. We were sitting there talking and next thing you know I reached up and choked Jennifer. I did this on my own without any prior discussion with Dustin Turner. He did not encourage me in any way and in fact, I remember one instance while I was choking Jennifer, Dustin trying to pull my hands away. Jennifer became unconscious and I am certain she was dead at that time. We were still in the parking lot. I do not know why I did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Turner, relying on the affidavit, then filed a petition for a writ of actual innocence in this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.10 through 19.2-327.13. The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Brown\u2019s inherently incredible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>statement could not meet the burden of proof imposed on Turner by Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13. Upon consideration of the pleadings and the record, a panel of this Court, without acting on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss, certified this case to the circuit court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> with instructions to assess Brown\u2019s credibility. Because the circuit court found Brown\u2019s statement credible,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the panel granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Turner\u2019s petition. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 458, 491-92, 680 S.E.2d 312, 329 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Upon the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing, this Court granted an <em>en banc </em>hearing to consider Turner\u2019s petition. As discussed above, because this Court has original jurisdiction in cases involving writs of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence, it is our responsibility to determine both the scope of the evidence before us and the merits of Turner\u2019s petition. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.10. Finally, this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>must now \u201cconsider and decide the case\u201d and in doing so we \u201cmay overrule any previous decision of any panel or of the fuH court.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">I believe that the record before us is sufficient to decide the case and no further development of the facts is necessary. Upon consideration of that record, I believe we must grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss Turner\u2019s petition. The evidence upon which Turner exclusively relies\u2014Brown\u2019s affidavit and statement\u2014simply does not meet the high burden of proof set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.11 and 19.2-327.13. Brown\u2019s highly impeachable and dubious statement does not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>and never could, prove that Turner is factually and legally innocent of the crime for which the jury convicted him. Hence, as the subsequent discussion shows, there is no reason for this Court to remand the case to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing. This Court is perfectly capable of evaluating the petition and supporting affidavit in light of the statutory burden of proof. Simply put, Turner\u2019s proffered after-discovered evidence simply is not of the requisite conclusive nature to warrant granting the writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u201cOnce a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and convicted of the offense for which he was charged, the presumption of innocence disappears____\u201d <em>Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 399-400, 113 S.Ct. 853, 860, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). Accordingly, \u201cin the eyes of the law, petitioner does not come before the Court as one who is \u2018innocent,\u2019 but, on the contrary, as one who has been convicted by due process of law of [a] brutal murder[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to overcome the fact that he is, as a matter of law, guilty of Jennifer Evans\u2019 murder, Dustin Turner must meet quite possibly the heaviest burden the law imposes. According to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11, a petitioner must produce evidence that is not only material to the issue of actual innocence, but is also the kind of evidence that \u201cwhen considered with all of the evidence in the current record ... <em>prove[s] </em>that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">This Court is required to apply Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii) in a manner that is \u201charmonious with its legislative purpose and [to] avoid any construction defeating that purpose.\u201d <em>Carpitcher v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 335, 345, 641 S.E.2d 486, 492 (2007). To that end, we must \u201cconsider the words the legislature has employed, the subject matter of the statutes governing writs of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence, the statutes\u2019 apparent object, and the legislative purpose in enacting the statutes[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003); <em>Commonwealth v. Bruhn, </em>264 Va. 597, 602, 570 S.E.2d 866, 869 (2002); <em>Lucy v.

Holland, </em>138 Va. 519, 527-28, 122 S.E. 430, 432-33 (1924)). The history of both the biological and non-biological writs of actual innocence is instructive as to the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting them. Hence, a discussion of that history can guide this Court in applying the law in accordance with the General Assembly\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">A. <em>Statutory History</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZg\">1. Development of the Writ</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Approximately a decade ago, scientific advances and Virginia\u2019s twenty-one-day rule collided. At that time, an individual who had been convicted of a crime could only challenge his conviction on the basis of after-discovered evidence within twenty-one days of the trial court\u2019s entry of final judgment\u2014 regardless of whether the evidence completely exonerated him. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1. Advances in the preservation, extraction, and analysis of human biological evidence, commonly referred to as DNA evidence, highlighted a flaw in the application of the twenty-one-day rule. Using DNA evidence, several convicts, including one on death row,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> were able to conclusively prove that they did not commit the crimes for which they had been convicted. In each of these cases, the proof of innocence often was only obtained well after the twenty-one-day period had run. <em>See, e.g., </em>William J. Dinkin and Cullen D. Seltzer, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>35 U. Rich L.Rev. 537, 561-64 (2001); Marjorie A. Shields, <em>DNA Evidence as Newly Discovered Evidence Which Will Warrant Grant of New Trial or Other Postconviction Relief in Criminal Case, </em>125 A.L.R.5th 497 (collecting cases, statutes, and court rules). Virginia was thus placed in the indefensible position of prohibiting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>individual who was demonstrably and factually innocent of a crime from seeking judicial relief from his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In response to that situation, our General Assembly created an exceedingly narrow exception to Virginia\u2019s twenty-one-day rule: the writ of actual innocence based on after-discovered biological evidence (biological evidence writ). 2001 Va. Acts ch. 878, 874; <em>see also 35 </em>U. Rich L.Rev. at 562 (discussing the passage of the writ of actual innocence based on after-discovered biological evidence); Crime Comm\u2019n Rep. at 5 (discussing the twenty-one-day rule).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Following the enactment of the biological evidence writ, members of the General Assembly recognized that there could be other conclusive, exonerating evidence besides DNA evidence, and proposed the creation of a writ of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence. Crime Comm\u2019n Rep. at 7, 12. According to the Crime Commission\u2019s Report, the proposed legislation was designed to \u201cuse[ ] <em>the same high level of proof </em>that must be met in order to obtain relief\u2019 under the biological evidence writ. <em>Id. </em>at 16 (emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s proposed legislation, which eventually became the writ for actual innocence based on non-biological innocence, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-327.10 through 19.2-327.13, closely tracked the language of the biological evidence writ and, just like the biological evidence writ, reflected Virginia courts\u2019 long-held suspicion of after-discovered evidence. Crime Comm\u2019n Rep. at 13. Because the General Assembly relied \u201con Virginia\u2019s traditional treatment of after-discovered evidence,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 7 <em>&amp; </em>7 n. 13, the writs reflect the deference with which Virginia has always viewed the final judgment of a trial court, <em>In re Carpitcher, </em>47 Va.App. 513, 526, 624 S.E.2d 700, 706 (2006) (\u201cA verdict resulting from a trial, during which the evidence has been tested by the adversarial process, is presumed to be correct, and, thus, a heavy burden is placed upon those seeking to overturn it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">2. After-Discovered Evidence Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">As part of that deference for the finality of judgment, Virginia law views motions for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence with disfavor. They \u201care considered with special care and caution, and are awarded with great reluctance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Tweed, </em>264 Va. 524, 528, 570 S.E.2d 797, 800 (2002). This is so because the law \u201cgive[s] every litigant one, and only one, opportunity of presenting his case to the jury or before the court, and when this has been had, the results of the trial will not usually be disturbed____\u201d <em>Pauley v. Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 510, 518, 144 S.E. 361, 363 (1928). It is well settled in Virginia law that a new trial will be granted on the grounds of after-discovered evidence only if the moving party can prove that: 1) the evidence was discovered since the trial; 2) the evidence could not, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered before the trial terminated; 3) the evidence is material and such as ought to produce a different result on the next trial; and 4) the evidence is not merely cumulative, corroborative, or collateral. <em>See, e.g., Avent v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 175, 206, 688 S.E.2d 244, 261 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">However, in recognition that the relief sought by actual innocence petitioners is complete exoneration and release from prison\u2014instead of a new trial\u2014the burden of proof an actual innocence petitioner must meet with his after-discovered evidence is much higher. Criminal defendants seeking a new trial need only show that the after-discovered evidence would <em>likely </em>lead to a different result upon retrial. In sharp contrast, actual innocence petitioners must produce clear and convincing evidence that proves that \u201cno rational trier of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in light of the newly-discovered evidence, taken together with the rest of the evidence in the case. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2\u2014327.3(A)(vii); 19.2-327.11(A)(vii). In other words, the new evidence must conclusively show that the petitioner\u2019s guilt is a factual impossibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The General Assembly, as reflected in the language of the statute and the purpose of the legislation, intended that an actual innocence petitioner\u2014regardless of whether he proceeds under the biological evidence writ or the non-biological evidence writ\u2014meet a burden of showing not merely evidence that <em>could </em>call his conviction into question, but evidence that actually exonerates him of the crime for which he was convicted.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Indeed, our Supreme Court has specifically recognized this high burden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">By enacting these provisions, the General Assembly intended to provide relief only to those individuals who can establish that they did not, <em>as a matter of fact, </em>commit the crimes for which they were convicted____ [The writ was] not intended to provide relief to individuals who merely produce evidence contrary to the evidence presented at their criminal trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\"><em>Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 345, 641 S.E.2d at 492 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Because the General Assembly adopted the same requirements for the non-biological writ as it did for the biological evidence 'writ, the General Assembly clearly demonstrated its intent to limit the application of the writ to newly-discovered evidence of the same conclusive nature as DNA evidence. Thus, the writ at issue in this case establishes, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>intended by the General Assembly to establish, an extraordinarily high burden. Although there is no restriction on the type of evidence upon which a petitioner may rely in his attempt to prove his actual innocence, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11; Crime Comm\u2019n Rpt. at 16, only \u201ca truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence made after trial\u201d will provide \u201cthe necessarily ... extraordinarily high\u201d \u201cthreshold showing\u201d required to demonstrate actual innocence. <em>Herrera, </em>506 U.S. at 417-18, 113 S.Ct. at 869 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (discussing the assumed due process right a prisoner would have to challenge a capital sentence with after-discovered evidence of actual innocence). A truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence, then, will prove to be a difficult task, because evidence that will meet the high standard required by Code \u00a7 19.2-311(A)(vii) is of necessity limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">B. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Unless the petitioner proffers after-discovered evidence that can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cno reasonable trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d upon consideration of the new evidence along with the evidence presented at trial, Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii), our inquiry should end, and we should dismiss the petition. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13. If the proffered evidence cannot conclusively establish innocence, there is simply no reason to proceed further; factual findings are not \u201crequire[d].\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Of course, the General Assembly did not create this Court\u2019s function in determining whether the after-discovered evidence can support the petitioner\u2019s claim out of whole cloth. Again, this procedure is similar to that employed by a circuit court in deciding whether to grant a motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence. \u201cWhen ... evidence supporting the new trial motion is contradicted by evidence in opposition to the motion, the circuit court is not permitted to presume that the moving party\u2019s evidence is true but is required to weigh all the evidence presented____\u201d <em>Orndorff v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 486, 505, 628 S.E.2d 344, 354 (2006) (citations omitted). In sorting through that conflicting evidence, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>court\u2019s role resembles that of a fact finder in determining whether the evidence is such that it should produce an opposite result on the merits at a new trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">However, unlike a circuit court\u2019s evaluation of after-discovered evidence proffered in support of a motion for a new trial, this Court must evaluate the probative value of uncorroborated, after-discovered witness testimony in an actual innocence proceeding through the prism of the incredibly high burden of proof set by the General Assembly. Effectively, we must ask ourselves whether this new testimony would produce the certainty of opinion in the minds of jurors that the statute demands. This type of witness testimony is problematic because it is, by its very nature, uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">When a witness testifies to a fact, he is testifying not to what that fact actually is, but rather his belief in or perception of that fact. <em>See Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm\u2019n v. Peatross, </em>269 Va. 428, 445-46, 611 S.E.2d 392, 401 (2005) (determining that evidence of credibility was in equipoise when three witnesses gave conflicting evidence based on each witness\u2019 \u201chonest[ ] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 recollection of the events____\u201d). The witness could be telling the truth as he understands it, but he could be mistaken due to poor eyesight or poor memory. Or, the witness can appear entirely credible, but actually be lying. Either way, testimony can be credible\u2014that is, believable\u2014 without being factually dispositive of the issue of innocence. That is why our criminal justice system allows twelve jurors, as triers of fact, to individually assess and weigh testimony and assign it such credence as each individual juror determines appropriate. Jurors are instructed that they may \u201caccept or disregard all or part of the testimony of a witness as [they] think proper\u201d and that they may \u201cdetermine which witnesses are more believable and weigh their testimony accordingly.\u201d 1-2 Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal Instruction No. 2.500 (2009). Hung juries are proof positive that there are times when reasonable jurors do not agree on whether to believe a witness\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>That is not to say that a newly-discovered witness\u2019 testimony can <em>never </em>be conclusive enough to survive a motion to dismiss the petition. However, to reach that point, the after-discovered testimonial evidence must \u201cundermine[ ] the prosecution\u2019s entire case.\u201d <em>In re Clark, </em>5 Cal.4th 750, 759, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 514, 855 P.2d 729, 734 (1993). \u201cIt is not sufficient that the evidence might have weakened the prosecution case or presented a more difficult question for the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>or jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d at 519, 855 P.2d at 739. Nor is it sufficient that the new evidence, when combined with other evidence favorable toward the petitioner, put the evidence as to the petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence in equipoise. <em>See Peatross, </em>269 Va. at 446, 611 S.E.2d at 402 (holding that evidence which is in equipoise cannot satisfy the clear and convincing burden of proof). Instead, only evidence that \u201ccasts fundamental doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the proceedings ... [and] undermine[s] the entire prosecution case and point[s] unerringly to innocenee[,]\u201d <em>In re Clark, </em>5 Cal.4th at 766, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d at 519, 855 P.2d at 739, needs to be further examined for credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">That is exactly the situation that was before the Supreme Court in both <em>Carpitcher </em>and <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 315, 641 S.E.2d 480 (2007). In both of those cases, the after-discovered testimony consisted of the recantation of testimony presented at trial and without which the petitioner could not have been convicted. If the recantation were true, there would have been no evidence that the petitioner committed the crime for which he was convicted. Or, put another way, if the only evidence supporting the convictions proved to be false, no reasonable juror could have convicted the petitioners in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In <em>Carpitcher, </em>the complaining witness recanted her trial testimony that Carpitcher sexually abused her. 273 Va. at 340, 641 S.E.2d at 489. The complaining witness was \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s only witness during the trial, and, thus, <em>the jury predicated Carpitcher\u2019s convictions solely upon her testimony.\u201d Carpitcher, </em>47 Va.App. at 517-18, 624 S.E.2d at 702 (2006) (emphasis added). Thus, because the <em>only </em>evidence supporting Carpitcher\u2019s conviction would have been eliminated had the recantation testimony been true, no reasonable juror could have convicted Carpitcher. <em>Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 345-46, 641 S.E.2d at 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">There, the Supreme Court affirmed this Court\u2019s determination to certify two specific questions to the circuit court: first, \u201c[w]hether the victim in this case has recanted the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>she gave at trial in any material way -with regard to the culpability of the petitioner;\u201d and second, \u201cif such material recantation of her trial testimony has taken place, whether or not such recantation is the product of duress, undue influence or inappropriate pressure from others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 346, 641 S.E.2d at 489, 493. The Supreme Court also affirmed this Court\u2019s subsequent decision to dismiss the petition upon the circuit court\u2019s finding that the victim was no longer a credible witness because \u201cshe had testified inconsistently about the same issues on three separate occasions\u201d and had been subjected to threats and intimidation designed to elicit her recantation. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 348-49, 641 S.E.2d at 489-90, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Supreme Court came to a similar conclusion in <em>Johnson. </em>There, the petitioner was convicted of capital murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder for hire. 273 Va. at 318, 641 S.E.2d at 482. One of Johnson\u2019s co-conspirators, Smith, testified at Johnson\u2019s trial and established that \u201cJohnson asked Smith to kill [the victim] or find someone to kill her. According to Smith, Johnson stated that he would \u2018give his next paycheck\u2019 to any person willing to kill [the victim].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 641 S.E.2d at 482. Smith\u2019s testimony provided the critical link between Johnson and the crime for which Johnson was convicted. Several weeks after the trial, however, Smith recanted his trial testimony, and Johnson relied upon that recantation in pursuit of a writ of actual innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 319-20, 641 S.E.2d at 482-83. This Court certified the question of Smith\u2019s credibility to the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 320, 641 S.E.2d at 483. After the circuit court found that Smith\u2019s testimony was \u201cneither logical or believable,\u201d this Court dismissed the petition, and our Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Carpitcher </em>and <em>Johnson </em>in that Brown\u2019s most recent statement in no way undermines the Commonwealth\u2019s entire case at trial. First and foremost, Brown did not testify at Turner\u2019s trial\u2014thus, his new statement, unlike the recantations in <em>Carpitcher </em>and Johnson\u2014did not reduce the quantum of evidence presented at trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>with which the Commonwealth met its burden.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Second, in a related point, the Commonwealth did not rely on Brown to make the critical link between Turner and the crime. Instead, the Commonwealth relied upon extensive direct and circumstantial evidence<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> to carry its burden of proving that Turner participated in the murder and abduction of Jennifer Evans. Finally, Brown\u2019s proffered testimony is simply a repetition of the testimony Turner gave at trial\u2014testimony that was specifically rejected by the jury that heard the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">C. <em>Evaluating the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Thus, in evaluating the petition, this Court should view Brown\u2019s affidavit along with the other evidence in the record to determine whether Turner\u2019s newly-discovered evidence could possibly be conclusive on the issue of his innocence. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii) (\u201c[Wjhen considered with all of the other evidence in the current record [the after-discovered evidence] will prove that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). If the newly-presented evidence is not of such a clear and convincing nature that we can say that no reasonable juror would have voted to convict, he has failed to state a claim and we must dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>To determine whether Turner stated a claim, this Court need only evaluate the evidence he proffered. This Court must then must weigh the proffered after-discovered evidence with the evidence in the trial record and decide whether the after-discovered evidence is so absolute and compelling that no reasonable juror would have voted to convict the accused in light of that evidence. <em>See House v. Bell, </em>547 U.S. 518, 538, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 2078, 165 L.Ed.2d 1 (2006) (discussing claims of actual innocence in the federal habeas corpus context) (\u201cBecause [an actual innocence] claim involves evidence the trial jury did not have before it, the inquiry requires the ... court to assess how reasonable jurors would react to the overall, newly supplemented record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Hence, it is our proper function to evaluate the probable effect this evidence would have had on a jury. When properly viewed through the prism of the statute, Brown\u2019s statement becomes just another piece of evidence that the jury would have considered. Even though Brown was undeniably an eyewitness to the crime, it is quite foreseeable that a reasonable juror would have considered Brown\u2019s statement as what it was\u2014simply one more in a series of conflicting and unreliable tales emanating from the steroid and alcohol impaired memory of a self-confessed murderer. It is quite reasonable to conclude that a hypothetical juror would have chosen to ignore Brown\u2019s testimony in its entirety and decide the case on the same evidence considered by the original jury. In fact, finders of fact are explicitly allowed to do just that under our jurisprudence.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>See Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986) (The finder of fact may accept or reject a witness\u2019 testimony in whole or in part.); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>also Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (A fact finder is at liberty to reject the conflicting evidence presented on behalf of the accused.). Furthermore, Brown\u2019s many inconsistent prior statements, which would have certainly been used to impeach his testimony, make his statement the very antithesis of the kind of evidence that can support a petition for a writ of actual innocence: that is, rock-solid evidence that has the same unquestionable, conclusive nature as DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">It is incumbent upon an actual innocence petitioner to present clear and convincing evidence proving that his guilt is a factual impossibility. The writ was \u201cnot intended to provide relief to individuals who merely produce evidence contrary to the evidence presented at their criminal trial.\u201d <em>Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 345, 641 S.E.2d at 492. Even assuming that Brown\u2019s testimony would have been consistent with his affidavit, that testimony is not, either by its nature or its weight, sufficient to convince me that no reasonable juror would have voted to convict Turner had they heard it. Therefore, in my opinion, Turner has not met the high standard of proof set by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii). I would grant the Commonwealth\u2019s motion and dismiss Turner\u2019s petition pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.13.</p>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">. This is why the majority is incorrect in its assertion that \"the issue of whether the referring panel needlessly sent the matter back to the circuit court for factual findings is not an issue on which either party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>sought review, nor is it an issue granted by this Court for consideration en banc.\" <em>Supra </em>at 412 n. 9, 694 S.E.2d at 261 n. 9. We do not sit to review the decision of either the panel or of the circuit court\u2014we sit to decide the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">. When developing the writ of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence, the General Assembly surveyed the post-conviction relief available to actual innocence claimants in all fifty states, and rejected the approaches of states that vested trial-level courts with original jurisdiction in cases involving claims of actual innocence. <em>See Writ of Actual Innocence Based on Non-Biological Evidence, </em>Rep. of the Va. State Crime Comm'n (2004), App'x 5 (hereinafter Crime Comm'n Rep.). Some states vest their trial courts with this authority by statute, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.Y. C.P.L. \u00a7 440.30 (Consol.2010) (setting forth procedures for motions to vacate judgment or to set aside sentence on the basis of after-discovered evidence, including DNA evidence); Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 116.3 (2007) (setting forth a specific procedure for actual innocence claimants to follow in the trial court), while others do so by decision, <em>see, e.g., Summerville v. Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 641 A.2d 1356, 1369 (1994) (\"[A] substantial claim of actual innocence is cognizable by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, even in the absence of proof by the petitioner of an antecedent constitutional violation that affected the result of his criminal trial.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b480-4\">. Indeed, the delineation between original and appellate jurisdiction is one of the most basic\u2014and longstanding\u2014in American jurisprudence. <em>See Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. 137, 175-76, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 <em>(1803) </em>(discussing the difference between original and appellate jurisdiction and noting that \"the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction\u201d is \u201cthat it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause\u201d and that to \"issue ... a writ ____seems not to belong to appellate, but to original jurisdiction\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">. Of course, we recognize that there are situations where an evidentiary hearing will be required to resolve certain issues. For those situations, the General Assembly provided a mechanism in Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12 for the taking of additional evidence in the circuit court to enable this Court to ultimately determine the exonerating nature of the proffered evidence. For instance, DNA analysis may conclusively establish that the biological sample did not come from the defendant. However, its exonerating nature may well depend on where the sample was found. Blood found on a victim's body may well be quite probative of innocence; blood found on the street a block away, perhaps not. Similarly, before this Court could evaluate the probative value of an after-discovered video recording apparently showing another individual committing the crime, an evidentiary hearing might be necessary to authenticate the recording. This does not mean, however, that all factual findings, including credibility, need be referred to the circuit court. If the proffered testimony is sufficiently incredible on its face, we are perfectly capable of making that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">.

The first two times Brown was questioned by law enforcement regarding Jennifer Evans\u2019 disappearance, he denied having any knowledge of her. A few days later, Brown and Turner were both taken to the FBI office in Richmond for questioning. At that time, in the space of five hours, Brown told law enforcement officers three different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>stories regarding Jennifer Evans\u2019 death. First, he told FBI agents that he did not have any knowledge of what happened to Jennifer Evans. Second, Brown stated that he and Turner took Jennifer Evans to an area near some beach houses and, when she began to struggle, jointly killed her\u2014Turner choking her while Brown held her arms and legs. Third, Brown told law enforcement that he came out to the car, from the bar, and found that Turner had killed Jennifer Evans when she resisted his sexual advances. Brown\u2019s sworn testimony at his own trial essentially tracked his third statement\u2014that Turner acted alone in killing Jennifer Evans\u2014and is inconsistent with his sworn affidavit and his sworn testimony before the circuit court in this action. Brown also explained in his statement to Turner\u2019s attorney that Brown originally told his own attorney in 1999 that he acted alone in killing Jennifer Evans. Brown\u2019s attorney did not believe him. A few weeks later, Brown recanted his story. Finally, as the Attorney General points out, in 2000 through 2001 Brown asserted in his <em>pro se </em>habeas corpus pleadings that <em>Turner </em>acted alone in killing Jennifer Evans, and that at most, Brown was guilty of being an accessory after the fact to Jennifer Evans\u2019 murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">. At Turner\u2019s trial, the jury was also presented evidence from the medical examiner who indicated that it typically takes three-to-five minutes of constant pressure on the carotid artery to deprive the brain of sufficient oxygen and blood flow to cause death by manual strangulation.

It is apparent upon examining the altered page that the font size has been changed to ensure that the altered second page ends at the same point as the unaltered second page. The altered version was attached to Turner's petition, and includes the following testimony from Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">We were sitting there talking and next thing you know I reached up and choked Jennifer. I did this on my own without prior discussion with Dustin Turner.

I note that other members of the Court believe that these factual findings are conclusively binding on this Court. Although my view of the procedural posture of this case means that these factual findings are now irrelevant to the case before us, I do take issue with this view of the circuit court\u2019s factual findings.

Such factual findings are similar to circuit court findings made under Code \u00a7 8.01-654(C) in habeas corpus cases in which we have original jurisdiction and have referred factual issues to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, we will apply to the factual findings contained in the record of the Court of Appeals a standard of review similar to the standard we apply to factual findings entered in our original jurisdiction habeas corpus proceedings.

Second, the circuit court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>factual findings pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12 are only binding if they are approved by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s use of the word \"approved\u201d is consistent with this Court\u2019s role as the ultimate finder of fact in cases involving the writ.

Instead, we must independently review the record, and make the necessary factual findings ourselves. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v.

In <em>Johnson, </em>as discussed <em>infra, </em>the ultimate issue upon which Johnson\u2019s \"actual innocence\u201d hung was whether a key trial witness had lied at trial, or had lied in his subsequent recantation. Were the witness telling the truth when he recanted his trial testimony, then there would be no evidence linking Johnson with the crime of which he was convicted. Hence, in that context, it was appropriate\u2014if confusing\u2014to use the terms \"truth\u201d and \"credibility\u201d interchangeably. And while the term \"credible evidence\u201d means \"[e]vidence that is worthy of belief; trustworthy evidence,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>637 (9th ed.2004), it does not logically follow that all of the \"believable\" evidence is of necessity true. If that were the case, the English language would not require two different words for the concepts of \u201ccredibility\u201d and \"truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Molina </em>stands for the proposition that we must, on appellate review, \" 'regard as <em>true </em>all the <em>credible </em>evidence favorable to [the party who prevailed below.]\u2019 \u201d 272 Va. at 671, 636 S.E.2d at 473 (quoting <em>Parks v.

First, as explained above, this case does not involve an appellate review. The Court of Appeals is the court of original jurisdiction for cases involving the writ of actual innocence based on non-biological evidence. Second, the prevailing party in this case was the Commonwealth\u2014 Turner comes to us as a person convicted of a brutal murder by a jury of his peers.

In 1982, Arthur Lee Whitfield was convicted of two rapes based on the highly credible testimony of the two victims, both of whom positively identified Whitfield as their attacker. In 2004, DNA evidence exonerated Whitfield of both crimes and identified a convicted rapist as the actual assailant. Whitfield was subsequently pardoned by the governor in 2009. <em>See </em>Rep. to the Gen. Assemb., \"List of Pardons, Reprieves, and Other Forms of Clemency,\u201d Sen. Doc.

Both the majority and dissent refer to Brown\u2019s affidavit as a \"recantation.\u201d I reject that characterization. While he may have recanted the statements he gave to the police and his testimony at this own trial, Brown did not testify at Turner\u2019s trial and, thus, there was no testimony in this proceeding for him to recant. Unlike Carpitcher and Johnson, Turner was not convicted based solely on testimony that the witness later claimed was false. In the context of the matter before us, Brown\u2019s new version of the events of that fatal night should be analyzed the same way trial courts deal with the garden-variety after-discovered alibi witness testimony that prompts motions for new trials on a daily basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">.

This case has taken many twists and turns and involves a complex record of conflicting evidence. However, we instruct jurors they are entitled to use their common sense. I suggest the fact that we normally write in great detail\u2014with many citations to legal authority\u2014does not negate the fact that we, too, should apply a commonsense approach. There is no denying that this petition is of a most serious nature. Having said that, and no matter how many novel legal theories we apply to this case, the issue before us is really quite simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">First, a clear majority of this Court agrees on the proper standard of review, as enunciated in <em>Carpitcher v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 335, 641 S.E.2d 486 (2007). A panel of this Court referred this matter to the circuit court for fact finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-327.12, and we are bound by that decision. The Supreme Court of Virginia could not have been clearer in setting out the relevant legal principles in <em>Carpitcher </em>and <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 315, 322, 641 S.E.2d 480, 484 (2007) (giving \u201cthe Court of Appeals <em>broad discretion </em>to certify to the circuit court issues of fact that must be resolved before deciding the merits of a petition\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Second, the circuit court found that \u201cBrown [was] credible in his assertion that he acted independently in murdering the victim and that Turner had no role in the murder or any restraint of the victim.\u201d Because the referring panel determined that Brown\u2019s recantation was material to Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence and, therefore, that referral to the circuit court was required, we must accept the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact in that regard unless plainly wrong. <em>See Carpitcher, </em>273 Va. at 342-43, 641 S.E.2d at 490 (binding this Court \u201cby the factual findings in the present record ... unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to support them\u201d). Much is made of the contention that \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d are not necessarily the same. While this is an accurate assessment of reality, our judicial system has always been based on credibility findings made by the trier of fact. I am aware of no legal concept that allows an appellate court, even one acting on a matter over which it has original jurisdiction, to ignore a credibility finding because it <em>might </em>not be \u201cthe truth,\u201d unless the record meets the higher burden of establishing that credibility finding is plainly wrong. Although the search for real truth is elusive, it is abundantly clear in this case that the trier of fact credited Brown\u2019s testimony that he alone restrained and killed the victim with <em>no </em>participation from Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Third, the question then becomes whether any rational fact finder could convict Turner of the victim\u2019s murder and abduction when told it had to accept the above finding as credible\u2014 that is, that the fact finder was <em>required </em>to believe Brown\u2019s <em>most recent testimony. </em>The answer to that question is obvious: If X says that he did it and that Y did not participate in any way, and the jury believes X, there is no legal way to convict Y. A rational fact finder simply cannot apply <em>any </em>interpretation to the remaining circumstantial evidence that will allow it to find Y guilty in light of this direct credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Because Brown\u2019s credible recantation prevents a finding that Turner participated <em>directly </em>in Evans\u2019 murder, the majority applies a novel theory of abduction by deception in order to manufacture the intent to defile, a required element a rational fact finder would need to find Turner guilty of felony murder. However, the record is devoid of any evidence that Turner ever engaged or intended to engage in any sexual activity <em>against the will </em>of the participant. Turner\u2019s mere <em>desire </em>to engage in sexual activity with Evans cannot serve as the basis for concluding he would have used force if she did not consent. Applying the theory of abduction by deception in this fashion lends itself to abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Dustin Turner deserves no accolades for his behavior on the terrible night of the victim\u2019s death, but based on the circuit court\u2019s findings regarding Brown\u2019s credibility in the context of the entire record, the evidence proves Turner did not restrain or murder the victim. He has been incarcerated for fourteen years for a crime the fact finder has found he did not commit. The petition should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">TURNER\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIMES</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">My disagreement with the majority stems from its holding that \u201ca rational fact finder could have found that Turner!, acting with intent to defile,] abducted Evans by deception\u2014 meaning no finding of force or restraint would have been required\u2014and that the abduction ended with Evans\u2019 murder.\u201d The majority first errs by not considering, in light of Brown\u2019s credible recantation, whether Brown acted alone in killing Evans. While the majority properly recognizes that we must \u201creject! ] all evidence that is in conflict with the circuit court\u2019s findings,\u201d I believe Brown\u2019s recantation has a more far-reaching impact on the circumstantial evidence relevant to demonstrating Turner\u2019s intent than the majority acknowledges. I would conclude Brown\u2019s testimony on referral compels us to reject any evidence that suggests Brown and Turner acted in concert to engage in sexual intercourse with Evans against her will. Second, and central to my dissent, I believe no rational fact finder could find Turner guilty of abduction with intent to defile and felony murder based on the remaining circumstantial evidence contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Where two or more parties engage in criminal concert of action, one who participates in the initial felony giving rise to the homicide may be found guilty of murder whether or not he was the one who actually dealt the killing stroke. <em>See Rollston v.

Turner played no role in the murder <em>or </em>in the restraining of the victim.\u201d (Emphasis added). By assuming Brown\u2019s recantation \u201chas no bearing on what a reasonable fact finder could conclude about Turner\u2019s ... sexual intent,\u201d the majority does not view both the question and the answer in the context of the convictions Turner challenges\u2014for murder and abduction with intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The circuit court, by referring to the murder and the restraint in the disjunctive, contemplated Brown\u2019s recantation in light of both the actual killing and the underlying crime of abduction. \u201cRestrain\u201d means \u201c\u2018[t]o control\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018[t]o take away freedom or liberty of.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

The legislature has provided that abduction as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-47 is synonymous with kidnapping, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-47(C), which is not separately defined in the Virginia Code. At common law, kidnapping required proof of both \u201can unlawful restraint\u201d and an asportation. <em>See State v. Dix, </em>282 N.C. 490, 193 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Relying on <em>Jerman v. Dir. of the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>267 Va. 432, 593 S.E.2d 255 (2004), and <em>Kent v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 840,183 S.E. 177 (1936), the majority concludes \u201c[t]he accused need not have used any physical force <em>or restraint </em>against the victim\u201d in order to uphold a conviction for abduction. (Emphasis added). Although our legislature, like many others, now permits a conviction for abduction upon proof of a detention without any asportation, <em>see, e.g., Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526, 323 S.E.2d 572, 576 (1984), the statutory language provides no indication the legislature has removed the \u201crestraint\u201d requirement. To the contrary, one who \u201cseizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another,\u201d as those terms are used in Code \u00a7 18.2-47, \u201crestrains\u201d that person under the accepted legal definition of the term. The Supreme Court has recognized that a conviction for abduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>under Code \u00a7 18.2-47 requires proof of restraint of the victim either by asportation or detention and that the asportation or detention may be accomplished by force, intimidation, or deception. <em>Jerman, </em>267 Va. at 439, 593 S.E.2d at 259; <em>see </em>John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 5.1[6] (2009) (\u201c[A]bduction consists of <em>restraints </em>on the personal liberty of another.\u201d (Emphasis added)). Thus, an asportation by force or deception is a type of restraint<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and, if the other statutory elements are proved, constitutes abduction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Based on the crimes for which Turner was convicted, the wording of the question posed by this Court to the circuit court, and the accepted \u201cassum[ption] that trial judges have knowledge of the Commonwealth\u2019s laws and properly apply those laws\u201d absent clear evidence to the contrary, <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 318, 326 477 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1996), I would hold the circuit court\u2019s use of the word \u201crestraint\u201d constitutes a finding that Turner did not participate with Brown in an abduction by either force or deception. I would therefore reject the theory that Turner and Brown engaged in any criminal concert of action such that any rational fact finder could believe any causal connection existed between Turner\u2019s conduct and Evans\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In light of the circuit court\u2019s acceptance of Brown\u2019s testimony that Turner did not participate in the murder or the abduction leading to the murder, the hypothetical fact finder must necessarily reject any evidence or interpretation thereof that suggests an agreement between Turner and Brown existed to undertake these acts.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Specifically, I would reject the majority\u2019s conclusion that Fitzgibbons\u2019 testimony, heavily relied upon by the majority, implies a formulated plan between Turner and Brown to engage in group sex with Evans against her will. A plain reading of the record compels such a rejection. At approximately 1:15 a.m., Turner made arrangements with Kate Bishop to take Brown home if Turner did not return to the club in time to do so himself. Then, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Turner spoke to Fitzgibbons and indicated that he, Brown, and Evans were going to have a \u201cthreesome.\u201d The majority posits that \u201c[fjifteen minutes would have been more than enough time for their plan [to have sex with Evans] to have changed[,]\u201d but it inexplicably ignores the fact that at approximately 1:45 a.m., Bishop approached Brown to take him home. According to Bishop\u2019s testimony, Brown refused to accompany her because he did not want to wait for Bishop\u2019s friend to arrive and not because he had alternate plans with Turner to engage in sexual intercourse with Evans. It is a stretch of the imagination to believe a rational fact finder could conclude Turner made arrangements to have sex with Evans without Brown, changed the plans to include Brown in the sexual activity, changed his mind again to have Brown ride home with Bishop, and finally returned to the original plan of engaging in a threesome, all in the span of thirty minutes. Under the same logic, we cannot interpret Brown\u2019s salacious request to \u201cget[] it on with [Evans] too\u201d as evidence of a nefarious agreement between him and Turner. No rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>fact finder could infer from this evidence that an agreement between Turner and Brown existed to engage in a threesome with Evans against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In the absence of such an agreement, no rational trier of fact could find the men acted in concert to abduct or kill Evans. Because the two men each acted of their own volition, Turner\u2019s conduct and Brown\u2019s entry into the vehicle and subsequent killing were not \u201cinterdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u201d <em>Edmonds v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 310, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813 (1985). Indeed, Turner\u2019s waiting with Evans in his vehicle merely accounted for his \u201cpresence at the location of the [murder], and nothing directly related to the commission of the felony that caused the [murder].\u201d <em>King, </em>6 Va.App. at 358, 368 S.E.2d at 708 (finding no causal connection between flying a plane containing marijuana as part of a drug smuggling operation and the death of a co-felon caused by crashing the plane into a mountain); <em>see Rollston, </em>11 Va.App. at 542, 399 S.E.2d at 827 (\u201cMere presence during the commission of a crime is not sufficient to render one criminally liable.\u201d). Whatever intentions Turner possessed when he left the club with Evans, the circuit court\u2019s findings on referral compel the conclusion that he did not act in concert with Brown to lure her into leaving the club for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse against her will. Those findings instead compel the conclusion that Brown acted as an independent and superseding force so that his actions constituted a separate\u2014and completely coincidental\u2014enterprise with no causal connection to Turner\u2019s own conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Not only has Brown\u2019s recantation severed Turner from the criminal enterprise leading to Evans\u2019 murder, but, in light of the circuit court\u2019s acceptance of Brown\u2019s recantation, I believe a rational trier of fact could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Turner abducted Evans with intent to defile prior to and separate from Brown\u2019s acts of restraint and murder. The majority takes the opposite view that \u201ca rational fact finder could have found that Turner abducted Evans by deception.\u201d It is at this critical juncture where the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>premises its dismissal of Turner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence and where the heart of my dissent lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Under Code \u00a7 18.2-47, abduction requires proof of an asportation or detention. <em>See Scott, </em>228 Va. at 526, 323 S.E.2d at 576. The accused need not have used any actual force against the victim in order to sustain a conviction. <em>Kent, </em>165 Va. at 841-42, 183 S.E. at 177-78. Instead, restraint for purposes of abduction includes a taking away or detention induced by fraud or deception. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-47; <em>Jerman, </em>267 Va. at 439, 593 S.E.2d at 259; <em>Kent, </em>165 Va. at 841-42, 183 S.E. at 177-78; Costello, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.1[6]. However, the evidence must show that the accused effected such deception with the specific intent to defile the victim. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth (Johnson II), </em>221 Va. 872, 879, 275 S.E.2d 592, 597 (1981); <em>see also Simms v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 614, 617, 346 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1986) (equating \u201cdefile\u201d with \u201csexually molest\u201d). This intent-to-defile element requires proof of an intent to engage in sexual contact against the will of the claimed victim. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-61 (rape), 18.2-67.1 (forcible sodomy), 18.2-67.3 (aggravated sexual battery), 18.2-67.4 (sexual battery).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201c \u2018Intent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind which may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 510, 519, 446 S.E.2d 451, 457 (1994) (quoting <em>David v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 1, 3, 340 S.E.2d 576, 577 (1986)). The state of mind of an accused may be shown by his conduct and by his statements. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 198, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided [the evidence as a whole] is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). In its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve, in whole or in part, the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt. <em>Speight v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en </em>banc). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The rejection of that testimony, however, does not provide substantive evidence that the opposite is true. <em>Tarpley v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 251, 256-57, 542 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In both <em>Kent </em>and <em>Jerman, </em>the Court determined that the abductions occurred when the defendants told a specific lie that induced or coerced their respective victims into going places they would not otherwise have gone. In this case, by contrast, no rational fact finder could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Turner made any statement or engaged in any act showing an intent to deceive Evans for the purpose of sexually molesting her against her will. Although the evidence does not preclude the <em>possibility </em>that Turner had such an intent, reasonable hypotheses of innocence flow from the evidence, thereby precluding any rational trier of fact from finding Turner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of abduction with intent to defile. To support its conclusion, the majority applies a novel theory of abduction by deception to manufacture the intent to defile that a rational fact finder would require to find Turner guilty of felony murder. In essence, the majority concludes that it is rational to find that any rude individual who desires sex also harbors an intent to defile.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The record contains neither legal authority nor factual support for such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In <em>Johnson II, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of abduction where his acts of restraint were \u201cdone in furtherance of his sexual advances and not with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the intent to deprive [the victim] of her personal liberty.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> 221 Va. at 879, 275 S.E.2d at 597. In that case, the defendant followed the victim into her kitchen after knocking on her door. He grabbed the victim from behind, attempted to kiss her, and rubbed his hips against her buttocks. When the victim\u2019s landlady responded to her cries for help, the defendant released the victim and walked rapidly out of the apartment. The Court held that the defendant clearly \u201centered the apartment with the intention of having sexual intercourse with the [victim] and that the advances he made, however limited and fleeting, were designed to accomplish that purpose. However, his assault was frustrated by her resistance and stopped short of constituting an attempted rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 879, 275 S.E.2d at 596-97. On those facts, the evidence did not prove the defendant acted with the separate intent to deprive the victim of her personal liberty with the intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Similarly here, the circumstantial evidence \u201cfails \u2018to form an unbroken chain which links [Turner] to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hickson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 383, 388, 520 S.E.2d 643, 645 (1999) (quoting <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1984)), because a rational trier of fact could find Turner acted with an intent to defile Evans, i.e., to engage in sexual contact against her will, only by \u201cresorting to speculation and surmise,\u201d <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 698, 699, 213 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1975). Turner\u2019s stated purpose for leaving the club with Evans was to wait with her in his vehicle for her friends Andria Burdette and Michelle McCammon to return. Although a rational fact finder could have rejected Turner\u2019s testimony regarding his purpose, such a rejection does not support a finding that he acted instead with the requisite criminal intent to abduct Evans with an intent to defile. <em>See Tarpley, </em>261 Va. at 256-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>57, 542 S.E.2d at 764. Indeed, even if a rational fact finder could conclude Turner lied to Evans about his purpose in going with her to his car and that he actually hoped to have some form of sexual contact with her, the record contains no indication that Turner acted , with the intent to have that sexual contact by force if Evans had refused. The evidence provided by Andria Burdette, Michelle McCammon, and Turner himself indicating that Evans would have refused such advances does not bridge that gap in logic. Moreover, it defies rationality to suggest that displaying poor manners toward an individual\u2019s friends and opening a door with \u201csurprising force\u201d could indicate an intent to defile. In fact, the record contains no evidence that Turner overbore Evans\u2019 will at any point dining their encounter. Turner did not force Evans to stay behind; she willingly agreed to remain with him at the club and to meet her friends later that night. Turner did not make Evans uncomfortable; to the contrary, she appeared to have enjoyed his company. The evidence of the condition in which Evans\u2019 body was found supports a finding that she had been sexually molested because her pants and underwear had been removed and her vest had been pushed up. However, Brown\u2019s recantation, credited by the circuit court on referral, accounts for this because he fully admitted to defiling Evans\u2019 body after he had killed her. In a similar vein, Turner\u2019s callous behavior after Evans\u2019 murder goes toward his guilt of being an accessory after the fact, a crime he conceded to have committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In sum, the majority makes a fatal leap in logic from Turner\u2019s possible desire to engage in sexual intercourse to his alleged intent to defile Evans. In light of Brown\u2019s recantation, the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt, at most, that when Turner invited Evans to wait with him in his vehicle for her friends, he did so with the hope of persuading her to have consensual sexual contact. The record is devoid of evidence supporting a rational finding that Turner acted with the intent to force Evans into having sex against her will. Brown\u2019s recantation negates the inculpatory evidence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Turner to such an extent that no rational trier of fact could have found Turner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of abduction with intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">For these reasons, I would conclude Turner has met his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that Brown\u2019s recantation is truthful and, consequently, that no rational trier of fact could have found proof beyond a reasonable doubt of abduction with intent to defile and felony murder. Code \u00a7 19.2-327.11(A)(vii).

As the circuit court noted, the evidence establishing Turner\u2019s guilt was largely circumstantial. Brown did not testify at Turner\u2019s trial and did not provide his false inculpatory testimony to the jury. All of the Commonwealth's eyewitness testimony confirmed that Evans was last seen with Turner on the night of her death, a fact Turner readily concedes. There are, however, no eyewitnesses\u2014besides the two convicted men\u2014-who identified the actual killer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. The majority further suggests that because the jury at Turner's original trial was \"instructed that abduction with the intent to defile could be accomplished by, <em>inter alia, </em>deception and could have found that Turner deceived Evans into leaving the bar,\u201d and apparently so found, \"it cannot be said that <em>no </em>rational trier of fact <em>could </em>have found Turner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" In other words, the majority says that a rational trier of fact could have found the petitioner guilty because the original jury did. However, to say that a rational trier of fact could have found the petitioner guilty because the original jury did fails to take into consideration the new evidence found credible on referral and would mandate the dismissal of every petition for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">.
