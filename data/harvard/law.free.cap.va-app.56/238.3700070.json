For the reasons stated below, we agree with McNamara and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">I. Backgkound</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. As part of an unrelated investigation, a police officer searched McNamara\u2019s automobile while it was parked on the grounds of Langley High School. The officer found a \u201cdouble edged sheath knife\u201d and a \u201csmall pocket knife\u201d in the car, as well as a machete \u201cunderneath the driver\u2019s side middle seat.\u201d It is the machete that is at issue in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both a photograph of the machete and the machete itself were admitted into evidence at trial. It consists of a five-inch handle attached to a seventeen- and-one-half-inch, curved, metal blade that has a rounded tip and a single sharp edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The only question before this Court is one of statutory interpretation. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(A) criminalizes the possession of, among other things, any \u201c(in) weapon, including a weapon of like kind, designated in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308, other than a firearm[,] upon (a) the property of any public, private or religious elementary, middle or high school, including buildings and grounds____\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), referenced in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(A), makes unlawful the concealed carrying of, among other things, \u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, machete, razor, ... or any weapon of like kind.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii). Thus, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-308.1(A) unquestionably prohibits the possession of a machete on school grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">However, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B) contains exceptions to the prohibitions in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(A) depending upon the location or use of the item. As relevant to this case, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B)(vi) allows possession of \u201can unloaded firearm that is in a closed container, or a knife having a metal blade, in or upon a motor vehicle, or an unloaded shotgun or rifle in a firearms rack in or upon a motor vehicle\u201d on school grounds. Because we conclude that McNamara\u2019s machete is a type of knife, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B)(vi), his conviction must be reversed as his possession of it in his automobile falls within the statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">This question of statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Young v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 528, 533, 643 S.E.2d 491, 493 (2007). When interpreting a statute, we seek to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent by the words used in a statute, and when a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of its language. <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, </em>266 Va. 260, 264-65, 585 S.E.2d 552, 554 (2003). As we analyze the statute, we must give each word \u201c \u2018its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sansom v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>257 Va. 589, 594-95, 514 S.E.2d 345, 349 (1999) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Taxation v. Orange-Madison Coop. Farm Serv., </em>220 Va. 655, 658, 261 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (1980)); <em>accord Winborne v. Virginia State Lottery, </em>278 Va. 142, 148, 677 S.E.2d 304, 306 (2009) (\u201cUnder principles of statutory construction, we must consider the ordinary and plain meaning of statutory terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We must also construe penal statutes, like this one, strictly: \u201c[i]n accordance with principles of statutory construction of penal statutes, a court must not add to the words of the statute nor ignore the words of the statute and must strictly construe the statute and limit its application to cases falling clearly within the statute.\u201d <em>Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 181-82, 639 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2007). This means that we must construe the statute \u201cstrictly against the State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>favorably to the liberty of the citizen\u201d so as to ensure that \u201c[n]o man incurs a penalty unless the act which subjects him to it is clearly within the spirit and letter of the statute which imposes such penalty.\u201d <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 834, 834, 65 S.E. 15, 15 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">While the statutes at issue here are not ambiguous, they do not define the words \u201cknife\u201d or \u201cmachete.\u201d Thus, we will give those words their \u2018\u201cordinary meaning, given the context in which [they are] used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sansom, </em>257 Va. at 594-95, 514 S.E.2d at 349 (quoting <em>Orange-Madison Coop. Farm Serv., </em>220 Va. at 658, 261 S.E.2d at 533-34).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The word knife is a broad term, which encompasses a wide variety of instruments; it is defined as \u201c[a] cutting instrument consisting of a sharp blade attached to a handle;\u201d \u201c[a] cutting edge; a blade.\u201d <em>The Am. Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>969 (4th ed.2004). A machete, in turn, is defined as \u201ca large heavy knife with a broad blade, used as a weapon and an implement for cutting vegetation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1047; <em>accord Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1353 (1981) (\u201c[A] large heavy knife usu. made with a blade resembling a broadsword often two or three feet in length and used esp. in So. America and the West Indies for cutting cane and clearing paths.\u201d); <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 744 </em>(11th ed. 2003) (\u201c[A] large heavy knife used for cutting sugar cane and underbrush and as a weapon.\u201d). Uniformly, then, a machete is defined as a type of knife, albeit a large one, that, like other knives, is capable of being used as both a tool and a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Attorney General argues that, because the General Assembly referred to machetes specifically in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii), machetes are not knives within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1, but are weapons that do not fall within the exception language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B)(vi). However, Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) does not use the general term knife at all; instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii) lists a number of weapons that are illegal to carry concealed, including several types of knives: dirks, bowie knifes, switchblade knives, ballistic knives, and machetes. Unless some other knife is a \u201cweapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>of like kind\u201d to the enumerated knives, it must be listed specifically, or its concealed possession is not prohibited. <em>See Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 280, 292, 673 S.E.2d 469, 474 (2009) (reversing a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii) upon the conclusion that while a \u201cbutterfly knife is a \u201cweapon,\u2019 [it is not] \u2018of like kind\u2019 to a dirk or any other weapon enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B)(vi), however, uses the more general term \u201cknife having a metal blade.\u201d The language of the exception does not limit itself to a particular size or style of knife, or knives that are designed to serve as tools rather than as weapons. Furthermore, the language of the exception itself indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to distinguish between weapons and non-weapons. Of the four items listed in the automobile exemption\u2014unloaded firearms, knives having a metal blade, unloaded shotguns, and unloaded rifles\u2014only a knife with a blade of less than three inches would not be considered a weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that a machete is also \u201ccommonly understood to be [a] \u201cweapon[ ],\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrakhan, </em>273 Va. at 182, 639 S.E.2d at 230, is irrelevant to the analysis. The plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1, which we are required to construe strictly, states that it is legal to have a knife in an automobile parked on school grounds. Because a machete is a type of knife, McNamara\u2019s possession of the machete did not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We reverse and dismiss McNamara\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">. McNamara was also convicted of the felony of possession of burglary tools in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-94. That conviction is not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-11\">. The double-edged sheath knife appears to be approximately eighteen inches in length. McNamara was not charged with the unlawful possession of this knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">. The exception at issue is found in the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1(B). That paragraph also states that \u2018\u2018[flor purposes of this paragraph, \u2018weapon\u2019 includes a knife having a metal blade of three inches or longer....\u201d The Attorney General argues that because the machete has a blade longer than three inches it is a weapon and thus not included in the exception. However, as we note above, the fact that the machete is a weapon does not exclude it from the scope of the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
