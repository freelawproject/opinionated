King, Jr., appellant, was convicted in a bench trial of a number of felonies, including two that are subject to this appeal, namely, child abuse, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A), and child endangerment, in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103(A). On appeal, he contends that the trial court, by convicting him of both these offenses, twice put him in jeopardy for committing the same offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Because the sufficiency of the evidence is not before us, we recite only those facts necessary to analyze whether there has been a double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Appellant is the father of K.W. (\u201cthe baby\u201d), born on February 25, 2008. Appellant did not live with the baby\u2019s mother, R.W. On April 23, 2009, appellant visited the baby at R.W.\u2019s residence. Later that evening, appellant told R.W. that the baby was not breathing. A paramedic arrived at the scene and observed that the baby had no heartbeat and was not breathing. The baby was ultimately transported to a Richmond hospital. A CT scan revealed blood in the baby\u2019s brain. The symptoms indicated that the baby\u2019s injuries were not accidental, but resulted from shaken baby syndrome. K.W.\u2019s thighbone was also shattered, which was caused by a \u201crotational type force.\u201d The baby died on April 29, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Appellant gave conflicting explanations as to the source of the baby\u2019s injuries. He admitted to a detective that he was \u201cresponsible for the whole thing\u201d but he did not remember the specifics of what happened. At one point, appellant said he was holding the baby, hugging and kissing her, and the next thing he knew, she was not breathing. He later said the baby fell out of his arms and landed on her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Dr. Kevin Whaley, an assistant chief medical examiner, performed the autopsy. He noticed no external wounds or signs of trauma to the baby\u2019s head, but discovered a hemorrhage in her brain, consistent with a strong blow to the head. He also observed swelling of the brain. He opined that the baby died by blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The trial court convicted appellant of all of the charged felonies, including the two on appeal before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Appellant contends his convictions for child abuse and child endangerment violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>cif\u00edcally, he argues he was improperly convicted and punished twice for committing one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Our inquiry is whether the convictions and punishment for child abuse and child endangerment, both of which arose from the injuries to and death of one victim, violate the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In pertinent part, this amendment states that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u201cThis constitutional provision guarantees protection against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 227, 509 S.E.2d 293, 300 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Because this appeal concerns convictions for child abuse and child endangerment that occurred during one trial, our double jeopardy analysis is limited on appeal to the third guarantee. In such a case, where both of the defendant\u2019s convictions occurred in a single trial, \u201c\u2018the only relevant constitutional guarantee is protection against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 531, 540, 674 S.E.2d 835, 839 (2009) (quoting <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 797-98 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">We will assume, without deciding, that the evidence established appellant\u2019s course of conduct was a continuous act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the two convictions occurred in a single trial, we must decide whether the trial court exceeded \u201c \u2018its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne, </em>257 Va. at 227, 509 S.E.2d at 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(quoting <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">In the prosecution for two crimes in the same trial, the double jeopardy defense does not apply unless (a) the defendant is twice punished for one criminal act, <em>and </em>(b) the two punishments are either for the same crime or one punishment is for a crime which is a lesser included offense of the other. <em>See Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. at 169-70 [97 S.Ct. at 2227-28].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The two relevant statutes make it clear that the legislature intended to create two distinct offenses, child abuse and child endangerment. Appellant\u2019s actions violated these statutes, so we must consider the rule enunciated in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). \u201c[W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we look at the offenses charged in the abstract, without referring to the particular facts of the case under review.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>261 Va. at 200, 539 S.E.2d at 734 (citing <em>Blythe, </em>222 Va. at 726-27, 284 S.E.2d at 798-99).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">An analysis of whether the multiple punishments imposed upon appellant are proper requires a determination of what punishments the legislature intended to impose. Thus, we must first examine the statutes under which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A) (child abuse) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">Any parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 who by willful act or omission or refusal to provide any necessary care for the child\u2019s health causes or permits serious injury to the life or health of such child shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony. For purposes of this subsection, \u201cserious injury\u201d shall include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>but not be limited to (i) disfigurement, (ii) a fracture, (iii) a severe burn or laceration, (iv) mutilation, (v) maiming, (vi) forced ingestion of dangerous substances, or (vii) life-threatening internal injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Code \u00a7 40.1-103(A) (child endangerment) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person employing or having the custody of any child willfully or negligently to cause or permit the life of such child to be endangered or the health of such child to be injured, or willfully or negligently to cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health or morals may be endangered, or to cause or permit such child to be overworked, tortured, tormented, mutilated, beaten or cruelly treated. Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The child abuse and child endangerment statutes proscribe different conduct. Each contains proof of a fact that the other does not. Child abuse requires serious injury to the life or health of a child. Child endangerment does not require serious injury, or any injury at all. In fact, the statute requires only that the child be placed at risk of danger. On the other hand, child endangerment, but not child abuse, requires that the child\u2019s life, health, or morals be endangered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Endangerment of a child\u2019s moral well-being is not a violation of the child abuse statute; the latter is limited to a child\u2019s physical well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Because we find that each statute requires proof of additional facts not found in the other, therefore constituting two distinct offenses, there is no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Child abuse and child endangerment are not the same offense, nor is one a lesser-included offense of the other. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>find no error in the trial court\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s double jeopardy argument. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\">. Appellant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. However, the record strongly suggests there were two distinct criminal acts, in which appellant 1) caused a fatal head injury to the baby and 2) broke the baby\u2019s leg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\">. This Court invalidated part of Code \u00a7 40.1-103(A) for vagueness, specifically, use of the word \"may.\u201d <em>See Commonwealth v. Carter, </em>21 Va.App. 150, 462 S.E.2d 582 (1995). However, that does not change the statute's focus on the protection of a child's life, health, or moral well-being and does not affect our analysis or ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
