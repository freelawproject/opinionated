He contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the narcotics discovered pursuant to an \u201call persons present\u201d clause in a search warrant on the ground the warrant was \u201cstale\u201d when it was executed by police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Detective Wayne Roberts of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) for the Hampton Police Department obtained a warrant allowing police to search all persons present at an apartment based on the following affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">In the past seventy-two hours, a reliable confidential informant advised this affiant that he/she was present inside apartment 1 of a multi-family apartment building located at 113 Turret Lane, Hampton, Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While at the said location, the reliable confidential informant observed the sale of marijuana. The reliable confidential informant stated that he/she observed an unknown white male known only as \u201cEric\u201d who is described as 6'0\" tall, 210 pounds, 25 to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>years old, with goatee type facial hair, selling marijuana. The informant advised that all other persons present were possessing, attempting to possess or using marijuana. The informant stated that when he/she left the apartment, approximately one ounce of marijuana was still present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The search warrant was issued on October 6th and stated the officers were authorized to \u201cforthwith search\u201d for marijuana and other related paraphernalia \u201ca multi-family apartment building located at 113 Turret Lane, Hampton, Virginia, the apartment to be searched is apartment 1, also an unknown white male known only as \u2018Eric\u2019 who is described as 6'0\" tall, 210 pounds, 25 to 28 years old, with goatee type facial hair and all other persons present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The warrant was executed October 18th, twelve days after its issuance. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Detective Roberts produced a log of the SIU\u2019s activities to account for the time between the issuance of the warrant and its execution. On October 17th, SIU conducted surveillance at the Turret Lane apartment but terminated their surveillance after \u201c[Eric] was seen leaving\u201d with a large group of people and did not return. On October 18th, the police executed the search warrant and recovered marijuana and cocaine from Felton in addition to seventeen bags of marijuana and digital scales in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Felton contends the information contained in the affidavit was \u201ctoo stale\u201d to justify an \u201call persons present\u201d search at the time the search was executed because \u201cno reasonable person could have concluded that all of the persons who had been present at the time of the observation of the informant had remained on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-56, a search warrant \u201cshall command that the place be forthwith searched,\u201d as the warrant for the Turret Lane apartment directed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement \u201cis intended to \u2018define[ ] the policy of the Commonwealth that search warrants be executed as soon as reasonably practical [and] while probable cause continues to exist.\u2019\u201d <em>Maye v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 463, 477, 605 S.E.2d 353, 360 (2004) (quoting <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 737, 740, 420 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1992)). Thus, while the statute codifies the constitutional mandate that probable cause exist when the search warrant is executed, it goes further and requires that the officers execute the warrant \u201cwith reasonable dispatch and without undue delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, search warrants must be executed \u201cforthwith,\u201d as required by the statute, and before probable cause has dissipated, as required by the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 605 S.E.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Felton does not argue the officers failed to execute the warrant \u201cwith reasonable dispatch and without undue delay\u201d but contends the officers failed to execute the warrant before probable cause dissipated because no reasonable person would conclude the same individuals observed by the informant would still be present in the apartment when the warrant was executed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When a challenge is made to the continued existence of probable cause to support execution of a warrant, the proper issue for determination is whether a delay between the warrant\u2019s issuance and execution has somehow vitiated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>probable cause that existed when the warrant was issued. <em>Maye, 44 </em>Va.App. at 480, 605 S.E.2d at 362. In determining whether probable cause dissipated to execute the Turret Lane apartment warrant, our analysis would be based on whether the criminal activity described in the affidavit was of a continuing nature. <em>Turner, </em>14 Va.App. at 745, 420 S.E.2d at 239-40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But, at oral argument, Felton conceded probable cause to search the apartment still existed. Thus, the proper issue for our consideration was not raised by Felton, but in fact conceded by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">With regard to the identity issue Felton did raise, the warrant did not specify that police search only those same individuals observed by the informant. Rather, the warrant allowed police to search an individual known as \u201cEric\u201d and \u201call other persons present\u201d without regard to their identity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Felton has failed to challenge the probable cause supporting the magistrate\u2019s determination that anyone present at the apartment would be engaged in drug activity, we must presume that the warrant was lawfully issued. <em>See Lebedun v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 697, 711, 501 S.E.2d 427, 434 (1998) (presumption of validity attaches to a search conducted by police pursuant to a warrant issued by a magistrate). Thus, the officers were justified in doing exactly what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>warrant commanded\u2014searching all persons present in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">. Felton does not challenge the issuance of the warrant, only its execution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-14\">. The summons for the arrest of Felton indicated his residential address was \"113 Turret Lane, Apt. 1, Hampton, Va.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\">. Detective Roberts testified regarding the normal quantity sold from one ounce and confirmed it was of a sufficient quantity for continued sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-56 also requires that search warrants be executed within fifteen days. The warrant to search the persons present at the Turret Lane apartment was clearly executed within this time frame, and Felton does not contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. Because Felton\u2019s argument is based solely on whether probable cause dissipated, it is unnecessary to discuss the activities of the SIU set forth in the log produced by Detective Roberts or determine whether the warrant was executed \"as soon as reasonably practicable\u201d in consideration of competing law enforcement interests or reasonable police investigative practices. <em>See Maye, </em>44 Va.App. at 478-80, 605 S.E.2d at 360-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">. \u2018\u2018[W]e have held that \u2018the selling of drugs, by its nature, is an ongoing activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitaker v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. <em>21, 30, 553 </em>S.E.2d 539, 543 (2001) (quoting <em>Turner, </em>14 Va.App. at 746, 420 S.E.2d at 240).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. Felton\u2019s argument is premised upon a misunderstanding of the justification for an \"all persons present\u201d warrant. Determining whether probable cause exists to support the issuance of an \"all persons present\u201d warrant does not depend on the identity of the individuals but whether \"the information in the affidavit support[s] a finding of probable cause that those persons present in the private residence would be engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Morton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 946, 951, 434 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1993). This is so because the individuals to be searched are identified \"by physical nexus to the on-going criminal event itself.\u201d <em>New Jersey v. De Simone, </em>60 N.J. 319, 288 A.2d 849, 850 (1972). \"So long as there is good reason to suspect or believe that anyone present at the anticipated scene will probably be a participant, <em>presence </em>becomes the descriptive fact satisfying the aim of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
