On appeal, Asfaw contends the trial court erroneously denied his pretrial request for a transcript of his preliminary hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>We agree with Asfaw, reverse his convictions, and remand for retrial after the transcript has been made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Just over two weeks before trial, Asfaw\u2019s counsel filed a motion seeking the preparation of a transcript of his preliminary hearing. The court had previously found Asfaw to be indigent and appointed counsel to represent him. At a hearing ten days before trial, counsel explained to the court that Asfaw\u2019s charges had been previously <em>nolle prosequied </em>and reinstated after his acquittal on unrelated robbery and firearm charges. In that unrelated case, counsel stated, the court granted Asfaw\u2019s request for a transcript of the preliminary hearing. Counsel said the transcript proved \u201cvery useful\u201d because \u201csome of the testimony changed, especially the testimony of the primary witnesses who were actually alleged co-defendants in the matters____\u201d For similar impeachment purposes, counsel reasoned, he needed the preliminary hearing transcript of the present case \u201cso that we can have at least the preliminary testimony of the witnesses who will be testifying at trial to make sure that their testimony is consistent with what they said at the preliminary hearing.\u201d The witnesses in the unrelated case were among those who testified at Asfaw\u2019s preliminary hearing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In response, the prosecutor did not dispute counsel\u2019s proffer of the impeachment value of the transcript. Instead, the prosecutor merely stated the cost of preparing the transcript on such short notice would be very expensive. Asfaw\u2019s counsel, the prosecutor added, could instead rely on his notes from the preliminary hearing. Asfaw\u2019s counsel replied that he had \u201cno reason to believe\u201d the reporter could not prepare the transcript within several days because the court reporter retained for the preliminary hearing was not the one typically used by the court. As for the potential extra cost to expedite the transcript, Asfaw\u2019s counsel said he did not expect there to be any, but if there were, he would ask Asfaw or his parents to pay the extra cost directly. Believing there was no need for a continuance, Asfaw\u2019s counsel did not ask for one.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The trial court denied without comment Asfaw\u2019s motion for a transcript. Ten days later, the case proceeded to a jury trial on the robbery and firearm charges. In its case in chief, the Commonwealth relied heavily on the testimony of witnesses who had testified at Asfaw\u2019s preliminary hearing\u2014 some of the same witnesses who had testified unsuccessfully against Asfaw in the earlier unrelated case. The jury accepted the testimony of these witnesses and convicted Asfaw of four counts of robbery and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Under equal protection principles, an indigent defendant must be provided with the basic tools of an adequate defense. This obligation includes \u201ca transcript of prior proceedings when that transcript is needed for an effective defense.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 208, 211, 450 S.E.2d 394, 395-96 (1994) (quoting <em>Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. 226, 227, 92 S.Ct. 431, 433, 30 L.Ed.2d 400 (1971)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining need, two factors predominate: the strategic \u201cvalue\u201d the transcript provides to the defense, and the \u201cavailability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 227, 92 S.Ct. at 434; <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 710, 714, 467 S.E.2d 297, 299 (1996); <em>Anderson, </em>19 Va.App. at 211-12, 450 S.E.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As a general rule, the strategic \u201cvalue of a transcript from a prior proceeding \u2018can ordinarily be assumed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434, because \u201c[i]n cases whose outcome turns on witness credibility, the potential value of a transcript for impeachment purposes is obvious.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>19 Va.App. at 212, 450 S.E.2d at 396 (citation omitted). An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>indigent does not have to show a particularized need \u201ctailored to the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434. Nor does an indigent \u201cbear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a Court in hindsight.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>19 Va.App. at 212-13, 450 S.E.2d at 396 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is enough that he merely asserts a reasonable basis for believing the transcript would serve as a valuable \u201cdiscovery device in preparation for trial\u201d or as a \u201ctool at trial itself for the impeachment of prosecution witnesses.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">An indigent, however, cannot wait until the eve of trial to insist upon his right to a transcript. The right is waived if he does not make a \u201ctimely request ... so as to avoid disruption of the subsequently scheduled trial.\u201d <em>White, </em>21 Va.App. at 713, 467 S.E.2d at 299 (quoting <em>United States v. Talbert, </em>706 F.2d 464, 470 (4th Cir.1983)). The equal protection doctrine, after all, seeks to place the indigent in rough parity with the prudent, prepared non-indigent\u2014not the imprudent, procrastinating non-indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In this case, Asfaw\u2019s counsel filed the motion more than two weeks before trial and obtained a hearing on the motion ten days before trial. Asfaw\u2019s counsel suggested he could likely obtain the transcript within a few days without incurring an expedited reporter fee and, if any extra fee was incurred, he would ask either Asfaw or his parents to pay it. By making this proffer, Asfaw\u2019s counsel successfully avoided placing the trial court in the untenable position of either continuing the trial or authorizing an expedited fee solely because of a belated request.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Asfaw\u2019s counsel also demonstrated a persuasive need for the transcript. The witnesses at Asfaw\u2019s preliminary hearing testified in a prior case involving unrelated charges against Asfaw. The preliminary hearing transcript for the unrelated case, counsel proffered, was used to impeach these witnesses and ultimately resulted in an acquittal. With this proffer, Asfaw\u2019s counsel showed the requested transcript could likewise be used as a \u201ctool at trial itself for the impeachment of prosecution witnesses,\u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434, thus confirming that \u201cthe potential value of a transcript for impeachment purposes is obvious,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>19 Va.App. at 212, 450 S.E.2d at 396 (citation omitted). For these reasons, the trial court erred by denying Asfaw\u2019s pretrial request for a transcript of his preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, we see no basis for characterizing the error as harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The failure to provide an indigent with a transcript implicates the constitutional harmless-error stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dard which requires a reviewing court to be \u201cable to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>White, </em>21 Va.App. at 716, 467 S.E.2d at 300 (citation omitted). In this case, the prosecution relied heavily on witnesses who had earlier testified at Asfaw\u2019s preliminary hearing. The probability that Asfaw\u2019s counsel could have challenged their testimony with inconsistent statements (particularly given his claimed success at doing so in the earlier, unrelated case) precludes the trial court\u2019s error from being declared harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Because the trial court erred by denying Asfaw\u2019s motion for a transcript of his preliminary hearing, we reverse his convictions and remand for retrial after the transcript has been provided to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">. <em>See Roberts v. La Vallee, </em>389 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967) (holding a state's refusal to supply an indigent defendant with a free transcript of his preliminary hearing constituted a denial of equal protection); <em>accord Faison v. Zahradnick, </em>563 F.2d 1135, 1135-36 (4th Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">. Before the trial court, the Commonwealth suggested Asfaw\u2019s counsel could rely on his notes of the preliminary hearing as an alternative to the transcript. While counsel\u2019s notes might fulfill the discovery function of a transcript, they cannot satisfy the impeachment function of a transcript. \"When a transcript is desired for impeachment, the fact that the Commonwealth supplied other bases for impeachment is inadequate consolation.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 47.4, at 752-53 (4th ed.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">. The Commonwealth contends on appeal Asfaw failed to properly preserve the transcript issue for appellate review under Rule 5A:18. We disagree. After reminding the court of his client\u2019s indigency, Asfaw\u2019s court-appointed counsel asserted a specific need for the transcript and proffered a reasonable basis for his belief that it was important to Asfaw\u2019s defense. This argument fully satisfied\u2014albeit not by name\u2014 the <em>Britt </em>constitutional standard, the only legal basis available for an indigent to demand a free transcript. When relief sought in a trial court involves alternative and analytically different legal theories, Rule 5A:18 requires a litigant to <em>specifically </em>assert in the trial court the legal theory he seeks to raise on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 24 n. 2, 635 S.E.2d 688, 690 n. 2 (2006). On the other hand, when the relief requested in the trial court could only involve one possible legal basis, Rule 5A:18 does not \u201cprohibit reliance on statutes or cases not presented to the trial court to support, on appeal, a position otherwise adequately presented at trial.\u201d <em>Lash v. County of Henrico, </em>14 Va.App. 926, 929, 421 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1992) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-678 makes \"harmless-error review required in <em>all </em>cases.\" <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. ix, ix, 396 S.E.2d 675, 675 (1990) (emphasis in original and text in parenthetical). That is particularly true where, as here, a decision on the merits would be \"rendered moot\u201d by a \"further ruling that the error in the trial court's denial of a free transcript was harmless.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Harley, 256 </em>Va. 216, 219, 504 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b214-16\">. Asfaw also appeals certain evidentiary rulings of the trial court. At oral argument, both Asfaw and the Commonwealth agreed we need not offer advisory opinions on these evidentiary points as they are unlikely to come up in the same manner on remand. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 24:50; 25:45 (Feb. 16, 2010). We thus do not address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
