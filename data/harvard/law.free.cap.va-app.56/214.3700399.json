White, (ii) found he brought more assets into the marriage, and (Hi) awarded him a greater share of the marital estate. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003) (citations omitted). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferential!y, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Brandau v. Brandau, 52 </em>Va.App. 632, 635, 666 S.E.2d 532, 534 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Husband and wife married in 1986. In 2007, husband filed a complaint seeking a divorce. Wife also requested a divorce. Neither party sought spousal support, and both requested an equitable distribution award. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, husband was 75 years old and suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease. He lived alone in an assisted living facility. Wife was 25 years his younger and worked for the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>At the hearing, husband\u2019s counsel argued husband\u2019s age and medical condition should be considered in fashioning the equitable distribution award. Counsel contended these considerations coupled with husband\u2019s monetary contributions to the marriage made it appropriate for the court to include in husband\u2019s award his retirement funds, most of the liquid marital assets (including CDs and savings bonds), and a greater portion of the equity in the marital home. Wife\u2019s counsel made a general objection to any consideration of husband\u2019s \u201cfuture needs.\u201d The court twice asked husband\u2019s counsel to provide legal authorities addressing this issue, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">From the bench, the court explained its equitable distribution award in light of each of the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). With respect to factor 4, the court stated, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to know just how ... to construe that factor. I\u2019ll only say that I have tried in my consideration to take into account their relative ages and physical and mental condition.\u201d The court later remarked, \u201cMy conclusion, in looking at the statute and case law, that the future need, while it\u2019s certainly a factor I considered, it\u2019s not a predominant factor. It\u2019s the property of the parties as they now have it and not their present, even their present or future needs.\u201d After valuing the marital estate at approximately $1,200,000, the trial court awarded <em>55% </em>to husband and 45% to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">A. Consideration of Future Needs</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Wife contends the trial court, by mentioning husband\u2019s \u201cfuture needs\u201d during its ruling from the bench, betrayed a misunderstanding of the conceptual differences between equitable distribution and spousal support. She argues we should vacate the award and remand it to the trial court for reconsideration without any reference to husband\u2019s \u201cfuture needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">In Virginia, \u201cwe presume [trial] judges know the law and correctly apply it.\u201d <em>de Haan v. de Haan, </em>54 Va.App. 428, 445, 680 S.E.2d 297, 306 (2009) (citation omitted). An appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>lant can rebut the presumption by showing, either by the ruling itself or the reasoning underlying it, the trial judge misunderstood the governing legal principles. We are particularly skeptical, however, of appellate efforts to piece together such a conclusion from fragmented remarks from the bench. <em>See generally Damon v. York, </em>54 Va.App. 544, 555, 680 S.E.2d 354, 360 (2009) (holding it improper to \u201cfix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On appeal, wife argues our holding in <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>7 Va.App. 553, 565, 375 S.E.2d 533, 540 (1989), precluded the trial court from considering <em>any </em>future needs under <em>any </em>circumstances when fashioning an equitable distribution award. We do not view <em>Reid </em>so broadly. In <em>Reid, </em>the trial court awarded spousal support and ordered equitable distribution. The trial court relied on the catch-all factor of the equitable distribution statute, factor 11 of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), to enhance the equitable distribution award based upon the payor spouse\u2019s future income and the payee spouse\u2019s need for future housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Though our rhetoric in <em>Reid </em>was broad,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our holding was narrow: \u201cSpecifically, we hold that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(11) does not contemplate consideration of earning capacity of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>spouse and support needs of the other spouse, which are expressly embodied in Code \u00a7 20-107.1 and are more appropriately determined under the latter statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 375 S.E.2d at 540. The <em>Reid </em>holding, therefore, addressed future needs only in the context of the <em>catch-all factor </em>of the equitable distribution statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Here, unlike <em>Reid, </em>the trial court relied not on the catch-all factor but on factor 4 of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) which mandates consideration of the \u201cages and physical and mental condition of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only in this context did the trial court consider husband\u2019s future needs. The court did not err by doing so. \u201cThe age of the parties obviously has nothing to do with their contributions to the marriage. Age is a valid indicator of need, however, as older parties generally have less income and more medical expenses.\u201d Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 8.20, at 878 (3d ed. 2005). \u201cHealth, like age, has no direct effect on property division,\u201d but a party\u2019s physical and mental condition nonetheless remains a \u201cvalid indicator of need, since less healthy parties have smaller incomes and greater expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 879. Age and health, therefore, \u201care relevant mostly as secondary indications of financial need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.15, at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Wife contends we can still interpret the age-and-health factor in a way that wholly ignores future needs. We do not see how. Age is inexorable. It ratchets in only one direction. By requiring a trial judge to consider a spouse\u2019s age-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>needs, the equitable distribution statute acknowledges this inescapable reality. Much the same can be said of the physical and mental conditions of the parties. When such conditions will likely continue into the future (like husband\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease), a trial court should consider the future. When such conditions are merely temporary, the trial court should limit its consideration accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In short, the trial court took into account husband\u2019s future needs only to the extent they related to his age and health\u2014a mandatory consideration under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4). Neither <em>Reid </em>nor its progeny forbid the court from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">B. Husband\u2019s Contribution of Assets to Marriage</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Wife also contests the trial court\u2019s determination that husband \u201ccame to the marriage with some more property\u201d than wife. This finding, wife argues, unfairly skewed the equitable distribution award in husband\u2019s favor. We have reviewed the record, however, and found no instance where wife specifically brought this objection to the trial court\u2019s attention. Wife\u2019s brief on appeal does not point us to any specific objection or contend we should review the matter even if none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Rule 5A:18 precludes appellants from raising for the first time on appeal \u201cgrounds asserted as a \u2018basis for reversal\u2019 of the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Blackman v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 633, 642, 613 S.E.2d 460, 465 (2005) (citation omitted). Exceptions to Rule 5A:18 exist\u2014but we employ them only in rare cases, and we never invoke them <em>sua sponte. See Widdifield v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 559, 564, 600 S.E.2d 159, 162 (2004) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 761, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en banc), aff'd by unpublished order, </em>No. 040019 (Va. Oct. 15, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">C. Award of 55% of Marital Assets to Husband</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The trial court divided the marital assets on a 55/45 ratio to husband and wife. On appeal, wife acknowledges she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>has no presumptive right to a 50/50 award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She also lodges no general challenge to the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. Instead, she asserts only that the disparate award resulted from the trial court\u2019s erroneous consideration of husband\u2019s \u201cfuture needs\u201d and his greater contribution of assets at the inception of the marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we disagree with wife\u2019s first assertion and find her second assertion procedurally defaulted, her challenge to the award ratio necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Finding no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award, we affirm the final divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">. \"It is axiomatic,\u201d we generalized, that \"whatever the future may hold for either of the parties has no bearing on the issue of the appropriate division of what has been accumulated by their contributions during the marriage.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>7 Va.App. at 565, 375 S.E.2d at 540. Some have criticized this claimed axiom as \"unusual\u201d and \"highly questionable.\u201d Lawrence J.
