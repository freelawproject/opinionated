He contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his probation, asserting that his probation revocation hearing was held after the statutory time limitation prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-306 had expired. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">On May 1, 2002, appellant was convicted of grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and sentenced to four years imprisonment. The trial court imposed an active term of incarceration of twenty-two months. It suspended the remainder of appellant\u2019s sentence for three years conditioned on his being placed on supervised probation for a period of three years following his release from incarceration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">On February 13, 2003, appellant was released from incarceration and began his period of supervised probation. On April 10, 2004, the trial court was notified that appellant had violated the terms of his probation. On May 28, 2004, the trial court issued a show cause order for appellant to appear before it to show cause why his probation should not be revoked and his suspended sentence reimposed. On July 26, 2004, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>appellant failed to appear for the show cause hearing, the trial court issued a bench warrant for his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 24, 2008, appellant was served with the bench warrant, while he was in the Fairfax County jail on an unrelated charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">At his April 3, 2009 probation revocation hearing, appellant argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his probation and his suspended sentence. He asserted that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-306, the trial court lost its \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d to revoke his probation and suspended sentence because he was not served with the bench warrant charging the probation violation and brought before the trial court on that charge within one year following the end of his three-year probation period. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument, ruling that Code \u00a7 19.2-306, as amended in 2002, required only that a bench warrant charging his probation violation be issued within one year following the end of his probation period. It concluded that, because the bench warrant charging appellant\u2019s probation violation was issued within the statutory time limits, it retained jurisdiction to revoke his probation and suspended sentence. It found appellant guilty of violating the terms of his probation, revoked his suspended sentence, resuspended all but six months of that sentence, and placed him on supervised probation for two years following his release from incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On appeal, as he did in the trial court, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the revocation proceeding. He asserts that the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-306 in effect at the time of his conviction and sentencing in May 2002, not the amendment to that statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>effective July 1, 2002, governed the trial court\u2019s authority to revoke his probation and his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">On appeal, we review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the \u201ctrial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case.\u201d <em>Watts v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 206, 213, 562 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cWhen coupled with a suspended sentence, probation represents \u2018an act of grace on the part of the Commonwealth to one who has been convicted and sentenced to a term of confinement.\u2019 \u201d Price <em>v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 443, 448, 658 S.E.2d 700, 703 (2008) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 660, 667, 633 S.E.2d 755, 758 (2006)). We have previously \u201cnoted the wide latitude the legislature has afforded trial courts in fashioning rehabilitative programs for defendants.\u201d <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1085, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991) (citing <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 685, 292 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1982)); see, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-304 (permitting trial court to \u201csubsequently increase or decrease the probation period and may revoke or modify any condition of probation\u201d). \u201c[P]robation statutes ... should be liberally construed to provide trial courts a valuable tool for rehabilitation of criminals.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>223 Va. at 684, 292 S.E.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Prior to the 2002 amendment, Code \u00a7 19.2-306 required that a person accused of violating the terms of his probation be arrested and brought before the trial court within one year following the end of his probation period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Effective July 1, 2002, Code \u00a7 19.2-306 was amended by deleting the requirement that a person charged with violating his probation be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>arrested and brought before the trial court within one year following the end of his probation period. 2002 Va. Acts ch. 628. As amended, Code \u00a7 19.2-306, in effect when appellant was released from incarceration and began his period of probation on February 13, 2003, provides that the \u201ccourt may not conduct a hearing to revoke the suspension of sentence unless the court, within one year <em>after the expiration of the period of probation </em>or the period of suspension, <em>issues process to notify the accused </em>or to compel his appearance before the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306(B) (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Citing <em>Morency v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 569, 574, 649 S.E.2d 682, 684 (2007),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellant asserts that his May 2002 sentencing order was a final judgment order and that Code \u00a7 1-239<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> vested him with an accrued right to the law governing probation revocation procedures in effect at that time. He argues that the law governing probation revocation proceedings as applied to him required that he be arrested and brought before the trial court prior to February 13, 2007 (one year following the end of his probation period) for violating his probation. He contends that because he was not brought before the trial court within that time period, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to conduct the probation violation proceeding and to revoke his suspended sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find his argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In <em>Morency, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201ca final judgment order may vest a litigant with an accrued right for purposes of Code \u00a7 1-239.\u201d 274 Va. at 574, 649 S.E.2d at 684. It continued to say that \u201c[t]his conclusion, however, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>end our inquiry. The nature of the specific \u2018right\u2019 embodied in the judgment order must be determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 649 S.E.2d at 684. Here, the <em>nature of the specific right to be determined, </em>is whether appellant\u2019s probation is governed by the 2002 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-306, a statute that provides <em>\u201cprocedural </em>time limits ... to safeguard the due process rights of persons receiving suspended sentences or probation.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 329, 332, 343 S.E.2d 385, 387 (1986) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201c[T]he issue at a [probation] revocation proceeding is not what sentence to impose upon the defendant for his prior criminal conviction, but whether to continue all or any portion of a previously imposed and suspended sentence due to the defendant\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of his probation.\u201d <em>Alsberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 314, 318, 572 S.E.2d 522, 524 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">As the Supreme Court held long ago, \u201c[statutory] alterations which do not increase the punishment, nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt ... <em>relate to modes of procedure only, </em>in which no one can be said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\"><em>Pilcher v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 158, 169, 583 S.E.2d 70, 75 (2003) (quoting <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 590, 4 S.Ct. 202, 210, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Because the 2002 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-306 altered only the time period within which a probationer charged with violating the terms of his probation must be brought before the trial court for a hearing on that charge, that amendment was <em>procedural </em>in nature. \u201c[A] procedural remedy ... \u2018may be altered, curtailed, or repealed at the will of the legislature\u2019 and therefore [does] not give rise to any vested interest.\u201d <em>Morency, </em>274 Va. at 576-77, 649 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>685 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Shaffer, </em>263 Va. 428, 432-33, 559 S.E.2d 623, 626 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s May 1, 2002 sentencing order states that appellant \u201cis placed on probation <em>to commence on his release from incarceration, </em>under the supervision of a Probation Officer for three (3) years----The defendant shall comply with all the rules and requirements set by the Probation Officer.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The procedural law governing appellant\u2019s probation is governed by the statute in effect at the time he was placed on probation after serving a portion of his imposed sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in applying the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-306 in effect when appellant began his period of probation on February 13, 2003. On July 1, 2002, appellant was serving a sentence of active incarceration imposed by the trial court on May 1, 2002. On February 13, 2003, after the July 1, 2002 effective date of the amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-306, appellant was released from incarceration and placed on supervised probation, a condition for which his remaining sentence had been suspended. He thereafter violated the terms of his probation. The trial court issued a bench warrant for his arrest for violating his probation on July 26, 2004, well within the time period prescribed by the 2002 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-306 in effect at that time. Because appellant\u2019s probation revocation proceeding was conducted in compliance with the procedures in effect at the time his probation began, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-306 in finding that appellant violated his probation and in sentencing him accordingly. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 476, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">. We note that, while \"probation\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201csuspended sentence,\u201d the terms refer to different sentencing matters. <em>See Grant v.

Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 228, 661 S.E.2d 415, 426 (2008)). The \"Supreme Court has distinguished subject matter jurisdiction as a unique form of jurisdiction and has defined it as a type of jurisdiction (1) that is granted to courts by constitution or statute and (2) that delineates a court\u2019s ability to adjudicate a defined class of cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 691 S.E.2d at 515.

The question presented in this appeal is not one of whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to revoke appellant\u2019s probation, it clearly did, but whether the trial court had authority jurisdiction within the time limitation provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-306 to revoke his probation. <em>See Mohamed, </em>56 Va.App. at 101, 691 S.E.2d at 516 (\"[w]hile the authority to exercise jurisdiction is a type of jurisdiction, it is distinct from subject matter jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">.

In <em>Farmer, </em>the accused was convicted on October 8, 1998 and sentenced to six months in jail. He was placed on supervised probation at that time, and his sentence of imprisonment was suspended for two years, conditioned on his successful completion of his probation.

The one-year period following the end of his probation period concluded on October 8, 2001.
