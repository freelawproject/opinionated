On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike four of these ten charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant also argues that the trial court erred when it refused appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction, which was based on the model jury instruction for constructive possession of contraband. Disagreeing with appellant\u2019s arguments, we affirm all ten convictions for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">On the morning of February 14, 2008, police officers executed a search warrant on a Stafford County home owned by appellant\u2019s parents. Appellant resided in a basement apartment in this home, which had a separate door to the outside, as well as a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a storage area. Appellant had lived in the basement apartment for two- and-a-half years, and he had been its sole occupant for approximately five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Appellant was in the basement apartment when the officers executed the search warrant. In the basement apartment\u2019s living room, appellant\u2019s computer was turned on, and its monitor displayed a photograph of appellant. The police seized this computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Detective Darrell Wells, who was admitted at appellant\u2019s trial as an expert in computer forensics, conducted an examination of appellant\u2019s computer. His examination revealed that the temporary Internet file cache of appellant\u2019s computer contained twenty digital pictures that were characterized as child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fourteen additional photographs depicted young girls who were completely nude, almost nude, or only partially clothed, and another file contained a video of a man engaging in sexual intercourse with a young girl. Detective Wells did not detect any viruses on appellant\u2019s computer and found no signs that these files carried any viruses.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Based on his analysis of appellant\u2019s computer and the temporary Internet cache, Detective Wells testified that these files had all been created and saved to the computer\u2019s hard drive between 8:07 a.m. and 8:12 a.m. on the morning of February 14, 2008\u2014less than two hours before the police arrived to execute the search warrant. There was no evidence that appellant left the basement apartment that morning or that anyone else had been inside the basement apartment that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Appellant moved to strike four of the ten charges of possession of child pornography, contending that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 required the Commonwealth to introduce three or more images of child pornography to support each conviction under that statute. Thus, he contended, the Commonwealth proved only six violations of the statute. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In addition, appellant proffered a jury instruction that adapted a model jury instruction on constructive possession of contraband. Appellant claimed that this instruction was required under <em>Kromer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 812, 613 S.E.2d 871 (2005), where this Court affirmed Kromer\u2019s conviction for possession of child pornography by applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>principles of constructive possession. The trial court refused appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction, finding that it contained language that was inapplicable to the facts presented at trial and that it was potentially confusing to the jury. The trial court instead instructed the jury that the Commonwealth was required to prove that \u201cthe defendant knowingly possessed child pornography.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">During its deliberations during the guilt phase of the trial, the jury asked the trial court to define \u201cknowingly possessed.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury that it had received all applicable instructions and that it must apply its common sense understanding of those instructions to the facts in the case. The jury eventually found appellant guilty on all ten counts of possession of child pornography, and appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">A. Motion to Strike Four Charges of Child Pornography</p>\n<p id=\"AEfV\">Appellant argues that the twenty images of child pornography found in his temporary Internet cache were insufficient to prove ten counts of possession of child pornography, but instead provided sufficient evidence to prove only six counts. Appellant premises this question presented on an issue of statutory interpretation\u2014whether Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) requires proof of at least three images of child pornography \u201cstored in a computer\u2019s temporary Internet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>cache\u201d to support each conviction under that statute. In addressing appellant\u2019s argument, we are mindful that \u201c[statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law and is accordingly subject to <em>de novo </em>review\u201d by an appellate court. <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006) (citing <em>Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1 prohibits the knowing possession of child pornography. A person possesses child pornography when he or she possesses \u201csexually explicit visual material which utilizes or has as a subject an identifiable minor.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A). \u201cSexually explicit visual material\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">a picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, digital image, <em>including such material stored in a computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache when three or more images or streaming videos are present, </em>or similar visual representation which depicts sexual bestiality, a lewd exhibition of nudity, as nudity is defined in \u00a7 18.2-390, or sexual excitement, sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse, as also defined in \u00a7 18.2-390, or a book, magazine or pamphlet which contains such a visual representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In 2007, the General Assembly amended its definition of \u201csexually explicit material\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) to include the emphasized language concerning materials stored on a computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 636 S.E.2d 480 (2006), Mason argued, similar to appellant\u2019s argument here, that the trial court erred in finding that each photograph of child pornography could support a separate conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1. This Court rejected Mason\u2019s argument, emphasizing that the General Assembly chose to define \u201csexually explicit visual material\u201d as \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, digital image or similar visual representation\u2019 depicting lewd conduct or sexual activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 636 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A)). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Edu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>cational Books, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 392, 323 S.E.2d 84 (1984), which held that the permissible unit of prosecution for the sale of obscene items under Code \u00a7 18.2-374 was the number of each such item sold, this Court held in <em>Mason </em>that \u201cthe permissible unit of prosecution for possession of child pornography under [the statute] corresponds to the number of individual items of sexually explicit visual material.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>49 Va.App. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Appellant argues that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mason </em>no longer controls because it was decided the year before the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) to include the language concerning materials stored on a computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache. He contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) should now be strictly construed to require that the Commonwealth introduce, at a minimum, three images from a computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache for each charge of possession of child pornography. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\u201cOnce the legislature has acted, the role of the judiciary \u2018is the narrow one of determining what [the legislature] meant by the words it used in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dionne v. Southeast Foam Converting &amp; Packaging, Inc., </em>240 Va. 297, 304, 397 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1990) (quoting <em>Diamond v. Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. 303, 318, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 2212-13, 65 L.Ed.2d 144 (1980)). \u201cWhen considering the meaning and effect of a statute, this Court follows the long-held standard that the clear meanings of words are controlling\u201d and determines the legislature\u2019s intention from the plain language of the statute, \u201c\u2018unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 115, 124, 637 S.E.2d 344, 348 (2006) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Courts are not permitted to interpret a statute in a way that \u2018\u201cwould render the statute strained, ambiguous, illogical, and in contravention of the legislature\u2019s clear intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 139, 145, 692 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2010) (quoting <em>Broadnax v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 808, 814-15, 485 S.E.2d 666, 668-69 (1997)). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>over, \u201c[o]nly when a \u2018penal statute is <em>unclear</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>do courts apply the rule of lenity and strictly construe the statute in the criminal defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>De\u2019Armond v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 26, 34, 654 S.E.2d 317, 321 (2007) (quoting <em>Waldrop v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 210, 214, 495 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1998)). \u201c[T]he rule of lenity serves only to resolve genuine, plausible ambiguities and \u2018does not abrogate the well recognized canon that a statute ... should be read and applied so as to accord with the purpose intended and attain the objects desired if that may be accomplished without doing harm to its language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 654 S.E.2d at 321 (quoting <em>Cartwright v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 368, 372, 288 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In <em>Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 301, 288 S.E.2d 461 (1982), the Supreme Court stated that the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cparamount legislative goal\u201d in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 \u201cwas to protect children from the harm they suffer when they are induced to become models\u201d in sexually explicit materials. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 288 S.E.2d at 465. In furtherance of this legislative intent, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) provides that possession of <em>a </em>photograph (as well as <em>a </em>picture, <em>a </em>drawing, <em>a </em>motion picture film, or <em>a </em>digital image, among other items), when containing sexually explicit material involving an identifiable minor, can fully support a conviction for possession of child pornography. Thus, \u201cthe Virginia legislature has demonstrated its clear intent that possession of a single photograph could constitute an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 and that multiple punishments would result from multiple violations of the statute.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>49 Va.App. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">It is completely inconsistent with this clear legislative intent to suggest that the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) in 2007 to address the pervasive dissemination of child pornography by computer and over the Internet by potentially <em>reducing </em>the culpability of those persons whose computers store images or streaming videos of child pornography in the temporary Internet cache. Interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) to require proof of three images or videos from a defendant\u2019s temporary Internet cache per conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>doubtlessly would \u201c \u2018defeat the obvious intention of the legislature,\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1271-72, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974)), which a court simply should not and cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) now provides that os <em>a threshold </em>for convictions of possession of child pornography based on materials found in a defendant\u2019s temporary Internet cache, the Commonwealth must first establish that \u201cthree or more images or streaming videos\u201d depicting sexually explicit material involving an identifiable minor actually are stored on the computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once that threshold of \u201cthree or more images or streaming videos\u201d stored on a computer\u2019s temporary Internet cache is satisfied, however, we hold, as this Court held in <em>Mason, </em>that \u201cthe permissible unit of prosecution for possession of child pornography\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A) \u201ccorresponds to the number of individual items of sexually explicit visual material.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>49 Va.App. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484; <em>see also Educational Books, Inc., </em>228 Va. at 395, 323 S.E.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Applying these legal principles to the facts of this case, we find the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of twenty examples of child pornography, which were found in the temporary Internet cache of appellant\u2019s computer, was certainly sufficient to prove ten counts of possession of child pornography. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike four of these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>B. Refused Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Appellant also argues that the trial court erred when it refused his proffered jury instruction, which he had adapted from the model jury instruction for constructive possession of contraband, for use in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that portions of appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction were not \u201capropos to the facts of this case\u201d and included \u201cphrases and references which are not only inappropriate but would be downright confusing to the jury.\u201d Instead of using appellant\u2019s proposed instruction, the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict appellant of possession of child pornography only if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chibikom v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 422, 425, 680 S.E.2d 295, 296 (2009) (quoting <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988)). \u201cIt is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the \u2018essentials of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell, </em>6 Va.App. at 488, 370 S.E.2d at 719 (quoting <em>Dowdy v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>114, 116, 255 S.E.2d 506, 508 (1979)). \u201cInstructions are to be read in connection with the evidence to which they are intended to apply.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Hutchinson, </em>172 Va. 43, 52, 200 S.E. 644, 648 (1939). Moreover, the trial court has broad discretion over whether to give or deny proposed jury instructions. <em>See Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Appellant contends that his proffered jury instruction was required under this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Kromer, </em>but we find that case is not controlling given the very different facts presented here. In <em>Kromer, </em>a forensic examiner found several files containing child pornography on Kromer\u2019s computer. These files had been created at least two months before the police seized the computer. <em>Kromer, </em>45 Va.App. at 815, 613 S.E.2d at 873. Kromer\u2019s hypothesis of innocence was that someone else, such as a family member, downloaded the pornographic images on his computer and created those files. <em>Id. </em>at 820, 613 S.E.2d at 875. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Kromer\u2019s conviction, this Court noted that it need not \u201cdetermine whether [Kromer] was the person who downloaded the pornographic images,\u201d but instead \u201cwhether [Kromer] knew the images existed,\u201d and if so, whether he exercised dominion and control over them after they were downloaded. <em>Id. </em>at 818, 613 S.E.2d at 874. Applying principles of constructive possession, this Court ultimately determined that the evidence was sufficient to find that Kromer knowingly possessed child pornography in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A). <em>Id. </em>at 818-21, 613 S.E.2d at 874-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The facts in Kromer\u2014which involved the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction for possession of child pornography, rather than appropriate jury instructions for a possession of child pornography trial\u2014are readily distinguishable from the facts in this case. Here, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, the proponent of the refused jury instruction, <em>see Rose v. Jaques, </em>268 Va. 137, 150, 597 S.E.2d 64, 71 (2004), there was not even a scintilla of evidence presented at trial that anyone but appellant was in the basement apartment on the morning of Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ary 14, 2008\u2014when the files containing child pornography were saved to the temporary Internet cache of appellant\u2019s computer. <em>See Cherrix v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 292, 307, 513 S.E.2d 642, 652 (1999) (stating that \u201ca defendant is not entitled to a jury instruction unless it is supported by more than a scintilla of evidence\u201d). Thus, unlike in <em>Kromer, </em>where the issue was whether Kromer was aware that either he or someone else had downloaded child pornography onto his computer months before the computer was seized, the question of fact to be determined by the factfinder here was whether appellant was aware of the child pornography that first appeared on his computer <em>the very morning </em>that the police executed the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Although appellant argues that his proffered jury instruction would have better assisted the jury in determining whether appellant knowingly possessed the child pornography found on his computer,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court <em>actually instructed </em>the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>to determine whether appellant \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d child pornography, as was required by statute to support a conviction for possession of child pornography.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the Virginia Code simply provides that any person who \u201cknowingly possesses\u201d child pornography is guilty of possession of child pornography. Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A). The trial court informed the jurors \u201cas to the essential elements of the offense\u201d by instructing them that the evidence must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d child pornography in order to convict him under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A). <em>Darnell, </em>6 Va.App. at 488, 370 S.E.2d at 719. Consequently, we conclude the trial court did not err in granting this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Moreover, appellant, as the proponent of the refused jury instruction, bore the burden \u201cto satisfy the trial court that the proposed language [gave] a correct statement of the law, applicable to the facts of the case on trial, and expressed in appropriate language.\u201d <em>Shaikh v. Johnson, </em>276 Va. 537, 546, 666 S.E.2d 325, 329 (2008). Appellant failed to carry this burden in the proceedings below, as the trial court found that portions of appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction were inapplicable to the facts presented at trial and could potentially confuse the jury. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">For instance, appellant\u2019s proposed instruction would have told the jury that \u201c[p]ossession need not be exclusive; it may be shared with another.\u201d While expressing a generally correct statement of law, this portion of the instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>wholly inapplicable to the facts presented at trial. As discussed above, only appellant was in the basement apartment when the files corresponding to the pornographic photographs and video (as well as the photographs of nude, almost nude, and partially clothed young girls) were created and saved to the computer\u2014sometime between 8:07 a.m. and 8:12 a.m. on February 14, 2008. Therefore, no evidence at trial even suggested the possibility that appellant\u2019s possession of the photographs depicting child pornography was \u201cshared with another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In addition, the portion of appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction indicating that the \u201clength of time of the possession [of child pornography] is not material\u201d was potentially confusing to the jury. Here, as the trial court found in denying appellant\u2019s renewed motion to strike, the fact that the pornographic images were stored on appellant\u2019s temporary Internet cache for a very short period of time before his computer was seized by the police was an <em>extremely </em>material and relevant circumstance for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Thus, appellant failed to establish that significant portions of his proposed jury instruction were applicable to the facts of this case and were expressed in appropriate language. <em>See Shaikh, </em>276 Va. at 546, 666 S.E.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In contrast to appellant\u2019s misleading and rather unwieldy proposed instruction, the trial court here gave the jury a \u201csimple, impartial, clear, concise statement of the law.\u201d <em>Gottlieb v. Commonwealth, </em>126 Va. 807, 813, 101 S.E. 872, 874 (1920). Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to include appellant\u2019s proffered jury instruction in its initial charge to the jury. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion when it declined to use appellant\u2019s instruction in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry concerning the definition of \u201cknowingly possessed.\u201d As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">Once the judge has made an accurate and correct charge, the extent of its amplification must rest largely in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>discretion. The trial judge, in the light of the whole trial and with the jury before him, may feel that to repeat the same words would make them no more clear, and to indulge in variations of statement might well confuse. How far any charge on technical questions of law is really understood by those of lay background would be difficult to ascertain, but it is certainly more evident in the living scene than in a cold record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 67 S.Ct. at 1396. Here, the trial court indicated that the jury had been adequately instructed and advised the jury to apply its common sense to the instructions and the facts of the case in determining whether appellant knowingly possessed child pornography. This response to the jury\u2019s inquiry was certainly appropriate. <em>See Van Dyke v. Common</em>wealth, 178 Va. 418, 426, 17 S.E.2d 366, 370 (1941) (\u201c[I]n the consideration of facts established the jury must apply common sense and weigh them as ordinary men are expected to weigh them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\u201c \u2018When granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaines, </em>39 Va.App. at 568, 574 S.E.2d at 778 (quoting <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384 (1984)). Based on the record before us, we conclude that the trial court left \u201cnothing unsaid which need[ed] to be said, while saying no more than necessary.\u201d <em>Kennemore v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 703, 712, 653 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A), which defines \u201cchild pornography,\u201d does not require that each conviction be supported by three separate images containing child pornography. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike four of the charges of possession of child pornography. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing appellant\u2019s proffered jury instruction. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of child pornography under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A), as well as the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>convictions for possession of child pornography, second or subsequent offense, under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\">. Appellant also made a separate motion to strike all ten charges, based on a different legal argument. Although he requested review of the trial court\u2019s denial of this motion, an appeal was not granted on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. \"Child pornography\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \"sexually explicit visual material which utilizes or has as a subject an identifiable minor.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A). Appellant does not contest that these twenty photographs were child pornography.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">. The full text of this instruction given by the trial court to the jury states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">The defendant is charged with the crime of Possession of Child Pornography. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following element of that Crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">1) That the defendant knowingly possessed child pornography;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-11\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the above element of the crime as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-12\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt of [sic] the element of the crime, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. Enacting such a threshold is certainly reasonable, given the possibility that an innocent person may download sexually explicit material accidentally or inadvertently over the Internet or via electronic mail. <em>See Kromer, </em>45 Va.App. at 821, 613 S.E.2d at 875-76 (\u201cWe are not suggesting that anyone who ever uses a computer containing sexually explicit images of children is guilty of possessing child pornography.\u201d); <em>cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(c) (providing an affirmative defense for possession of child pornography if a defendant establishes that he or she possessed \"less than three matters\u201d of child pornography and either destroyed each visual depiction of child pornography or made a report to a law enforcement agency).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">. Appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">To knowingly and intentionally possess an image of child pornography means that a person is aware of the presence and character of the image and has actual physical possession or constructive possession. Actual physical possession means that the image or item is found on the person. Constructive possession means that the person has dominion and control over the image. Mere proximity is not enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">Possession need not be exclusive; it may be shared with another. The length of time of the possession is not material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">Ownership or occupancy of the premises in which an image of child pornography is found does not create a presumption that the owner or occupant either knowingly or intentionally possessed such image. Such ownership or occupancy is a fact which may be considered with other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">Possession may be proved by acts, declarations or conduct of the defendant from which it may be fairly inferred that he was aware of the presence and character of the image at the place found.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\">. During oral argument before this Court, appellant\u2019s counsel noted that Detective Wells could not testify with certainty how the child pornography files had ended up on appellant\u2019s computer. For instance, the detective acknowledged that pornographic images sometimes appear on \u201cpop-up\" or \"pop-down\u201d advertisements, which often occur contrary to the intention of the user of the computer. Therefore, appellant contended, the files might have been saved to the temporary Internet cache without appellant\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Although the detective\u2019s acknowledgement was relevant evidence for the jury to consider, appellant provided no <em>affirmative </em>evidence that supported his proffered jury instruction. <em>See Commonwealth v. Leal, </em>265 Va. 142, 147, 574 S.E.2d 285, 288 (2003) (\"We repeatedly have ruled that although the jury's ability to reject evidence will support an acquittal, the ability to reject evidence does not supply the affirmative evidence necessary to support a jury instruction.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). No affirmative evidence at trial suggested that the files were downloaded to appellant\u2019s computer accidentally or without his knowledge. Rather, the evidence established the opposite. We note that his computer's temporary Internet cache contained not only twenty images of child pornography, but also fourteen additional images depicting nude, almost nude, or partially nude young girls. It is unlikely that thirty-four images of such material could be downloaded accidentally or unknowingly, especially when there is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that these files were accidentally downloaded. Furthermore, a video of a man engaging in sexual intercourse with a young girl also appeared in appellant's temporary Internet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>cache. Notably, Detective Wells testified that a video takes longer to download to a computer\u2019s hard-drive than a photograph would take, so accidental downloading of such material is highly unlikely. The trial court was permitted to consider that appellant presented no affirmative evidence to suggest the images and video here were accidentally or unknowingly downloaded when it refused appellant's proffered jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">. In his petition for appeal, appellant argued under a separate question presented that the trial court was required to instruct the jury that it must find appellant \"knowingly <em>and intentionally </em>\" possessed the child pornography in order to convict. An appeal was not granted on that question presented, however, so it is not before this Court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
