On appeal, he contends the trial court improperly prohibited him from using evidence that the decedent belonged to a particular gang, erroneously preventing him (1) from questioning the jury pool about possible gang affiliations to assess bias, (2) from cross-examining one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses about his affiliation with the decedent\u2019s gang, also as relevant to show bias, and (3) from introducing evidence about the decedent\u2019s gang affiliation to show the decedent\u2019s propensity for violence as related to appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense. We hold the proffered evidence was relevant, material, and more probative than prejudicial and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow appellant to use the evidence during trial in an attempt to show the witness\u2019 bias was not harmless error. Thus, we reverse and remand for retrial. Because gang affiliation evidence will be admitted on remand, we hold appellant will be entitled, within limits to be determined by the trial court in its discretion, to have the jury questioned regarding possible bias resulting from gang membership.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Because the admissibility of evidence depends on whether its proponent has laid a proper foundation from which the jury might conclude it is relevant to the proponent\u2019s theory of the case, we recite the evidence in a manner that reflects appellant\u2019s theory of the case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 1-5, at 30 (6th ed. 2003) (noting that \u201c[w]here <em>relevance, </em>as distinguished from competence, [of proffered evidence] is involved,\u201d and \u201cthe relevance ... depend[s] upon the existence of a fact, ... the judge may be obligated to admit the evidence and allow the jury to make the \u2018preliminary\u2019 determination of fact\u201d as long as \u201cthere is some evidence from which the jury might reasonably find the fact upon which relevancy depends\u201d (citing <em>McMurray v. Commonwealth, </em>143 Va. 489, 129 S.E. 252 (1925))).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">At about 3:30 a.m. on April 20, 2008, Officer T.B. Bouyea responded to a report of a shooting at a particular motel. Officer Bouyea, who was nearby when he received the call, arrived very quickly and found Michael Blanchard lying on the ground in the parking lot, bleeding and unresponsive. No weapon was found on Blanchard or anywhere in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">It was undisputed that Blanchard had been shot by appellant, who claimed he fired in self-defense. It was also undisputed that, at the time of the shooting, Blanchard and his friend, Charlie Scott, were standing in the motel parking lot. Appellant, accompanied by passengers Calvin Hunter and Marcus Elliot, had driven Hunter\u2019s car into the parking lot a short time earlier to pick up Ciara Gillespie. No evidence indicated any of the occupants of the car knew Blanchard or Scott. The dispute existed over who started the altercation and upon what provocation. Appellant claimed Scott and the decedent attacked him without provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Prior to trial, appellant moved the court to allow expert testimony and other evidence concerning Blanchard\u2019s and Scott\u2019s gang affiliation, admitted by the Commonwealth in discovery, to show Scott\u2019s bias; to show motive for Scott and Blanchard for the otherwise unexplained attack on appellant; and to show Blanchard\u2019s reputation in the community for violence as relevant to appellant\u2019s self-defense claim. Appellant also sought a ruling permitting the admission of the testimony of Suntrees Wheeler, who had previously \u201c[taken] out a charge\u201d against Blanchard for rape but later dropped it, saying she lived in Blanchard\u2019s gang territory and had been threatened by Blanchard and the gang not to \u201c[go] forward with the charge.\u201d Finally, appellant asked to <em>voir dire </em>the jury panel regarding any connections to Blanchard\u2019s alleged gang, the White Rock Crew, in order to assess possible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Commonwealth filed a competing motion seeking to exclude evidence of the decedent\u2019s alleged gang membership based on a lack of evidence to suggest gang rivalry or activity of any sort. The Commonwealth conceded \u201cthey may be able to question Mr. Scott about bias if they can establish some kind of gang connection and some kind of gang connection between Mr. Scott and the victim.\u201d The Commonwealth also opposed the admission of the testimony of Suntrees Wheeler concerning the allegation of rape from 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The court ruled appellant could ask the venire \u201cwhether any of them have any knowledge of these ... offenses,\u201d but that he could not inquire about gang membership in <em>voir dire </em>or mention it in his opening statement. It later excluded all evidence relating to gang membership because appellant did not claim to be in a gang and failed to proffer any reason for why a gang-related attack would have occurred. The trial court noted appellant might be able to use the gang affiliation evidence on cross-examination of Scott, saying that if Scott denied being a friend of the decedent\u2019s, appellant could impeach him with evidence they were in the same gang. The court ruled that the testimony of Suntrees Wheeler would be admitted as relevant to self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>At trial, the Commonwealth called three eyewitnesses. Ciara Gillespie testified that as she climbed into the right rear passenger seat of the car appellant was driving, passenger Calvin Hunter told appellant someone had said something to them. Appellant backed the car up to that person as he stood outside the motel and asked what he had said. The man, Scott, said \u201che didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d and at that moment \u201cthis random person,\u201d Blanchard, \u201cr[a]n from behind out of nowhere\u201d and hit appellant twice in the face. Appellant said to Hunter, \u201chand me that, Op or Ock or whatever,\u201d and Hunter retrieved a gun from the passenger\u2019s door and handed it to appellant. Blanchard backed up with his hands up. Appellant \u201cpointed the gun out the window and said, do you see this?\u201d Blanchard responded, \u201cI\u2019m not scared of no mother fuckin\u2019 gun,\u201d and appellant shot Blanchard. Gillespie said she could see both of Blanchard\u2019s hands when appellant fired and that she never heard Blanchard or Scott say he had a gun or any other type of weapon. She also never saw Blanchard reach for anything. However, Gillespie got out of the car when she saw Hunter pass the gun to appellant, and she conceded on cross-examination that her view of Blanchard could have been obstructed during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Marcus Elliot, appellant\u2019s cousin, who was sitting in the rear seat of the car on the driver\u2019s side, also testified for the Commonwealth. Elliot said that after Gillespie got into the car, a man walked up to the car and argued with appellant. The man, Scott, opened appellant\u2019s car door, and appellant shut the door while they continued to argue. Scott \u201cswung inside the car,\u201d but Elliot did not know whether Scott hit appellant. A few minutes later, \u201canother guy[, Blanchard, came] running up to the car,\u201d and \u201c[t]hen all three of them [were] arguing,\u201d and \u201cthey [were] swinging up inside the car\u201d and trying to open the car door. Blanchard \u201cwas reaching for something\u201d \u201cin the front of his pants,\u201d and he stepped away from the car and \u201ctwisted and went inside his pants.\u201d Elliot, fearing Blanchard was reaching for a gun, ducked, and he heard a gunshot about the same time Gillespie jumped out of the car. Immediately afterward, appellant drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Charlie Scott testified for the Commonwealth, admitting he and Blanchard were good friends and had known each other for 12 years. Scott said they were at the motel for Blanchard\u2019s younger sister\u2019s after-prom party when Scott saw the car appellant was driving, which resembled one a friend of his owned. He mistakenly thought his friend was driving it and said, \u201cYo.\u201d When the ear backed up, Scott realized his mistake. He claimed appellant \u201cjust started trouble\u201d and that they exchanged words for two or three minutes. Scott then saw the passenger retrieve a chrome object, which he \u201cknew ... was a [handjgun,\u201d from the right door panel and set it in his lap. Just then, Blanchard came outside and asked Scott if he was all right. Scott said, \u201c[Y]eah, they trying to start a little bit of trouble,\u201d and he warned Blanchard not to get too close to the car \u201cbecause the passenger got a gun on his lap.\u201d Scott moved backward, but Blanchard moved closer to the car, to a point six or seven feet away from it, and Scott saw the gun in appellant\u2019s hand. Scott said Blanchard and appellant \u201cwere having a little conflict\u201d at that time, \u201cthey was just going back and forth,\u201d but Scott claimed he could not hear what was being said, and he \u201cjust [saw] [appellant] fire the gun.\u201d As soon as the shot was fired, the car \u201cjust peeled off,\u201d and Scott realized Blanchard had been shot. Scott denied seeing Blanchard with a gun or taking a weapon from Blanchard\u2019s waistband. Scott denied seeing a girl exit the motel and get into the car, and he also denied that either he or Blanchard had been \u201cswinging] [at] ... [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Appellant renewed his motion to question Scott about whether he and Blanchard belonged to a gang. Outside the presence of the jury, Scott denied he was a member of a gang, and the trial court ruled that testimony was not relevant and could not be presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Appellant called his uncle, front-seat passenger Calvin Hunter, to testify. Hunter said that while they were in the parking lot in Hunter\u2019s mother\u2019s car, which Hunter routinely drove, Scott walked \u201cright\u201d up to the driver\u2019s window and \u201cstarted running off at his mouth\u201d in an \u201cangry\u201d fashion. Hunter did not know Scott and said no one in the car said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>anything rude to Scott before he approached the car. When Scott walked up to the car, appellant told Scott \u201che ain\u2019t have ... nothing to do with why we was there.\u201d Hunter, who admitted he had been quite drunk that evening, said he did not think there was any physical contact between appellant and \u201cthe first guy,\u201d Scott. Hunter said that when the second person, Blanchard, came up to the car, Blanchard had his hands in his pants, up under his shirt, in a manner Hunter demonstrated for the jury, and that Blanchard started swinging his closed fist inside the driver\u2019s window. Blanchard succeeded in opening the car door, but Hunter was paying more attention to the first person, Scott, \u201cand making sure that he didn\u2019t try to get in [the car] or do anything.\u201d Hunter claimed not to know anything about the gun appellant used and said he could not see Blanchard\u2019s hands immediately before appellant fired because the driver\u2019s door was obstructing his view.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Appellant testified in his own behalf, saying that while he was circling the motel looking for Gillespie, he drove past a person who said something, so appellant said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d The person, Scott, whom appellant did not know, said, \u201cWhere are ya\u2019ll going?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201c[N]ah, dog, you don\u2019t know us.\u201d The man \u201ckind of seemed frustrated,\u201d but appellant \u201ckept on going,\u201d \u201cpull[ing] up a little bit to wait for [Gillespie] to come out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Scott then \u201ccame directly to [appellant\u2019s] door,\u201d \u201cstarted saying some aggressive things,\u201d and opened appellant\u2019s car door, but appellant \u201cpulled it back shut.\u201d Scott \u201ckept on saying things,\u201d including \u201cWhite Rock, ... White Rock, and pointing at ... his forearms.\u201d Seott then \u201cstarted swinging at [appellant] through the window.\u201d Appellant said he had no idea why Scott was mad, that he did not insult Scott, and that he was, in fact, \u201ctrying to brush it off,\u201d \u201ctryfing] to avoid it.\u201d Appellant also tried to avoid Scott\u2019s swings, but Scott struck him once in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">While Scott was still at the window, another person appellant did not know, Blanchard, came up to appellant\u2019s window, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and Scott moved toward the back door of the car. Blanchard, too, tried to open appellant\u2019s door, but without success. Blanchard then \u201cswung and hit [appellant] through the window twice\u201d while \u201csaying some aggressive things.\u201d While Blanchard was at the window, Scott remained at the side and \u201cwas still making comments[,] as well.\u201d Blanchard and Scott stopped trying to hit appellant, and Blanchard backed up and reached beneath his shirt. Appellant testified that, as this happened, a \u201cgun was produced\u201d from the passenger side of the car, and he grabbed it from the seat. Appellant testified the gun was not his and that he did not know, before it appeared on the seat, that a gun was in the car. When appellant saw Blanchard back away from the car and move his hand under his shirt, in a manner appellant demonstrated for the jury, appellant \u201cthought [Blanchard] was reaching for a gun,\u201d and he used the gun from the car seat to fire a single shot \u201cto defend [his] life.\u201d Appellant said that, because he did not see Scott reach for anything, appellant did not fire at Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Appellant testified he did not try to drive away before he fired because he thought the only way to protect himself and his passengers was to shoot. Immediately after he fired, he drove off, and he turned himself in to police six days later. He testified he was scared and that before he turned himself in, he \u201cheard about the possibility of some of his people trying to\u201d do something, but appellant was unable to elaborate due to an objection. Appellant then testified he \u201cheard some\u201d \u201cspecific\u201d \u201cthings\u201d indicating he \u201c[might] be injured.\u201d Appellant initially denied knowing where the gun came from, but he then testified that, after the shooting, he \u201cgave it back to Mr. Hunter. Well, I gave it to Mr. Hunter.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant admitted he was \u201ca convicted felon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The court allowed appellant to call Suntrees Wheeler, who testified Blanchard raped her six or seven years prior to trial but that he was not tried or prosecuted and that she had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>had any problems or even any contact with him since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Appellant then questioned two police officers regarding Blanchard\u2019s and Scott\u2019s gang involvement outside the presence of the jury in order to proffer their testimony for the record. Officer C.A. Dowdy, a member of the Lynchburg Police Department\u2019s street crimes unit, which was responsible for \u201cgang intelligence coordination,\u201d testified he was also certified as a gang specialist by the Virginia Gang Investigators Association. Early in the morning on April 20, about half an hour before appellant shot Blanchard, Dowdy encountered Blanchard and Scott at a local restaurant and identified them both as members of the White Rock Crew gang \u201c(jjust by speaking to them about it.\u201d Dowdy testified he had never heard appellant\u2019s name in connection with any gang membership or activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Officer Kevin Poindexter was also questioned outside the presence of the jury about his gang expertise, which included his involvement as regional director of the Virginia Gang Investigators Association, his maintenance of files on active gang membership for the Lynchburg Police Department, and his prior qualification as a gang expert in \u201call three state courts\u201d in Lynchburg. Poindexter testified that Blanchard and Scott were both members of Lynchburg\u2019s White Rock Crew gang at the time of Blanchard\u2019s death. Poindexter examined an autopsy photo of the decedent and identified a tattoo on his upper arm that said \u201cWRC 4 life.\u201d Poindexter indicated the tattoo signified that Blanchard claimed to be a member of the White Rock Crew gang for life and that if he had such a tattoo without being a member of the gang, \u201c[i]t would probably upset\u201d people who were in the gang. Poindexter testified the police department had no intelligence indicating appellant was a member of any gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Poindexter testified that \u201cin gangs in general,\u201d it is important to have the respect of fellow members. He said members of the same gang will \u201cwork to protect each other\u201d and \u201clie to police everyday about everything.\u201d He explained that wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>er members of the same gang would lie \u201cto get one of the other out of trouble\u201d \u201c[djepends on the individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Without hearing any gang-related evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of second-degree murder rather than first-degree as charged, and it also found him guilty of the related use-of-a-firearm offense. The jury recommended the minimum sentence of five years for the second-degree murder conviction and three years for the related firearm offense. In a subsequent bench trial, the trial court found appellant guilty of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Following both trials, the trial court imposed the sentences recommended by the jury and also imposed a sentence of five years for the felon-in-possession conviction, all sentences to run consecutively with no time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Appellant then noted the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">ANALYSIS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acs\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">USE OF EVIDENCE OF GANG MEMBERSHIP DURING TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith v.

The Supreme Court noted the trial court took steps to \u201cavoid <em>undue </em>prejudice to [the defendant]\u201d by \u201cordering] that the [gang] name \u2018Aryan Brotherhood\u2019 not be used,\u201d by \u201coffering] to give a limiting instruction concerning the testimony,\u201d and by \u201csustaining] defense objections to the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning the punishment meted out to unfaithful members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 105 S.Ct. at 470, 83 L.Ed.2d at 459 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Similarly, here, appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation entitled him to cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, Charlie Scott, about whether he and the decedent were members of the same gang, the White Rock Crew. Scott denied such membership when examined outside the presence of the jury, and the trial court ruled that Scott\u2019s response was not relevant. We conclude appellant\u2019s proffered evidence that Scott and the decedent were members of the same street gang was relevant to the issue of Scott\u2019s bias and that whether Scott was biased was material to appellant\u2019s theory of the case. We also conclude as a matter of law that appellant\u2019s proffered evidence concerning <em>the fact </em>of their membership in the same gang was not more prejudicial than probative. Here, appellant was entitled to explore witness Scott\u2019s possible bias in favor of the decedent based on appellant\u2019s proffered evidence of their common gang membership. Although the Commonwealth acknowledged prior to trial \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>they may be able to question Mr. Scott about bias if they can establish ... some kind of gang connection between Mr. Scott and [the decedent],\u201d the trial court erred in refusing to allow appellant to cross-examine Scott about this source of potential bias and to impeach him with extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant himself testified that Scott chanted \u201cWhite Rock\u201d and pointed to his forearms immediately before he began what appellant contended was the unprovoked attack, in which Scott tried unsuccessfully to open appellant\u2019s car door and then punched appellant through the window. Appellant proffered the detailed testimony of two police officers, who were certified gang specialists and knowledgeable in gang matters in the city, that Scott and the decedent were both known members of the White Rock Crew gang. One of those officers testified he had spoken to Scott and the decedent only half an hour before the shooting and that both men had identified themselves to him at that time as members of the White Rock Crew gang. Finally, the autopsy photo introduced by the Commonwealth and identified by Officer Poindexter in his proffered testimony showed that the decedent had \u2018WRC 4 ever\u201d tattooed on his upper arm, and Officer Poindexter identified this tattoo as meaning \u2018White Rock Crew [Gang] [for]ever.\u201d This evidence, if credited by the jury, was sufficient to establish that Scott\u2019s membership in the same gang as the decedent might cause him, \u201cunconsciously or otherwise,\u201d to \u201cslant ... his testimony ... against [appellant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 105 S.Ct. at 469, 83 L.Ed.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Further, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Abel, </em>certain attributes of that gang membership may \u201c[bear] directly not only on the <em>fact </em>of bias but also on the <em>source </em>and <em>strength </em>of [Scott\u2019s possible] bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 105 S.Ct. at 470, 83 L.Ed.2d at 458-59. Thus, we conclude appellant was also entitled to present expert testimony concerning general traits of gangs in the city and the traits of the White Rock Crew gang in particular as those traits bore further on the strength of Scott\u2019s possible bias, subject to reasonable limitations, as in <em>Abel, </em>to prevent prejudice from outweighing probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\n<em>2. Harmless Error Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The existence of error does not automatically compel a reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions. In all cases in which we determine error has occurred, \u201charmless-error review [is] required.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. ix, ix, 396 S.E.2d 675, 675 (1990). Appellant avers the errors were not harmless, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The improper restriction of cross-examination is an error of constitutional magnitude. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674, 686 (1986). \u201c \u2018[B]efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt;\u2019 otherwise the conviction under review must be set aside.\u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201c[Ojur analysis turns not on the evidence excluded ... but on the evidence in the record, viz., [the witness\u2019] testimony, which was not fully subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 36, 42, 486 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1997). \u201c \u2018The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, [we] might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maynard v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 437, 448, 399 S.E.2d 635, 641 (1990) (en banc) (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d at 686). Important factors in this analysis are \u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d at 686-87. \u201c \u2018[H]armless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 395, 400, 528 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>166, 169 (2000) (en banc) (quoting <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 457-58, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992)). \u201cAn error does not affect the verdict if we can determine, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Cairns v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 271, 286, 579 S.E.2d 340, 347 (2003); <em>see Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Here, we cannot conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of Scott\u2019s and the decedent\u2019s gang membership, as relevant to show bias, was harmless error as to his jury trial convictions for second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. Appellant\u2019s theory of the case was that the altercation either began as a gang-related attack or quickly evolved into one. Appellant averred that he acted merely to defend himself when first Scott, and then Blanchard, punched him through his open car window and when Blanchard backed away from the car and reached beneath his shirt toward his waistband, in a movement that appellant thought indicated he was about to retrieve a firearm. The fact that Scott and the decedent were members of the same gang was probative of whether Scott\u2019s testimony about the incident was either knowingly or unknowingly slanted against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Appellant\u2019s ability to challenge Scott\u2019s testimony based on bias arising from his membership in the same gang with the decedent was particularly important in light of Scott\u2019s testimony that he and Blanchard did not attack appellant and that he found no gun on or around Blanchard after the shooting. Although appellant was free to cross-examine Scott for bias based on his twelve-year friendship with Blanchard, the fact of their membership in the same gang, as well as proffered evidence concerning the willingness of some gang members to \u201ccover\u201d for one another, would have provided additional evidence from which the jury could have concluded Scott had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>incentive to slant his testimony about the altercation or to lie about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Thus, as to the murder and related use-of-a-firearm convictions, this is not a case in which the other evidence of guilt was so overwhelming and the error so insignificant by comparison that we can conclude the error was harmless. This is also not a case in which the point the erroneously excluded evidence was offered to prove was established by other undisputed evidence in the record. As appellant points out, even without the excluded evidence, the jury failed to convict him on \u201cthe top count\u201d of the indictment, first-degree murder, and it recommended the lowest available sentence within the range for second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On these facts, we cannot conclude \u201c \u2018that the error[s] did not influence the [fact finder], or had but slight effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 731 (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557, 1566 (1946)). Thus, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of that offense and remand for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">For similar reasons, we hold the errors also were not harmless as to appellant\u2019s conviction for possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Appellant conceded he possessed the firearm long enough to shoot the decedent but claimed he was entitled to invoke the common law defense of necessity as recognized in <em>Humphrey v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 36, 553 S.E.2d 546 (2001). The \u201cessential elements\u201d of this defense \u201cinclude \u2018(1) a reasonable belief that the action was necessary to avoid an imminent threatened harm; (2) a lack of other adequate means to avoid the threatened harm; and (3) a direct causal relationship that may be reasonably anticipated between the action taken and the avoidance of the harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 553 S.E.2d at 552 (quoting <em>Buckley v. City of Falls Church, </em>7 Va.App. 32, 33, 371 S.E.2d 827, 827-28 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In rejecting appellant\u2019s claim of necessity, the trial court made several explicit findings of fact. It accepted Scott\u2019s testimony that the encounter began when Scott \u201chailed the vehicle that [appellant] was driving because he thought somebody was in there that he knew\u201d but that \u201cit turned out it wasn\u2019t.\u201d It also found that Blanchard \u201cshowed up on the scene[,] ... jumped into it, ... probably had no business [getting involved,] and didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d It found credible Scott\u2019s testimony that he saw appellant grab a gun from the passenger\u2019s lap and warned Blanchard about it as Scott was backing away from the car but that \u201cBlanchard\u2019s a big shot\u201d and \u201cgoes in and says ... he\u2019s not afraid of [appellant] even when he produces a gun.\u201d The trial court also expressly rejected as not credible the testimony of appellant and Elliot that Blanchard \u201cwas reaching\u201d under his shirt toward his waistband when appellant fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">If the trial court had ruled properly that appellant\u2019s evidence of Scott\u2019s and the decedent\u2019s gang membership was admissible as probative of Scott\u2019s bias, the court might instead have credited appellant\u2019s theory of the case. Appellant\u2019s theory of the case included the following: (1) that he armed himself in the reasonable belief that he was in danger of imminent harm based on Scott\u2019s and the decedent\u2019s exhortations to him to \u201cget out of the car\u201d so they could \u201cfuck [him] up,\u201d followed by their efforts to remove him from the car and punch him through the open window; (2) that, at the instant appellant armed himself, driving away was an inadequate means of avoiding the threatened harm because Scott and the decedent were actively engaged in trying to remove him from the car; and (3) that a direct causal relationship existed between appellant\u2019s act of arming himself and avoiding the threat of harm presented by Scott and the decedent at that time based on their physical attack on him with their fists.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Thus, we cannot conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to appellant\u2019s bench trial conviction for possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Accordingly, we also reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>offense and remand for retrial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">LIMITATIONS ON <em>VOIR DIRE </em>TO PREVENT QUESTIONING ABOUT GANG MEMBERSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We now consider the trial court\u2019s ruling preventing <em>voir dire </em>of the venire panel regarding whether they or any of their family members or friends were members of the same gang as the victim, the White Rock Crew, in order to assess possible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u201c[A]n accused is entitled to an impartial jury as a matter of constitutional guarantee, reinforced by legislative mandate and by the Rules of ... court.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 444, 271 S.E.2d 123, 128 (1980) (footnotes omitted). Code \u00a7 8.01-358, made applicable to criminal proceedings by Code \u00a7 19.2-260, provides for <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror \u201cto ascertain whether he is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, ... or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein.\u201d Rule 3A:14 similarly requires <em>voir dire </em>\u201cto determine whether anyone ... [h]as any interest in the trial or the outcome of the case ... [or] [h]as a bias or prejudice against the Commonwealth or the accused.\u201d In keeping with these principles, the court must exercise its discretion \u201cto empanel jurors who are free from bias or prejudice against the parties and who \u2018stand indifferent to the cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 447, 451, 339 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1986) (quoting <em>Breeden v.

Strain, </em>194 Ill.2d 467, 252 Ill.Dec. 65, 742 N.E.2d 315, 321 (2000) (in a case in which the defendant belonged to a gang and the motive for the crime stemmed from a gang rivalry, holding that \u201cwhen testimony regarding gang membership and gang-related activity is to be an integral part of the defendant\u2019s trial, the defendant must be afforded an opportunity to question the prospective jurors, either directly or through questions submitted to the trial court, concerning gang bias\u201d); <em>see also State v. Lugo, </em>266 Conn. 674, 835 A.2d 451, 461 (2003) (suggesting that <em>voir dire </em>questions about gang membership should inquire about gangs in general and not be overly factually specific so that they do not \u201cimproperly ... afford[] defense counsel an opportunity to gauge how each prospective juror would view his defense\u201d). We need not decide the precise parameters or scope of such questioning. We also need not decide under what circumstances appellant might be entitled to have a juror struck for cause due to an admission of having some relationship to a gang member. We decide only that\u2014on the facts of this case, in which we have ruled that evidence of the decedent\u2019s and a witness\u2019 gang membership is admissible\u2014appellant was entitled to make inquiry for the purpose of uncovering possible bias against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>him, subject to reasonable limitations to be imposed by the trial court in its broad discretion over <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the proffered evidence was relevant, material, and more probative than prejudicial and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow appellant to use it during trial in an attempt to show bias was reversible error. Thus, we reverse and remand for retrial. Because gang affiliation evidence will be admitted on remand, we hold appellant will be entitled, within limits to be determined by the trial court in its discretion, to have the jury questioned regarding possible bias resulting from gang membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. Because we reverse and remand based on the trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of evidence of gang affiliation to show bias, we need not specifically address the question of whether evidence of gang affiliation might be relevant and admissible at trial for other purposes, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">. The parties agree that the evidence introduced at appellant's subsequent bench trial, although admitted through fewer witnesses, was substantially the same as at his jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. At appellant\u2019s subsequent bench trial, he testified the gun \u201cwas [Hunter's] weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\">. Because appellant\u2019s first listed assignment of error (whether the court erred in preventing him from questioning the jury about gang membership) is somewhat dependent upon his other assignments of error (whether evidence concerning the decedent\u2019s and witness Scott's alleged gang membership was admissible at trial), we consider the admissibility of this evidence first and evaluate the <em>voir dire </em>issue last.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\">. Although <em>Abel </em>was decided under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the federal evidentiary rules the Court considered all have similar counterparts in Virginia law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence); Fed.R.Evid. 402 (providing that all relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, applicable statute or rule); Fed.R.Evid. 403 (providing that evidence should not be admitted if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\">. As stated <em>supra </em>in footnote 1, because we reverse and remand based on the trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of evidence of gang affiliation to show bias, we need not specifically address appellant's third assignment of error, whether evidence of gang affiliation might be relevant and admissible at trial for other purposes, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\">. As appellant avers on brief, the decedent\u2019s autopsy photo was admitted into evidence at trial. Appellant\u2019s proffered testimony from Officer Poindexter indicates that the design and lettering \u201cWRC 4 ever\u201d tattooed on the decedent\u2019s arm, clearly visible in the autopsy photo, indicate the decedent was a member of the White Rock Crew gang. To the extent any member of the jury was a member or close associate of a member of the White Rock Crew gang, that jury member would have known of the decedent\u2019s gang affiliation, based on the tattoo, despite the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence regarding that affiliation at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
