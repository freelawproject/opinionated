Appellant contends the five-year <em>mandatory </em>sentence under this statutory provision violates the separation of powers doctrine of the Virginia Constitution. Appellant argues the General Assembly usurped a judicial function in creating the statutory framework under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 by mandating a specific sentence of five years, and divesting the court of any discretion to determine appellant\u2019s sentence. For the reasons stated below, we disagree with appellant and affirm the imposition of the five-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The facts leading to appellant\u2019s conviction are not at issue on appeal. On September 23, 2008, the trial court found appellant guilty of eluding a police officer, possession of a firearm by a violent felon, possession of a Schedule I or II substance, and possession of a firearm while in possession of a Schedule I or II substance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 31, 2008, prior to sentencing, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss,\u201d arguing \u201cthe Court can neither convict nor sentence [appellant] under an unconstitutional statute.\u201d Appellant argued that by prescribing a mandatory five-year term of incarceration in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the legislature improperly usurped a judicial function, in violation of the principle of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>At appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing on November 7, 2008, appellant conceded that pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, he was procedurally barred from seeking a dismissal of the charge against him. Instead, he asked the court, as he did in his motion to dismiss, to sever the mandatory five-year term of incarceration prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and declare that portion of the statute unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. The court found the motion untimely under Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2, concluding that the statute required appellant make his motion before trial. The court also noted that even if the motion was not procedurally barred, the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 was constitutional. The trial judge then sentenced appellant to five years incarceration, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2\u201410(f) and -308.2, for possession of a firearm by a violent felon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) proscribes possession of a firearm by a violent felon, and states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, any person who violates this section by knowingly and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall be sentenced to a <em>mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYv\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">For Class 6 felonies, [the jury or court trying the case without a jury shall impose] a term of imprisonment of not less than one year <em>nor more than five </em>years, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>discretion of the jury or the court trying the case without a jury, confinement in jail for not more than 12 months and a fine of not more than $ 2,500, either or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Appellant argues that in adopting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the legislature unconstitutionally mandated a specific sentence of five years incarceration, and in doing so, it usurped the power of the judiciary to determine appellant\u2019s sentence. Appellant contends the trial court should have severed the unconstitutional provision of the statute and sentenced him under Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f), which provides a range of punishment for Class 6 felonies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">When the trial court rules on the constitutionality of a statute, we review such decisions <em>de novo. Yap v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 622, 629, 643 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2007) (citing <em>Shivaee v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 112, 119, 613 S.E.2d 570, 574 (2005)). \u201cIt is firmly established that all actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional. Therefore, the party assailing the legislation has the burden of proving that it is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Etheridge v. Med. Ctr. Hosps., </em>237 Va. 87, 94, 376 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1989) (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018This presumption is one of the strongest known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to the law. Under it, courts must resolve any reasonable doubt regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity. To doubt is to affirm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 173, 181, 647 S.E.2d 517, 521 (2007) (quoting <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 506-07, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) (citations omitted)). \u201c[C]ourts will declare legislation invalid only when it is \u2018plainly repugnant to some provision of the state or federal constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 94, 376 S.E.2d at 528 (quoting <em>Blue Cross v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 349, 358, 269 S.E.2d 827, 832 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Challenging the constitutionality of the statute, appellant argues Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 violates the long-standing and well-recognized principle that \u201c[t]he legislative, executive, and judicial departments shall be separate and distinct, so that none exercise the powers properly belonging to the others, nor any person exercise the power of more than one of them at the same time----\u201d Va. Const, art. III, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true that a sound and wise policy should keep [the three branches] of the government as separate and distinct from each other as practicable. But it is equally true that experience has shown that no government could be administered where an absolute and unqualified adherence to that maxim was enforced. The universal construction of this maxim in practice has been that the whole power of one of these departments should not be exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of either of the other departments, but that either department may exercise the powers of another to a limited extent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>In re: Iris Lynn Phillips, </em>265 Va. 81, 86-87, 574 S.E.2d 270, 273 (2003) (quoting <em>Winchester &amp; Strasburg R.R. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>106 Va. 264, 268, 55 S.E. 692, 693 (1906)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Appellant contends that the power to determine his sentence is a power exclusively within the province of the judiciary. To support this contention, appellant relies on the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 139, 661 S.E.2d 841, 847 (2008). In <em>Moreau, </em>our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Supreme Court stated, \u201c[although the subject matter of the judiciary\u2019s power may, in some ways be limited by legislative action, the essential function of the judieiary-the act of rendering judgment in matters properly before it-may not be abridged by either the executive or the legislative branches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846. \u201cThe act of rendering judgment is within the inherent power of the court and the very essence of adjudication and entry of judgment by a judge involves discretionary power of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 661 S.E.2d at 847. \u201cRequiring a court or judge to enter a certain judgment unquestionably infringes upon the exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>In re: Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Roanoke, </em>265 Va. 313, 319, 576 S.E.2d 458, 462 (2003). Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moreau </em>and <em>In re Commonwealth\u2019s Atty. for City of Roanoke </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In both of these cases, the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s holding was only that \u201crendering judgment\u201d encompasses the determination of an accused\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 138, 661 S.E.2d at 847; <em>In re Commonwealth\u2019s Atty. for City of Roanoke, </em>265 Va. at 319, 576 S.E.2d at 462. Thus, despite appellant\u2019s suggestion that <em>Moreau </em>controls this case, we are not compelled to conclude that the act of rendering judgment necessarily includes determining the <em>scope of punishment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In fact, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, determining the scope of punishment historically has been a function of the legislature. \u201c\u2018Determinate sentences [have been] found in this country\u2019s penal codes from its inception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1928, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). \u201c \u2018[Specification of punishments\u2019 [are] matters ordinarily understood as \u2018peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lilly, </em>50 Va.App. at 184, 647 S.E.2d at 522 (quoting <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 290, 311, 645 S.E.2d 448, 461 (2007)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">The historic norm for the jury was to determine only guilt or innocence, leaving the court alone to fix punishment consistent with the legislatively mandated sentences. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the early days of the Republic ... the period of incarceration was generally prescribed with specificity by the legislature. Each crime had its defined punishment____ Later statutory reforms produced wide sentencing ranges within which trial judges could exercise individualized discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APO\"><em>Id. </em>at 187, 647 S.E.2d at 524 (citing <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 45-46, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2613-14, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978)); <em>see also United States v. Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820) (noting \u201c[t]he power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In <em>Lilly, </em>the defendant challenged the one-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed by Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3) on those persons determined to be habitual offenders of the statute prohibiting driving while intoxicated. 50 Va.App. at 182-83, 647 S.E.2d at 521-22. Responding to Lilly\u2019s argument that the legislature overstepped its bounds in enacting a determinant sentence, this Court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Given [the] history, we find no basis for [the defendant\u2019s] characterization of mandatory minimum sentences as a legislative usurpation of a historically unique judicial function. Just the opposite is true: The development of mandatory minimum sentences reflects the traditional legislative role in creating statewide uniformity, at least at the lower end of the punishment scale, for all sentences for the specified crimes. This can hardly be a due process violation, given that the General Assembly \u201chas the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 188, 647 S.E.2d at 524 (quoting <em>Chapman, </em>500 U.S. at 467, 111 S.Ct. at 1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Although <em>Lilly </em>was decided on equal protection and due process grounds, we see no reason to depart from its logic. To be sure, our Supreme Court has also noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">\u201cVirginia alone can prescribe the jurisdiction of her own courts. She can mould her remedies as she pleases____She may be bound to provide some remedy for wrong, but she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the exclusive and sovereign judge of the form of the remedy.\u201d <em>Richmond F &amp; P. R.R. Co. v. Louisa R.R. Co., </em>54 U.S. (13 How.) 71, 77 [14 L.Ed. 55] (1852). Thus, whether the remedy ... is viewed as a modification of the common law or as establishing the jurisdiction of the courts in specific cases, clearly it [is] a proper exercise of legislative power. Indeed, were a court to ignore the legislatively-determined remedy ... the court would invade the province of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 101, 376 S.E.2d at 532; <em>see also Boyles v. City of Roanoke, </em>179 Va. 484, 487-88, 19 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1942) (\u201cTo say that the court can of its own volition reduce the jail term provided in the ordinance ... is to say that the court can legislate ... [and] that duty is not a judicial one but one solely for the legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Appellant also relies on <em>Fishback v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 104, 112, 532 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2000), and <em>Hinton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 492, 496, 247 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1978), arguing that the Supreme Court of Virginia has held, \u201c \u2018the assessment of punishment is a function of the judicial branch of government.\u2019 \u201d However a close reading of both <em>Fishback </em>and <em>Hinton </em>instructs that the cited language must be read in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In <em>Fishback </em>and <em>Hinton, </em>the Supreme Court considered the propriety of informing the jury about possible modifications to a defendant\u2019s sentence, including reduction or suspension of imposed incarceration time and options for parole. The Court found that with the exception of the abolition of parole in certain cases, these matters are properly committed to the executive branch, not the judiciary. <em>Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 112, 532 S.E.2d at 632; <em>Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 496, 247 S.E.2d at 706. Thus, the Court stated, \u201c \u2018under our system, the assessment of punishment is a function of the judicial branch of government, while the administration of such punishment is a responsibility of the executive department.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hinton, </em>219 Va. at 496, 247 S.E.2d at 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In the instant case, however, appellant asks us to define the judiciary\u2019s role as it relates to the <em>legislature, </em>which, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the executive branch, exercises plenary power over the courts with respect to the scope of punishment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10, -11, -53.1, -58, -248, -308.4, 19.2-306. Further, even accepting that \u201cthe assessment of punishment is a responsibility of the judicial branch,\u201d that assessment must be made within the bounds set by the legislature. <em>See Boyles, </em>179 Va. at 487-88, 19 S.E.2d at 663; <em>Lilly, </em>50 Va.App. at 187-88, 647 S.E.2d at 524. Accordingly, these cases neither provide guidance nor decide the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Given the legislature\u2019s broad authority and its historical role in defining the scope of punishment available to the court, we find it within the legislature\u2019s authority to prescribe a mandatory determinant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">For these reasons, we find the five-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 does not violate the constitutional provision requiring the separation of powers. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to sever that portion of the statute and sentence appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">. Appellant contested the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress the evidence as well as the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. This Court denied appellant an appeal on those issues. Only the sentence for appellant\u2019s conviction of possession of a firearm by a violent felon, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, is at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">. Appellant was sentenced to a total of six years for the remaining convictions, with four years and six months suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">. This Court has previously recognized the wisdom of an enhanced penalty for this offense. \"The \u2018mischief at which \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is directed is the possession of firearms by convicted felons in an attempt to prevent indiscriminate use of dangerous weapons by one previously convicted of a serious crime.\u201d <em>Alger </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 89, 93, 578 S.E.2d 51, 53 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\">. Appellant also suggests the trial court erred in denying his \"Motion to Dismiss\u201d as untimely, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2(A)-(B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">Defense motions or objections seeking ... dismissal of a warrant, information, or indictment or any count or charge thereof on the ground that the statute upon which it was based is unconstitutional shall be raised by motion or objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">Such a motion or objection in a proceeding in circuit court shall be raised in writing, before trial. The motions or objections shall be filed and notice given to opposing counsel not later than seven days before trial in circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2(A)-(B). To the extent that appellant's request to sever the mandatory incarceration provision did not seek the \u201cdismissal of a warrant, information, or indictment,\u201d he was not required to file his motion prior to trial. Further, on appeal, the Commonwealth has not argued that appellant is procedurally barred from raising this substantive issue. Thus, to the extent that Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2(B) applies as a procedural bar, the Commonwealth has abandoned that argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:21. Accordingly, we address the merits of appellant\u2019s constitutional argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
