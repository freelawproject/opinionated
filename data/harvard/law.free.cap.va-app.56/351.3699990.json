As part of that agreement, Smith reserved the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion. Smith timely filed both his notice of appeal and petition for appeal, but failed to file the transcript from his suppression hearing in the trial court within sixty days after entry of final judgment, as required by Rule 5A:8. Consequently, the transcript for Smith\u2019s suppression hearing is not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In his petition for appeal, Smith argued that the proper remedy for this Court to apply under these circumstances was to dismiss the appeal for failure to file an indispensable transcript. In fact, before Smith\u2019s petition for appeal was granted, he filed a separate motion to dismiss his own appeal on those grounds. Smith argued that, absent the suppression-hearing transcript, this Court lacked jurisdiction to decide the merits of his appeal. A three-judge panel of this Court granted Smith\u2019s petition for appeal, held his motion to dismiss in abeyance, and instructed the parties to brief whether the appropriate remedy for the failure to timely file an indispensable transcript is to deny the petition for appeal or dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In response, Smith argues that the proper remedy for a failure to file an indispensable transcript is to dismiss the appeal while the Commonwealth contends that the failure to provide a sufficient record should simply result in the denial of a petition for appeal. Given our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 659 S.E.2d 311 (2008), we hold that Smith\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of Rule 5A:8 is a violation of a non-jurisdictional, though mandatory requirement of the Rules governing the processing of appeals in this Court. Thus, Smith\u2019s failure to present an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>record sufficient to review the merits of the issues and arguments he presents on brief constitutes a waiver of his question presented and supporting argument. Accordingly, we deny Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the decision of the trial court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">At the onset, we note that this appeal is more than a bit peculiar in light of the fact that Smith simultaneously filed in this Court both a petition to appeal his convictions for abduction and forcible sodomy and a motion to dismiss that very appeal. Smith asserts that he did so in order to attempt to avail himself of the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-321.1. He argues that, if applicable, Code \u00a7 19.2-321.1 may allow him to pursue a delayed appeal and, thus, overcome his failure to file the transcript of his suppression hearing as part of the trial court record, which he concedes is indispensable to our resolution of the merits of his appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Prior to its decision in <em>Jay, </em>both our Supreme Court and this Court have historically dismissed appeals when the mandatory requirements of the Rules have not been adhered to, including those cases in which a transcript, indispensable to the resolution of the issue, had not been filed in the trial court. <em>See Fearon v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 256, 176 S.E.2d 921 (1970); <em>Crum v. Udy, </em>206 Va. 880, 146 S.E.2d 878 (1966); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 766, 531 S.E.2d 11 (2000); <em>Price v. Price, </em>17 Va.App. 105, 435 S.E.2d 652 (1993); <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 96, 341 S.E.2d 400 (1986). In our view, this practice of dismissing, rather than denying, non-compliant petitions for appeal has always been problematic, since the very nature of the petition process mandated by statute contemplates that unless the petition for appeal is granted, there is no need to act on it in any other way than simply denying the petition. It is certainly true that once a petition for appeal or for certiorari has been granted, and in those cases where a petition is unnecessary because an appeal lies as a matter of right, appeals are almost invariably dismissed when an appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties. However, in other jurisdictions, the converse is not necessarily true, and the practice of dismissing appeals on non-jurisdictional grounds is not at all unusual among our sister appellate courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, our Supreme Court adopted a different position in <em>Jay, </em>and its holding in this regard is both final and binding on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The holding of <em>Jay </em>could hardly be clearer, \u201c[b]y <em>dismissing </em>rather than <em>denying </em>the appeals, the Court of Appeals rendered the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) jurisdictional.\u201d 275 Va. at 517, 659 S.E.2d at 315 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>is true that <em>Jay </em>specifically refers to Rule 5A:20(e), if the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d has any consistent meaning, we see no rational reason why this principle should not also apply to Rule 5A:8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Jay </em>commands that we not dismiss an appeal except on the grounds that this Court lacks jurisdiction, and thus, the resolution of the issue before us turns on the meaning of the term \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d as used in <em>Jay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cJurisdiction is a term which can engender much confusion because it encompasses a variety of separate and distinct legal concepts.\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 228, 661 S.E.2d 415, 426 (2008). Undeniably, \u201c \u2018[{jurisdiction is a word of many, too many, meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ghameshlouy v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 379, 388, 689 S.E.2d 698, 702 (2010) (quoting <em>Ghameshlouy v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 47, 57, 675 S.E.2d 854, 859 (2009) (Haley, J. dissenting)). That said, \u201c[cjourts cannot take or grant jurisdiction <em>where the legislature or a constitution has not given it.\u201d Swalef v. Anderson, </em>50 Va.App. 100, 106 n. 4, 646 S.E.2d 458, 461 n. 4 (2007) (emphasis added). <em>See also Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>271 Va. 336, 344, 626 S.E.2d 374, 379 (2006); <em>Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772-73, 43 S.E.2d 890, 894 (1947); <em>accord Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 169, 387 S.E.2d 753, 755, (1990). It follows then that a rule of court cannot convey or limit jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahh\">Indeed, a court refusing to exercise its jurisdiction or erroneously limiting its jurisdiction, precludes the parties from being able to litigate an issue as surely as if the court was without jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">Although <em>a court cannot confer jurisdiction upon itself, </em>it does have the power to determine whether it has jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Gibson v. Gibson, </em>5 Va.App. 426, 433, 364 S.E.2d 518, 522 (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The appellate courts of the Commonwealth are not alone in promulgating confusing jurisprudence on this issue. In <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 453, 124 S.Ct. 906, 914, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004), the United States Supreme Court recognized that it has created similar confusion in the federal arena, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>noting that it had been \u201cless than meticulous\u201d in its use of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to describe timeliness requirements. The Supreme Court then observed that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that court-prescribed rules of practice and procedure, as opposed to statutory time limits, <em>do not create or withdraw ... jurisdiction.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Again in <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 210-12, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2364-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007), the Supreme Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avo\">[although several of our recent decisions have undertaken to clarify the distinction between claims-processing rules and jurisdictional rules, none of them calls into question our longstanding treatment of <em>statutory </em>time limits for taking an appeal as jurisdictional. Indeed, those decisions have also recognized the jurisdictional significance of the fact that a time limitation is set forth in a <em>statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(Emphasis added). In other words, the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d refers to mandatory requirements prescribed by constitution or statute as a prerequisite to a court taking a case for resolution. What the United States Supreme Court characterizes as \u201cclaim-processing\u201d requirements relate to those nonjurisdietional, but nonetheless mandatory, \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business\u201d that are <em>\u201cnot jurisdictional.\u201d Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 454, 124 S.Ct. at 914 (quoting <em>Schacht v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 58, 64, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This is precisely the situation represented in this case. No rule of court actually conveys, expands or restricts the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the courts of the Commonwealth. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia are promulgated under the statutory authority of that Court to \u201cprescribe the forms of writs and make general regulations for the practice in all courts of the Commonwealth; and [] prepare a system of rules of practice and a system of pleading and the forms of process.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-3. Perhaps our Supreme Court will at some point elect to bring the same level of clarity to the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d that the Supreme Court of the United States has in the federal arena in <em>Kontrick, </em>but in the meantime, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>engaging in the exercise our Supreme Court referred to in <em>Ghameshlouy </em>as \u201cplumb[ing] the murky depths of the sea of \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d 279 Va. at 388, 689 S.E.2d at 702, we hold Smith\u2019s failure to file the transcript from his suppression hearing was a violation of a non-jurisdictional, though nonetheless mandatory, requirement of a rule of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Here, the flavor of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d that the dissent finds is implicated by Rule 5A:8 is what it describes as \u201cauthority jurisdiction.\u201d The dissent uses this term as shorthand for its conclusion that a Rule limiting this Court\u2019s authority to proceed to a decree is by definition jurisdictional. The dissent\u2019s conclusion would dramatically expand the concept of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d while simultaneously making it more amorphous than ever. Moreover, this conclusion would undermine the recent attempts of our Supreme Court to bring at least some measure of order out of what has long been \u201cjurisdictional\u201d chaos.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>the Supreme Court parsed the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d into what it termed as \u201cpotential jurisdiction,\u201d which encompassed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">subject matter jurisdiction, which is the authority granted through constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies; territorial jurisdiction, that is, authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area; notice jurisdiction, or effective notice to a party or if the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>seizure of a <em>res; </em>and <em>the other conditions of fact must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law </em>as the prerequisites of the authority of the court to proceed to judgment or decree</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ava\">and \u201cactive jurisdiction\u201d which it described as the actual \u201cpower to adjudicate a case on the merits.\u201d <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>279 Va. at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 703 (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>271 Va. at 343-44 &amp; n. 2, 626 S.E.2d at 379 &amp; n. 2) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court\u2019s parsing of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in this manner indicates, in our view, that it intended to convey that the terms \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cauthority\u201d are not synonymous and that the \u201cauthority\u201d of a court to act is dependent upon it having subject matter jurisdiction, personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>jurisdiction over the parties, and territorial jurisdiction, as required by the constitution or statute. On the other hand, even where a court has the requisite subject matter, territorial, and personal jurisdiction over the parties, its \u201cpower\u201d to actually reach the merits of a case depends upon compliance by the parties with any and all mandatory requirements imposed by the rules of court. Moreover, if as the dissent suggests, the term \u201cconditions of fact demanded by unwritten and statute law\u201d includes the written rules of court, there would be no need for our Supreme Court to create the second category of what it calls \u201cactive jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The dissent cites Rule 1:1 as an example of this concept of \u201cauthority jurisdiction.\u201d We certainly must concede that as recently as its decision in <em>City of Suffolk v. Lummis Gin Company, </em>278 Va. 270, 683 S.E.2d 549 (2009), our Supreme Court characterized Rule 1:1 as a limitation on the exercise of a court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d However, a review of the Supreme Court\u2019s more comprehensive discussions of the concept of jurisdiction found in <em>Ghameshlouy, Porter, Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 552 S.E.2d 73 (2001), and <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 437, 527 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2000), strongly suggests to us that its usage of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in <em>Lummis Gin Co. </em>is simply another example of its use of this term as inartful shorthand for what in reality is more accurately described as a mandatory \u201cclaims-processing rule,\u201d the term now used by the United States Supreme Court. Given the basic premise that a rule of court may limit a court\u2019s power to act but cannot create or limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction, in our view, the mandatory time limits contained in the Rules of the Supreme Court, including Rule 1:1, are more properly viewed as regulatory in nature rather than \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in the strict sense of that word.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We respectfully suggest that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>does no service to the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth to continue to use the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to describe what are more accurately described as emphatic time prescriptions in the rules of court designed to superintend and facilitate the orderly and prompt resolution and disposition of matters before the courts of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Furthermore, we also disagree with the dissent\u2019s application of its concept of \u201cauthority jurisdiction\u201d to Rule 5A:8. By way of analogy, no one would seriously contend that the failure of an appellant to preserve an alleged error by complying with the contemporaneous objection requirements of Rule 5A:18 deprives this Court of either the authority or ability to decide the case on appeal\u2014we simply may not be able to decide it on the merits where the record is silent that the error was preserved for appeal. The same is true here. The failure of a party to file a transcript does not affect our <em>authority </em>to decide the case one whit. We clearly have the authority and thus, even under the analysis of the dissent, the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to do so and indeed, we routinely fulfill our obligation to decide the merits of appeals when a transcript has not been filed, if the issue is one that can be resolved without it. Since there is no precedent for a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defect to operate selectively, it seems axiomatic to us that if the failure to file a transcript denied this Court the authority to exercise its appellate jurisdiction, this would necessarily be true in <em>every </em>case where the trial court record lacked a transcript, including those cases that may not require a transcript for resolution of the issue presented. As noted above, Rules 5A:7 and 5A:8 have nothing whatsoever to do with the mandatory requirements for \u201cperfecting\u201d an appeal. Rule 5A:7(a)(7) simply includes a transcript in the definition of the trial court record to be considered by this Court on appeal, and Rule 5A:8 specifies that this occurs when the transcript is filed in the office of the clerk of the trial court within 60 days after entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of the final judgment. Neither Rule 5A:7 nor Rule 5A:8 implicates our authority to decide a case on appeal. Appeals are decided based upon the contents of the record of the trial court, whatever the quality or degree of completeness of that record, either on the merits or based on a procedural infirmity that prevents this Court from reaching the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Accordingly, given the clear mandate of <em>Jay </em>that we may not dismiss an appeal on other than jurisdictional grounds, we hold that Smith\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 5A:8 constitutes a violation of a non-jurisdictional rule requirement. By not filing the transcript of the suppression hearing, which Smith concedes is indispensable to the resolution of his appeal, Smith deprived this Court of an adequate record to address the issue he presents. Thus, we deny Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss his appeal, treat the underlying issue as waived, and affirm the trial court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Judge James C. Hawks heard the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">. It is not a given that by dismissing his appeal, Code \u00a7 19.2-321.1 would apply to this situation. Code \u00a7 19.2-321.1 only permits a motion to file a delayed appeal when an appeal has \"been dismissed for failure to adhere to proper form, procedures, or time limits in the <em>perfection of the appeal </em>as required by law or by the Rules of the Supreme Court.\" (Emphasis added). It is arguable whether a violation of Rule 5A:8 relates to the perfection of an appeal. Rules 5A:7 and 5A:8 are silent as to the manner and form by which an appeal is <em>perfected </em>to this Court, but rather relate strictly to the contents of the record in the trial court which, when forwarded to this Court, will simply frame the context of this Court\u2019s decision. Indeed, the Amendments to Part 5A of the Rules of the Supreme Court adopted on April 30, 2010 and effective on July 1, 2010 make this distinction by placing those Rules applicable to the preparation of the record in a different subsection from those Rules which relate to the \"Perfection of the Appeal\u201d found in Section E of Part 5A of the amended Rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. Appellate courts in other jurisdictions, including the United States Supreme Court, routinely dismiss appeals where: the issue is moot, the appeal has been improvidently granted, or as here, the record is so incomplete as to prevent the Court\u2019s proper consideration of the issue. <em>See e.g. Christian Civic League of Me., Inc. v. FEC, </em>549 U.S. 801, 127 S.Ct. 336, 166 L.Ed.2d 7 (2006) (dismissing as moot); <em>Gilligan v. Sweetenham, </em>405 U.S. 949, 92 S.Ct. 1161, 31 L.Ed.2d 227 (1972) (noting probable jurisdiction, but dismissing as moot); <em>see also United States v. Dula, </em>989 F.2d 772 (5th Cir.1993) (dismissing defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim for failure to provide a record). The term \"dismissed,\u201d in the context of <em>an </em>appeal, is used elsewhere as a generic dispositional term indicating that a party failed to put the appeal in a posture such that the issues can be reached and resolved by the appellate court. Thus, in many other jurisdictions, the dismissal of an appeal has no inherent jurisdictional implications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. Notably, in concluding in <em>Jay </em>that a dismissal rendered a rule violation jurisdictional, the Supreme Court expressly stated that \"to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>otherwise would mean that, if an appellant did not list cases alphabetically in the table of citations as required by Rule 5A:20(a), dismissal of the appeal would be mandated as a jurisdictional matter.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>275 Va. at 520, 659 S.E.2d at 317. Yet curiously on April 30, 2010, the Supreme Court of Virginia adopted comprehensive amendments to its Rules which, contrary to the holding in <em>Jay, </em>permit, and in some cases require the <em>dismissal </em>of a petition for appeal for failure to comply with various Rules including, among other things, the failure to file a compliant table of contents or authorities. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:26 (\"If an appellant fails to file a brief in compliance with these Rules, the Court of Appeals <em>may dismiss </em>the appeal.\u201d); <em>see also e.g. </em>Rule 5A:12(c)(l)(ii) (\"If the assignments of error are insufficient or otherwise fail to comply with the requirements of this Rule, the petition for appeal <em>shall be dismissed.\u201d) </em>(Amendments to Part 5A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia adopted April 30, 2010 and effective July 1, 2010) (emphasis added). Since <em>Jay </em>expressly holds that deficient briefs and other rule violations which are readily curable are not jurisdictional and, thus, ought not result in dismissal of an appeal, the plain language in the amended Rules would seem to be in clear conflict with the holding of <em>Jay </em>and, thus, it may well be that when effective, these amended Rules will have the effect of overruling <em>Jay. </em>However, that is a decision for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. Rule 5A:20(e) requires the appellant to provide this Court, in his opening brief, the principles of law, argument, and legal authority relating to his questions presented. Rule 5A:8 requires the appellant to file the transcript in the trial court within sixty days after entry of final judgment, thereby making the transcript a part of the record. In other words, Rule 5A:20(e) requires that an appellant provide this Court with the issues he wants us to resolve and the arguments and legal authority he asserts to support his position, while Rule 5A:8 relates to the contents of the trial court record we are to use in that endeavor. If we were to adopt the dissent\u2019s reasoning, we would create a conflict in our own jurisprudence by ignoring the fact that this Court recently held that the failure to file a transcript indispensable to the resolution of the merits of the appeal, operates as a waiver of the issue. <em>Shiembob v. Shiembob, 55 </em>Va.App. 234, 246, 685 S.E.2d 192, 198-99 (2009) (\"Because the arguments raised by husband are wholly contained within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>untimely-filed transcript and are indispensable to the determination of this issue, this question is waived on appeal\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. We disagree with the position of the dissent that the General Assembly has somehow implicitly ceded to the Supreme Court of Virginia its authority to create or limit the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth's courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. The dilemma both the dissent and we face involves the reconciliation of facially irreconcilable precedent from our Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court of Virginia in recent years has taken some steps toward refining the concept of \"jurisdiction\u201d to its original meaning as \"[a] court\u2019s power to decide a case or issue a decree,\u201d <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>867 (8th ed.2004), as the dissent correctly points out, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>other cases our Supreme Court has used the word \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to apply to several of the mandatory requirements of various rules of court. <em>See Dudley v. Florence Drug Corporation, </em>204 Va. 533, 535, 132 S.E.2d 465, 467 (1963) (\"We have repeatedly held that Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e) and (f), is mandatory and jurisdictional and a failure to comply with it is fatal to an appeal. Here the plaintiff has flagrantly violated the mandatory requirements of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e) and (f), in that the transcript of the oral testimony and other incidents of trial was not tendered to the court below within 60 days after final judgment. Such lack of compliance with the Rule is fatal to the jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the writ of error is sustained, the effect of which is to affirm the judgment of the court below.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>see also Towler v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 533, 535, 221 S.E.2d 119, 121 (1976) (\"These are simple, easily understood rule provisions. But they are jurisdictional, and failure to comply therewith will result, as in the present case, in dismissal, either before or after appeal is awarded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Given the apparent conflict between the language used in these cases with the principle, acknowledged by our Supreme Court, that jurisdiction must flow from the authority of the constitution or statute and its corollary that a rule of court may not convey or limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction although it may limit its ability to act, we believe that the use of the word \"jurisdictional\u201d in the cases relied upon by the dissent is simply an inartful synonym for the mandatory procedural requirements which regulate the manner in which a court exercises its power\u2014not its jurisdiction. In other words, the legislature determines \"jurisdiction,\u201d i.e. the generic power of a court to act at all, under what circumstances, and which court is appropriate for the resolution of various types of cases and controversies. Conversely, the Supreme Court of Virginia, through its statutory grant of rulemaking authority, determines the mandatory or discretionary procedural steps necessary as a prerequisite to process, in an orderly fashion, those cases in the various courts in which they have jurisdiction to act. However, in doing so, the Supreme Court does not, and indeed may not, limit the actual jurisdiction of the courts. Put another way, a court may be unable to act because it has no jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties in the first place, or it may be unable to act, even where the court has jurisdiction, due to a failure to satisfy mandatory procedural requirements deemed essential to an orderly and expeditious resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">To use the dissent\u2019s example, by its plain language, we believe Rule 1:1 does not limit a court\u2019s \"jurisdiction,\u201d but rather limits the <em>power </em>of a court, which already has jurisdiction, to modify its final order more than 21 days after its entry. Thus, Rule 1:1 is better understood to be an exercise of our Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority to regulate the judicial system by fixing a mandatory time certain when a case is finally considered concluded in a court with jurisdiction. Such bright-line finality is necessary so that either the prevailing party can enforce a judgment or an aggrieved party can seek relief in a higher court, and Rule 1:1 simply regulates the point in time at which this takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>As discussed above, on the facts of this case, this distinction makes a practical difference in the Commonwealth only because <em>Jay </em>holds that a dismissal of a case constitutes a determination that this Court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">.

Over a quarter of a century ago, our Supreme Court answered that question with clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal language. The Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">[W]e must <em>dismiss </em>the writ as improvidently awarded.

Going on to explain why that statement is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding to the contrary, the majority apologetically notes that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cusage of \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 [when discussing these rules] is simply another example of its use of this term as inartful shorthand for what in reality is more accurately described as a mandatory \u2018claims-processing rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 360, 693 S.E.2d at 770.

To the contrary, I believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the term jurisdiction in <em>Towler </em>was both deliberate and fully consistent with its definition of that term in <em>Ghameshlouy v.

The Supreme Court concluded that dismissal is an appropriate remedy only when the violation of a Rule is jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 659 S.E.2d at 315. The Court stated that \u201c[b]y <em>dismissing </em>rather than <em>denying </em>the appeals, the Court of Appeals rendered the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court held that it was error to dismiss the appeal and concluded that Rule 5A:20(e) is not jurisdictional. The Court went on to suggest that the appropriate remedy for the failure to comply with that Rule is to \u201ctreat [the] question presented as waived\u201d and deny the petition for appeal, or, if the petition for appeal had already been granted, affirm. <em>Id. </em>at 520, 659 S.E.2d at 317. In the alternative, the Court also suggested that \u201cthe Court of Appeals may ... require an appellant to re-submit the petition for appeal or opening brief ...\u201d or, if the failure to strictly adhere to the Rule was insignificant, decide the case on its merits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s only holding in <em>Jay </em>was that the Court of Appeals erred by dismissing for failure to comply with a non-jurisdictional Rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Jay, </em>then, requires us not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>assume that all rules are non-jurisdictional, as the majority clearly does, but to \u201cadhere to this distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rule requirements____\u201d 275 Va. at 518, 659 S.E.2d at 315. Such an admonition requires us to consider each Rule and its contents individually to determine whether it is, wholly or partially, jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional. Thus, to answer the parties\u2019 ultimate question\u2014what is the appropriate remedy for the failure to timely file an indispensable transcript\u2014we need only answer the question of whether such a failure is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Like the majority, I begin with the recognition that \u201c \u2018jurisdiction is a word of many, too many, meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>279 Va. at 388, 689 S.E.2d at 702 (quoting <em>Ghameshlouy v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 47, 57, 675 S.E.2d 854, 859 (2009) (Haley, J. dissenting)). Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[jlurisdiction is a term which can engender much confusion because it encompasses a variety of separate and distinct legal concepts.\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 228, 661 S.E.2d 415, 426 (2008). Fortunately, the Supreme Court did not end its discussion with such a defeated tone, but rather expressly defined the term so as to guide both the bench and bar toward a greater understanding of such a confusing concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">The term jurisdiction embraces several concepts including subject matter jurisdiction, which is the authority granted through constitution or statute to adjudicate a class of cases or controversies; territorial jurisdiction, that is, authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area; notice jurisdiction, or effective notice to a party or if the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>seizure of a <em>res; </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>\u201cthe other conditions of fact must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the prerequisites of the authority of the court to proceed to judgment or decree.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azb\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Farant Inv.

The distinctions between these types of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d are far more than an academic exercise because our Supreme Court has mandated certain practical differences among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u201cJurisdiction ... is the power to adjudicate a case upon the merits and dispose of it as justice may require.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>271 Va. at 343, 626 S.E.2d at 378 (quoting <em>Shelton v.

The Supreme Court has parsed the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d into two concepts: potential and active jurisdiction. <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>279 Va. at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 702-03. Potential jurisdiction is subject matter jurisdiction, which \u201cis the authority granted to [the court] by constitution or statute over a specified class of cases or controversies ...\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 388, 689 S.E.2d at 702. However, potential jurisdiction alone is insufficient to provide a court the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>adjudicate a case on the merits. A court\u2019s potential jurisdiction \u201cbecomes \u2018active\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d when all of the following <em>elements </em>are present: subject matter jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, notice jurisdiction, and authority jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 702-03; <em>accord Bd. of Supervisors, </em>271 Va. at 343, 626 S.E.2d at 378 (naming these four types of jurisdiction as elements of a court\u2019s active jurisdiction); <em>Farant Inv. Corp., </em>138 Va. at 427, 122 S.E. at 144 (calling these types of jurisdiction \u201cfour essential requisites to confer upon a court \u2018active jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Neither party has argued that we lack subject matter jurisdiction, and it would certainly be a futile exercise to do so. Our Constitution grants the General Assembly \u201cthe power to determine the original and appellate jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth.\u201d Va. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 1. And, the General Assembly exercised this constitutional power by enacting Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i), which clearly grants to this Court appellate subject matter jurisdiction over \u201cany final conviction in a circuit court of a traffic infraction or a crime----\u201d Unquestionably, therefore, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Thus, like <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>I am not concerned with our potential jurisdiction, which is subject matter jurisdiction, or, the statutory authority of this Court to consider the subject matter of this appeal. 279 Va. at 389, 689 S.E.2d at 703. Nor am I concerned with our personal jurisdiction over the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>do not necessarily equate to the requisite active jurisdiction to decide the case. <em>Ghameshlouy, </em>279 Va. at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 702-03. This Court must also have the authority to convert our potential subject matter jurisdiction into active jurisdiction, or, put differently, we must have the authority to exercise our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Without this \u201cactive jurisdiction,\u201d this Court is without \u201cpower to adjudicate [this] case upon the merits.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>271 Va. at 343, 626 S.E.2d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">This authority to exercise subject matter jurisdiction is a completely distinct and different jurisdictional concept. <em>Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 281, 552 S.E.2d 73, 75 (2001); <em>see also Mohamed v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 95, 98-99, 691 S.E.2d 513, 514-15 (2010). It \u201cis commonly described as those \u2018conditions of fact [that] must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the <em>prerequisites of the authority of the court </em>to proceed to judgment or decree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mohamed, </em>56 Va.App. at 101, 691 S.E.2d at 516 (quoting <em>Porter, </em>276 Va. at 228, 661 S.E.2d at 426) (emphasis added). Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which originates in a constitution or stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ute, these conditions of fact often arise from \u201cthe unwritten or the statute law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that a rule falls within this \u201cauthority jurisdiction\u201d as opposed to \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d does not mean that the rule is not jurisdictional. On the contrary, a rule that limits this Court\u2019s authority to proceed to a decree is by definition jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Our Constitution has specifically delegated to our Supreme Court the \u201cauthority to make rules governing the course of appeals and the practice and procedures to be used in the courts of the Commonwealth, but such rules shall not be in conflict with the general law as the same shall, from time to time, be established by the General Assembly.\u201d Va. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 5. Thus, the Constitution provides for both the Supreme Court and the General Assembly to promulgate rules to govern the courts of the Commonwealth. As such, the Supreme Court engages in a quasi-legislative function by promulgating these rules much in the same way that an executive agency exercises a quasi-legislative function in promulgating rules and regulations pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Thus, to the extent that the Supreme Court\u2019s rules do not conflict with those established by the General Assembly, those rules carry the force and effect of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The General Assembly has enacted numerous general laws, and the Rules of the Supreme Court are consistent with those laws. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-100 through 17.1-629. But, in the absence of legislation from the General Assembly, the responsibility for \u201cmaking rules governing the course of appeals\u201d rests predominantly with the Supreme Court. Indeed, the General Assembly has also delegated to our Supreme Court the authority to \u201cmake general regulations for the practice in all courts of the Commonwealth,\u201d including \u201ca system of rules of practice----\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 8.01-3(A). This delegation of rule-making authority is in addition to the Supreme Court\u2019s consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tutional authority. If the General Assembly disagrees with one of these rules, it \u201cmay, from time to time, by the enactment of a general law, modify, or annul any rules adopted\u201d by the Supreme Court. Code \u00a7 8.01\u20143(D); <em>see also </em>Va. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 5; <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>263 Va. 13, 18, 557 S.E.2d 223, 226 (2002) (stating that \u201c[t]he General Assembly has implicitly modified Rule 3A:6(b)\u201d by enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8)). Essentially, both the Constitution and the General Assembly have delegated rulemaking authority to the Supreme Court and has allowed it to limit the authority of the courts to act in certain situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The majority contends that a rule of court cannot, in any circumstance, convey or limit jurisdiction. However, denying a rule jurisdictional character has never been based on the erroneous assumption that a rule can never be jurisdictional. <em>See State Water Control Bd. v. Crutchfield, </em>265 Va. 416, 424, 578 S.E.2d 762, 766 (2003). Indeed, no decision in our jurisprudence has ever established the majority\u2019s \u201cbasic premise.\u201d Rather, the analysis has always centered on the precise language of the specific rule in question. <em>Id. </em>In <em>State Water Control Board, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Rule 2A:4 is not jurisdictional because of the \u201cabsence of language in the Rule compelling such a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reinforces the view that a rule can limit the jurisdiction of a Court if the language in the rule compels such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">For example, Rule 1:1 limits the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction by prescribing that \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees ... shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d Recently, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe provisions of Rule 1:1 are mandatory in order to assure the certainty and stability that the finality of judgments brings. Once a final judgment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>been entered and the twenty-one day time period of Rule 1:1 has expired, the trial court is thereafter without jurisdiction in the case.\u201d <em>City of Suffolk v.

In presuming that the Supreme Court has \u201ctaken steps toward refining the concept of jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id., </em>the majority ignores the broad definition of ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>risdiction set out in <em>Ghameshlouy </em>and <em>Porter. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court reinforced the proposition that Rule 1:1 is jurisdictional in <em>Ghameshlouy </em>when it stated that \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s <em>jurisdiction </em>over the case extends 21 days beyond the entry of the final order.\u201d 279 Va. at 390, 689 S.E.2d at 703 (citing Rule 1:1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Nonetheless, the majority concludes that Rule 1:1 is not jurisdictional and the Supreme Court\u2019s use of that term in <em>Ghameshlouy </em>was inartful when it states in footnote 7, \u201cRule 1:1 does not limit a court\u2019s \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 but rather limits the <em>power </em>of a court, which already has jurisdiction, to modify its final order more than 21 days after its entry.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 360 n. 7, 693 S.E.2d at 770 n. 7 (emphasis in original). However, as stated above, a court\u2019s active jurisdiction includes \u201c \u2018other conditions of fact [that] must exist which are demanded by the unwritten or statute law as the prerequisites of the <em>authority of the court to proceed to judgment or </em>decree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter, </em>276 Va. at 228, 661 S.E.2d at 426 (quoting <em>Farant Inv. Corp., </em>138 Va. at 427-28, 122 S.E. at 144) (emphasis added). \u201cThese \u2018conditions of fact\u2019 can be affected by various factors, including ... the passage of time.\u201d <em>Mohamed, </em>56 Va.App. at 101, 691 S.E.2d at 516 (citing <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 290, 293, 176 S.E.2d 815, 817 (1970)). Clearly, the fact that must exist as a prerequisite to the trial court\u2019s authority to proceed to judgment or decree is whether the modification occurred within 21 days after the entry of the final order. Thus, the only conclusion I can reach is that Rule 1:1 is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Further, the majority cites to both <em>Nelson, </em>262 Va. at 278, 552 S.E.2d at 74, and <em>David Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 437, 527 S.E.2d 406, 409 (2000), as evidence that our Supreme Court has \u201ctaken steps to refin[e] the concept of \u2018jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson </em>involved a <em>Baker </em>claim<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>trolled by the rule established one year earlier in <em>Moore. </em>In <em>Moore, </em>the Court held that the statute limited the trial court\u2019s authority to proceed to judgment. 259 Va. at 440, 527 S.E.2d at 411. Because the limitation on the court\u2019s authority limited its jurisdiction, the Court held that the failure to comply rendered the judgment void. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Nelson, </em>the Supreme Court admitted its error in <em>Moore </em>and concluded that \u201cthe statutory requirement of notice to parents was not jurisdictional but procedural in nature, that a failure to notify parents could be waived by a failure to object, and correspondingly, that a failure to comply with the requirement rendered subsequent convictions voidable and not void.\u201d 262 Va. at 285, 552 S.E.2d at 77. Essentially, the Supreme Court concluded that the statute did not limit the trial court\u2019s authority to proceed to judgment at all, but rather merely imposes a procedural requirement. Thus, the notice requirement was not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The majority overlooks the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the language used in the specific statute, which was dispositive in that case. In that discussion, the Supreme Court acknowledged that in 1977, the General Assembly removed language from the statute that essentially made it jurisdictional: <em>\u201cin no case shall the hearing proceed </em>until the parent or parents of the child ... have been notified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 552 S.E.2d at 76 (emphasis in original). The new language merely required that \u201cthe juvenile court shall give parents notice in writing of a transfer hearing,\u201d and the Supreme Court concluded that this language was procedural and not jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 552 S.E.2d at 77. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Nelson </em>that the new language did not \u201cremotely suggest[ ] an intention to re-institute a jurisdictional requirement in the notice provisions of the juvenile statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Nelson </em>concluded that the notice requirement was not jurisdictional simply because of the absence of language in the statute compelling such a result. <em>Cf. State Water Control Bd., </em>265 Va. at 424, 578 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>S.E.2d at 766 (concluding that Rule 2A:4 is not jurisdictional because of the \u201cabsence of language in the Rule compelling such a result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Thus, I am unwilling to cast off such a well-established legal principle that the trial court is divested of jurisdiction over a case after twenty-one days. This limitation on the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction is solely rule-based and has no statutory foundation. As a result, I disagree with the majority\u2019s \u201cbasic premise ... that a rule of court cannot create or limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction____\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 360, 693 S.E.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Applying these principles to the case at hand, it is imperative to note that the jurisdictional nature of Rule 5A:8 is <em>not </em>an issue of first impression. Both this Court and our Supreme Court have held repeatedly that failure to file an indispensable transcript will result in the dismissal of an appeal. In <em>Dudley v. Florence Drug Corporation, </em>204 Va. 533, 535,132 S.E.2d 465, 466-67 (1963), the appellant tendered the transcript to the trial court six days after the sixty-day deadline set forth in Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e) and (f), which was the precursor to former Rule 5:9 and current Rules 5:11 and 5A:8.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, the transcript was not properly before the Court. The Court stated that \u201cRule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e) and (f) is mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and <em>jurisdictional </em>and a failure to comply with it is fatal to an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 132 S.E.2d at 467 (emphasis added). The Court reasoned that the \u201cplaintiff has flagrantly violated the mandatory requirements of Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e) and (f)\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch a lack of compliance with the Rule is fatal to the <em>jurisdiction </em>of this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court then sustained the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the writ of error and dismissed the writ.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Similarly, in <em>Towler, </em>the appellant filed the transcript with the court; however, he failed to accompany it with \u201cany notice, certificate of service, or acceptance of service,\u201d which was required by former Rule 5:9. <em>Towler, </em>216 Va. at 534, 221 S.E.2d at 120. Our Supreme Court stated that because of the appellant\u2019s failure to abide by former Rule 5:9, the transcript was not made a part of the record. <em>Id. </em>Then, the Court stated that the transcript was indispensable to disposition of the issues before it and concluded that it \u201cmust <em>dismiss </em>the writ as improvidently granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">[w]e take the occasion ... to reiterate the <em>jurisdictional </em>nature of [former] Rule 5:9 and to reemphasize the necessity of compliance with its mandatory provisions. We do this because we have observed far too many violations of this rule; and we lament the numerous instances in which we have been forced to <em>dismiss </em>appeals because of failure to observe the rule\u2019s requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 534, 221 S.E.2d at 121 (emphasis added). After explaining the requirements of former Rule 5:9(b), the Court stated that \u201c[t]hese are simple, easily understood rule provisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>But they are <em>jurisdictional, </em>and failure to comply therewith will result, as in the present case, in <em>dismissal, </em>either before or after appeal is awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 221 S.E.2d at 121 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">This Court has also enunciated these principles repeatedly throughout its jurisprudence. <em>See Smith, </em>32 Va.App. at 771-72, 531 S.E.2d at 14-15; <em>Clary, </em>15 Va.App. at 601, 425 S.E.2d at 822; <em>Anderson, </em>13 Va.App. at 509, 413 S.E.2d at 77; <em>Williams, </em>7 Va.App. at 519, 375 S.E.2d at 366; <em>Bunton, </em>6 Va.App. at 561, 370 S.E.2d at 472; <em>Holley, </em>6 Va.App. at 568-69, 370 S.E.2d at 321; <em>Jordan, </em>3 Va.App. at 673, 353 S.E.2d at 168; <em>Turner, </em>2 Va.App. at 99, 341 S.E.2d at 402; <em>Barrett, </em>1 Va.App. at 380, 339 S.E.2d at 209-10. For example, in <em>Barrett, </em>the Court stated that the failure to comply with Rule 5A:8 \u201cis <em>jurisdictional </em>and the failure to comply therewith will result in <em>dismissal.\u201d Barrett, </em>1 Va.App. at 380, 339 S.E.2d at 210 (citing <em>Towler, </em>216 Va. 533, 221 S.E.2d 119) (emphasis added). The Court went on to state that \u201c[t]he transcript or written statement is indispensable to a disposition of this appeal and is <em>jurisdictional. </em>There is no rule, statute or rationale that allows us to decide otherwise. This case is, therefore, <em>dismissed.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">When, however, the issues on appeal may be decided without the transcript (i.e. the transcript is not indispensable), its absence does not limit our jurisdiction to decide those issues that do not require a transcript. We have recognized that there is no mandate in our Rules that requires either party to file a transcript, <em>Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 640, 643, 371 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1988), and \u201c[t]he absence or late filing of the transcript ... does nothing to diminish our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>2 Va.App. at 99, 341 S.E.2d at 402. We explained that statement in <em>Turner </em>and limited its application to those issues for which the transcript was not indispensable. <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201c[i]f the record on appeal is sufficient in the absence of the transcript to determine the merits of the appellant\u2019s allegations, [then] we are free to proceed to hear the case.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 643, 371 S.E.2d at 315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u201cThe importance of the record is obvious, for it is axiomatic that an appellate court\u2019s review of the case is limited to the record on appeal.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>2 Va.App. at 99, 341 S.E.2d at 402. A transcript is indispensable when, in the absence of a transcript, the record is not \u201ccomplete to the degree necessary to adjudicate the appeal,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cdetermine the merits of the appellant\u2019s allegations,\u201d <em>id., </em>or \u201cpermit resolution of appellate issues.\u201d Rule 5A:8(b). Thus, it is clear that if the transcript is indispensable, then \u201cany assignments of error affected by the omission <em>shall not </em>be considered.\u201d Rule 5A:8(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Turner, </em>this Court determined that the transcript was indispensable and concluded that there was \u201cno alternative but to dismiss the case for failure to comply with mandatory rule provisions.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>2 Va.App. at 100, 341 S.E.2d at 402. We reached the same conclusion in <em>Anderson, </em>13 Va.App. at 510, 413 S.E.2d at 78, where we said \u201c[bjecause the statement of facts is indispensable to a determination of the question presented, we must dismiss the appeal.\u201d In contrast, however, we reached the merits in <em>Wolfe </em>because \u201cthe issue presented ... [was] capable of resolution without a transcript.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 644, 371 S.E.2d at 316. We noted that the \u201cdecision to review [that] case without a trial transcript or statement of facts is the rare exception rather than the general rule. The trial transcript usually is indispensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, cases where a transcript is not filed are usually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jay </em>does nothing to overturn <em>Towler, Fearon, Crum, Dudley, Smith, Clary, Anderson, Williams, Bunton, Holley, Jordan^ Turner, </em>or <em>Barrett. </em>While our <em>post-Jay </em>application of Rule 5A:8 may have changed from dismissing to affirming cases affected by this issue, our jurisprudence does not support that practice. Indeed, just last year, our Supreme Court, in an unpublished order,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> held that this Court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>err in dismissing an appeal \u201con the ground that a transcript or written statement of facts was \u2018indispensable to a determination of the questions presented.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Mitchell v. O\u2019Brien, </em>No. 072633 (Va. Feb. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Further, I note several important distinctions between Rules 5A:20 and 5A:8. First, unlike Rule 5A:20, Rule 5A:8 expressly limits our authority to act. \u201cWhen the appellant fails to ensure that the record contains transcripts or a written statement of facts necessary to permit resolution of appellate issues, any assignments of error affected by the omission <em>shall not be considered.\u201d </em>Rule 5A:8 (emphasis added). Rule 5A:20 merely states that \u201cthe opening brief of appellant shall contain\u201d a list of items, a phrase that does not limit our authority to proceed to judgment or decree. Second, a violation of Rule 5A:8, unlike a violation of Rule 5A:20, cannot be corrected or overlooked. Once the time limit for filing the transcript with the trial court has expired, it cannot thereafter be extended. <em>Jordan, </em>3 Va.App. 672, 353 S.E.2d 168.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>noted in <em>Jay </em>that this Court could take actions to address a violation of Rule 5A:20, such as requiring an appellant to refile a defective brief. No such corrective measures are available to address a failure to file an indispensable transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Thus, I would hold that when an indispensable transcript is not made part of the record, this Court lacks both the authority and the ability to address the issues raised. Therefore, I would conclude that, if the transcript is indispensable, the proper remedy for failing to file such transcript is dismissal. Thus, to determine whether the fate of this particular appeal is a dismissal, affirmance, or reversal, I would next decide whether the untimely-filed suppression-hearing transcript is indispensable to our ability to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The only question presented that Smith raises on the merits of this case is whether the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress an out-of-court identification because the circumstances were unduly suggestive. In Smith\u2019s motion to suppress he argued \u201cthat complete, neutral, and unbiased photographic lineups were not provided to the alleged victim\u201d and he gave notice that he would \u201cmove to exclude all identifying evidence from admission into evidence at his subsequent trial.\u201d That is the only information in the record regarding the victim\u2019s identification of Smith. The record simply included the typical court documents such as the indictment, motion to suppress, plea agreement, conviction order, sentencing order, notice of appeal, Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the transcript from the sentencing hearing. In the absence of the suppression-hearing transcript, the record is not complete to the degree necessary to adjudicate the appeal and determine the merits of the appellant\u2019s allegations. Therefore, I would conclude that the suppression-hearing transcript is indispensable to the resolution of Smith\u2019s question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Accordingly, I would dismiss Smith\u2019s appeal, thereby allowing his convictions to stand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\">. While this dissent refers to indispensable transcripts, the following analysis applies equally to an indispensable written statement of facts. Rule 5A:8(b). I also note that, contrary to the majority's opinion, nothing in this dissent would require this Court to dismiss any appeal for the mere failure to file a dispensable transcript. To the extent that the majority interprets this dissent to require dismissal in every case where a transcript is not filed, it misstates my position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\">.

The majority states that \"[t]he holding in <em>Jay </em>could hardly be clearer, '[b]y <em>dismissing </em>rather than <em>denying </em>the appeals, the Court of Appeals rendered the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 355, 693 S.E.2d at 767. I agree that <em>Jay's </em>holding could hardly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>clearer, but reading the entire opinion in context, the Court's holding is simply that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing for a violation of a non-jurisdictional rule. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding rests entirely on its conclusion that Rule 5A:20(e) is not jurisdictional. In contrast, and noted below, the Supreme Court has repeatedly and consistently held that Rule 5A: 8 is <em>jurisdictional </em>and the remedy for a violation is <em>dismissal. </em>Had the Court intended the holding in <em>Jay </em>to overturn this long-standing precedent, I believe it would have explicitly done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. The majority contends that \"potential jurisdiction\u201d consists of subject matter jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, notice jurisdiction, and authority jurisdiction. <em>Supra </em>at 357-59, 693 S.E.2d at 768-69. However, the Supreme Court in <em>Ghameshlouy </em>clearly limited this concept to subject matter jurisdiction. 279 Va. at 388-89, 689 S.E.2d at 702-03. Indeed, this is not a new concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">The jurisdiction under consideration is what Mr. Lile, in his excellent work above cited, calls \"active jurisdiction,\u201d which he defines as \"the right to exercise the potential jurisdiction in a given case\u201d (Lile\u2019s Eq.

The majority attempts to draw a distinction between a court\u2019s \"power\u201d and \"authority.\" According to the majority, \"authority\u201d is jurisdictional, but \u201cpower\u201d is not. Thus, the majority states that \"a court\u2019s <em>\u2018power \u2019 </em>to actually reach the merits of a case depends upon a party's compliance with any and all mandatory requirements imposed by the rules of court.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 360, 693 S.E.2d at 769-70 (emphasis added). I see no support for this distinction in our jurisprudence and, further, as noted above, the Supreme Court defined \"jurisdiction\u201d in <em>Board of Supervisors </em>as \"the <em>power </em>to adjudicate a case upon the merits and dispose of it as justice may require.\u201d 271 Va. at 343, 626 S.E.2d at 378 (quoting <em>Shelton, </em>126 Va. at 629, 102 S.E. at 85) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">I view a court\u2019s power to adjudicate a case on the merits as an overall description of the concept of jurisdiction including both potential and active jurisdiction. Thus, in order for a court to adjudicate a case on the merits, the court must have subject matter, territorial, notice, and authority jurisdiction. It follows logically, then, that \"authority\u201d is a required element of a court\u2019s \"power\u201d to proceed on the merits. Where a rule limits a court\u2019s \"authority\u201d to proceed to judgment or decree, the court has no \"power\u201d to adjudicate the case on the merits.

In <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Castle, </em>263 Va. 407, 411, 559 S.E.2d 616, 619 (2002), our Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>With the exception of cases with procedural defects and the limited number of cases for which appellate review by the Supreme Court of Virginia is dependent upon \"a substantial constitutional question as a determinative issue or matters of significant precedential value\u201d (Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-410 and -411), the refusal of a petition for appeal constitutes a decision on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">And, a \u201cdecision on the merits\u201d\u2014including the denial of a petition of appeal\u2014has precedential value, as long as \"the grounds upon which the refusal is based are discernible from the four comers of the Court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 559 S.E.2d at 619.

The majority also raises the argument that Rule 5A:18 is not jurisdictional in order to support its argument that Rule 5A:8 is not jurisdictional. Of course Rule 5A: 18 is not jurisdictional. It contains an \"ends of justice\u201d exception, something that is inconsistent with a jurisdiction<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>al requirement. Rule 5A:8, however, is mandatory, and provides for no exception. Thus, I fail to see the logic in that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
