In those decisions, DMAS denied Avante\u2019s claims for additional reimbursement of costs (in the form of year-end settlement adjustments) for respiratory therapy services rendered to Medicaid eligible patients over a two-year period. Because of DMAS\u2019s errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ous interpretation and application of certain governing state and federal regulations, we agree with Avante that DMAS made errors of law in adjudicating Avante\u2019s claims. We thus reverse the circuit court in affirming DMAS\u2019s decisions, and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand to DMAS for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Avante, as a Medicaid services provider, established in the mid-1990\u2019s specialized care units at its four Virginia nursing facilities, located in Roanoke, Lynchburg, Waynesboro, and Harrisonburg, for the treatment of, among others, ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients who were eligible for Medicaid benefits. <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-60-40(H) and 12 VAC 30-60-320 (setting forth Medicaid criteria for \u201cventilation/tracheostomy specialized care\u201d). Those patients \u201crequire[d] comprehensive respiratory therapy services\u201d as part of their specialized care. 12 VAC 30-60-320(B). Avante contracted with the University of Virginia Medical Center to perform the respiratory therapy services. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106 (regulating cost reimbursements to nursing facilities for Medicare and Medicaid specialized care services provided \u201cunder arrangements\u201d with outside entities). Avante received reimbursement for the cost of the services from DMAS, through its administration of the Medicaid program in Virginia. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-325 (establishing DMAS as the agency in Virginia to administer the Medicaid program).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The University of Virginia Medical Center eventually stopped performing respiratory therapy services for patients at nursing facilities under the Medicaid program, at which time Avante began performing the services \u201cin-house,\u201d managing \u201cthe program on [its] own.\u201d After a year of doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Avante, in 2001, again contracted with an outside entity, Southern Healthcare Services (\u201cSouthern\u201d), to perform the respiratory therapy services for Avante\u2019s Medicaid eligible ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients. This arrangement with Southern extended for at least the next two fiscal years ending May 31, 2002 (FY 2002) and May 31, 2003 (FY 2003), which are the two years in dispute in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The respiratory therapy services provided to Avante\u2019s above-referenced Medicaid eligible patients fell within the definition of \u201cancillary services\u201d under the Medicaid payment system for nursing facilities. 12 VAC 30-90-264. The costs of those services were, in turn, categorized as \u201c[sjpecialized care ancillary costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, to the extent Avante\u2019s costs for providing those services were \u201creasonable,\u201d Avante was entitled to payment from DMAS for the costs \u201con a pass-through basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, there was no pre-determined annual \u201cceiling\u201d or limitation on the total actual costs that were subject to reimbursement (unlike, for example, certain Medicaid reimbursement limits for Avante\u2019s \u201croutine operating costs\u201d). <em>Id. </em>DMAS paid Avante for the costs of such ancillary services under a prospective payment system. Under that system, DMAS would pay a provider like Avante an \u201cinterim rate\u201d or per diem throughout the current year based on the provider\u2019s actual \u201csettled\u201d costs for the services in the previous year, and at the end of the current year DMAS would determine what \u201csettle[ment]\u201d was required between it and the provider after reconciling the per diem payments with the provider\u2019s actual costs incurred in the current year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In FY 2002, DMAS thus paid to Avante a per diem throughout the year for the respiratory therapy services provided to Avante\u2019s Medicaid eligible ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients based on DMAS\u2019s payment to Avante for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>costs of such services in the previous year (FY 2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the end of FY 2002, Avante submitted to DMAS, as required, annual cost reports setting forth, <em>inter alia, </em>the actual costs it incurred for those respiratory therapy services in FY 2002\u2014 services provided to Avante\u2019s patients through its first year contract with Southern. <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-90-70. Avante indicated in the reports that it had been underpaid for the services, as established by comparing the total of its actual costs for FY 2002 to the total of its interim per diem payments received in FY 2002. Avante\u2019s actual costs for the respiratory therapy services in FY 2002 were, in fact, substantially more than its costs \u201cas settled\u201d for the services in the previous year\u2014the year Avante provided the services through its own employees. Accordingly, Avante further indicated in the FY 2002 cost reports that it was claiming, as part of its year-end settlement with DMAS, reimbursement in the amount of its underpayment for the actual costs of the respiratory therapy services incurred in FY 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In the next step of this \u201ccost settlement process,\u201d DMAS evaluated Avante\u2019s cost reports, conducted an audit, and decided that Avante\u2019s actual costs in FY 2002 for the respiratory therapy services were not reasonable. <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-90-20; 12 VAC 30-90-70; 12 VAC 30-90-120. Having reached that decision, DMAS determined Avante\u2019s reimbursable costs for those services by calculating a \u201cper patient/per day allowance\u201d based on Avante\u2019s FY 2001 settled costs. As a result of this calculation, which became the basis of DMAS\u2019s FY 2002 cost settlement for Avante, Avante\u2019s reimbursable costs were much less than the actual costs it incurred that year in providing the services to its Medicaid patients under its contract with Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Avante pursued its claim for additional Medicaid reimbursement for the costs of its respiratory therapy services provided in FY 2002 by challenging DMAS\u2019s FY 2002 cost settlement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>an administrative appeal. Following a formal administrative hearing, DMAS issued a final agency decision dated June 30, 2004, rejecting Avante\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The subsequent FY 2003 cost settlement process between DMAS and Avante was essentially the same, both procedurally and substantively, as the process had been for FY 2002. The total of the per diem paid by DMAS to Avante in FY 2003 for the respiratory therapy services provided that year to Avante\u2019s Medicaid eligible ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients\u2014through Avante\u2019s second year contract with Southern\u2014was much less than Avante\u2019s actual costs for providing the services. After Avante made a claim for the difference, as reflected in its FY 2003 cost reports, DMAS again decided that Avante\u2019s actual costs for the services were not reasonable, and determined Avante\u2019s reimbursable costs for those services by calculating a \u201cper patient/per day allowance\u201d based on Avante\u2019s FY 2001 settled costs. DMAS\u2019s FY 2003 cost settlement for Avante thus again resulted in Medicaid cost reimbursement to Avante for respiratory therapy services that was substantially below Avante\u2019s actual costs for providing the services in FY 2003. Avante sought additional reimbursement from DMAS through another administrative appeal, and, again, following a formal administrative hearing, DMAS rejected Avante\u2019s claim in a final agency decision dated December 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Avante appealed to the circuit court DMAS\u2019s final agency decisions on Avante\u2019s respective FY 2002 and FY 2003 claims for additional Medicaid reimbursement for the costs of its respiratory therapy services. The two appeals were eventually consolidated for consideration because of the similarity of the issues presented. By letter opinion dated November 5, 2008, the court denied Avante\u2019s claims. The court then \u201csustained\u201d DMAS\u2019s two agency decisions and dismissed Avante\u2019s appeals by final order entered on December 2, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The Virginia Administrative Process Act authorizes judicial review of agency decisions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. Under well established principles governing the appeal of such decisions, \u201cthe burden is upon the appealing party to demonstrate error.\u201d <em>Carter v. Gordon, </em>28 Va.App. 133, 141, 502 S.E.2d 697, 700-01 (1998). Our review is limited to determining (1) \u201c[w]hether the agency acted in accordance with law;\u201d (2) \u201c[w]hether the agency made a procedural error which was not harmless error;\u201d and (3) \u201c[w]hether the agency had sufficient evidential support for its findings of fact.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988) . Further, with regard to claims of regulatory interpretive error, we are to \u201cgive \u2018great deference\u2019 to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., </em>52 Va.App. 460, 466, 663 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2008). \u201cThis deference stems from Code \u00a7 2.2-4027, which requires that reviewing courts \u2018take due account\u2019 of the \u2018experience and specialized competence of the agency\u2019 promulgating the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 160-61, 384 S.E.2d 622, 627 (1989) ). However, \u201c \u2018deference is not abdication, and it requires us to accept only those principles of agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 260, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 1237, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991)). <em>See also Avalon Assisted Living Facilities v. Zager, </em>39 Va.App. 484, 503, 574 S.E.2d 298, 307 (2002) (principles of statutory construction apply with equal force \u201cto the interpretation of regulations adopted by an administrative agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Avante argues on appeal that DMAS erroneously interpreted and applied both state and federal regulations in reaching the conclusion in DMAS\u2019s two final agency decisions that Avante\u2019s costs for the subject respiratory therapy services in FY 2002 and FY 2003 were not reasonable, and in thus rejecting Avante\u2019s claims for additional Medicaid cost reimbursements. Avante farther argues that the circuit court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>denying Avante\u2019s request to set aside DMAS\u2019s decisions, failed to recognize those errors, erroneously limiting its review, instead, to whether the decisions were substantially supported by the evidence in the record. We agree with Avante that DMAS erred in its interpretation and application of governing state and federal regulations in its two final agency decisions and that the circuit court erroneously failed in its review of DMAS\u2019s adjudication of Avante\u2019s claims to recognize those errors and remand the case to DMAS for reconsideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>Avante\u2019s Utilization of Respiratory Therapists</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In support of its claims for additional Medicaid cost reimbursements for FY 2002 and FY 2003, Avante presented evidence at the evidentiary hearings addressing the reasonableness of its costs for the respiratory therapy services provided to its Medicaid eligible ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients for each of those two years. Avante\u2019s representatives testified that, in an effort to obtain a niche in the market, at the beginning of FY 2002 Avante started taking not only additional Medicaid eligible ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients, but also greater numbers of such patients with more acute conditions. Avante\u2019s representatives further testified that in order to provide the necessary respiratory therapy services to those patients Avante needed to contract with an outside entity possessing a higher level of expertise in the field of respiratory therapy than that possessed by Avante\u2019s own employees. That was the reason, Avante\u2019s witnesses explained, for Avante\u2019s contract with Southern to perform those services in FY 2002 and FY 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Avante\u2019s representatives also asserted that, pursuant to DMAS\u2019s regulations and Nursing Home Manual, respiratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>therapists (furnished by Southern), as opposed to Avante\u2019s nurses, were required to and did, in fact, perform all of the respiratory therapy services for Avante\u2019s subject Medicaid patients and that respiratory therapists were required to be on the premises twenty-four hours a day for at least the benefit of the ventilator dependent patients. Thus, according to Avante, the increase at its facilities of both the number of patients and the level of respiratory therapy services reasonably accounted for a significant part of its increased costs for the services in FY 2002 and FY 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In response, DMAS took the position, which was ultimately adopted in both final agency decisions, that its regulations did not require that all respiratory therapy services in a specialized care unit be performed by respiratory therapists. It was sufficient to have nurses provide respiratory therapy care in addition to respiratory therapists, so long as a respiratory therapist remained available, as defined by being \u201con call\u201d twenty-four hours a day. As DMAS\u2019s Medicaid Settlement Reimbursement Manager, James Branham, testified, \u201c[j]ust a nurse is required to be on site twenty-four [hours a day]\u2014a respiratory therapist has to be available on a twenty-four hour basis.\u201d By \u201cavailable,\u201d he meant \u201con call availability.\u201d Bran-ham also testified, however, in response to questioning by the administrative hearing officer in the appeal of Avante\u2019s FY 2003 claim, that if Avante was required to have a respiratory therapist on site \u201c24/7,\u201d then he assumed that \u201cwould change the numbers,\u201d referring to DMAS\u2019s cost settlement with Avante.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The regulations at issue are 12 VAC 30-60-40 and 12 VAC 30-60-320. At all relevant times, 12 VAC 30-60-40 provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">H. Specialized care services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">2. Providers must be able to provide the following specialized services to Medicaid specialized care recipients:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>b. Skilled nursing services by a registered nurse <em>available 24 hours a day;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">g. Respiratory therapy services by a board-certified therapist (for ventilator patients, these services must be <em>available 24 hours per </em>day)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Setting forth the specialized care criteria for the Medicaid patient, 12 VAC 30-60-320 provided, among other things, that the patient had to meet at least one of several specifically listed alternative requirements. Two of the alternative requirements were (i) that the patient needed \u201cspecial equipment such as mechanical ventilators, respiratory therapy equipment (that has to be supervised by [a] licensed nurse <em>or </em>respiratory therapist),\u201d or (ii) that the patient needed \u201c[d]aily respiratory therapy treatments that must be provided by a skilled nurse <em>or </em>respiratory therapist.\u201d 12 VAC 30-60-320 \u00a7 2.2(B)(2) and (B)(3)(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In addition, Avante pointed to language from DMAS\u2019s Nursing Home Manual providing that the \u201c[rjespiratory therapy services must be of a level of complexity and sophistication or the condition of the resident shall be of such a nature that the services can only be performed by a respiratory therapist who is certified by the Board of Medicine.\u201d DMAS Nursing Home Manual, Chapter VI at 56 (page revision date: January 1, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">DMAS, on the other hand, relied on language from the same section of the Nursing Home Manual, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">If the nursing home agrees to provide care to a resident who is dependent on mechanical assistance for respiration (positive or negative pressure mechanical ventilators), respiratory therapy services must be available 24 hours daily. If the nursing home contracts for respiratory therapy services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>a respiratory therapist must be on call 24 hours a day and available to the home in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Avante and DMAS advance the same arguments in this Court as they did throughout both of Avante\u2019s administrative appeals below. Viewing 12 VAC 30-60-40 and 12 VAC 30-60-320 as part of the same regulatory scheme, we agree with DMAS that these regulations, read in conjunction, plainly contemplated the provision of respiratory therapy services by both nurses and respiratory therapists. Thus, DMAS was correct in rejecting Avante\u2019s position that all of those services had to be provided only by respiratory therapists. Indeed, 12 VAC 30-60-320 \u00a7 2.2(B) expressly indicated that at least some of the services could be provided by a \u201cnurse <em>or </em>respiratory therapist.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We also conclude, however, that DMAS erred in deciding that no respiratory therapist was required to be on the premises on a twenty-four-hour basis at each of Avante\u2019s nursing facilities, so long as each facility had a respiratory therapist \u201con call.\u201d Neither 12 VAC 30-60-40 nor 12 VAC 30-60-320 made any reference to a respiratory therapist being \u201con call.\u201d Rather, in setting forth the specialized care criteria for a nursing facility, 12 VAC 30-60-40 specifically stated that the nursing facility was required to provide \u201c[sjkilled nursing services by a registered nurse <em>available 2k hours a day; </em>\u201d and, \u201cfor ventilator patients,\u201d the facility was required to provide \u201c[rjespiratory therapy services by a board-certified therapist ... <em>available 21 hours per day.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The required availability of nurses and respiratory therapists, where ventilator patients were concerned, was thus exactly the same under the express terms of this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">As we stated in <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>52 Va.App. at 466-67, 663 S.E.2d at 574 (quoting <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 588, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 1663, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000)),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">[n]o matter how one calibrates judicial deference, the administrative power to interpret a regulation does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the power to rewrite it. When a regulation is \u201cnot ambiguous,\u201d judicial deference \u201cto the agency\u2019s position would be to permit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create <em>defacto </em>a new regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><em>See also Dep\u2019t of Med. Assistance Servs. v. Beverly Healthcare of Fredericksburg, </em>41 Va.App. 468, 483-84, 585 S.E.2d 858, 866-67 (2003) (rejecting DMAS interpretation contrary to \u201cplain language of the regulation\u201d); <em>Smith v. Liberty Nursing Home, Inc., </em>31 Va.App. 281, 296-97, 522 S.E.2d 890, 897 (2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In regard to the DMAS Nursing Home Manual, it is similar to the federal Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, which we have described as \u201can interpretive guideline designed to facilitate the management of reimbursement under the Medicare Program.\u201d <em>Fralin v. Kozlowski, </em>18 Va.App. 697, 699, 447 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1994). But the Nursing Home Manual, like the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, \u201cdoes not have the binding effect of law or regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699 n. 2, 447 S.E.2d at 240 n. 2 (determining the \u201clegal status\u201d of the PRM) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, to the extent the Nursing Home Manual can be read as contrary to our above-stated construction of 12 VAC 30-60-40 and 12 VAC 30-60-320, those provisions of the manual have no legal effect. <em>See Maximum Home Health Care, Inc. v. Shalala, </em>272 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir.2001) (\u2018Where an administrative agency creates manual provisions that are inconsistent with the governing regulations, it creates for itself a kind of open-ended discretion in its administrative investigations, and opens the door to disparate treatment of interested parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We therefore hold that, pursuant to 12 VAC 30-60-40, Avante was required, as a matter of law, to have one or more respiratory therapists on site twenty-four hours a day at each of its nursing facilities\u2019 specialized care units engaged in the care of Medicaid eligible ventilator patients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<em>Avante\u2019s Payment of Salary Equivalency Rate under b.2 C.F.R. \u00a7 blS.106</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Under Avante\u2019s contract with Southern to furnish the respiratory therapists that performed the subject respiratory therapy services at Avante\u2019s four nursing facilities, Avante paid Southern for the services at the \u201csalary equivalency\u201d rate (\u201cSER\u201d) established under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This federal regulation, addressing the cost of a provider\u2019s services furnished \u201cunder arrangements\u201d with an outside entity, is part of the Medicare reimbursement regulatory scheme that governs certain aspects of Medicaid reimbursement in Virginia. <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-90-20 (providing that, except where specifically modified in the DMAS regulations, \u201cMedicare principles of reimbursement, as amended from time to time, shall be used to establish the allowable costs in the rate calculations\u201d). On strictly an hourly basis, the SER was significantly higher than the wages Avante paid to its own respiratory therapists in FY 2001 when it was providing the respiratory therapy services \u201cin-house.\u201d The SER was also significantly higher than the hourly wages paid to the \u201cin-house\u201d respiratory therapists at two other nursing facilities in the northern Virginia area to which DMAS compared Avante\u2019s costs for respiratory therapy services.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Avante has argued throughout this appeal that the SER paid to Southern was reasonable <em>per se </em>and that Avante was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>thus entitled to Medicaid reimbursement of costs based on that rate. DMAS has rejected this argument, asserting that Avante failed to prove that paying the SER to Southern was reasonable. As summarized in the final agency decision in Avante\u2019s appeal of DMAS\u2019s FY 2003 cost settlement, DMAS\u2019s director stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">Avante argues that it is entitled to the disputed payments because it \u201cpaid no more than the salary equivalency for its outside respiratory therapy services\u201d and that because the salary equivalency represents \u201cthe fair market rate for those services,\u201d it has proven its entitlement to the disputed payments. In essence, Avante argues that because it has claimed no more than the highest salary equivalency amount allowed under DMAS\u2019 payment policy (DMAS uses Medicare\u2019s salary equivalency guidelines to cap what it will pay on an hourly basis for out-sourced specialized services), its costs are <em>per se </em>reasonable. However, Avante has made no showing that it was unable or even tried to purchase respiratory therapist services at anything but the highest level permitted under the guideline. Under Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s \u201cprudent buyer\u201d principle, it was incumbent upon Avante to make such a showing. <em>See </em>Provider Reimbursement Manual, CM-Pub 15-1, \u00a7 2103. Clearly, it did not. While a fair market rate may, in some circumstances, be equal to the cap, in others it may not. Applying the logic of Avante\u2019s argument, a payment cap becomes a payment entitlement. However, because Avante did not demonstrate that payment at the cap (the salary equivalency) was both necessary and reasonable, Avante\u2019s argument fails.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We agree with Avante to the extent Avante argues that it was reasonable, as a matter of law, for Avante to use the SER to pay Southern for respiratory therapists pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">[t]he reasonable cost of the services of ... therapists [including respiratory therapists] ... furnished under arrangements ... with a provider of services ... may not exceed an amount <em>equivalent to the prevailing salary and additional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>costs </em>that would reasonably have been incurred by the provider or other organization had such services been performed <em>by such person in an employment relationship, </em>plus the cost of <em>other reasonable expenses </em>incurred by such person in furnishing services under such an arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ane\">(Emphasis added). The \u201cprevailing salary\u201d is defined as \u201cthe hourly salary based on the 75th percentile of salary ranges paid by providers in the geographical area, by type of therapy, to therapists working full time in an employment relationship.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(b)(1). The prevailing hourly salary is then adjusted by adding the \u201cstandard fringe benefit and expense factor,\u201d as defined in subsection (b)(2) of the regulation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which together produces an \u201cadjusted hourly salary equivalency,\u201d and \u201c[t]his amount is determined on a periodic basis for appropriate geographical areas.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(b)(3). A \u201cstandard travel allowance\u201d is also accounted for, \u201cin addition to the adjusted hourly salary equivalency amount.\u201d 42 C.F.R.\u00a7 413.106(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The SER guidelines \u201care the amounts published by [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services] reflecting the application of [42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(b)(1) through (b)(4), as described above] to an individual therapy service and a geographical area.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(b)(6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tion then provides in subsection (c): <em>\u201cUntil </em>a guideline is issued for a specific therapy or discipline, costs are evaluated so that such costs do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would pay for the given service.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(c)(6) (emphasis added). The plain import of this language is that, once a guideline amount has been established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a specific therapy, it supplants an agency\u2019s regulatory authority to require a provider to prove that paying the SER to an outside entity for the particular service was prudent. <em>See New Jersey Speech-Language-Hearing Ass\u2019n v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>551 F.Supp. 1024, 1027 (D.N.J.1982) (holding that, because SER guidelines had \u201cnot yet [been] issued for occupational therapy and speech therapy services\u201d pursuant to the predecessor to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106, the intermediaries were \u201ctherefore required to use the \u2018prudent buyer principle\u2019 to determine the reasonableness of expenditures for speech therapy provided under arrangement\u201d). DMAS has cited no authority holding otherwise, nor have we found any. Because the SER for respiratory therapists in Virginia had been issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for all times relevant to this appeal, Avante\u2019s use of that rate to pay Southern for those services was thus reasonable <em>per se, </em>as Avante asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Our reading of the relevant provisions of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106 is reinforced by the fact that there is no mechanism in the regulation for requiring a provider to prove it acted prudently (and thus reasonably) in paying the SER to an outside entity for therapy services; yet, there is a procedure in the regulation under which a provider may demonstrate, based on \u201cunique circumstances or special labor market conditions,\u201d that \u201cthe costs for therapy services established by the [SER] guideline amounts are <em>inappropriate </em>to [that] particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>lar provider.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 418.106(f)(1) (emphasis added); <em>see Grancare, Inc. v. Shalala, </em>93 F.Supp.2d 24, 30 (D.D.C.2000) <em>(\u201cA </em>provider could escape application of a limit imposed by a[SER] guideline only by demonstrating, in a trial-like proceeding, the existence of unusual circumstances that resulted in an efficient provider incurring costs above the standard payment rate.\u201d) (citing 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(f)). As explained in <em>Bedford Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, </em>766 F.2d 321 (7th Cir.1985), under this \u201cexception\u201d to the application of the SER guideline amounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">Once a provider establishes a prima facie case that the going rate for [the particular] therapy or other services in the area is higher than the guidelines, the intermediary is to survey the other providers in the area to determine what the going rate is for the particular specialist. This survey should include similarly situated providers. Thus, the intermediary\u2019s ultimate decision as to the extent of the reasonable costs is made by assessing the applicant\u2019s costs vis-avis other providers in the relevant area, not on the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 324 (citing Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part 1, \u00a7 1414.2). No such survey is authorized under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106(f)(1), or addressed in the Provider Reimbursement Manual, for use as a basis of supporting a government agency\u2019s decision to reject the SER as a reasonable cost for therapy services obtained by a provider \u201cunder arrangement\u201d with an outsider entity, i.e., rejection of the SER because it was purportedly too high, rather than too low. DMAS therefore erred in using its survey of the two nursing facilities in the northern Virginia area for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">DMAS, moreover, ultimately erred in its interpretation and application of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106 by concluding in its final agency decisions that Avante\u2019s use of the SER to pay Southern for those services was not reasonable <em>per se </em>and that Avante was, therefore, not entitled to Medicaid cost reimbursements based on the SER in DMAS\u2019s FY 2002 and FY 2003 cost settlements. <em>See General Elec. Co. v. United States EPA, </em>53 F.3d 1324, 1330 (D.C.Cir.1995) (explaining that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>government agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation is entitled to deference, but if it wishes to use that interpretation to cut off a party\u2019s right, it must give full notice of its interpretation\u201d). However, while Avante was entitled to cost reimbursements for the respiratory therapists furnished by Southern based on the SER, as evidenced by our holding under subsection II.A. above, this was true only so far as Avante\u2019s utilization of those therapists in its specialized care units was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of DMAS\u2019s final agency decisions denying Avante\u2019s claims for additional Medicaid cost reimbursements for FY 2002 and FY 2003, and remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to return the case to DMAS for reconsideration of its decisions consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. At all relevant times, Avante Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, owned and operated the four nursing home facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. <em>See also Fralin v. Kozlowski, </em>18 Va.App. 697, 699, 447 S.E.2d 238, 239 (1994) (explaining that \u2018\u2018[t]he Virginia Medicaid program is authorized under the federal Medicare statute,\u201d and \"is governed by a comprehensive statutory scheme structured to reimburse reasonable costs incurred by qualified providers of health services to Medicare and Medicaid patients\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. The terms \"settled\u201d and \"settlement\u201d in reference to costs in this context do not denote an agreement between DMAS and the provider, but rather DMAS\u2019s own determination as to whether a provider was underpaid or overpaid for the costs of the services provided in the fiscal year under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\">.

Because of our rulings on Avante\u2019s arguments regarding those errors of law and remand of this case for reconsideration, we need not address Avante's other arguments that DMAS\u2019s decisions were not supported by substantial evidence and that the circuit court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. We are not ruling, however, upon the <em>actual </em>number of respiratory therapists that should have been present at each of Avante\u2019s specialized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>care units during each twenty-four-hour period based on the actual patient population. Such a ruling would involve, <em>inter alia, </em>a review of medical standards of care applicable to the particular number and mix of both ventilator and tracheostomy dependent patients at each of the units. <em>See </em>12 VAC 30-60-40(A). Only limited evidence was presented on that issue in Avante's two formal evidentiary hearings. Thus, in light of our construction of 12 VAC 30-60-40 and 12 VAC 30-60-320, and remand of this case to DMAS for reconsideration, DMAS may desire to receive additional evidence on this medical issue as it relates to Avante's reimbursement of costs. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4029.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">.

Consequently, when one compares the SER to the \"in-house\" cost of a therapist on strictly an hourly basis at the market rate, the SER will by definition be significantly higher; but that amounts to comparing the proverbial \"apples to oranges,\" as DMAS\u2019s Medicaid Settlement Reimbursement Manager, James Branham, acknowledged during his testimony. Only after applying the fringe benefits and other expenses to the in-house hourly wage, as are factored into the SER, is there something close to an \"apples to apples\u201d comparison\u2014thusly explaining the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the term \"salary <em>equivalency \u201d </em>rate in describing the rates set forth in the federal guidelines. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.106 (emphasis added).
