Specifically, appellants contend that the circuit court erred in (1) reversing the Virginia State Water Control Board (\u201cSWCB\u201d) and holding that the SWCB had not followed federal law as required by a state regulation where the SWCB had reasonably deferred to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) interpretation of federal law and its own regulations; (2) reversing the SWCB based upon the circuit court\u2019s own independent reading of EPA regulations contrary to the EPA comment letter construing its own regulations and the EPA\u2019s consistent past practice which appellants contend were entitled to, but not given, great deference by the circuit court; and (3) finding <em>de novo </em>that the waste heat treatment facility (\u201cWHTF\u201d) is a \u201ccooling lake\u201d or \u201ccooling pond\u201d within the meaning of the former federal regulations rather than remanding for further factual determinations by the SWCB. For the following reasons, we agree with appellants and reverse the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The record in this case is voluminous and complex, but the facts relevant to the issues before us on appeal are relatively straightforward and are essentially as follows. In 1971, Lake Anna<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was formed by the creation of a dam across the main stem of the North Anna River in Louisa and Spotsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>counties to provide cooling water to NANPS, a nuclear power station that produces electricity by steam turbine generators. NANPS went into operation in 1978. The impounded water is divided into two sections. Lake Anna contains a large 9,600 acre reservoir that was filled by December 1972. The WHTF is comprised of 3,400 acres subdivided further by dams into three \u201clagoons.\u201d The purpose of the WHTF is to allow the heated water condensed from the steam turbines from NANPS to cool to ambient temperature by flowing from one \u201clagoon\u201d to the next prior to its discharge into Lake Anna.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Since 1977, Dominion has obtained a series of five-year Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cVPDES\u201d) permits from the SWCB to discharge water from the WHTF into Lake Anna. The SWCB has consistently taken the position in the permit that a separate permit was not required for the discharge of heated water from NANPS into the WHTF because it classified the WHTF as a \u201cwaste treatment system\u201d falling under an exception in the federal Clean Water Act, EPA regulations, and state regulations for waste treatment systems.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">On June 28, 2005, Dominion applied for the reissuance of the VPDES permit with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s (\u201cDEQ\u201d) SWCB staff. In 2007, several nonprofit organizations and individuals (\u201cappellees\u201d) living near Lake Anna and the WHTF challenged the SWCB\u2019s regulation of NANPS\u2019s thermal discharges in the permit, and specifically challenged the reissuance of the permit on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the discharges from NANPS into the WHTF required a separate permit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The DEQ requested an official advisory opinion from the Attorney General of Virginia on this issue in compliance with Code \u00a7 2.2-505.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General\u2019s opinion, which he released on November 30, 2006, stated that the SWCB did not have \u201clegal authorization to impose limitations on thermal effluent involved in discharges by [NANPS]\u201d into the WHTF because the waste treatment system exception in 9 VAC 25-31-10 excludes the WHTF from the discharge permit regulations. In addition, he noted that the SWCB had historically declined to regulate the WHTF; and further, if there was any requirement for interpretation of the regulation, the agency\u2019s interpretation was entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d unless it was arbitrary and capricious. The Attorney General also noted that the federal waste treatment system exception specifically excluded \u201ccooling ponds\u201d unlike the state waste treatment system exception, but that the EPA had approved the SWCB regulations, which did not contain this exclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>On September 20, 2007, the EPA\u2019s Region III Director of the Water Protection Division submitted a comment to the proposed VPDES permit by letter (\u201cEPA Letter\u201d) to the DEQ. In the EPA Letter, the director specifically stated \u201c[fjollowing this review, and in the exercise of EPA\u2019s discretion in NPDES permit oversight matters, EPA does not object to [ ]DEQ\u2019s issuance of the North Anna VPDES permit.\u201d The director also noted the DEQ\u2019s determination that the WHTF is a \u201cwaste heat treatment facility\u201d subject to the waste treatment system exception, the Attorney General\u2019s confirmation of the DEQ\u2019s determination that the WHTF was subject to the exception, and the history of the federal regulation and exception. The EPA director then concluded that the \u201cEPA is not objecting to [JDEQ\u2019s determination on the <em>regulatory status </em>of the [WHTF].\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">On October 25, 2007, the SWCB reissued the NANPS permit without regulating the discharge of heated water from NANPS into the WHTF. Appellees then pursued an appeal of right under the Virginia Administrative Process Act to the circuit court. On February 20, 2009, the circuit court determined that Virginia law required regulation of the discharges from the power plant into the WHTF because the waste treatment system exception contained in the EPA regulations did not apply to the WHTF. The circuit court specifically held that the exception is inapplicable because the WHTF is a \u201ccooling lake,\u201d which is included in the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>On February 27, 2009, appellants filed a joint motion for reconsideration of the February 20, 2009 ruling in light of <em>Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition v. Aracoma Coal Co., </em>556 F.3d 177 (4th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, 78 </em>U.S.L.W. 3099 (U.S. Aug. 26, 2009) (No. 09-247), a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which upheld the application of the federal waste treatment system exception to systems created in waters of the United States for salt mining purposes. However, the circuit court disagreed, and in its June 8, 2009 order held that the factual differences between this case and <em>Ohio Valley </em>warranted a different conclusion. Specifically, the circuit court reasoned that the SWCB\u2019s application of the waste treatment system exception in this case was inconsistent with federal regulations, and not entitled to deference because a state agency\u2019s discretion \u201ccannot be exercised in a manner \u2018inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On September 14, 2009, the circuit court entered the final order holding that Virginia law required state regulation of the WHTF consistent with the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of federal EPA regulations. Specifically, the circuit court held that the SWCB was required to regulate the discharge of heated water from NANPS into the WHTF due to the fact that the WHTF is a \u201cwater[ ] of the United States\u201d as defined by federal regulation; and because the circuit court classified the WHTF as a \u201ccooling lake,\u201d it held that the WHTF does not fall under the \u201cwaste treatment systems\u201d exemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Thus, the circuit court held the SWCB erred as a matter of law in declining regulatory jurisdiction over the WHTF. In declining to regulate the WHTF, the circuit court held that the SWCB, when it reissued the NANPS permit, violated Virginia State Water Control Law VPDES regulations, and relevant portions of the Clean Water Act. More specifically, the circuit court held that \u201cto the extent the state is protecting less than what is protected by the C[lean] W[ater] A[ct], the state is violating state law.\u201d The circuit court then remanded the permit back to the SWCB for further proceedings consistent with its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in (1) finding the SWCB erred by failing to conduct an independent assessment of compliance with federal law and in deferring to the EPA Letter; (2) failing to defer to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of federal law by reaching the merits of the meaning of federal law and misapprehending that law; (3) failing to accord the appropriate deference to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of federal regulations by concluding that the federal exception does not apply; and (4) remanding and directing the SWCB to issue the permit pursuant to its <em>de novo </em>determinations. Essentially, appellants contend that the circuit court erred in the standard of review it applied with respect to the SWCB\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, and the standard of review it applied to SWCB\u2019s deference to the EPA Letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4027 of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cVAPA\u201d) authorizes judicial review of an agency decision. Under VAPA, the circuit court reviews an agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201c \u2018equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>an appeal from a trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>J.P. v.

Nicely, </em>12 Va.App. 1051, 1061-62, 408 S.E.2d 545, 551 (1991)). \u201cIn this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Gordon v.

[w]hether the agency had sufficient evidential support for its findings of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On reviewing the claims of error, an agency\u2019s factual determination is given substantial judicial deference, and is reviewed \u201conly for whether they have support in substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazloumi v.

An agency\u2019s \u201clegal interpretations of statutes\u201d is accorded no deference because \u201c[w]e have long held that \u2018pure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary,\u2019 and thus, Virginia courts \u2018do not delegate that task to executive agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>The Mattaponi Indian Tribe v.

The Circuit Court\u2019s Deference to the SWCB</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in finding the SWCB erred in relying on the EPA Letter and had a duty under state law to independently construe the EPA\u2019s regulations, thus creating an obligation for the SWCB that is not in federal or state law. Specifically, appellants contend that the SWCB had no duty to make an independent assessment of the federal Clean Water Act and its attendant regulations, since neither state nor federal law give the SWCB the right, power, or obligation to make such an independent assessment. Appellants further contend that the SWCB\u2019s deference to the EPA Letter construing the EPA\u2019s own regulations is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Finally, appellants maintain that even assuming the circuit court properly reached the merits of the meaning of federal law, it misapprehended federal law without giving proper deference to the EPA\u2019s interpretation when it determined that \u201ccooling lakes\u201d and \u201ccooling ponds\u201d are excluded from the federal waste treatment system exception. Furthermore, appellants allege the circuit court did not give proper deference to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the federal regulation when it held that the exception does not apply to \u201ccooling lakes\u201d or \u201ccooling ponds.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>First, we note that the requirement that a VPDES permit be \u201cissued by the [SWCB] pursuant to the Clean Water Act and the State Water Control Law\u201d is a regulatory requirement and not a statutory one. 9 VAC 25-31-20. Thus, reviewing courts must give special weight to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, and interfere only if its interpretation is arbitrary or capricious constituting a clear abuse of its delegated discretion. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd., </em>6 Va.App. at 243-44, 369 S.E.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In turning to the permit program and the requirements of the SWCB, we note this case is one of first impression in Virginia, and, thus, we must look closely at the interplay between the SWCB and the EPA, and the \u201cdelicate partnership\u201d between the two in eliminating water pollution. <em>Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. Va. State Water Control Board, </em>495 F.Supp. 1229, 1232 (E.D.Va.1980) (\u201cThe [Clean Water Act], in general, and the NPDES program, in particular, thus join the state and federal governments in a \u2018delicate partnership\u2019 endeavoring to control and eventually eliminate water pollution.\u201d (quoting <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v.

Since the enactment of the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq., in 1972, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permit is required under federal law for discharges into navigable \u201cwaters of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>States.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, Virginia State Water Control Law, Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.2 to -44.34:28, requires a VPDES permit for the discharge of pollutants into \u201cstate waters.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.5(A)(1). However, both federal and state law include a \u201cwaste treatment system\u201d exception which, if applicable, eliminates the need for an additional permit for discharge of pollutants into either \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d or \u201cstate waters.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.2<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; 9 VAC 25-31-10.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Clean Water Act and federal regulations allow states to administer their own NPDES program in place of the federal program once the state program is approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the EPA, authorized under state law, and has standards that are at least as stringent as federal standards. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(b) &amp; (c)(1) (2000); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.1(a)(2).

The EPA has a review function in that the state must submit NPDES permit applications to the Administrator for his consideration. The Administrator may, within ninety days prevent the issuance of a permit by exercising his veto, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(d); or, the Administrator may acquiesce in a permit\u2019s issuance; which decision is totally discretionary and unreviewable. <em>Mianus River Preservation Committee v.

The permitting process under \u00a7 402(b) is, for the most part, undeniably a state program. <em>District of Columbia v. Schramm, </em>631 F.2d 854 (D.C.Cir.1980). The state character of an approved NPDES program is so strong, moreover, that the state\u2019s assumption of that responsibility is not viewed as a delegation of federal authority. H.R.Rep.

In making its final determination, the SWCB had before it voluminous information from the DEQ staff as well as the materials and comments presented at the public hearing. The SWCB also had the legal opinion it requested from the Attorney General in which he concluded that the SWCB was without jurisdiction to separately regulate the WHTF; and it had the EPA Letter noting the issue of the WHTF\u2019s regulatory status, the previous history of its treatment under federal regulations and the EPA, and the EPA\u2019s ultimately not objecting to the reissuance of the permit. In addition, the SWCB had the benefit of the past twenty years\u2019 history of the SWCB holding the WHTF as falling under the waste heat treatment system exception under EPA regulations and state regulations, and the recommendation of the DEQ to reissue the permit without regulating the WHTF.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Further, to the extent that the SWCB relied on the EPA Letter in determining compliance with the Clean Water Act and federal regulations implementing it, its reliance was not arbitrary or capricious in light of the \u201cdelicate partnership\u201d and the EPA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. As noted above, the EPA plays a supervisory role in the VPDES/ NPDES permit process that is limited to \u201c[r]eview of the permit applications submitted to the EPA and oversight to insure compliance with the [Clean Water] Act subject to decertification of the program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the EPA Letter, the EPA went through the regulatory history of the federal waste treatment system exemption and noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADU\">To date, there has been no additional federal rulemaking to clarify whether, or under what circumstances, the \u201cwaste treatment system\u201d [exception] may include cooling ponds, lakes, or lagoons that are created in waters of the United States, or that result from the impoundment of waters of the United States. Thus, NPDES permitting authorities, both EPA and approved states, have some discretion in determining whether particular cooling water impound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ments qualify for the \u201cwaste treatment system\u201d [exception] from the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d EPA recognizes that this regulatory background may present difficult, case-specific issues in applying the \u201cwaste treatment system\u201d [exception] to cooling water impoundments. However, given the above-recited permitting and regulatory history, and circumstances of the creation and continuing use of the cooling lagoons to treat the thermal discharge from [NANPS], EPA is not objecting to VaDEQ\u2019s determination on the regulatory status of the cooling lagoons/WHTF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In light of the EPA\u2019s oversight requirement to ensure state compliance with the Clean Water Act, and the interplay between the EPA and the SWCB as set forth in the MOU, the SWCB did not err to the extent it deferred to the federal agency\u2019s determination of the permit\u2019s compliance with federal law to support its conclusion that the permit was issued \u201cpursuant to the Clean Water Act.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9P\">Therefore, we hold that the SWCB\u2019s decision not to regulate the WHTF based on its determination that it fell under the \u201cwaste heat treatment system\u201d exemption was not arbitrary or capricious constituting an abuse of its delegated discretion, and, thus, the circuit court erred in not according deference to the SWCB in its construction of its own regulations and erred further in not permitting the SWCB to defer to the EPA\u2019s construction of federal regulations. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court on that basis. Because we hold that the SWCB\u2019s interpretation of its regulations was not arbitrary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>capricious, we need not reach the merits of appellants\u2019 alternative argument that if the SWCB erred, the circuit court should have remanded the case back to the SWCB for it to independently apply the federal regulations to the record before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">III.
