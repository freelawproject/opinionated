FELTON, JR., Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Following a bench trial, Antwain Levelle Harris (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted of driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301. Appellant contends the trial court erred in doing so. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The evidence proved that on April 20, 2008 appellant was charged with driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense. At trial, the parties stipulated that appellant had previously been convicted of driving on a suspended license on December 21, 1998 and October 3, 2000 in violation of a City of Danville ordinance \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Code \u00a7 46.2-301. The record also showed that appellant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>convicted of driving on a suspended license on September 2, 2007 in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to convict him of driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense. He asserts that he had been convicted of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) on only one prior occasion and that his two prior convictions for driving on a suspended license under a substantially similar Danville city ordinance cannot be used to enhance punishment pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-301(C). Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-301 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">B. Except as provided in [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-304 and 46.2-357, no resident or nonresident (i) whose driver\u2019s license ... has been suspended or revoked or (ii) who has been directed not to drive by any court ..., or (iii) who has been forbidden, as prescribed by operation of any statute of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar ordinance of any county, city or town, to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth shall thereafter drive any motor vehicle ... on any highway in the Commonwealth until the period of such suspension or revocation has terminated or the privilege has been reinstated or a restricted license is issued____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">C. A violation of subsection B is a Class 1 misdemeanor. A third or subsequent offense occurring within a 10-year period shall include a mandatory minimum term of confinement in jail of 10 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-301(0 classifies driving on a suspended license as a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, \u201c[a] third or subsequent offense occurring within a 10-year period shall include a mandatory minimum term of confinement in jail of 10 days.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">\u201cUnder basic rules of statutory construction, we examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases. When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. We must determine the General Assembly\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>intent from the words appearing in the statute, unless a literal construction of the statute would yield an absurd result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 407, 450, 611 S.E.2d 631, 653 (2005) (quoting <em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001)). \u201c[A] statute should be read to give reasonable effect to the words used \u2018and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Viewing Code \u00a7 46.2-301 in its entirety, we conclude the enhanced punishment provision in subsection C, on proof of three or more offenses of driving on a suspended license, necessarily encompasses violation of a \u201csubstantially similar [local] ordinance.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B); <em>see also Shreve v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 541, 546, 605 S.E.2d 780, 782 (2004) (\u201c \u2018the intention of the legislature is to be gathered from a view of the whole and every part of the statute taken and compared together\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918))).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The evidence proved that appellant had been convicted of driving on a suspended license on three prior occasions, once on a charge of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) and twice on charges of violating a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d ordinance under Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B). Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in convicting appellant of driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense, nor did it err in sentencing appellant to a mandatory minimum of ten days incarceration pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-301(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"A_r\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">. We do not find it necessary to evaluate the legislature\u2019s use of the word \"offense\u201d rather than \"conviction\u201d as the trial court did, as the statute itself expressly lists \"substantially similar [local] ordinance\u201d in subsection B under which a person is subject to conviction under the statute.
