On appeal, appellant argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove he committed aggravated sexual battery because the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant forced the victim to touch his intimate parts. Specifically, appellant argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 requires the use of actual force to establish sexual abuse when the complaining witness is mentally incapacitated. We hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 does not require the use of actual force under these circumstances. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). Viewed through this evidentiary prism, the evidence established that J.A., a forty-four-year-old man with Down\u2019s Syndrome, touched appellant\u2019s penis on February 5, 2008. At that time, J.A. was a client at Blue Ridge Opportunities (Blue Ridge), a facility that provides vocational and social training for mentally disabled adults and students.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">On February 5, 2008, J.A. left Blue Ridge at approximately 9:15 a.m. for his work assignment at a nearby business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Candy Lamb (Lamb), the program director at Blue Ridge, went outside shortly after J.A. departed and saw him talking to a man in the Blue Ridge parking lot. This man was later identified as appellant. Lamb approached J.A. and told him that he needed to go to work. J.A. assented and began walking away from Blue Ridge. Lamb asked appellant if she could help him, and appellant responded that he was waiting for the pawnshop to open for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Lamb went back to her workplace, but continued to watch J.A. from the door of the facility. She saw appellant pursue and ultimately catch up with J.A. The two men crossed the street together and entered an alley. Concerned for J.A.\u2019s safety, Lamb went back outside and walked toward the alley. When she was standing approximately eighteen feet from appellant and J.A., she shouted at J.A. to come over to her. At this time, J.A. was facing Lamb, and appellant stood between them, with his back to Lamb and the street. J.A. walked over to Lamb, and appellant turned towards her. Lamb could see that appellant\u2019s pants were undone and that his penis was exposed. Lamb and J.A. went back to Blue Ridge and called the police. Lamb did not see J.A touch appellant nor did she see appellant touch J.A. during this encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">After the police found appellant at a local business, appellant agreed to accompany them to the police station. Corporal S. Mauck formally Mirandized appellant and interviewed him regarding his earlier interaction with J.A. Corporal Mauck testified that a slight odor of alcohol emanated from appellant\u2019s person during the interview. Appellant claimed he had a \u201ccouple shots of bourbon and some wine\u201d that morning. During the interview, Corporal Mauck told appellant that he had been seen near Blue Ridge, which the corporal referred to as a \u201cschool for handicapped people.\u201d He also informed appellant that both J.A. and an employee at the school told Corporal Mauck that appellant had exposed himself in the alley near Blue Ridge. Corporal Mauck repeatedly told appellant that he knew that \u201ca handicapped boy\u201d had touched appellant\u2019s penis. Appellant repeatedly denied any involve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ment with the \u201chandicapped boy.\u201d After being pressed on the issue, appellant stated numerous times that if any touching did occur, he \u201cwas sorry.\u201d Appellant said that his mind was \u201cconfused,\u201d presumably from his consumption of alcohol. After Corporal Mauck told appellant that only guilty individuals apologized for their actions, appellant stated that J.A. \u201ctalked [him] into it,\u201d by offering to \u201cplay with\u201d appellant\u2019s penis in exchange for money to buy a soda. According to appellant, when appellant agreed to J.A.\u2019s proposition, J.A. unzipped appellant\u2019s pants and touched appellant\u2019s penis. Subsequently, appellant demonstrated how J.A. touched appellant\u2019s penis. Additionally, he claimed that he was unaware that J.A. was mentally disabled, and asserted that he was not sure if J.A. was male or female. Appellant\u2019s statement was recorded and viewed by the trial court during appellant\u2019s bench trial for aggravated sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In addition to Lamb\u2019s testimony and appellant\u2019s taped statement, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of J.A.\u2019s sister and legal guardian, Caroline Jo Johnson (Johnson), and Kathy Wolfe-Heberle (Wolfe-Heberle), Blue Ridge\u2019s president, during the trial. According to Wolfe-Heberle, J.A. was \u201cseverely mentally retarded\u201d and possessed the functional ability of a child between the ages of five and ten years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Johnson testified that she became J.A.\u2019s primary caretaker in November 2006, when J.A. moved in with Johnson and her husband. As J.A.\u2019s legal guardian, Johnson was responsible for taking care of his needs, managing his finances, and providing reports to Social Services regarding his well-being. Johnson described her brother\u2019s ability to take care of his personal hygiene. While he could bathe himself, Johnson had to take care of many other tasks, such as helping him into the shower, turning on the water, and providing him with towels and washcloths. She washed his hair and trimmed his fingernails and toenails. J.A. was able to perform simple chores like making his bed, and he was able to follow Johnson\u2019s simple directions. Johnson explained that if she asked J.A. to complete multiple tasks at once, he was unable to remember all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Johnson testified that J.A. enjoyed coloring with crayons in children\u2019s coloring books and watching the same television shows that he enjoyed as a child, such as <em>I Love Lucy </em>and <em>The Brady Bunch. </em>Johnson stated that he had never shown any interest in more mature programming. Additionally, Johnson testified that J.A. lacked initiative. Specifically, she stated that J.A. would follow directions given to him by other adults, even if they were strangers, and that he was unable to negotiate for a reward in exchange for following directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Finally, Johnson testified that J.A. had not expressed an interest in sex since he began living with her in 2006. She stated that her brother\u2019s genitals had never developed and that he had no underarm or facial hair. Johnson had never seen J.A. sexually aroused, and she had never seen evidence of nocturnal emissions or other discharges while cleaning his laundry. She stated that J.A. had a \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d whom he saw once a year. J.A. spoke to his girlfriend on the telephone, and either Johnson or J.A.\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s mother chaperoned their dates. Johnson said the couple held hands and J.A. sometimes kissed his girlfriend on the cheek or hugged her while saying goodbye.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Wolfe-Heberle, a Qualified Mental Health Retardation Professional certified through Virginia\u2019s Department of Mental Health Retardation and Substance Abuse Services, qualified as an expert in \u201cthe cognitive abilities of individuals suffering from mental retardation,\u201d and the trial court allowed her to testify regarding J.A.\u2019s functional capacity and his understanding of sexual acts. For the two-and-one-half years preceding J.A.\u2019s interaction with appellant, Wolfe-Heberle oversaw J.A\u2019s treatment plan at Blue Ridge. One aspect of Blue Ridge\u2019s training plan involved functional assessments of the facility\u2019s clients. Wolfe-Heberle classified J.A.\u2019s level of mental retardation as \u201cin the upper end of severe\u201d mental retardation, and she stated that he was not able to live independently. She stated that J.A lacked the ability to perform complex reasoning or understand complicated logic. Notably, Wolfe-Heberle stated that J.A. was not capable of negotiating. Specifically, she explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>[J.A.] does not have the ability to negotiate. He doesn\u2019t understand that process at all____I can tell [J.A.], if you do this[,] I mil give you a cookie. He understands what a reward is. But, rewards are different than the negotiation process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">[J.A.] does not have the ability to come to me and say, \u201cKathy, if you do this[,] then I will give you this.\u201d It is not reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Wolfe-Heberle stated that J.A. did not understand the concept of money, except for the fact that he needed \u201ctwo quarters to get a soda out of the [vending] machine.\u201d According to Wolfe-Heberle, J.A. purchased cans of sodas from a vending machine near the alley where Lamb had seen J.A. and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Finally, Wolfe-Heberle stated that J.A. did not have an understanding of sex or the nature and consequence of sex acts of any type. J.A. never expressed an interest in sex and never showed any interest in touching of a sexual nature. Wolfe-Heberle testified that J.A. had \u201cno concept or no clue even to use the word \u2018penis.\u2019 He does not understand what the word is. So, he is not aware that [the penis has a sexual function].\u201d Wolfe-Heberle stated that for J.A., \u201c[t]he penis is used to pee. The penis is not used for sex.\u201d Wolfe-Heberle acknowledged that J.A. participated in Blue Ridge\u2019s sexual education program, by attending group discussions about condoms and sexually transmitted diseases, but \u201che [did not] have any understanding of what it mean[t].\u201d During one such session, Wolfe-Heberle showed the group how to put a condom on a cucumber. J.A. \u201cwas kind of oblivious to the entire conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The trial court determined that J.A. was incompetent to testify. In addition to the expert testimony and the testimony of Johnson and Lamb, the Commonwealth presented color photographs of J.A. The Commonwealth stated that the purpose of admitting the photographs into evidence was to show that J.A. exhibited physical characteristics associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Down\u2019s Syndrome. There was no direct evidence that appellant knew that J.A. was mentally incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Appellant moved to strike the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and at the close of all of the evidence. Appellant argued that Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.3 and 18.2-67.10 required the Commonwealth to prove that appellant used actual force to make J.A. touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts. Preliminarily, the trial court rejected appellant\u2019s assertion that J.A. offered to touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts in exchange for money and found that J.A. touched appellant\u2019s intimate parts \u201cat the invitation\u201d of appellant. Then the trial court cited <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 31, 630 S.E.2d 291 (2006), for the proposition that the use of constructive force to accomplish a sexual touching would support a finding of guilt under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(2). The trial court held that J.A.\u2019s mental incapacitation precluded him from legally consenting to the touching of appellant\u2019s intimate parts, and therefore appellant constructively forced J.A. to touch appellant\u2019s penis. The trial court convicted appellant of aggravated sexual battery, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The trial court convicted appellant of aggravated sexual battery under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(2), which states in pertinent part: \u201cAn accused shall be guilty of aggravated sexual battery if he or she sexually abuses the complaining witness, and ... [t]he act is accomplished through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3) defines \u201cmental incapacity\u201d as the \u201ccondition of the complaining witness existing at the time of an offense ... which prevents the complaining witness from understanding the nature or consequences of the sexual act involved in such offense and about which the accused knew or should have known.\u201d Appellant does not contest on appeal that J.A.\u2019s mental retardation prevented him from \u201cunderstanding the nature or consequences of the sexual act involved in such offense\u201d; however, he denies on appeal that he knew or should have known that J.A. was mentally incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b) defines \u201csexual abuse\u201d as \u201can act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where ... [t]he accused <em>forces </em>the complaining witness to touch the accused\u2019s, the witness\u2019s own, or another person\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Appellant argues on appeal that the evidence at trial showed J.A offered to touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts, and appellant merely acquiesced to this offer. Appellant argues that to be guilty of aggravated sexual battery under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A), appellant had to accomplish an act of sexual abuse against J.A. through the use of J.A.\u2019s mental incapacity. Appellant claims that under the statute, sexual abuse only occurred if appellant \u201cforced\u201d J.A. to touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts. Appellant asserts that the fact that J.A. was mentally incapacitated does not lead to the conclusion that appellant used constructive force to accomplish the inappropriate touching. In furtherance of this argument, appellant maintains that if the General Assembly intended the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity to be considered in the determination that sexual abuse occurred, the General Assembly would have discussed the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity in the definition of sexual abuse found in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6). According to appellant, because mental incapacity is solely mentioned in the aggravated sexual battery statute, it cannot be considered in determining if sexual abuse, as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6), occurred. He contends that this Court cannot uphold appellant\u2019s conviction, because appellant merely \u201callowed J.A, who offered to play with [appellant\u2019s] privates, to touch [appellant\u2019s] privates,\u201d and this acquiescence does not constitute a use of \u201cforce\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The determination of the definition of \u201cforce\u201d as used by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b) is a question of statutory interpretation, and therefore, this Court reviews the question <em>de novo. See Johns v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 742, 746, 675 S.E.2d 211, 213 (2009) (citing <em>Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 369, 373, 672 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2009)). While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>reviewing the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>we \u201cgiv[e] deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless the findings are \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 681, 686, 594 S.E.2d 284, 287 (2004) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, 28 </em>Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 235-36 (1998)). \u201c[T]he \u2018trial judge\u2019s major role is the determination of fact, and \"with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanford v. Commonwealth, 54 </em>Va.App. 357, 359, 678 S.E.2d 842, 843 (2009) (quoting <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004)). Thus, \u201cthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995) (citing <em>Schneider v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 379, 382, 337 S.E.2d 735, 736-37 (1985); <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 528, 532, 290 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In deciding the motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the trial court found that J.A. was mentally incapacitated, that J.A. touched appellant\u2019s penis, and that the touching was at the invitation of appellant. We can infer from the trial court\u2019s ruling that the trial court made these same factual findings when convicting appellant of aggravated sexual battery. On appeal, appellant urges us to disregard the trial court\u2019s factual finding that appellant invited J.A. to participate in the sexual touching. Appellant states that \u201cthe only evidence concerning how J.A. came to touch [appellant] was [appellant\u2019s] statement that J.A. offered to play with his penis for some money.\u201d Nevertheless, it is clear from the trial court\u2019s ruling that the trial court rejected appellant\u2019s statement to the police and instead concluded that appellant invited J.A. to touch him.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">It is true that a trial court \u201c \u2018may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with the facts in the record,\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>666, 669-70, 418 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1992) (quoting <em>Hankerson v. Moody, 229 </em>Va. 270, 274, 329 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1985)); however, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s statement that J.A. offered to touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts. In weighing appellant\u2019s credibility, the trial court was entitled to consider the fact that appellant gave multiple accounts of his interaction with J.A. on the date of the offense. <em>See Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 304, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993) (acknowledging that \u201c[determining the credibility of witnesses who give conflicting accounts is within the exclusive province of the [fact finder]\u201d). Appellant first denied interacting with \u201ca handicapped boy.\u201d Later appellant said that his mind had been \u201cconfused,\u201d so he did not remember the day well, but if any inappropriate touching did happen, it was an accident for which he was sorry. Finally, appellant said that he didn\u2019t remember if he encountered a boy or a girl that day, but the person \u201ctalked [him] into\u201d the arrangement by offering to touch appellant\u2019s penis in exchange for money. Appellant then demonstrated how J.A. touched appellant\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In determining appellant\u2019s credibility, the trial court also had discretion to consider the testimony of J.A.\u2019s sister and primary caretaker, Johnson, and Wolfe-Heberle. Both women stated that J.A. did not possess the ability to negotiate, and Johnson stated that J.A. was very trusting and would obey the directions of any adult. Thus, there was evidence that contradicted appellant\u2019s assertion that J.A. initiated the touching. Because \u201c[i]n its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt,\u201d <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998) (citing <em>Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en </em>banc)), we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding appellant\u2019s version of his encounter with J.A. was fabricated and appellant was lying to conceal his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Similarly, we can infer that in finding appellant guilty of aggravated sexual battery, the trial court found appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>claim that he did not know J.A. was mentally incapacitated to be incredible. We cannot say that this determination was plainly wrong, because as previously noted, the \u201cfact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Speight, </em>4 Va.App. at 88, 354 S.E.2d at 98). Additionally, throughout the interrogation, Corporal Mauck repeatedly referred to J.A. as \u201cthe handicapped boy,\u201d a characterization that appellant did not dispute until Corporal Mauck asked him directly if he knew that J.A. was \u201chandicapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Having resolved the credibility claims appellant presents on appeal, we consider appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the application of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6) to his conduct. Again, when considering the question of law presented by this case, which we review <em>de novo, </em>we are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings, if they are not \u201c \u2018plainly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>42 Va.App. at 686, 594 S.E.2d at 287 (quoting <em>Timbers, </em>28 Va.App. at 193, 503 S.E.2d at 235-36). Appellant argues that appellant\u2019s conduct, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, did not constitute \u201csexual abuse,\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\"><em>\u201cSexual abuse </em>\u201d means an act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">a.

If the complaining witness is under the age of 13, the accused causes or assists the complaining witness to touch the accused\u2019s, the witness\u2019s own, or another person\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">d. The accused forces another person to touch the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Appellant contends that in order to be guilty of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A), the specific offensive conduct must constitute sexual abuse, which is defined without mention of the mental capacity of the victim. According to appellant, the Commonwealth was required by subsection (b) of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6) to prove appellant \u201cforce[d] the complaining witness to touch the accused\u2019s ... intimate parts ...and this force could not be proved through a mere showing that the victim was mentally incapacitated. Appellant argues that the trial court ignored both the basic principles of statutory construction and the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Martin </em>regarding the 2004 amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he province of construction is wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u2019\u201d <em>Barnett v.

Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it found that under <em>Martin, </em>a showing that J.A. was mentally incapacitated was evidence that appellant used constructive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Martin, </em>the defendant, \u201cthen fourteen years old, exposed his penis to the eight-year-old victim, asked the victim to masturbate him and, following [the defendant\u2019s] directions, the victim complied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 630 S.E.2d at 291. The defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual battery under subsection (A)(1) of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 based on his sexual abuse of the victim as defined by the 2003 version of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b). <em>Id. </em>at 34, 630 S.E.2d at 292. In 2003, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b) stated that sexual abuse occurred when \u201c[t]he accused forces the complaining witness to touch the accused\u2019s, the witness\u2019s own, or another person\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.\u201d The defendant argued in <em>Martin </em>that the Code required \u201can overt act of actual force and that, in the absence of such an act, [the defendant\u2019s] conviction [could not] be sustained.\u201d 272 Va. at 34, 630 S.E.2d at 292. The Supreme Court disagreed with the defendant, finding that Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence had long recognized \u201cthat \u2018force\u2019 may include both constructive and actual force and in the absence of any legislative definition of \u2018force,\u2019 [the Supreme Court could not] conclude that the General Assembly intended to limit the meaning of the word \u2018force\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>actual force for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 630 S.E.2d at 292 (citing <em>Waterman v. Halverson, </em>261 Va. 203, 207, 540 S.E.2d 867, 869 (2001); <em>Dodson v. Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Service, Inc., </em>241 Va. 89, 94, 400 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Supreme Court stated \u201cthat in the context of sexual crimes, an act undertaken against a victim\u2019s will and without the victim\u2019s consent is an act undertaken with force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, 252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979)). The Supreme Court turned to rape prosecutions for guidance regarding sexual abuse prosecutions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">[I]n the context of a rape prosecution, we held that constructive force exists if the victim could not legally consent to the act. <em>Stump [v. Commonwealth </em>], 137 Va. [804,] 807, 119 S.E. [72,] 73 [ (1923) ]. Proof of the absence of legal consent provides \u201call the force which the law demands as an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. (97 Hans.) 107, 111 (1886).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\"><em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded \u201c \u2018force\u2019 includes actual and constructive force and that constructive force includes engaging in proscribed conduct with a victim who is under the legal age of consent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The Supreme Court also addressed the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201c[w]here a statute proscribes certain behavior based on both the age of the victim and the fact that the act was accomplished using force, it would be incongruous to conclude that proving the victim was beneath the common-law age of consent satisfied the express requirement of proving force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 630 S.E.2d at 293 (citing <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1966-04-4, 2005 WL 2122112, *6, 2005 Va.App. LEXIS 337, at *19 (Sept. 6, 2005) (Elder, J., dissenting)). The Supreme Court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">the use of a common set of facts for proof of differing elements of a crime is [not] incongruous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">The prosecution for aggravated sexual battery in this case required a showing of sexual abuse under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(b), which includes proof of force, and a showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the victim was under 13 years of age, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(A)(1). The common factual element in this case-the age of the victim-serves as proof of both the force requirement and the age requirement. Such a circumstance is neither improper nor incongruous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 36, 630 S.E.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Finally, the <em>Martin </em>Court discussed the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6), which the defendant asserted supported the theory that actual force was necessary to establish sexual abuse under the circumstances of that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">The 2004 amendment added a new subparagraph (c) to the definition of sexual abuse set out in that statute: where the accused causes a victim under the age of thirteen to touch the intimate parts or clothing covering the intimate parts of the accused, the victim or another person. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(c). The 2004 amendment did not remove the element of force from the other actions defined as sexual abuse nor did it define \u201cforce\u201d to exclude constructive force. The substantive change effected by the 2004 amendment was the creation of a category of sexual abuse based on the age of the victim. While force is not an element of this category of sexual abuse, it does not follow that actions undertaken with constructive force could not qualify as sexual abuse under other provisions of the current statute or under the provisions of the previous statute. Therefore, we do not consider the 2004 amendment as altering the definition of force when used in the context of sexual crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 35, 630 S.E.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Appellant points to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6) \u201cdid not remove the element of force from the other actions defined as sexual abuse nor did it define \u2018force\u2019 to exclude constructive force,\u201d to argue that the fact that J.A. was mentally incapacitated alone did not prove that appellant used constructive force to accomplish the inappropriate touching.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Commonwealth did not show constructive force, as defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary: \u201cConstructive force is anything which produces fear sufficient to suspend the power of resistance and prevent the free exercise of the will. Actual force is applied to the body; constructive is by threatening words or gestures and operates on the mind.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>284 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s analysis of the Code and the case law relating to sexual abuse and mental incapacity. In particular, we find <em>Martin </em>and <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 332, 457 S.E.2d 382 (1995), instructive. Pursuant to <em>Martin, </em>the General Assembly did not \u201cintend[ ] to limit the meaning of the word \u2018force\u2019 to actual force.\u201d 272 Va. at 35, 630 S.E.2d at 292. The <em>Martin </em>Court explicitly held that \u201can act undertaken against a victim\u2019s will and without the victim\u2019s consent is an act undertaken with force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Jones, </em>219 Va. at 986, 252 S.E.2d at 373). Thus, in the context of this case, constructive force existed if J.A. could not legally consent to the sexual touching. <em>See </em>id. (citing <em>Stump, </em>137 Va. at 807, 119 S.E. at 73).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In <em>Adkins, </em>this Court held that a rape occurred in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), if the victim is mentally incapacitated as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3), such that the victim \u201cdoes not understand \u2018the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u2019\u201d <em>Adkins, </em>20 Va.App. at 343, 457 S.E.2d at 387 (citing Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3)). This Court reversed Adkins\u2019 conviction for having sexual intercourse with a mentally impaired sixteen-year-old girl through the use of her mental incapacity, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii), <em>id. </em>at 336, 457 S.E.2d at 384, after finding that although the sixteen-year-old girl suffered from a mental impairment, the Commonwealth failed to prove that she did not understand the nature or consequences of sexual intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 457 S.E.2d at 389. This Court found there was insufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>prove Adkins had sexual intercourse with the girl \u201cthrough the use of\u2019 her mental incapacity. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 457 S.E.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In interpreting the rape statute, this Court engaged in a lengthy examination of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in prohibiting sexual intercourse with an individual \u201cthrough the use of\u2019 the individual\u2019s mental incapacity. We stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">The legislative purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) is to protect persons who are mentally impaired or retarded from being sexually exploited due to their mental incapacity. <em>See State v. Ortega-Martinez, </em>[124 Wash.2d 702] 881 P.2d 231, 236 (Wash.1994) (explaining the legislative purpose of a similar statute). However, such statutes must not be interpreted and applied in a manner that creates an unintended rule that would prohibit all mentally impaired or retarded persons from engaging in consensual sexual intercourse without having their partners commit a felony. <em>See State v. Olivio, </em>[123 N.J. 550] 589 A.2d 597, 604 (N.J.1991) (expressing concern about \u201cunenlightened attitudes toward mental impairment and about the importance of according the mentally handicapped their fundamental rights\u201d). By specifically defining mental incapacity, the legislature has chosen to protect those mentally deficient persons whose mental condition prevents them from \u201cunderstanding the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 342-43, 457 S.E.2d at 387 (footnote omitted). Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 shares the legislative purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-61, which was at issue in <em>Adkins. See City of Richmond v. Confrere Club of Richmond, Va., Inc., </em>239 Va. 77, 80, 387 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1990) (\u201cLegislative intent is determined from the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d (citing <em>Marsh v. City of Richmond, </em>234 Va. 4, 11, 360 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1987); <em>Va. Dept. of Labor v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 99, 353 S.E.2d 758, 760-61 (1987); <em>Ambrogi v. Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 386, 297 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1982))). Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 also protects mentally impaired individuals, specifically those persons who lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>an \u201cunderstanding [of] the nature and consequences\u201d of sexual acts, from sexual exploitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The <em>Adkins </em>Court\u2019s narrow definition of \u201cmental incapacity\u201d and the narrow circumstances during which sexual abuse is accomplished \u201cthrough\u201d the victim\u2019s mental incapacity is also relevant to our instant analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Manifestly, the legislature did not intend to include as part of the protected class of people under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(ii) those whose mental impairment or handicap may prevent them from comprehending the more complex aspects of the nature or consequences of sexual intercourse, but who, nevertheless, have the mental capacity to have a basic understanding of the elementary and rudimentary nature and consequences of sexual intercourse. Not all persons who are mentally retarded or handicapped need the special protection of Code \u00a7 18.2\u201461(A)(ii). The range of intellectual functioning among the mentally impaired and mentally retarded varies widely. The statute was not designed to unfairly punish the sexual partners of those mentally impaired or mentally retarded persons who have a basic understanding of the act and consequences of sexual intercourse and are capable of making a volitional choice to engage or not engage in such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Adkins, </em>20 Va.App. at 345, 457 S.E.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Finally, and most pertinent to our analysis, the <em>Adkins </em>Court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">When a mentally impaired or mentally retarded person has sufficient cognitive and intellectual capacity to comprehend or appreciate that he or she is engaging in intimate or personal sexual behavior which later may have some effect or residual impact upon the person, upon the person\u2019s partner, or upon others, then the person does not have a \u201cmental incapacity\u201d within the meaning of the statute. If a person is mentally incapacitated but, nevertheless, has the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the sexual act, which understanding includes the capacity to make a volitional choice to engage or not engage in such act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>then that person\u2019s sexual partner has not violated the rape statute merely because a mentally impaired person has made an unwise decision or has chosen to be sexually active.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUY\"><em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 457 S.E.2d at 388-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The converse of the above analysis is also true. A mentally incapacitated individual may not have the \u201ccapacity to make a volitional choice to engage or not engage\u201d in a sexual act due to their lack of understanding of the nature and consequences of the sexual act. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, when an individual is mentally incapacitated under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(3), the individual is incapable of legally consenting to the sexual touching, on the grounds that \u201c[e]onsent without understanding is no consent at all.\u201d <em>Molina v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 338, 358, 624 S.E.2d 83, 92 (2006) (holding that a jury instruction regarding the victim\u2019s mental incapacitation did not prejudice the defendant in a jury trial for rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In the instant case, the trial court found that J.A. did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the sexual act. As discussed above, the evidence at trial was sufficient to support this conclusion, and therefore, as a matter of law, J.A. did not have the ability to provide legal consent to the sexual touching that appellant invited. Accordingly, appellant sexually abused J.A. by constructively forcing him to touch appellant\u2019s intimate parts, and this sexual abuse constituted aggravated sexual battery because the touching was accomplished through J.A.\u2019s mental incapacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">For the reasons stated, we find no error in the judgment of the trial court. Therefore we affirm the appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\">. Specifically, appellant argued that the Commonwealth had to show that appellant\u2019s acceptance of J.A.\u2019s offer to \"play with\u201d appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>penis constituted constructive force. As previously noted, the trial court rejected this factual account of appellant\u2019s encounter with J.A., and we will not discuss it further herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\">. As the Supreme Court found in <em>Martin, </em>\u201cthe use of a common set of facts for proof of differing elements of a crime'' is appropriate in the instant case. <em>See </em>272 Va. at 36, 630 S.E.2d at 293.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
