On appeal, Armstead contends the court should have suppressed most, if not all, of the incriminating evidence. He also claims the evidence was insufficient to support his drug convictions. Finding neither argument persuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">In addition, our examination of the record \u201cis not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>or by the trial court in its ruling.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008). In determining whether there is evidence to sustain a conviction, an appellate court must consider \u201call the evidence\u201d admitted at trial that is contained in the record. <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 108, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In July 2006, a Newport News police officer made a stop of a vehicle suspected of violating a city noise ordinance. Arm-stead was alone in the vehicle. The officer asked Armstead for his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. Armstead said he currently held a Virginia driver\u2019s license but had no type of documentary identification with him. He provided verbal information including a name, birth date, and social security number. The officer checked this information on his computer and concluded the information was likely false.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Armstead then informed the officer he was licensed in Washington D.C. The officer checked this information and determined the only driver\u2019s license associated with the name given had expired. Believing Armstead again provided false information, the officer informed him he was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">It was impossible, however, to fill out the arrest paperwork without knowing Armstead\u2019s true identity. \u201cIf there\u2019s no I.D.,\u201d the officer testified, \u201cthere\u2019s no way to verify his identity.\u201d Before leaving the scene, the officer decided to search the vehicle. At trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the officer explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">Q: And just for the purpose of the record, why was it you that [sic] placed him under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">A: I believe he was giving me false information ... someone giving me false information leads me to believe they have no intention of appearing in court, and I didn\u2019t feel like I could satisfactorily fill out the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>mons because I didn\u2019t believe with the information at the time that the subject would appear in court. I elected to take him in front of a magistrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Q: Were you ultimately able to determine who he was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Q: How did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">A: Searched the vehicle incident to arrest and located a wallet with Virginia identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">While in the vehicle, the officer observed the remains of a marijuana cigar in an open ashtray and two clear plastic bags containing 5.675 grams of crack cocaine in the center console. Another officer later seized the drugs and placed them in evidence retention bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Armstead invoked his right to counsel. The officer then placed Armstead in a police vehicle for transport to the local jail. A female walked up to the scene claiming the vehicle belonged to her. Based on her statements, the officers arrested her. Watching from the police vehicle, Armstead shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s mine, it\u2019s mine, everything in the car is mine.\u201d The officer testified Armstead \u201ccontinued constantly to scream that from the back of the marked police unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Prior to trial, Armstead filed a written motion to suppress. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor argued the officer had a right to search the vehicle incident to Armstead\u2019s arrest under settled law, citing among other cases, <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). The prosecutor focused on the probable cause justifying Arm-stead\u2019s arrest. Armstead\u2019s counsel argued the arrest was pretextual and a mere ruse to search the vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">Judge, the argument is that the information he gave came back as a valid identity in Washington, D.C. and that merely we have a fishing expedition. The officer has some desire to search the vehicle and uses that pretext that initially said this or that, and \u201cI just suspect that maybe he\u2019s not who he says he is, so I\u2019m not going to give him a summons,\u201d kind of on a whim, the argument is he\u2019s finding any excuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>search the vehicle, and the search should be declared invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding the officer had probable cause to arrest Armstead. Correctly applying then-current law, the court concluded a valid arrest <em>ipso facto </em>authorized the vehicle search. \u201cThe issue really is not what happens after the arrest,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthe issue is the ability to arrest. Clearly, once the arrest is made, somebody can search the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">At trial, Armstead testified he never shouted that everything in the vehicle belonged to him. He denied any knowledge of the cocaine and said the car belonged to the woman, his fianc\u00e9e. She testified the car was hers, but said nothing about the drugs. On cross-examination, Armstead and his fianc\u00e9e admitted they were convicted felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Sitting as factfinder, the trial court rejected Armstead\u2019s testimony and found him guilty of providing false identity information to a law enforcement officer in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, driving on a suspended or revoked operator\u2019s license (second or subsequent offense) in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute under Code \u00a7 18.2-248, and possession of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. The court entered final conviction and sentencing orders on May 1,2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Armstead filed a notice of appeal and, on July 13, 2009, moved the court to authorize bail pending appeal. At the bail hearing, Armstead\u2019s counsel argued for the first time the search of the vehicle violated the rule recently adopted by <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009). The trial court denied the request for bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress\u2014Arizona v. Gant</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOd\">On appeal, Armstead argues the trial court violated the rule recently announced in <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), when it refused to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the motion to suppress. He contends we should apply <em>Gant </em>retroactively and doing so would necessarily require the application of the exclusionary rule to his case. We do not address the exclusionary rule issue<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because \u201cthe best and narrowest ground available\u201d for decision, <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 691, 698 n. 2, 653 S.E.2d 600, 603 n. 2 (2007) (citation omitted), is the first premise of Armstead\u2019s argument\u2014that the trial court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with Gant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not believe it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Prior to <em>Gant, </em>many courts (including Virginia\u2019s appellate courts) understood <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981), to permit wholly suspicion-less searches of vehicles after a valid arrest of a recent occupant. <em>See Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 433, 513 S.E.2d 137 (1999); <em>Cason v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 728, 530 S.E.2d 920 (2000); <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 446, 482 S.E.2d 876 (1997). <em>Gant </em>rejected this broad view of <em>Belton </em>and limited vehicular searches incident to arrest to situations where (i) an unsecured arrestee is within reach of the passenger compartment of the vehicle, or (ii) it is <em>\u201creasonable to believe </em>evidence relevant to the crime of arrest <em>might </em>be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Gant, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1719 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In this respect, <em>Gant </em>addressed only the \u201ccircumstances unique to the vehicle context\u201d arising out of a \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest\u201d of a recent occupant. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Here, the officer testified he believed Armstead \u201cwas giving me false information\u201d concerning his identity and the status of his driver\u2019s license. The officer\u2019s belief was justified. Armstead initially claimed to possess a valid Virginia license and provided verbal information including a name, birth date, and social security number\u2014which proved to be false. Arm-stead then, claiming the same identity, said he had a valid D.C. license. That, too, proved to be inaccurate. Throughout the encounter, Armstead insisted he had no documentation of his identity. These circumstances established probable cause to arrest Armstead for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3, which prohibits the use of false identity information to avoid summons, arrest, or prosecution, or to impede a criminal investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The power to arrest Armstead for providing false identity information under Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3 authorized the officer to search the vehicle because it was \u201creasonable to believe\u201d the vehicle \u201cmight\u201d contain evidence of that crime, <em>Gant, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1719 (citation omitted), specifically Arm-stead\u2019s true identity and his driving status. <em>See State v. Gordon, </em>110 Or.App. 242, 821 P.2d 442, 443-44 (1991) (\u201cEvidence of defendant\u2019s identity was relevant to the crime of giving false information to an officer. Accordingly, the search of defendant\u2019s vehicle for evidence of identification was proper as a search incident to arrest.\u201d). The belief that such informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tion might be in the vehicle is particularly reasonable where, as in Virginia, a vehicle operator must always have with him a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration card. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>Gant </em>fully supports this reasoning by citing with approval <em>State v. Fesler, </em>68 Or.App. 609, 685 P.2d 1014, 1017 (1984), as an example of a case <em>correctly </em>applying the narrow view of <em>Belton. See Gant, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1721 n. 8. Like our case, <em>Fesler </em>involved a driver arrested for driving without a valid license who gave false identification information to an officer. <em>Fesler </em>held a search of the driver\u2019s vehicle, while the driver was locked in the back of the police cruiser, was valid because the \u201cofficer had probable cause to arrest defendant and charge him with driving while suspended and giving a false name.\u201d <em>Fesler, </em>68 Or.App. at 613, 685 P.2d at 1017. The vehicle search related \u201cto the offense for which defendant was arrested in two ways: it would further serve to identify defendant and, because defendant\u2019s knowledge he was suspended may be a pertinent consideration in such cases, it would further tend to show defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt if the wallet had been hidden.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">It makes no difference that the officer who arrested Armstead did not sequence his thinking in the order of these cascading legal principles. The offense establishing probable cause need not \u201cbe \u2018closely related\u2019 to, and based on the same conduct as,\u201d the offense identified by the officer at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>543 U.S. 146, 153, 125 S.Ct. 588, 594, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004); <em>see also Jordan v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 591, 596, 151 S.E.2d 390, 394 (1966). \u201cSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769,1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); <em>see Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 37, 639 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2007) (holding an officer\u2019s \u201csubjective motivation is irrelevant\u201d (citation omitted)). An officer\u2019s \u201caction is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify [the] action.\u2019\u201d <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (emphasis in original and citations omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In short, the officer had probable cause to arrest Armstead for providing false identity information in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-186.3. It was \u201creasonable to believe\u201d that Armstead\u2019s vehicle \u201cmight\u201d contain evidence of that crime. <em>See Gant, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1719 (citation omitted). During the officer\u2019s valid search for evidence of Armstead\u2019s identity, he also discovered marijuana in the open ashtray and cocaine in the center console. Under these circumstances, we hold the trial court\u2019s denial of Armstead\u2019s motion to suppress is not inconsistent with <em>Gant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIP\">Under settled principles, we review a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In this case, Armstead contends no rational factfinder could conclude the evidence proved he possessed either the cocaine or the marijuana found in the vehicle. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Constructive possession of drugs can be shown by \u201cacts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which tend to show that the accused was aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 6, 602 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2004) (citation omitted). As has been often said, \u201cin drug cases no less than any other, it \u2018is axiomatic that any fact that can be proved by direct evidence may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Etherton v. Doe, </em>268 Va. 209, 212-13, 597 S.E.2d 87, 89 (2004)). Under such circumstances, the \u201cCourt must consider the totality of the circumstances established by the evidence.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 735, 594 S.E.2d 305, 311 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Consequently, \u201coccupancy of a vehicle ... where illicit drugs are found is a circumstance that may be considered\u201d with other evidence to show constructive possession. <em>Burchette v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 432, 435, 425 S.E.2d 81, 83 (1992). \u201cFurthermore, proof that a person is in close proximity to contraband is a relevant fact\u201d that may also be taken into account by the factfinder. <em>Id.; see also Dodd v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 301, 308, 649 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2007). \u201cWhile no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u2018combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 517, 521-22, 642 S.E.2d 779, 781 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Here, the cocaine and marijuana were found in the front passenger compartment of a vehicle occupied solely by Arm-stead. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 489, 493, 364 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1988) (\u201c[defendant] was <em>within arm\u2019s reach </em>of the cocaine\u201d (emphasis in original)). The marijuana cigar was in plain view in an open ashtray. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 1, 9-10, 421 S.E.2d 877, 883 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (taking into account the open visibility of the drugs found \u201con the dashboard in plain view\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While seated in the police vehicle, Armstead emphatically shouted that everything in the vehicle belonged to him. The timing and emphasis of his shouting, a factfinder could reasonably infer, suggests Armstead was motivated by a desire (albeit both spontaneous and short-lived) to exculpate his fianc\u00e9e from any inference the drugs belonged to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Even though Armstead denied his earlier statements to the officer that the contents found within the car belonged to him, the trial court, sitting as factfinder, was at liberty to discount Armstead\u2019s self-serving statements as little more than lying to \u201cconceal his guilt,\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 19, 25, 660 S.E.2d 687, 690 (2008) (citation omitted), and could treat such prevarications as \u201caffirmative evidence of guilt,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 296, 112 S.Ct 2482, 2492, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992)). This principle naturally follows from the broader observation that \u201cwhenever a witness testifies, his or her credibility becomes an issue.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 448, 462, 573 S.E.2d 324, 330 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>For these reasons, ample evidence supports the rationality of Armstead\u2019s convictions for possessing both the marijuana and cocaine found in the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Because the trial court did not err by denying Armstead\u2019s motion to suppress or by finding him guilty as charged, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>10</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. \"When affirming a trial court's denial of a suppression motion, we consider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Testa v.

Thus, faced with a suppression motion, a court should not limit itself \u201cto what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale,\u201d <em>Raab v.
