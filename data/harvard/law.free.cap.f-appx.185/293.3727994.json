We vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-22\">Turner claims the district court erred by applying the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, the imposition of a sentence under the mandatory guidelines regime was error. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769; <em>see also United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216-17 (4th Cir.2005). This court explained in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), that sentencing under a mandatory regime is \u201ca separate class of error ... distinct from the Sixth Amendment claim that gave rise to the decision in <em>Booker.\u201d Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 553. The court recognized that \u201c[t]his error ... may be asserted even by defendants whose sentences do not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such is the case here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-23\">As Turner raised a timely objection under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), he has preserved his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, we review his claim for harmless error, which places \u201cthe burden ... on the Government to show that such an error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. The Government concedes that it cannot show the error was harmless and cannot satisfy its burden of showing the error did not affect Turner\u2019s substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>rights. There is no indication from the record how the district court would sentence Turner under the current advisory guidelines system. Therefore, Turner must be resentenced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Turner\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-20\">. While the district court sentenced Turner using a higher drug quantity than he admitted, no Sixth Amendment error occurred because the sentence imposed was less than the maximum sentence that would have been authorized under the Guidelines by the drug quantity Turner admitted, absent the downward adjustment Turner received for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"><em>. </em>Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. <em>4, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Turner's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
