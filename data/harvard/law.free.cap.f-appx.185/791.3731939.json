The sentence was composed of concurrent terms of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts One and Two, and 36 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-17\">Joseph was deported to Haiti based on his cocaine conviction. He was arrested attempting to reenter the United States illegally with a fraudulent passport. Joseph argues on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). His argument is based largely upon his claim that his case involved \u201cunique circumstances\u201d in that he attempted to enter the United States because he was receiving threats in Haiti.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-18\">Sentences imposed under an advisory Guidelines system are reviewed for unreasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>dant\u2019s Guidelines range, and then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) facts or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s statement that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Joseph acknowledged below that the district court properly calculated the applicable advisory range under the Guidelines, and does not dispute the calculation on appeal. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. Joseph\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">At Joseph\u2019s sentencing hearing, which occurred after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Booker, </em>the district court heard mitigating factors as to his crime, criminal and personal history, and family situation. The court stated that it reached the 46-month total sentence after calculating the Guidelines range and applying it in an advisory manner. It specified that it reached the sentence after considering, among other things, the unique circumstances of the case, including the reasons Joseph committed the crimes, his criminal history, and the nature and seriousness of the crimes. In fact, Joseph attempted to reenter the United States illegally shortly after deportation while still on supervised release for his prior cocaine offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">The district court accepted as true Joseph\u2019s representations as to his situation in Haiti and acknowledged that \u201c[fit\u2019s a difficult time in that country.\u201d The court also stated that it understood that he \u201cwant[ed] to be back here with [his] family and five in some relative safety.\u201d However, it found that Joseph had previously committed \u201ca serious crime,\u201d specifically, importing cocaine, and was aware that he was not to return to the United States. The district court found that the 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), in particular, was warranted in light of the recent nature of Joseph\u2019s deportation. It stated that the instant offenses were \u201cmajor violations of the law,\u201d and that he could have pursued other options even though that \u201cmight have been difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Accordingly, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and conducted a proper reasonableness inquiry. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Furthermore, the total term of imprisonment imposed, 46 months, is at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range and is far lower that the aggregate statutory maximum sentence available to the district court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2); 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1543.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we cannot say the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Thus, we affirm Joseph\u2019s 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-11\">. Joseph also states briefly that removal following his sentence will cause hardship to his wife and children because realistically they will not be able to join him in Haiti. He does not, however, expressly challenge the requirement that he surrender for removal following his incarceration, or cite any authority to show that this was reversible error. Accordingly, this argument is deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830-831 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guidelines range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-18\">. We recognize that the statutory maximum sentence for falsely claiming United States citizenship, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911, is 3 years' imprisonment or 36 months imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7911. However, the statutory maximum sentence for illegally reentering the United States after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the statutory maximum sentence for forgery or false use of a passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1543, is 10 years' imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1543.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
