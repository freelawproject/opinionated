The district court sentenced him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), to 188 months of imprisonment, the bottom of the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines range. We affirmed Mabrey\u2019s conviction, vacated his sentence, and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Mabrey, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 274 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 04-5077) <em>(\u201cMabrey I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">On remand, the district court resentenced Mabrey to a 180-month prison term, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Mabrey appeals the sentence imposed on remand, asserting that the district court erred in concluding that his second-degree burglary conviction under Maryland law qualified as a violent felony for purposes of sentencing him as an armed career criminal and that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the predicate offenses were neither submitted to a jury nor admitted by him. Mabrey acknowledges, however, that he is precluded from raising these issues in this appeal because he litigated them in <em>Mabrey I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">In <em>Mabrey I, </em>we rejected the claims Mabrey now seeks to raise in this appeal. Thus, we find that Mabrey\u2019s claims are barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine and that none of the exceptions applies. <em>See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing doctrine and exceptions thereto); <em>see also S. Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn. v. Riese, </em>356 F.3d 576, 583 (4th Cir.2004) (discussing mandate rule). Accordingly, we affirm Mabrey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
