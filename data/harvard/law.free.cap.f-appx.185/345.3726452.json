Reviewing the record for clear error, we affirm the order of the district court for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-23\">1. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s holding that Sealed Appellant is presently suffering from a mental disease and defect as a result of which release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-24\">2. The ten-page mental health evaluation by the Government\u2019s evaluating psychiatrist, the hearing testimony of the Government\u2019s two medical expert witnesses and the actions, writings, and testimony of Sealed Appellant support this conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-25\">3. Sealed Appellant presented no medical evidence to contradict the opinions of the Government\u2019s experts, having refused to be interviewed and examined by the court\u2019s independent mental health expert designated at her counsel\u2019s request. While one examining psychiatrist stated that Sealed Appellant would likely present little or no risk to others if she received appropriate psychiatric medication and treatment, Sealed Appellant has consistently refused such mental health care even in a restrictive environment. There is no evidence to suggest that, upon release from a structured facility, Sealed Appellant would be able and willing to receive appropriate treatment and medication, without which the medical experts agree she would likely represent a danger to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-26\">4. Given the weight of the evidence suggesting that Sealed Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>suffers from a severe mental illness requiring custodial psychiatric care and treatment and Sealed Appellant\u2019s failure to present evidence to the contrary, the district court did not err in ordering her committed to the custody of the Attorney General until she is no longer in need of such care. <em>See United States v. Muhammad, </em>165 F.3d 327, 336 (5th Cir. 1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
