She claimed that TCISD violated C.R.T.\u2019s constitutional rights. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of TCISD. We affirm in light of the general rule that the state\u2019s failure to protect an individual from private harm does not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">This case arises out of an unfortunate incident. Appellant alleges that C.R.T., then an eighteen-year-old special education student attending Texas City High School, was sexually assaulted by another special education student on TCISD\u2019s watch. TCISD disputes Appellant\u2019s version of the facts, and the district court characterized TCISD\u2019s role in the incident as \u201cbenign.\u201d As this appeal arises from summary judgment, we view the record in the light most favorable to Appellant. Appellant argues that TCISD should be held liable for the incident, which occurred on school grounds, under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Ordinarily, governmental entities have no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private violence. <em>See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 196-97, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). To secure liability against the state for private harm under section 1983, plaintiffs must show that their claims fit within the narrow class of exceptions to the <em>DeShaney </em>rule. <em>DeShaney </em>itself recognized one exception: the state may be liable for private harm where it has a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 197-200, 109 S.Ct. 998. Additionally, out-of-Circuit cases have adopted a \u201cstate-created danger\u201d exception to <em>DeShaney. See generally McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 324-26 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Neither the special relationship exception nor the state-created danger exception applies here. No special relationship existed because C.R.T. \u2014 an eighteen-year-old not subject to compulsory attendance laws \u2014 was not \u201cinvoluntarily confined against h[er] will through the affirmative exercise of state power.\u201d <em>Walton v. Alexander, </em>44 F.3d 1297, 1299-1306 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc). As to the state-created danger theory, we assume without deciding that it would be viable in this Circuit. That exception would be inapposite here because the evidence does not create a genuine issue of fact that TCISD had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of, and disregarded, an \u201cexcessive risk\u201d to C.R.T. <em>See McClendon, </em>305 F.3d at 326 &amp; n. 8. For these reasons, the district court correctly granted summary judgment against Appellant\u2019s private-harm claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Not every one of Appellant\u2019s claims derive from the alleged private harm. She also alleges that school employees used excessive force in searching C.R.T. after the incident. The district court correctly found that Appellant did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to this claim. Appellant did not produce evidence that the alleged excessive force resulted from an official policy of TCISD, a precondition of it being liable for the acts of its employees under section 1983. <em>See Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist., </em>254 F.3d 595, 600 n. 2 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>For these reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
