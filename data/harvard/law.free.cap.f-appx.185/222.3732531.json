On appeal, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict because there was no evidence that he knew that Luther Ware \u2014 with whom he agreed to rob the bank \u2014 actually had a gun. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-22\">At Zimmerman\u2019s trial, Zimmerman, the bank manager, two tellers, and two customers who were present at the time of the robbery, testified. The government presented evidence that Zimmerman and Ware entered the bank. Zimmerman went directly to the teller line, vaulted over the counter, and directed the teller to assist him by opening the money drawers.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-23\">The second man, Luther Ware, wore a mask and brandished a firearm. He directed the bank branch manager, the two customers and the other teller to lie on the floor in the lobby area of the bank. The bank manager testified that he heard Ware threaten the people to be still or he would \u201cblow their brains out.\u201d Zimmerman immediately responded, \u201cNo, no, no. We\u2019re not going to hurt anybody.\u201d Kathy Mitchell, a bank customer, also testified that she heard the threat and heard Zim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>merman respond, \u201cNo, there won\u2019t be a shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Gail Libbey, the second teller, testified that Ware threatened to \u201cblow their heads off.\u201d She did not hear Zimmerman say anything in response. Tonya Mills, the other customer, also did not hear Zimmerman say anything after Ware threatened to shoot the occupants of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Danielle Emmons, the teller who was behind the counter when the robbery started, testified that she heard Ware\u2019s threat to \u201cBe quiet or I\u2019ll blow your heads off.\u201d She testified that, upon hearing this, she realized the seriousness of the situation, and she started shaking. Zimmerman told her to \u201cstay calm, nothing was going to happen, no one was going to get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Zimmerman testified that he and Ware did not plan the robbery and did not discuss what they would do once they entered the bank. He testified that he did not know that Ware had a gun and did not see the gun while they were in the bank. When asked what prompted him to say that no one was going to get hurt, Zimmerman stated that he noticed Emmons\u2019 hands shaking and made the statement to calm her and reassure her.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">We find that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Zimmerman had actual knowledge that a gun would be used. <em>See United States v. Spinney, </em>65 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.1995). Therefore, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Wills, </em>346 F.3d 476, 495 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>542 U.S. 939, 124 S.Ct. 2906, 159 L.Ed.2d 816 (2004). Accordingly, we affirm Zimmerman\u2019s conviction for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
