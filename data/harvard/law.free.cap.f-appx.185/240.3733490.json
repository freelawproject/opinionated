On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising one issue: whether Nichols was properly sentenced to 190 months of imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We find that Nichols was properly sentenced, under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), as an armed career criminal based on his prior North Carolina convictions for breaking and entering. Nichols was sentenced within his properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. We conclude that his ultimate sentence, which fell at the low end of this range, is reasonable under <em>Booker. United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (stating review standard); <em>see United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">We have examined the entire record in this case, in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Nichols\u2019 motion for abeyance. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
