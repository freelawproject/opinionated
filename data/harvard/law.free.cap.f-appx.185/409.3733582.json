He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition to challenge this conviction and sentence, and he now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. He argues that he should be permitted to pursue \u00a7 2241 relief in accordance with the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because his fugitive status prevented him from timely pursuing \u00a7 2255 relief. He also presents argument on the merits of his sentencing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Coley has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his purported \u00a7 2241 petition was best construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion over which the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Det. Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Coley\u2019s contention that he should be permitted to proceed under \u00a7 2241 due to his prior status as a fugitive is unpersuasive. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
