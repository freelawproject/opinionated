Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-29\">Graham\u2019s only contention on appeal is that the district court erred in applying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>two-level upward adjustment to his base offense level on the robbery charge for physically restraining his victims, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) (2004). When reviewing a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and review questions of law de novo. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006). We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s findings, and the briefs of the parties, and conclude that Graham qualified for the enhancement for physically restraining his victims, as this court has applied that term. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>198 F.3d 467, 471-72 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Stokley, </em>881 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Graham\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
