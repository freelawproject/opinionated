Milian was sentenced to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. Milian appeals, arguing that his guilty plea is invalid. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">During Milian\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered the following factual basis for Milian\u2019s plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-17\">On or about May 13th, 2003, in Hills-borough County, in the Middle District of Florida, the Defendant, Reginald Milian, pawned an Armalite AR-10 .308 caliber rifle at the University Gun and Pawn Shop....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-18\">On July 3rd, 2003, the Defendant returned to the University Gun and Pawn Shop and attempted to reacquire the Armalite AR-10 .308 caliber rifle and falsely answered no to the question of whether he had ever been convicted of a felony offense on ATF From 4473, the Firearms Transaction Record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-19\">This response was untrue, as the Defendant had been previously convicted of robbery ... and sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">Milian agreed that the government\u2019s recitation of the facts was accurate. The district court subsequently accepted Milian\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">On appeal, Milian argues for the first time that, because the government did not establish on the record that the pawn shop where he attempted to acquire the firearm was a federally licensed dealer, the district court did not establish a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea. Where, as here, a defendant fails to object to a Rule 11 violation in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error \u2018seriously a\u00a3fect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurther, in the Rule 11 context, the reviewing court may consult the whole record when considering the effect of any error on substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden of showing that an error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bejarano, </em>249 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir. 2001). In order to prove that a district court committed plain error under Rule 11, a defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Rule 11(b)(3) requires that the district court, before entering judgment on a guilty plea, \u201cdetermine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). This requirement serves the purpose of protecting \u201ca defendant who mistakenly believes that his conduct constitutes the criminal offense to which he is pleading.\u201d <em>United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1128 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2986, 162 L.Ed.2d 891 (2005) . \u201cThe standard for evaluating challenges to the factual basis for a guilty plea is whether the trial court was presented with evidence from which it could reasonably find that the defendant was guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(a)(6), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant knowingly made; (2) a false or fictitious written statement in connection with the purchase of firearms; (3) intended to deceive or likely to deceive a licensed firearms dealer; (4) and the false statement was a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or disposition of the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>318 F.3d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Here, the government presented sufficient evidence from which the district court reasonably could have determined that Milian was guilty of the charged offense. Milian admitted at the plea colloquy that, when he went to reacquire the firearm at the University Gun and Pawn Shop, he filled out an ATF Form 4473. This fact was sufficient for the district court to have reasonably concluded that University Gun and Pawn Shop was federally licensed, as federally licensed firearms dealers use this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Moreover, even assuming that the district court committed error by accepting Milian\u2019s guilty plea, Milian has not carried his burden to show prejudice. Milian has not alleged, much less proven, that, had the government included in its proffer that University Gun and Pawn Shop was federally licensed, he would not have pled guilty. Accordingly, we affirm Milian\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-13\">. We reject Milian\u2019s argument that this Court should apply the <em>de novo </em>standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>applicable to Rule 11 voluntariness challenges. Milian's appeal does not assert a voluntariness challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
