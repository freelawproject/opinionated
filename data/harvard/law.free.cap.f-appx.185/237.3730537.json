The district court sentenced Marquez-Cordoba to ninety months of imprisonment. On appeal, counsel filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests that the district court imposed a sentence that was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to serve the ends of justice. Marquez-Cordoba was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">The district court sentenced Marquez-Cordoba within the applicable advisory Guideline range and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, Marquez-Cordoba\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sentence imposed within properly calculated advisory Guideline range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Marquez-Cordoba\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Marquez-Cordoba, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Marquez-Cordoba requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Marquez-Cordoba. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-17\"> <em>Anders v.
