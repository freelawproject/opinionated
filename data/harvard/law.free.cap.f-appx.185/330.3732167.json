Mares was sentenced to a 21-month term of imprisonment and to a two-year period of supervised release. Mares gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Mares challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Mares\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Mares contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[t]his court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Mares] and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mares concedes as much, but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
