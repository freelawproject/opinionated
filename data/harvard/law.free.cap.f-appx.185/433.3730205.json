Cullum seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his \u201cRequest for Leave to File a Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc Amended Judgment Pursuant to the F.R.Civ.P. Rule 60(b)(4) <em>&amp; </em>(6).\u201d In that motion, Cullum argued that his sentence for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, manufacturing phenylacetone, and filing false tax returns was illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Cullum\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). For the reasons that follow, Cullum\u2019s IFP motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">Cullum\u2019s request is correctly characterized as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551-52 (5th Cir.1998); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255. Because Cullum has neither sought nor obtained from this court authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, his appeal is frivolous and is hereby dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cullum is warned that the filing of another frivolous pleading in this court will result in the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-24\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
