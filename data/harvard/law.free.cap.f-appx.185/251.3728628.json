The appeal period for challenging post-judgment orders in criminal cases is ten days. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b); <em>United States v. Little, </em>392 F.3d 671, 680-81 (4th Cir.2004). The appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). The district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration of the denial of Byrd\u2019s Rule 35 motion was entered on May 4, 2005. Excluding weekends and holidays, the appeal period expired on May 18, 2005. Giving Byrd the benefit of the prisoner mailbox rale, Fed. R.App. P. 4(c), his notice of appeal is deemed filed when he gave it to prison officials for mailing on May 23, 2005. Thus, Byrd\u2019s notice of appeal in No. 05-6953 was untimely, and we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">In No. 05-6954, Byrd seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Byrd has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, in No. 05-6954 we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">We grant Byrd\u2019s motion to seal his informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
