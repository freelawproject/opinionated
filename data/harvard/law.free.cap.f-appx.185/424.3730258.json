Bordelon, Louisiana prisoner # 339150, has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). The district court dismissed Bordelon\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Bordelon sued the Clerk of Court and Deputy Clerk of Avoyelles Parish, La., and the court reporter who prepared the transcript of his criminal trial, asserting that they were responsible for falsifying and altering testimony in the transcript. Bordelon now only \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous, but he fails to direct his IFP \u201cmotion ... solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Bordelon has effectively abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s disposition of his complaint. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">It is ordered that leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and this court\u2019s dismissal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Bordelon has at least one prior strike. <em>See Bordelon v. Jeansonne, </em>No. 03-1198-A (W.D.La. Oct. 23, 2003) (unpublished). Accordingly, Bordelon is now barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from bringing a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under \u00a7 1915 unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
