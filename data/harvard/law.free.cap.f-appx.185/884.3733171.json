Appellant began his supervised release on November 15, 2001. On August 10, 2004, the district court\u2019s probation office petitioned the court to issue a summons for appellant because he had violated the conditions of supervised release; among other things, he had possessed and used marijuana and committed child abuse and domestic battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">On July 21 and 22, 2004, the court held a revocation hearing. Appellant admitted the marijuana allegation, but contested the allegations of child abuse and domestic battery. After hearing evidence regarding those allegations, the court upheld them, revoked appellant\u2019s supervised release, and sentenced him to a prison term of 46 months. He now appeals his sentence, contending that it is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">That the district court revoked appellant\u2019s supervised release on the grounds presented for revocation does not concern us because the evidence fully supported the court\u2019s action. What troubles us is that the court, in sentencing appellant at the top of the Guidelines sentence range, neither articulated a reason for its imposition of the prison term nor indicated that it had considered the sentencing objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Under these circumstances, we are unable to assess the reasonableness of appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">We therefore remand the case with the instruction that the court consult the \u00a7 3553(a) objectives and articulate the reason^) for the sentence it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
