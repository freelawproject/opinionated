In her complaint, Jones alleged that she was fired because of her religious beliefs and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>This court may authorize Jones to proceed IFP on appeal if she is unable to pay the costs of the appeal and the appeal is taken in good faith, <em>ie., </em>the appeal presents nonfrivolous issues. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(1); <em>see Holmes v. Hardy, </em>852 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Jones has failed to demonstrate that her appeal would involve nonfrivolous issues. The summary-judgment evidence showed that General Nutrition Centers, Inc., had articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for Jones\u2019s termination and she had not borne her burden of establishing that the articulated reason was pretextual. <em>Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Jones\u2019s motion for IFP is therefore denied and her appeal dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
