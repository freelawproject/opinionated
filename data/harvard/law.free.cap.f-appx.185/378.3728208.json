Rivero argues that his sentence is unreasonable and that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Rivero contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court relied too heavily upon the Sentencing Guidelines and failed to give due consideration to the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We presume that the sentence is reasonable because it falls within the applicable guidelines sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006). Rivero has not shown error in connection with the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him within that range. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Further, the record shows that the district court gave sufficient weight to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Rivero\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable is unavailing. Rivero\u2019s contention that \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional is, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Rivero has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
