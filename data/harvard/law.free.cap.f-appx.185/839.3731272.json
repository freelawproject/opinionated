No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s application of a six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. 2B1.1(b)(2)(C) upon the court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that his criminal activity involved 250 or more victims. Defendant asserts a two-part challenge: he first argues that a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof should have applied to contested facts used to support an increase in the sentence imposed; he next argues that the record is wanting to satisfy even a preponderance of the evidence standard. We see no merit in these challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">About the standard of proof applicable to a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(2)(C) enhancement, Defendant argues that post-<em>Booker, United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the government\u2019s burden is beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Defendant, the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard derives from the Constitution; and Defendant also contends that, under the doctrine of \u201cconstitutional avoidance,\u201d this Court should avoid the difficult constitutional issue of whether the reasonable doubt standard is constitutionally mandated and apply that standard as a matter of statutory construction or judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Our <em>post-Booker </em>cases reflect no change to the standard of proof applicable to sentencing enhancements. Provided the district court applies the guidelines as advisory, nothing in <em>Booker </em>restricts the sentencing court from making factual findings under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1300 (11th Cir. 2006) (\u201cwhen a defendant challenges a factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d); <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (affirming sentence based on judicial findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence standard because the guidelines were applied in an advisory way), <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (for purposes of guideline sentence calculation, government bears burden of establishing disputed fact by preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">Defendant also maintains that the government failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his offense activity involved 250 or more victims. The sentencing guidelines provide a six-level increase when the mail theft offense involves 250 or more victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(2)(C) and the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 define victim to include \u201cany person who was the intended recipient, or addressee, of the undelivered United States mail.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, n. 4(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">The guidelines also provide a \u201cspecial rule\u201d creating a presumption applicable to the determination of the number of victims of undelivered mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-15\">A housing unit cluster box or any similar receptacle that contains multiple mailboxes, whether such receptacle is owned by the United States Postal Service or otherwise owned, shall, unless proven otherwise, be presumed to have involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the number of victims corresponding to the number of mailboxes in each cluster box or similar receptacle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment n. 4(C)(ii)(II). Applying the presumption, the district court determined that 250 mailboxes was but a very small portion of the total number of mailboxes accessed by Defendant and his co-defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant complains that the postal inspector was unable to confirm that the number of victims was necessarily equal to the number of mailboxes; indeed, the postal inspector said specifically that he had no way of knowing from which mailboxes mail was stolen. And Defendant argues further that the complaints received \u2014 under 50 from apartment complex residents and about 100 from rural residents of west Mobile \u2014 were not investigated fully to determine whether the complainant was a \u201cvictim,\u201d and, in any event, the number of complaints fell far short of 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The special rule for victim enhancement for offenses involving United States mail was created because of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">(i) the unique proof problems often attendant to such offenses, (ii) the frequently significant, but difficult to quantify, non-monetary losses in such offenses, and (iii) the importance of maintaining the integrity of the United States mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">U.S.S.G. app. C, Amendment 617. Defendant\u2019s protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, reference to the postal inspector\u2019s testimony provides no rebuttal of the presumption set out in the special rule. The testimony underscores the need for the special rule. The mail theft offense often eludes precise quantification.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">No reversible error has been shown in the application of the six-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. 2B1.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">. Defendant\u2019s constitutional argument rests on the Sixth Amendment cases that culminated in <em>Booker, </em>considered in the light of the Fifth Amendment Due Process right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt as recognized in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1071-73, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">.
