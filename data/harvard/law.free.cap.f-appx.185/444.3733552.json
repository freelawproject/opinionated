Sithole, the lead applicant, concedes that her asylum application was untimely but contends that she has demonstrated changed circumstances that materially affect her eligibility for asylum. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim, which is therefore dismissed. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In rejecting the applications, the BIA found that Sithole lacked credibility. This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influenced the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA summarily affirmed, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The IJ articulated cogent reasons, supported by substantial evidence in the record, for rejecting Sithole\u2019s testimony as incredible. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Absent credible testimony by Sithole, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that she failed to establish that she was eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>She also has failed to show error in the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the petitions for review are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">PETITIONS DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; PETITIONS DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
