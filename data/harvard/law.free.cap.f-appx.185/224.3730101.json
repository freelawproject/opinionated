Specifically, Dr. Meyers contends that Dr. Levinson is liable for republieation of a peer review report that Dr. Levinson authored for Dr. Meyers\u2019 employer, Riverside Regional Medical Center (\u201cRiverside\u201d). In a thorough opinion, the district court granted Dr. Levinson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the dissemination of the report to Riverside\u2019s Fair Hearings Board did not create a new cause of action under the single publication rule and, therefore, was time-barred under Virginia law. <em>See Sentida v. Rice, </em>863 F.2d 1156, 1161 (4th Cir. 1988) (noting that substantially contemporaneous distributions of a document within the same organization to individuals with a direct interest in the matter \u201cshould be considered part of an aggregate communication for purposes of applying the single publication rule\u201d). The district court further determined that the distribution of the report to Mary Immaculate Hospital was not authorized by Dr. Levinson, nor was it the \u201cnatural and probable result\u201d of Dr. Levinson\u2019s action. <em>See Weaver v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>199 Va. 196, 98 S.E.2d 687, 692 (1957) (stating that an original defamer is hable for republications that are the \u201cnatural and probable result\u201d of the defamer\u2019s actions). Dr. Meyers appeals both of these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Having reviewed, de novo, the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Meyers v. Levinson, </em>No. 4:02-cv-00009 (E.D.Va. July 26, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
