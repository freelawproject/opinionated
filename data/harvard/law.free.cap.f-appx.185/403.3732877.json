He argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence must be vacated because it was based on judicial fact-findings made in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Specifically, Jones challenges the enhancements to his sentence for brandishing a firearm and abducting his victims. He also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction to his sentence for being a minor participant. As the Government has not invoked the waiver provision in the plea agreement, the waiver is not binding on Jones. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The finding by the district court that Jones could have \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d that his co-defendant would brandish a firearm during the carjacking was necessary to support the enhancement to Jones\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 679 <em>&amp; </em>n. 23 (5th Cir.1997). Since Jones never admitted the fact that it was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d to him that his co-defendant would brandish a firearm during the carjacking, the enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Government concedes that Jones preserved this error for appeal. The Government, however, has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284-85 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Jones\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded for resentencing. Because we remand for resentencing based on the brandishing of a firearm enhancement, we do not reach Jones\u2019s arguments with respect to the enhancement for abducting his victims and the denial of a reduction for being a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
