The case was assigned to a magistrate judge who determined that \u00a7 2241 was an inappropriate vehicle for the relief requested by Williams, but rather that his claims fell under the ambit of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Without forwarding the matter on to a district court judge or making any findings regarding whether the petition met the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, the magistrate judge ordered it transferred to the district court in the Western District of Louisiana, the court that had sentenced Williams. The Western District of Louisiana then dismissed Williams\u2019s petition without prejudice, ruling that it had neither jurisdiction to consider his petition as one under \u00a7 2241 nor jurisdiction to treat it like a \u00a7 2255 motion, as Williams had already filed several \u00a7 2255 motions and had not been granted permission to file a successive motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-23\">Although Williams has filed a motion for a certificate of appealability (COA), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>agree with his assertion that a COA is not required. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, a COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Williams also moves for a transfer back to the district court for the Western District of Louisiana with orders that that court transfer his case back to the Eastern District of Texas for a ruling on his \u00a7 2241 petition. The magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Texas lacked the discretion, if not the authority or jurisdiction, to transfer Williams\u2019s case to the Western District of Louisiana. <em>See Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Based on the foregoing, Williams\u2019s request for transfer to the district court for the Western District of Louisiana is GRANTED for the limited purpose of that court\u2019s transfer of the case to the Eastern District of Texas for a ruling by a district court judge. In transferring this matter back to district court, this court makes no determination regarding the Eastern District of Texas magistrate judge\u2019s prior finding that Williams\u2019s 2241 application must be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion and makes no instruction as to how the application should be construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; MOTION TO TRANSFER GRANTED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S TRANSFER OF THE MATTER BACK TO THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FOR A RULING BY A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
