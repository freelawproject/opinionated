As indicated below, the motion laid dormant until October 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In 1995, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), which dealt with the \u201cuse\u201d prong, but not the \u201ccarrying\u201d prong, of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the statute that formed the basis of his Count 5 conviction. In October 1996, petitioner moved the district court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied his motion, but granted the Government\u2019s long-pending Rule 35 motion and reduced petitioner\u2019s sentences by 60 months. We denied petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to review the court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In April 2004, petitioner commenced the action now before us by filing a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court dismissed the petition with prejudice, concluding that petitioner faded to qualify for the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. Petitioner now appeals. He contends that the district court erred in dismissing his petition because (1) he did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), as alleged in Count 5, because he was illiterate and did not speak English, (2) he is actually innocent of this violation because he only \u201ccarried\u201d firearms during a drug-trafficking offense, and (3) he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">As an initial matter, because petitioner filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), the provisions of the act govern this appeal. Further, he may proceed before us despite the lack of a COA. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B), a federal prisoner must obtain a COA to appeal only when proceeding under \u00a7 2255. By negative implication, a federal prisoner who proceeds under \u00a7 2241 does not need a COA to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under limited circumstances, however, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added). Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Section 2255\u2019s savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; <em>and </em>(3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999) (emphasis added). For a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. <em>See id. </em>All three criteria will be met only in the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Section 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply merely because a \u00a7 2255 motion would be barred as second or successive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">If the petitioner satisfies the elements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, the proper inquiry is whether by showing actual innocence he can overcome a procedural default for not raising the claim earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. A petitioner may not assert actual innocence, though, until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">As noted above, in 1995, the Supreme Court, in the <em>Bailey </em>case, held that \u201c[t]o sustain a conviction under the \u2018use\u2019 prong of \u00a7 924(c)(1), the Government must show that the defendant actively employed the firearm during and in relation to the predicate crime.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>516 U.S. at 150, 116 S.Ct. at 509. The Court, however, distinguished between \u201cuse\u201d and \u201ccarry\u201d under \u00a7 924(c): \u201c[u]nder the interpretation we enunciate today, a firearm can be used without being carried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 116 S.Ct. at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">In this case, the district court did not err by dismissing petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Bailey </em>was decided in 1995, prior to when petitioner filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion; thus, his <em>Bailey </em>claim could have been raised in that motion. In sum, his \u00a7 2241 petition did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. The indictment also contained a forfeiture count, which petitioner did not contest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. Before a prisoner can file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion he or she must seek authorization from our Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255 11 8. We will only authorize a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion if the prisoner presents a claim based on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court or newly discovered evidence sufficient to make a finding of guilt unreasonable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 H 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-15\">. Since petitioner has not met the savings clause requirements, we need not consider his assertion that he is actually innocent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
