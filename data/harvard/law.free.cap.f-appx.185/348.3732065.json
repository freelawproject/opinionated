Smith contends that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for re-sentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Smith argues that the district court committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reversible error by engaging in judicial fact-finding in determining his sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines regime found unconstitutional in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Additionally, <em>Booker </em>excised portions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made application of the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 258-61, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">A sentence based on a preserved <em>Booker </em>error must be vacated unless the error is harmless. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005). The Government concedes, and the available record reflects, that Smith preserved a <em>Booker </em>claim. Therefore, the burden shifts to the Government to show the error was harmless. The Government has provided no evidence that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Instead, the Government argues that Smith\u2019s appeal is untimely and that Smith failed to submit the required record on appeal. The Government is mistaken on both counts. An appeal in a criminal matter must be filed within 10 days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). The date of entry, weekends, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation. Fed. R.App. P. 26. The judgment of conviction was entered on July 2, 2004, and, therefore, the appeal noticed on July 16, 2004, was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The Government also mistakenly argues that the rules required Smith to submit a statement of evidence in place of a missing transcript from the sentencing hearing in this matter. The rules require that an appellant order the relevant transcripts when filing an appeal and Smith did so. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(c). However, when a transcript is unavailable, as it was in this case, the rules <em>permit </em>but do not <em>require </em>the appellant to prepare a statement of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Smith submitted the documents needed to show that he was sentenced before <em>Booker </em>and that he preserved his <em>Booker </em>objections. He is not required to submit evidence to assist the Government to meet its burden of showing harmlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Because Smith preserved his Sixth Amendment objections and the Government has submitted no evidence that the sentencing error was harmless, Smith\u2019s sentence is hereby vacated and his case remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
