In appeal No. 06-6487, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his \u201cPlace Holder\u201d motion, in which he sought sixty days to prepare a motion for collateral relief in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">With respect to Foster\u2019s appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of his constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Foster has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss appeal No. 05-7550.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">With respect to appeal No. 06-6487, our decision in <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65 (2005), precludes Foster from preparing a motion that would rely on the retroactive application of <em>Booker </em>to his case on collateral review. We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s decision in appeal No. 06-6487. <em>See United States v. Foster, </em>5:03-CR-319-01 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 3, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">\n<em>No. 05-7550 DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">\n<em>No. 06-6187 AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
