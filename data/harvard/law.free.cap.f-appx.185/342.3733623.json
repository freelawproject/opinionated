Velasquez asserts that the district court was wrong to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>miss his \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) because he had not sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP). Although Velasquez had not moved to proceed IFP in the district court, the magistrate judge ordered that the filing fee for his \u00a7 1983 complaint be paid in installments, and, thus, the magistrate judge effectively granted Velasquez IFP status with respect to his \u00a7 1983 suit. Moreover, any misapplication of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) was harmless given the existence of an alternative frivolity provision applicable to fee-paid complaints. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Velasquez also argues that the district court erred in ruling on the claim raised in his \u00a7 1983 suit because the claim was pending first in another court via a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. Velasquez has not shown that there was any motion pending in the instant case which would have prevented the district court from ruling on his \u00a7 1983 complaint. He offers no other argument to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit as malicious and for failure to state a claim. Accordingly, Velasquez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Velasquez is advised that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit each count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
