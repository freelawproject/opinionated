The IJ denied Varon\u2019s application; and, on 30 December 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial. On 18 March 2005, Var\u00f3n filed a motion to reopen on the basis of new evidence: a letter from the purchaser of Varon\u2019s business in Colombia, stating that the FARC had called the business to ask about Varon\u2019s location. On 4 May 2005, the BIA denied Varon\u2019s motion to reopen. On 3 June 2005, Var\u00f3n filed the instant petition seeking review of the BIA\u2019s 4 May 2005 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">In his petition, Var\u00f3n argues that the BIA erred in determining (1) that Var\u00f3n could not establish past persecution because he had not suffered harm at the hands of the FARC and (2) that Var\u00f3n could not establish a well-founded fear of returning to Colombia because his family members remained in Colombia unharmed. The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s 30 December 2004 decision that affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusions about these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration case is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Var\u00f3n should have filed his petition for review by 31 January 2005 to appeal timely the BIA\u2019s 30 December 2004 order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. But Var\u00f3n did not file his petition with this Court until 3 June 2005. The filing of the motion to reopen on 18 March 2005 did not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and did not toll the review period. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3. Varon\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>is untimely for the BIA\u2019s 30 December 2004 decision. We, thus, lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments: we dismiss that portion of his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">So, the scope of our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s denial of Varon\u2019s motion to reopen. But review of Varon\u2019s brief shows that he makes no arguments about the motion to reopen, which was based on alleged new evidence: the letter by the purchaser of one of Varon\u2019s businesses. Most of Varon\u2019s brief is devoted to arguing why the IJ and BIA erred in denying his asylum application. Because Var\u00f3n has failed to brief the denial of the motion to reopen, this issue is abandoned and we do not consider it. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that issue not raised on appeal is abandoned). We deny Varon\u2019s petition for review of the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. The petition for review names only Var\u00f3n as a petitioner, even though Varon's wife, Luz Maty Castro, was a derivative applicant on Varon\u2019s asylum petition, is listed in Varon's brief as a petitioner, and signed the brief. Because Fed.R.App.P. 15 requires each petitioner to be named specifically in the petition for review, only Var\u00f3n is a proper petitioner. Regardless, as we decide that Var\u00f3n is entitled to no relief, Castro, as a derivative applicant, also would be entitled to no relief were she a proper petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
