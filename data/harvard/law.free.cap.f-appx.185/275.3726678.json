Miller\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that the consecutive sentences imposed pursuant to \u00a7 924(c) violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Counsel states, however, that in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Miller has filed pro se supplemental briefs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">Miller did not object at sentencing to the imposition of multiple consecutive sentences on the \u00a7 924(c) counts; thus, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cThis court has held that proportionality review is not available for any sentence less than life imprisonment without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>possibility of parole.\u201d <em>United, States v. Ming Hong, </em>242 F.3d 528, 532 (4th Cir. 2001). Because Miller\u2019s sentence is less than life imprisonment, the proportionality of his sentence is not reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In his pro se supplemental briefs, Miller contends that the second superseding indictment is multiplicitous and that the district court was biased against him. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that these claims are without merit. Miller also asserts that counsel provided ineffective assistance. We \u201cmay address [such claims] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006). Because counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is not apparent from the face of the record, we decline to review this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Miller\u2019s convictions and sentence. We deny Miller\u2019s motion for copies of certain documents. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
