Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Beraki fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Beraki cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We deny Beraki\u2019s motion to allow attachments to his brief and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
