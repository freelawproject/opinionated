DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and added a few comments of its own, so we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">To the extent the decisions were based on a legal determination, review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the ... decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). To reverse fact findings, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. If the alien establishes past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, we presume his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon his removal; or (2) the alien could avoid a future threat to his life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal, and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. <em>Id. </em>An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution on a protected ground if he returns to his country. <em>Id. </em>To establish a well-founded fear, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An alien cannot demonstrate he more likely than not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the IJ finds the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">We have noted persecution is \u201can \u2018extreme concept\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation\u2019 and that \u2018[mjere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)) (alteration in original). Furthermore, \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>212 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). \u201cThe weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Substantial evidence supports the denial <em>of </em>withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>record provides substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s decision that Guzman did not suffer past persecution. Guzman\u2019s testimony outlined a series of National Liberation Army (ELN) threats. While these threats may have had a sufficient nexus \u25a0with Guzman\u2019s work as a political activist for the Colombian Liberal Party, they were mere threats, and do not rise to the level of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Guzman did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. The IJ found Guzman presented insufficient evidence to establish it was more likely than not he would be persecuted if he went back to Colombia. Guzman\u2019s testimony concerned four incidents in which members of the ELN threatened him. Though Guzman\u2019s testimony about these incidents was consistent, it does not compel the conclusion his limited reputation as a political campaigner would outlast his nine year absence from Colombia. Guzman also stated he did not believe all of these threats were serious. Furthermore, Ruth and Juan were able to live in Colombia for two years after Guzman left without being harmed by the ELN. Such evidence does not compel us to conclude that it is more likely than not Petitioners would be persecuted if they returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Further, Guzman did not support his testimony with enough corroborating evidence to meet the high burden for withholding of removal. Without such corroborating evidence, and given the general weakness of Guzman\u2019s testimony, Petitioners could not show it was more likely than not they would be persecuted if returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">C. <em>CAT Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">To qualify for CAT relief, the applicant must show it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Guzman presented no evidence during his hearing or in his asylum application that he would be tortured upon his return to Colombia by a public official or with a public official\u2019s acquiescence. Therefore, the denial of CAT relief is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-19\">.
