Martin, </em>670 F.2d 49, 51 (5th Cir.1982). This court reviews the decision of the BIA and does not normally consider the rulings and findings of immigration judges unless they impact the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Our review of the BIA\u2019s decision is governed by the substantial evidence standard, which requires that the BIA\u2019s decision be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also INS v. EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (applying this standard to review of denial of withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">The Sohails argue that the BIA erred in denying their request for withholding of removal because the threats to their lives from Tehmina\u2019s brother constituted persecution against them on account of Tehmina\u2019s membership in a particular social group \u2014 Muslim women. Regardless of whether the BIA erred by mischaraeterizing the Sohails\u2019 suffering as \u201cfamily matters\u201d rather than persecution, any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>error would be harmless because substantial evidence supported the finding of the BIA that the Sohails lived in Islamabad for three and a half years without incident, including two years at the same address. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that the Sohails could relocate safely to a part of Pakistan other than Karachi and that the Sohails are thus ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(i)(B); <em>see also Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the Sohails\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
