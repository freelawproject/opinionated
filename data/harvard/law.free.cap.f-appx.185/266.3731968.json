Carrera argues that the district court abused its discretion in ruling inadmissible at trial two settlement agreements to which DirecTV was a party, and an affidavit by Jeffrey Fisher, a former DirecTV employee. Carrera also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the violations at issue could be inferred from his receipt of \u201cpirate access devices\u201d and the maintenance of a suspended DirecTV account, particularly when he returned one of the devices at issue about two weeks after he received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">With respect to the settlement agreements and the Fisher affidavit, this court reviews a district court\u2019s decision as to the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion and will not find an abuse unless a decision was \u201carbitrary and irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>282 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). We hold that the district court rationally excluded the settlement agreements because their entry into evidence would not have affected the district court\u2019s consideration of the credibility of other evidence submitted by DirecTV. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 408. We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the Fisher affidavit, which makes no reference to Carrera and does not shed light on the issues in dispute. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">Regarding the district court\u2019s finding that Carrera\u2019s violations could be inferred from his possession of pirate access devices and maintenance of a suspended DirecTV account, we review the court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. Va. <em>Vermiculite Ltd. v. Historic Green Springs, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 277, 284 (4th Cir.2002); see <em>also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a). The district court noted that the evidence showed Carrera purchased a \u201cDualPro WTX Ultimate Unlooper Programmer\u201d on January 17, 2001, purchased an \u201cEmulator complete with cables\u201d on January 26, 2001, and returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the Emulator on February 10, 2001. Carrera asserts that because he returned the Emulator, he cannot be said to have pirated DirecTV signals with the Emulator, and the \u00a7 605(a) count related to his possession of the Emulator thus is not supported by the evidence. This argument does not cast doubt upon the district court\u2019s factual finding that he possessed the Emulator, which was capable of intercepting DirecTV signals, for two weeks, and during that two-week period he maintained a suspended DirecTV account. With respect to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Carrera pirated DirecTV programming based on circumstantial evidence, we find the conclusion adequately supported by the evidence. \u201c[C]ireumstantial evidence is no less probative than direct evidence,\u201d and here, the district court\u2019s inference was reasonable and grounded in facts reflected in the record. <em>Stamper v. Muncie, </em>944 F.2d 170, 174 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We therefore affirm the decision of the district court. <em>See DirecTV v. Carrera, </em>No. CA-03-93, 2005 WL 2010157 (W.D.Va. Aug. 19, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
