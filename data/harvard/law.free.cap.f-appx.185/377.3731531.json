Ipina-Ipina argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt in light of later Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Ipina-Ipina contends that the waiver provision contained in paragraph 2 of his plea agreement does not bar his ability to raise this issue on appeal. The Government states that there was no waiver of appellate rights in the plea agreement. The Government\u2019s position is consistent with this court\u2019s interpretation of this waiver provision. <em>See United, States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 452 (5th Cir.2006). Further, because the Government does not seek to enforce the waiver in this case, it will not be considered. <em>See United States v. Lang, </em>440 F.3d 212, 213 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Ipina-Ipina\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Although Ipina-Ipina contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ipina-Ipina properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
