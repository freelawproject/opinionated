WilkinsonOkotie\u2019s motion for bond pending review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">Wilkinson-Okotie asserts that the BIA\u2019s November 3, 2002, order that affirmed the order of removal by the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) that granted voluntary departure was premature and unlawful. WilkinsonOkotie contends that his application for adjustment of status tolled the deadline for his voluntary departure. He challenges the May 18, 2004, decision by the BIA that denied his first motion to reopen and the BIA\u2019s denial of his second motion to reopen, and he asserts that counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance deprived him of his due process right to fair proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-26\">We must determine, as an initial matter, whether we have jurisdiction. <em>See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 292, 294 (5th Cir.2002). Wilkinson-Okotie did not timely petition for review of the November 2002 decision that affirmed the IJ\u2019s order of removal and the grant of voluntary departure, nor did he timely petition for review of the May 2004 decision that denied his first motion to reopen. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>we lack jurisdiction to review those decisions. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111, 113 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Wilkinson-Okotie timely petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s order that denied his second motion to reopen. The BIA found that the motion to reopen was untimely and was prohibited by the numerical limitation on such motions. The BIA also determined that Wilkinson-Okotie was not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes judicial review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decisions. <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 provides that the status of an alien \u201cmay be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). We lack jurisdiction over petitions for review concerning the discretionary denial of relief under \u00a7 1255. <em>Hadwani, </em>445 F.3d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We may consider Wilkinson-Okotie\u2019s ineffective assistance and due process claims provided that the claims constitute \u201csubstantial constitutional claim[s].\u201d <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). It has not been determined whether an alien has a constitutional right to effective assistance in removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, an attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance may implicate due process if counsel\u2019s representation \u201cwas so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Wilkinson-Okotie\u2019s ineffective assistance and due process claims concern the denial of adjustment of status. The decision on adjustment of status is within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. <em>Hadwani </em>445 F.3d at 800. Because Wilkinson-Okotie\u2019s attorney\u2019s alleged deficiencies merely restricted the chance of obtaining adjustment of status, Wilkinson-Okotie has not alleged a violation of due process. <em>See Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 476. His petition for review does not present a \u201csubstantial constitutional claim.\u201d Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">PETITION DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
