He argues that retroactive Amendments 433, 506, and 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines coupled with the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), affected the method by which U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (Career Offender) was applied to his kidnapping and firearms convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Our review of Williams\u2019s sentencing reveals that none of the cited amendments have any application to the sentence the district court imposed. To the extent that Williams invokes <em>Booker, </em>such an argument is not cognizable in the context of a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it is not based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). In light of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
