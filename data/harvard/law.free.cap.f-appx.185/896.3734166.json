Chavez argues on appeal that the IJ\u2019s determination he failed to establish statutory eligibility for relief from removal is not supported by substantial evidence. For the reasons discussed more fully below, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Chavez\u2019s petition to the extent he is (i) challenging the denial of withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, and (ii) raising a due-process claim under the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, we deny his petition to the extent he is seeking review of the denial of asylum relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In August 1997, Chavez, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without authorization. In September 2003, Chavez filed an application for relief from removal, without identifying the specific grounds on which he was seeking relief. Chavez, however, generally explained that (1) his father had belonged to the Civil Defense Patrols,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) \u201canti government\u201d and \u201cother\u201d groups had threatened him when he had refused to join them. In December 2004, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied Chavez\u2019s application and served him with a notice to appear, charging him with removability for being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled, pursuant to former INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">On June 7, 2004, at a hearing on Chavez\u2019s application for relief from removal, Chavez, who again was proceeding <em>pro se </em>and was the only witness,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> offered the following testimony. After entering the United States without inspection in 1997, Chavez had remained in the United States. Chavez\u2019s family still lived in Guatemala, where his mother owned land and worked in agriculture. On the other hand, Chavez\u2019s wife, who also was Guatemalan and was not a legal resident of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>States, resided with him in the United States with their minor daughter, who was a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Chavez further testified that he left Guatemala in 1997 because: (1) his father had been persecuted by \u201cthe previous guerillas,\u201d (2) these guerillas had threatened to kill his entire family, and (3) his father had told him that he \u201cneeded to leave the country.\u201d Although agreeing that the Guatemalan government and the guerillas, subsequent to him leaving Guatemala, had reached a peace agreement, Chavez contended that his mother \u201chas to move from one place to another because sometimes [guerillas] are looking for them.\u201d Chavez also stated that (1) the guerillas had formed \u201canother group,\u201d (2) this group was following his family, and (3) this group had beaten his now deceased father. Chavez, however, conceded that he did not know the identity of this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Chavez testified that, in addition to being afraid to return to Guatemala because \u201cthey\u201d could kill him, he believed he would not be safe if he relocated to Guatemala City because \u201cthey are after us everyplace [in Guatemala].\u201d Chavez explained that his father had died on March 26, 2004, two months prior to the evidentiary hearing, after being \u201cbeaten up\u201d by the persons who were persecuting him in Masate, which was another district in Guatemala. Chavez, however, did not know the name of the group that was persecuting his father because his father had not revealed this information to protect Chavez. Chavez also stated that, although a friend had witnessed the beating of Chavez\u2019 father, (1) Chavez only knew about the beating through his mother, who had gone to visit his father in Masate; and (2) he had no physical evidence documenting this incident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Chavez stated that his father had lived apart from his mother for four years prior to being killed and had never left Guatemala. Chavez also agreed that his mother and five younger siblings, who were still in school, had continued living in Quezaltenango, Guatemala. Moreover, Chavez added no more details after the IJ asked him whether he could tell her anything else about his father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">In addition to Chavez\u2019s testimony, the government submitted for the IJ\u2019s review the 2003 Country Report, which included that Guatemala is a democratic republic with separation of powers and a centralized administration. Although there were some improvements in the government\u2019s human-rights record, serious abuses persisted. Indeed, these abuses involved \u201ccredible reports of ... politically motivated killings by non[-]state actors,\u201d including \u201cat least 29 killings of opposition political candidates.\u201d This report, however did not include that either former members of the Civil Defense Patrols or their families had been targeted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">At the conclusion of this evidentiary hearing, the IJ found Chavez removable, denied his application for asylum under the INA and for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, but granted him voluntary departure,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with an alternate order of removal to Guatemala. The IJ explained that, although Chavez had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>filed his application for asylum more than one year after he arrived in the United States, she still had considered his application because he had filed it soon after he had turned 21 years\u2019 old.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The IJ, however, found that Chavez, whose \u201ccase\u201d had been \u201cvague to the extreme,\u201d had failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In reaching this determination, the IJ noted that Chavez\u2019s testimony had included that Chavez\u2019s father, who had been involved in the Civil Defense Patrols in Guatemala during the 1990s, had been beaten two months prior to the evidentiary hearing by an unknown group that previously had persecuted him. The IJ also noted that Chavez had indicated that this group had \u201csomething to do maybe with the guerilla[s], but now they wear masks, and they went after his father.\u201d The IJ discussed that, although Chavez had testified that his mother had moved \u201cfrom place to place,\u201d the IJ found that she had not moved \u201ctoo much\u201d since she owned land and was a farmer. The IJ discussed that, after being given several opportunities to provide more information about his father\u2019s death, Chavez had not done so. Finally, the IJ found that Chavez unreasonably believed that he also would be killed, despite that his mother and siblings were still living in the same region of Guatemala, unharmed. Thus, the IJ concluded that \u201cnone of this [evidence] satisfie[d] [Chavez\u2019s] burden of proof with regard to the legal requirements for the relief sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Through counsel, Chavez appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, arguing that the IJ improperly had denied his application for asylum due to the IJ\u2019s erroneous determination that Chavez had failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Chavez specifically challenged the IJ\u2019s findings that (1) he had no reason to fear returning to Guatemala because his mother and siblings had continued living there, (2) his testimony was \u201cextremely vague,\u201d and (3) he had failed to produce corroborating evidence. He also contended that, even assuming that he failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, the IJ should have granted him discretionary asylum, pursuant to <em>8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii), because there is a reasonable possibility that he may suffer other serious harm upon removal to Guatemala, in light of the fact that his father was beaten to death in March 2004. A single member of the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, without opinion, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Chavez, still proceeding with counsel, argues on appeal that the IJ improperly denied his application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, based on the IJ\u2019s erroneous conclusion that Chavez failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Chavez specifically contends that his testimony, which he argues the IJ implicitly found credible by incorporating into her decision, included that \u201cguerillas,\u201d in an effort to stop Chavez and his family from participating in the Civil Defense Patrols, had beaten his father several times, threatened to kill his entire family, and ultimately killed his father. Chavez also argues that the IJ, in concluding that he had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution, had erred in relying on the fact that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>mother and younger siblings had remained, unharmed, in one location in Guatemala because neither his mother nor his siblings had been members of the Civil Defense Patrols or been recruited by the guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Alternatively, Chavez contends that, after he established past persecution, the government failed to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Chavez also generally asserts that, even if he has no well-founded fear of future persecution, he should have been granted discretionary asylum because, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii), he established that there is a reasonable possibility that he may suffer other serious harm upon his removal to Guatemala. Furthermore, Chavez challenges the IJ\u2019s general finding that his testimony was vague, arguing that his detailed testimony was consistent with his application and was supported by his father\u2019s death certificate and the 2003 County Report. Finally, Chavez asserts that, if the IJ was not satisfied with the \u201cdepth or breadth of his testimony,\u201d she should have questioned him further because, at the hearing, he was not represented by counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">As a preliminary matter, Chavez generally asserted in his initial brief on appeal that aliens have due-process rights during removal proceedings, which include the right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard and a thorough review on appeal to the BIA. Prior to filing his reply brief, however, he did not discuss in detail how he was denied due process. To the extent he did not adequately assert a due-process argument in his initial brief, he has abandoned this argument. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228-29 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that petitioner abandoned issue by failing to offer argument on it in her brief); <em>see also United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining our \u201cprudential rule\u201d of declining \u201cto consider issues raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Regardless, Chavez failed to raise any due-process arguments in his appeal to the BIA. Chavez also failed to challenge in his appeal to the BIA the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent he was denied withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT. Thus, we lack jurisdiction over these issues because Chavez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1322, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201ca court may review a final order of removal only if \u2018the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u2019 \u201d (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)); <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001) (interpreting this exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional). We, therefore, dismiss Chavez\u2019s petition to the extent he is raising due-process arguments and seeking review of the denial of withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Examining the denial of Chavez\u2019s remaining asylum claim, \u201c[w]hen a single member of the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, such as here, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. \u201d Id. </em>\u201cOn the other hand, the IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u2018must affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55 (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001)). Under the substantial evidence test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. Thus, a finding of fact will be reversed \u2018only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-4\"><em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (quoting <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebut-table presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If he cannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof without coiToboration. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). However, when an IJ \u201csays not that [the IJ] believes the asylum seeker or [that] [the IJ] disbelieves her ... the reviewing Court is left in the dark,\u201d and that an IJ must make a \u201cclean determination[ ] of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). Because the IJ in the instant case did not clearly state that she was making an adverse credibility determination, we conclude that no such determination is dispositive on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">In examining whether Chavez established past persecution, the statute governing asylum \u201cprotects] not only against persecution by government forces, but also against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control .... \u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. However, \u201c[persecution on account of ... political opinion ... is persecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (emphasis in original)). The applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be singled out for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Evidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence, or merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Here, Chavez contended that persons persecuted his father and, two months pri- or to the evidentiary hearing, killed his father by beating him. Chavez, however, conceded that, although a friend witnessed the beating, his father, in an effort to protect Chavez, had not told him who was persecuting him, and he did not know who killed his father. To the extent Chavez also vaguely asserted that \u201cthe former guerillas had threatened to kill his entire family during the 1990s, he failed to show that these threats involved more than isolated incidents. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (explaining that, although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a refugee, \u201cpersecution\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d requiring \u201cmore than a few incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, the IJ did not err in considering the fact that Chavez failed to produce corroborating evidence, other than an untranslated death certificate reflecting that Chavez\u2019s father died of internal injuries. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201 (explaining that \u201c[t]he weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence\u201d). Thus, Chavez did not present \u201cspecific, detailed facts\u201d that demonstrated past persecution based on a protected factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Chavez also failed to demonstrate, in the alternative, a future threat to his life or freedom in Guatemala, based on a protected factor. As the IJ noted, Chavez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>mother and five younger siblings still were living in Guatemala, and Chavez did not testify that they had been harmed. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259 (noting that the petitioners\u2019 claim that they had a well-founded fear of future persecution in the area of Colombia where the petitioners previously lived was belied by the fact that their son and one of the petitioner\u2019s parents had remained in that area, unharmed). Chavez is arguing that (1) these family members are distinguishable because they were not recruited by the Civil Defense Patrols; and (2) the 2003 Country Report included that Guatemala\u2019s human-rights record remained poor and serious abuses involved \u201ccredible reports of ... politically motivated killings by non[-]state actors.\u201d This report, however, did not reflect that former members of the Civil Defense Patrols or their families had been targeted. Chavez, who has not lived in Guatemala since 1997, also failed to explain why he still would be targeted over eight years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Furthermore, to the extent IJ relied on her finding that Chavez did not show that he could avoid persecution by relocating within Guatemala, we recently clarified that \u201cit is not unreasonable to require a refugee who has an internal resettlement alternative in his own country to ... establish that such an option is unavailable.\u201d <em>See Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1223 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). We also discussed in <em>Arboleda </em>that, since 2001, the regulations have codified the country-wide requirement, and have instructed the IJ to consider whether \u201cunder all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant [to relocate].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After examining the relevant country reports for Colombia, we concluded in <em>Arboleda </em>that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) operates country-wide in Colombia, and that the government, therefore, had failed to show that relocation was a viable option for the petitioners, whom the BIA presumed had suffered past persecution, to escape future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1224-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Unlike the facts in <em>Arboleda, </em>Chavez failed to establish past persecution. He, therefore, had the burden of establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution that was both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. Moreover, as discussed above, Chavez failed to demonstrate that he will be singled out for persecution on account of a protected factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Thus, even if we were to conclude that the 2003 Country Report established country-wide persecution, a contrary conclusion would not compelled by this evidence. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7 (affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, despite the inclusion in Country Reports for Colombia that guerillas exercised an influence throughout the country, because the petitioner had failed to establish that she would be singled out for persecution on account of a protected ground). Indeed, as we recently explained, \u201conly in a rare case does the record compel the conclusion that an applicant for asylum suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>No. 448 F.3d 1229 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>that record evidence of a single -written death threat, a shooting, and numerous anonymous harassing telephone calls did not \u201ccompel\u201d a contrary conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Finally, to the extent Chavez is arguing summarily that, regardless of whether he established a well-founded fear of future persecution, the IJ abused her discretion in not granting him asylum under \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii), the BIA determined in <em>Matter of Chen, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 16 (BIA 1989), that, even if the presumption of future persecution arising from past persecution has been rebutted, an alien may have suffered such severe or atrocious forms of persecution at the hands of the former regime such that it would be inhumane to require the alien to return to his home country. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The BIA further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">[Tjhere may be cases where the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted for humanitarian reasons even if there is little likelihood of future persecution. ... It is frequently recognized that a person who \u2014 or whose family\u2014 has suffered under atrocious forms of persecution should not be expected to repatriate. Even though there may have been a change of regime in the country, this may not always produce a complete change in the attitude of the population, nor, in view of his past experiences, in the mind of the refugee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>Id. </em>Applying this analysis, the BIA in <em>Chen </em>granted \u201chumanitarian asylum\u201d to an applicant who had been disabled by torture and the denial of medical care during China\u2019s \u201cCultural Revolution,\u201d and who was suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">This category of asylum is now codified at \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii), which provides that an IJ may grant an applicant humanitarian asylum on a discretionary basis if the applicant has demonstrated \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution,\u201d or \u201ca reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(in)(A), (B). As discussed above, \u201c[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he is a refugee.... The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">The BIA has interpreted this form of relief to require an applicant first to show \u201csevere harm\u201d and \u201clong-lasting effects.\u201d <em>See In re N-M-A, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 312, 326 (BIA 1998); <em>see also Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 n. 4 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he degree of deference is especially great in the field of immigration\u201d). Moreover, as persuasive authority, other circuits that have reviewed applications for humanitarian asylum have concluded that this relief is reserved for the most extraordinary cases. <em>See Gonahasa v. U.S. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that \u201c[e]ligibility for asylum based on severity of persecution alone is reserved for the most atrocious abuse\u201d); <em>Bucur v. INS, </em>109 F.3d 399, 405 (7th Cir.1997) (characterizing humanitarian asylum as being reserved for situations such as the German Jews, the victims of the Chinese \u201cCultural Revolution,\u201d and survivors of the Cambodian genocide); <em>Krastev v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1268, 1280 (10th Cir.2002) (explaining that past persecution must have been so severe that it would \u201cso sear a person with distressing associations with his native country that it would be inhumane to force him to return there, even though he is in no danger of future persecution\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>At the time of the hearing, Chavez\u2019s mother and his five younger siblings still were living in Guatemala. Although Chavez testified that \u201cthe previous guerillas\u201d had threatened to kill his family during the 1990s, he did not claim that this treatment resulted in \u201csevere harm\u201d or \u201clong-lasting effects.\u201d <em>See In re N-M-A, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. at 326. Additionally, as discussed above, Chavez conceded that he did not know who was responsible for the beating that Chavez contended resulted in his father\u2019s death, and Chavez did not establish a connection to the persecution his father personally suffered. <em>See Shehu v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 435, 440 (5th Cir.2006) (persuasive authority discussing that the facts that (1) the petitioner\u2019s father was kidnapped and executed, and (2) her husband was wounded, beaten, and subjected to attempted murder did not apply because they were not related to persecution personally suffered by the petitioner). Thus, Chavez failed to show either extreme past persecution or compelling reasons why humanitarian asylum was warranted in his case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a), (b)(1)(iii)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review whether Chavez\u2019s due-process rights were violated, or substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT. Furthermore, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief was supported by substantial evidence. We, therefore, dismiss Chavez\u2019s petition to the extent we lack jurisdiction and deny it to the extent he is seeking review of the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART.
