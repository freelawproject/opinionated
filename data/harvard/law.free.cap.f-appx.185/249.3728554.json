We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-26\">Jamison claims Jefferson Pilot denied her benefits after she became disabled from her job. Because the benefits plan at issue grants the plan administrator discretionary authority to make coverage determinations, we review the district court\u2019s judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bynum v. Cigna Healthcare of North Carolina, Inc., </em>287 F.3d 305, 311 (4th Cir. 2002). Jefferson Pilot\u2019s policy covering Jamison ended December 31, 1998. As Jamison failed to show that she was disabled prior to 1999, the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Jefferson Phot\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-27\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We also deny Jefferson Pilot\u2019s motion for damages and costs under Fed. R.App. P. 38 because we cannot conclude Jamison pursued this litigation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>malicious purposes, <em>see Dyntel Corp. v. Ebner, </em>120 F.3d 488, 493 (4th Cir.1997), nor has she previously filed numerous frivolous suits, <em>see Foley v. Fix, </em>106 F.3d 556, 558 (4th Cir.1997). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
