She received a 121-month sentence. On appeal, she argues that the district court erred in not giving her a two-level reduction for her role as a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and in ruling that it lacked the authority to use a ratio other than the 100:1 ratio established by Congress in calculating the advisory guideline range for a cocaine base offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">Randolph first argues that the court erred in denying her a reduction based on her role as a \u201cminor participant\u201d pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2004). The standard of review for factual determinations, such as whether the appellant\u2019s conduct warrants a minor-role sentencing reduction, is clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir.1989). A defendant who is only a \u201cminor participant\u201d in a criminal activity may have his offense level reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>by two levels. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b). This applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5). We find that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Randolph a two-level reduction for being a \u201cminor participant\u201d was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Randolph also claims that the court erred in ruling that it lacked authority to use a ratio other than the 100:1 ratio established by Congress in calculating the advisory guideline range for a cocaine base offense. Randolph\u2019s argument is foreclosed by Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 633-34 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court cannot vary from advisory sentencing range by substituting its own crack cocaine/powder cocaine ratio for the 100-to-l ratio established by Congress); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 876 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (upholding validity of 100-to-l sentencing disparity).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Randolph\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
