Chealy raises four issues on appeal: (1) did the district court err by denying his motion to suppress statements he made to police; (2) did the district court abuse its discretion by admitting Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) evidence of a recent drug deal at trial; (3) is \u00a7 922(g) unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him; and (4) did the use of prior convictions in sentencing him under the ACCA violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">On appeal, Chealy argues that the district court erred by finding that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights because the evidence presented at the suppression hearing demonstrated that the confession in this case was coerced. Based on the totality of the circumstances \u2014 being stopped in an aggressive manner, being approached with guns drawn, remaining handcuffed for the entire interrogation in an abandoned parking lot, implied promises of leniency for his cooperation, the lack of an explicit waiver on the <em>Miranda </em>card used to read Chealy his rights, and Lee County Narcotics Detective Paul Trombley\u2019s poor recollection of what rights Chealy was advised \u2014 Chealy argues that his statements to the police should have been suppressed because his waiver, if there even was a waiver, was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress evidence for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1102 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cIt is well established that \u2018[t]he government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (brackets in original). When considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, all facts are construed in a light most favorable to the successful party. <em>United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 510 (11th Cir.1994). As for credibility determinations, we \u201cmust accept the district court\u2019s credibility determination unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d at 1102 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court considered the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and held that the government \u201cmay not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation from the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. Accordingly, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Court delineated the following procedure that, although not constitutionally mandated, safeguards the right against compelled self-incrimination: (1) before a person in custody is interrogated, he must be informed in clear and unequivocal terms of his right to remain silent; (2) the admonition against self-incrimination must be accompanied by an explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court; (3) the person must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have a lawyer with him during the interrogation; and (4) the advice of the right to counsel must be accompanied by the explanation that, if the person is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 467-73, 86 S.Ct. at 1624-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">As with many rights, the accused may waive the right against self-incrimination, so long as the waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. A waiver is effective where the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension\u201d of the <em>Miranda </em>rights being waived. <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1141, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (internal quotations omitted). However, we have recognized that a statement is not given voluntarily if it is \u201cextracted by any sort of threats or violence, or obtained by any direct or implied promises, or by the exertion of any improper influence.\u201d <em>United States v. Veal, </em>153 F.3d 1233, 1244 n. 14 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">In the present case, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Chealy was read his Miranda rights, understood those rights, and knowingly and voluntarily waived them is amply supported. Taking the facts in a light most favorable to the government, Chealy was pulled over pursuant to a traffic stop and stopped only after he was cut off by a second police cruiser. The officers testified that they did not recall having their guns drawn when they approached Chealy\u2019s car, although had they done so, Trombley testified that such an action was appropriate because Chealy was known to have outstanding felony warrants. After handcuffing Chealy and placing him under arrest, the officers moved to an abandoned bank parking lot, out of the way of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">The testimony further established that Trombley never displayed his gun while questioning Chealy in the back of the patrol car, and that Chealy did not appear under the influence of drugs or alcohol or otherwise appear incoherent. Trombley obtained a card containing the standard Miranda warnings, and read the warnings to Chealy, who indicated that he understood the rights and agreed to answer Trombley\u2019s questions. Furthermore, the record does not reflect that Trombley offered Chealy any promises, but rather stated to Chealy that, while the state of Florida could do many things for Chealy on the drug charge, there was nothing that could be done for him in the state of Georgia, where he had outstanding warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">While Chealy took the stand at the hearing and denied having ever been read his Miranda rights and disputed the officers\u2019 version of events, he admitted that Trombley did not interrogate him with a gun drawn. With two conflicting stories, the court was left to make a credibility determination, one which this Court is not in a position to reject absent a firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>See Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d at 1102. Here, Chealy offered no evidence to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding that the officers\u2019 testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Lastly, Trombley\u2019s statements to Chealy regarding the state having many options on the drug charge was not sufficient to render Chealy\u2019s statements involuntary. \u201cA statement made by a law enforcement agent to an accused that the accused\u2019s cooperation would be passed on to judicial authorities and would probably be helpful to him is not a sufficient inducement so as to render a subsequent incriminating statement involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Davidson, </em>768 F.2d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir.1985). Informing Chealy that nothing could be done for him in Georgia, but that the state could possibly do \u201cmany things\u201d on the drug charge did not render Chealy\u2019s statements involuntary, especially in light of Trombley\u2019s testimony that he made clear that he could not make any promises. Because 'the district court did not err by finding that Chealy had knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">II. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Chealy argues that the district court erred by permitting the government to introduce at trial evidence of his March 4, 2004, drug sale to an undercover officer one week before his arrest on March 11, 2004, and argues that admitting the evidence made the trial a drug trial instead of a firearm-possession trial. Specifically, Chealy argues that the March 4 drug sale was not inextricably intertwined with the March 11 firearm-possession charge because a week separated the sale from his arrest, there was no evidence of drugs discovered during his arrest, and the only connection between the two events was that he was driving the same car. Chealy further argues that his willingness to stipulate that he had been validly stopped and arrested removed any probative value of the earlier drug sale. Finally, regardless of whether the evidence was inextricably intertwined, Chealy argues that the evidence should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 because the probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury, and the limiting instruction given by the court in this case was not clear enough to remove the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">We review the district court\u2019s rulings on admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe abuse of discretion standard has been described as allowing a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989). Put another way, \u201c[we] will only reverse an evidentiary ruling when it has affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 968, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts, is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Thus, extrinsic evidence of uncharged, criminal activities generally is considered inadmissible for proving that the defendant acted the same way in the charged offense, but is admissible if used for another purpose, such as to establish intent. <em>See id. </em>However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">[e]vidence of criminal activity other than the charged offense is not extrinsic under Rule 404(b) if it is (1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\"><em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">If the evidence is extrinsic and covered under Rule 404(b), it is admissible only if we determine that: \u201c(1) the evidence is relevant to an issue other than defendant\u2019s character; (2) there is sufficient proof to enable a jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the evidence possesses probative value outweighing any prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Clemons, </em>32 F.3d 1504, 1508 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The evidence at issue here is testimony from government witnesses regarding the March 4, 2004, drug sale made by Chealy to an undercover police officer, which resulted in the traffic stop and Chealy\u2019s arrest one week later on March 11. In <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>relied upon by both parties, a confidential informant purchased crack cocaine from the defendant on two occasions, June 29 and July 8, 1998, and on July 15, an officer engaged in surveillance of the defendant\u2019s home observed what he believed to be another drug transaction. 242 F.3d 1028, 1030 (11th Cir.2001). A search warrant was executed two days later, and, while no drugs were found in the residence, firearms were found in the home and in the defendant\u2019s truck. <em>Id. </em>The defendant was charged with two counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine based on the June 29 and July 8 transactions, and one count of unlawful possession of firearms by a convicted felon. <em>Id. </em>The defendant in <em>Thomas </em>plead guilty to the drug charges but proceeded to trial on the firearms charge. Like Chealy, the defendant in <em>Thomas </em>moved the court to exclude testimony relating to the drug transactions, and the court denied the motion, finding that the testimony was relevant to prove that the defendant had knowingly possessed the firearms and that the probative value outweighed any prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 1030-31. The court issued a limiting instruction, stating that the testimony regarding the drug activity could be considered only for the purpose of determining whether \u201cthe government is able to establish that these guns were knowingly possessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1031. Also, like Chealy, the defendant in <em>Thomas </em>took the position that the firearms were not his and that he had not been aware of their presence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">This Court, citing with approval cases from the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that hold that possession of illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia is relevant to determining whether a defendant knowingly possessed a firearm, concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting testimony regarding the drug transactions because they were \u201cin sufficiently close proximity, temporally and physically, to be relevant to proving that [the defendant] knowingly possessed the weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1031-32. This Court also noted that the policies underlying Rule 404(b) were inapplicable where \u201csome of the offenses committed as part of a single criminal episode become \u2018other acts\u2019 merely because the defendant is not indicted for all of his actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032-33. Thus, this Court held that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s drug trafficking did not amount to the use of bad character evidence to convict him of being a felon in possession of a firearm \u201cbecause the two offenses were not \u201cwholly separate and independent crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. Finally, this Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Chealy cannot distinguish his case from <em>Thomas. </em>Like in <em>Thomas, </em>the drug trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>actions offered at trial took place one week before Chealy\u2019s arrest, which led to a search of his vehicle that revealed a firearm. As Chealy himself points out in his brief, he drove the same vehicle on March 4 that he did on March 11 when he was arrested. Also, like in <em>Thomas, </em>Chealy claimed at the time of his arrest that the gun was not his and that he did not know it was in his vehicle. This Court in <em>Thomas </em>cited with approval an Eighth Circuit case that noted there is a \u201cclose and well-known connection between firearms and drugs,\u201d and in Chealy\u2019s case, the government offered the evidence of the March 4 drug sale to prove that Chealy knowingly possessed the firearm found under the driver\u2019s seat of his car. <em>Thomas, </em>242 F.3d at 1032. Like in <em>Thomas, </em>the evidence here \u201cdid not amount to the use of bad character evidence to convict [Chealy] of being a felon in possession of [a firearm]\u201d because the March 4 transaction was not a \u201cwholly separate and independent\u201d crime. <em>Id. </em>at 1033. Thus, the drug sale was inextricably intertwined with the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Moreover, the government, to prove its point that there is a well-known connection between drugs and firearms, offered the expert testimony of Sergeant Loethen, who said that, in his experience, well over 70% of narcotics cases involved firearms in some way. Chealy\u2019s wife further testified that, although she purchased the gun, Chealy kept it with him almost all of the time. Without having offered evidence of Chealy\u2019s March 4 drug transaction, this testimony would have no relevance at all, and the March 4 drug transaction was the direct reason for Chealy\u2019s arrest. Like in <em>Thomas, </em>the evidence of Chealy\u2019s drug trafficking \u201cwas admitted to prove knowing possession of the firearm[ ], not character.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>242 F.3d at 1033. Furthermore, the district court gave an appropriate limiting instruction, and, like in <em>Thomas, </em>the probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">To the extent Chealy argues that his offer to stipulate to his arrest removed any probative value from the March 4 drug transaction, his stipulation does not fall under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that it was an abuse of discretion in a \u00a7 922(g) prosecution to spurn a defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to being a convicted felon in favor of admitting the entire record of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, where the name and nature of the prior offense raises the risk of a verdict tainted by improper considerations and the evidence is solely to prove the element of prior conviction. 519 U.S. 172, 174, 117 S.Ct. 644, 647, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). In the instant case, Chealy was permitted to stipulate to the prior conviction forming an element of the \u00a7 922(g) offense, but his March 4 drug transaction was not the predicate felony relied upon by the government, and the March 4 transaction was offered as proof that Chealy knowingly possessed the firearm, a completely separate element of the offense. Accordingly, <em>Old Chief </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Lastly, to the extent Chealy argues that his firearm-possession trial was overwhelmed by evidence of drug crimes, he has not cited any cases that would warrant a reversal of his conviction, and the trial testimony\u2019s references to the March 4 drug crime and evidence linking drugs and firearms were made only because Chealy disputed that he knew the weapon was in the car and that the weapon was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of the March 4 drug transaction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>eventually led to Chealy\u2019s arrest one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">III. Constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Next, Chealy argues that his conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Commerce Clause because Congress is not permitted to regulate the purely intrastate possession of a firearm or ammunition absent a showing that such possession substantially affects interstate commerce. First, Chealy argues that for the statute to be constitutional, the intrastate possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a non-commercial activity, must substantially affect interstate commerce. Next, he argues that the statute\u2019s jurisdictional element, limiting application to firearms \u201cin or affecting commerce,\u201d does not serve to limit the statute\u2019s reach to constitutional applications because (1) the term \u201ccommerce\u201d is not defined for purposes of \u00a7 922(g); (2) other portions of \u00a7 922 explicitly limit its reach to \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce;\u201d and (3) Congress failed to include a requirement that the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon substantially affects commerce. Finally, applying these principles to his own case, Chealy argues that the government\u2019s testimony failed to establish that his possession substantially affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">We review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United, States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1225 (11th Cir.) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 368, 163 L.Ed.2d 77 (2005). Where a defendant challenges the sufficiency of proof that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce, this Court reviews \u201cthe evidence to determine whether \u2018a reasonable jury, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the government could find the defendant ] guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>355 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">We have consistently upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g). <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280. Indeed, we have noted that \u201cthe phrase \u2018in or affecting commerce\u2019 indicates a Congressional intent to assert its full Commerce Clause power,\u201d and that enactment of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional and stating that the statute \u201cis an attempt to regulate guns that have a connection to interstate commerce; the statute explicitly requires such a connection,\u201d and because the government demonstrated that the defendant\u2019s firearm previously had traveled in interstate commerce, the statute was constitutional as applied to him). \u201c[Ojnly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">To the extent Chealy raises an as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g), we have held that the \u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d language of \u00a7 922(g) is a jurisdictional element of the offense that the government is required to prove by demonstrating that the firearm and ammunition possessed by Chealy traveled in interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>355 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, the dispositive issue is whether a jury could rationally conclude, based on the evidence, that the firearm and ammunition seized from Chealy was possessed in and affecting interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>Section 922(g) is not unconstitutional either on its face or as applied to Chealy.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>IV. Prior Convictions and the Sixth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Lastly, Chealy argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury by enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), on the basis of three prior convictions that were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, nor admitted by him. While noting that the prior-conviction exception in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1232-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), has not been explicitly overruled, Chealy argues that the reasoning of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>has been \u201cgravely wounded,\u201d and that we should not \u201cstrain\u201d to make <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>fit the facts of this particular case. Lastly, Chealy argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>does not control because that case was limited to the Fifth Amendment rights to an indictment, due process, and notice, not the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Where a defendant makes a constitutional challenge to his sentencing enhancements, as did Chealy, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review, and will conduct a harmless-error review. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). We have held that there are two possible <em>Booker </em>errors, the first being the constitutional error of extra-verdict sentence enhancements in a mandatory guidelines system, and the second being the statutory error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291. For the constitutional error, the burden is on the government to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court applied the Guidelines as advisory, there is no statutory error present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment, and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that a defendant has prior convictions in order for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. 523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1232-33. Later, in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court declined to revisit the reasoning of <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>holding that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Most recently, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to a jury trial. 543 U.S. at 232-36, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In so doing, the Court re-affirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi-. </em>\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we have repeatedly held that nothing in <em>Booker </em>disturbed the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>or <em>Apprendi, </em>and that a district court, therefore, does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v.

We have held that we will continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until the Supreme Court explicitly overrules it. <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">We, therefore, conclude that the district court did not commit constitutional error by sentencing Chealy under \u00a7 924(e) based on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-11\">. <em>Miranda v.
