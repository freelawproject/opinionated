Petitioners also requested that this court order a new proceeding regarding changed country conditions in Indonesia. The Attorney General contends that Petitioners waived these arguments because they did not raise them on appeal to the Board. Failure to raise arguments before the Board constitutes a waiver of those issues and precludes review by this court. <em>See Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999). Our review of Petitioners\u2019 brief to the Board supports the Attorney General\u2019s argument, and we therefore do not review the underlying merits of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">As for the denial of Petitioners\u2019 request for asylum, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Petitioners failed to file within one year of the date of their arrival in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). Whether the application was filed within one year of Petitioners\u2019 admission to the United States is a question of fact; accordingly, this court has no jurisdiction to review the determination that the application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000); <em>Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 150-54 (2nd Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review, the underlying merits of Petitioners\u2019 asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-22\">We therefore dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-18\"> Petitioners filed only one application for asylum. Sumilat was identified as a beneficiary of Maleke's application for asylum, and did not apply for asylum in her own right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
