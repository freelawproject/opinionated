Pete and Lesa Hames (collectively, \u201cthe Hameses\u201d) claim that the district court erred by excluding the impeachment testimony offered by one of their witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>All of the Appellants contend that evidence is insufficient to support their convictions and that their sentences violate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM Appellants\u2019s convictions, VACATE their sentences and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Pete Hames and his wife, Lesa Hames, an attorney, owned and operated Alternate Nursing Care (\u201cANC\u201d), a Medicare-funded home healthcare agency. Medicare reimbursed ANC for the cost of care for Medicare patients through Palmetto Government Benefits Administrators (\u201cPalmetto\u201d), a subsidiary of South Carolina Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which contracted with the Health Care Financing Administration (\u201cHCFA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to administer the Medicare program in Texas. Medicare reimburses only certain expenses, does not reimburse the costs associated with \u201crelated parties\u201d or shell corporations, and does not allow providers to make a profit. At trial, the Government argued that, in 1996, the Hameses discovered that their reportable expenses were $600,000 less than what they had already received through estimated advances. The Government contended that instead of repaying this amount, with the help of Davis, a family friend and full-time maintenance worker at an apartment complex, they padded their expenses to keep the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">At trial, the Government presented evidence suggesting that Davis assisted Lesa Hames to claim $120,000 in consulting services by signing a false, backdated contract purporting to show that Davis was earning $20,000 per month for healthcare consulting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The Government also argued that Davis assisted Lesa Hames by acting as the straw owner of Accelerated Home Health Personnel (\u201cAccelerated\u201d), a fake employee leasing company that Lesa Hames created. According to the Government, although Accelerated did not exist until March 1996, Davis signed backdated documents created in 1996 to make it appear that the company entered into employee leasing contracts with ANC in mid-1995 and early 1996. After Lesa opened Accelerated, she transferred almost all of ANC\u2019s employees to the company and leased them back to ANC at an inflated rate. The Government suggests that ANC did not pay Accelerated the claimed employee leasing expenses. In addition, ANC did not actually pay Accelerated\u2019s employees more money. Instead, it continued to pay them the same amount as before the leasing agreement was executed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The Hameses, through their corporation RALA, also purchased a dilapidated office building in Irving (\u201cIrving building\u201d) for $140,000 and began costly renovations to it. Shortly thereafter, the Hameses transferred RALA and its only asset, the Irving building, to Davis in exchange for a promissory note for $1.2 million. At trial, the Government presented evidence that Davis later represented to the Bank of the West that he had made $700,000 in payments on this $1.2 million note to secure a $500,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>loan when the money actually came from the Hameses. In connection with this scheme, Davis signed blank checks, backdated documents, and various lease agreements used to pad the Hameses\u2019 expenses for Medicare reporting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">According to the Government, some of the Hameses\u2019 other fraudulent acts were simpler. For instance, Lesa Hames claimed as Medicare expenses the renovation of their home and the Irving building. In addition, while she used the Irving building for some non-Medicare related purposes, Lesa Hames claimed as a Medicare expense the entire amount of rent on the Irving building.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Government argued that Davis and the Hameses operated these schemes until 1998, when Palmetto\u2019s auditors discovered and disallowed the fraudulent expenses. Larry Seals, the Palmetto investigator, determined that between 1996 and 1998, Medicare overpaid Appellants $2.2 million. Davis and his wife received over $500,000 of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">At trial, the Government called twenty-three witnesses in its case-in-chief, including David Hames, Pete Hames\u2019s brother who also served as the accountant for the Hameses\u2019 companies. He testified that many of the Hameses\u2019 expenses were falsified in order to avoid reimbursing Medicare for being overpaid. During David Hames\u2019s cross-examination, the defense did not question him about any prior inconsistent statements. A week later, near the end of the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, Lesa Hames sought to introduce the testimony of Max Wayman, a defense investigator who interviewed David Hames before he began cooperating with the government investigation into ANC. Wayman was expected to testify that David Hames told him Appellants had not committed any crimes and that he believed the reported expenses were all legitimate. The Government objected to Waymaris testimony because the defense had not questioned David Hames about any prior inconsistent statements before attempting to proffer extrinsic evidence about them. The trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">On December 15, 2004, pursuant to the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on all counts charged in the indictment, the district court sentenced Lesa Hames to 102 months imprisonment and Pete Hames and Davis to 70 months imprisonment each. The court also ordered Lesa Hames and Davis to serve three years of supervised release. Finally, the court ordered Appellants to pay, jointly and severally, $2,885,020 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">This appeal followed. Davis also filed a motion for release pending appeal in which he argued that there was a substantial question whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that he knowingly committed fraud. The district court granted release, and the Government\u2019s appeal of this issue has been consolidated with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">A. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err by Excluding Waymaris Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">First, the Hameses contend that the trial court erred by excluding Waymaris testimony because the advisory committee\u2019s notes on the Federal Rules of Evidence suggest that the traditional requirement of providing the witness an opportunity to explain the contradictions before the admission of extrinsic evidence has been abolished.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s ruling on exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ragsdale, </em>426 F.3d 765, 774 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bocanegra v. Vicmar Servs., Inc., </em>320 F.3d 581, 584 (5th Cir. 2003)). If the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony, we will review that error for harmlessness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">When the Hameses proposed to offer the testimony of Max Wayman to impeach David Hames with his prior inconsistent statements, the district court excluded Wayman\u2019s testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 613(b). That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Hameses point to the advisory committee\u2019s notes on the Federal Rules of Evidence and <em>United States v. Bibbs, </em>564 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir.1977), to support their argument that the trial court erred by excluding Wayman\u2019s testimony. In light of the Hameses\u2019 obfuscation of the issue in <em>Bibbs, </em>our standard of review, and the amount of discretion afforded to the trial court, their reliance on <em>Bibbs </em>and the committee\u2019s notes is misguided. In <em>Bibbs, </em>the district court admitted extrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements made by a witness after she had testified, even though the proponent had not cross-examined her on the yet-to-be-made statements while she was still on the stand. <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed, noting that the trial judge has wide discretion; and, even if the case had fallen under Rule 613(b), that rule does not <em>\u201crequire </em>that impeachment foundation precede the impeaching witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1169 (emphasis added). <em>Bibbs </em>does not stand for the proposition that a district court abuses its discretion when it in fact requires a foundation before admitting extrinsic evidence of the impeachment. In <em>Bibbs, </em>we merely cited the Rule 613(b) in suggesting that it would not be reversible error for a court to allow the impeaching witness\u2019 testimony to precede the impeachment foundation. To hold otherwise would severely limit the trial courts\u2019 broad discretion in controlling the manner and presentation of evidence at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 611. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Wayman\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>B. <em>Evidence is Sufficient to Sustain the Hameses\u2019 Convictions For Making False Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Hameses also argue that, because they made false statements only to Palmetto, a private contractor, and Larry Seals, an auditor for Palmetto, they cannot be convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 and 1516. Specifically, they contend that their convictions cannot stand because the statutes require that falsehoods be made directly to a government agency or to an agent of the executive branch. The Government argues that, although Palmetto is a private company, because it acts as Medicare\u2019s agent, the evidence is sufficient to affirm the Hameses\u2019 convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 1001 and 1516.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We review the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found Appellants guilty of their charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Gray, </em>105 F.3d 956, 965 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cThe evidence is viewed \u2018in the light most favorable to the verdict, accepting all credibility choices and reasonable inferences made by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Blount, </em>98 F.3d 1489, 1494 (5th Cir.1996)). \u201cThe jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence and the evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d 878, 883 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Section 1001 permits for punishment of: \u201c[Wjhoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully \u2014 ... (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The Supreme Court has ruled that jurisdiction must be defined in a nontechnical manner and \u201ccovers all matters confided to the authority of an agency or department.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. 475, 479, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984). Accordingly, this Court has consistently held that false statements need not be made directly to the government to fall \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of\u2019 the government. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montemayor, </em>712 F.2d 104, 106-09 (5th Cir.1983) (finding that false statements to procure Texas birth certificates fell within the jurisdiction of \u00a7 1001 because \u201cthese false statements, although not made directly to the federal agency itself, may factually be held to be a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal agency\u201d); <em>United States v. Uni Oil, </em>646 F.2d 946, 954-55 (5th Cir.1981) (noting that \u201cit is well settled that a false statement need not be made directly to a federal agency in order to sustain a \u00a7 1001 conviction\u201d and finding no deficiencies in an indictment charging false statements that were made to refiners who ultimately used those statements to submit calculations as required by an executive agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The HCFA administers Medicare for the government. In so doing, HCFA eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tracts with local companies to perform audits and distribute funds. Pursuant to HCFA\u2019s contract, Palmetto administers the Medicare program in Texas. Palmetto\u2019s contractual responsibilities include receiving, adjudicating and paying Medicare claims with government money. Accordingly, because Palmetto acts as Medicare\u2019s agent, a rational trier of fact could have found the Hameses guilty of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Similarly, a rational trier of fact could have found Lesa Hames guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516, which criminalizes the deception of a Federal auditor. The statute expressly defines \u201cFederal auditor\u201d as \u201cany person employed on a ... contractual basis to perform an audit or a quality assurance inspect for or <em>on behalf of </em>the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516 (emphasis added). Relying on <em>United States v. Plasser American Corporation, </em>57 F.Supp.2d 140 (1999), however, Lesa Hames argues that only auditors paid directly by the United States, as opposed to auditors paid by an outside company who are then reimbursed by the United States, qualify under the statute. Her reliance on <em>Plasser </em>is misplaced. <em>Plasser </em>held that an auditor acting on behalf of federally funded Amtrak is not a Federal auditor for purposes of \u00a7 1516. Here, Palmetto is both federally funded and performing an audit at the direct behest of, and certainly on behalf of, the United States. Thus, the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support Lesa Hames\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">C. <em>Evidence is Sufficient to Sustain the Jury\u2019s Verdict on Davis\u2019s Intent to Defraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Davis argues he lacked an intent to defraud, and that consequently, the jury\u2019s verdict against him must be overturned for lack of sufficient evidence. \u201cThe requisite intent to defraud is established if the defendant acted knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive, ordinarily for the purpose of causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Doke, </em>171 F.3d 240, 243 (5th Cir.1999). Specific intent can be proven through circumstantial evidence and inferences. <em>United States v. Ismoila, </em>100 F.3d 380, 387 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201c[P]roof of [] intent can arise \u2018by inference from all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Keller, </em>14 F.3d 1051, 1056 (5th Cir.1994))); <em>see also United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 277 (5th Cir.2002)(noting that \u201c[cjircumstances altogether inconclusive, if separately considered, may, by their number and joint operation, especially when corroborated by moral coincidences, be sufficient to constitute conclusive proof [of intent]\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Lechuga, </em>888 F.2d 1472 (5th Cir.1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The jury simply did not believe that Davis lacked the intent to defraud. A reasonable construction of the evidence is such that a rational trier of fact could conclude that Davis at some point formed an intent to defraud. <em>See Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d at 289-90 (sufficient evidence for jury to infer deliberate indifference to fraud when defendant was aware of billing mistakes but simply directed a consultant to fix them); <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>20 F.3d 593, 599 (sufficient evidence for jury to disbelieve defendants\u2019 story because of their circuitous route and disheveled appearance at the time of the crime). The record is replete with evidence that Davis had the intent to defraud. The record reflects that Davis signed numerous false, backdated contracts to help the Hameses pad their expenses for Medicare reporting purposes. In addition, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>could have believed that Davis routed ANC\u2019s Medicare funds to the Hameses\u2019 personal accounts and represented to the Bank of West that he had made $700,000 in payments on a $1.2 million note for the Irving building to secure a $500,000 loan. As a result, Davis and his wife received nearly $500,000 from all of these activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Given the evidence and the fact that this court does \u201cnot lightly overturn a determination by the trier of fact that the accused possessed the requisite intent,\u201d we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict against Davis. <em>See United States v. Robichaux, </em>995 F.2d 565, 570 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Aubrey, </em>878 F.2d 825, 827 (5th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">D. <em>Evidence is Sufficient to Sustain the Jury\u2019s Verdict on the Materiality of Davis\u2019s Misrepresentations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Davis also claims that his conviction for bank fraud must be reversed because the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find that his misrepresentations to the Bank of the West were material. Davis represented to the bank that he had purchased a building for $1.2 million and made $700,000 in payments on it, even though the original purchase price was only $140,000 and the Hameses supplied the money. He validated these representations through falsified documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">A statement is material if it \u201chas a natural tendency to influence, or was capable of influencing the decision of\u2019 the lending institution. <em>United States v. Heath, </em>970 F.2d 1397, 1403 (5th Cir.l992)(quoting <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 770, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Bill Wood, a Bank of the West employee testified that the fact that Davis stated that he paid $700,000 on the $1.2 million note influenced the decision to approve Davis\u2019s loan. This alone is sufficient for a jury to conclude that Davis\u2019s misrepresentations were material, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">E. <em>Appellants\u2019 Sentences Violate Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">' Appellants were sentenced pre<em>Booker. </em>They argue that their sentences violate the Sixth Amendment because they were based in part on facts that were neither admitted by them nor found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. Additionally, they argue that the district court erred by sentencing them pursuant to a mandatory application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government concedes that Appellants all preserved their <em>Booker </em>objections at the district court\" by citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). It further concedes that it cannot demonstrate that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the cases must be remanded for resentencing in accordance \"with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Appellants also argue that <em>ex post facto </em>and due process concerns preclude the district court from applying Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>on remand. Those arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-77 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See also United States v. Cruz, </em>418 F.3d 481, 484 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005) (not considering ex post facto/due process challenges because the case was remanded for resentencing, but noting that those challenges were foreclosed).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Appellants\u2019s convictions, VACATE then-sentences, and REMAND for resentencing. Having affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>we refer the Government\u2019s appeal of the motion for his release pending appeal to the district court for consideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The Government claimed that, notwithstanding the fact that Davis was Accelerated\u2019s owner, his sole task was to sign paychecks. He did not hire, fire, or otherwise manage the leased employees. In addition, evidence reflects that, even after Accelerated and ANC discontinued their purported lessor-lessee relationship, Davis routed ANC\u2019s Medicare funds from Accelerated to the Hameses' personal accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">.
