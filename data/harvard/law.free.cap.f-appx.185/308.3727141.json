The question in this case is <em>when </em>a policyholder must be a resident to have its claim covered by PCIGC. We hold that the statute requires a policyholder to be a resident of Maryland at the time the policy is issued. The district court\u2019s summary judgment to the contrary \u2014 that the statute requires residency at the time the claim is submitted to PCIGC \u2014 is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">PCIGC is a private, nonprofit, nonstock corporation that collects assessments for and administers Maryland\u2019s guaranty fund. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Ins. \u00a7 9-302. PCIGC steps into \u201cthe shoes of the insolvent insurer,\u201d <em>Igwilo v. PCIGC, </em>131 Md.App. 629, 750 A.2d 646, 650 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and, subject to certain limits, fulfills the obligations that the insolvent insurer should have fulfilled to Maryland residents, <em>Joe Shifflett, Inc. v. PCIGC, </em>77 Md.App. 706, 551 A.2d 913, 915 (1989). The corporation\u2019s avowed purpose is to \u201cprovide a mechanism for the prompt payment of covered claims under certain policies and to avoid financial loss to residents of [Maryland] who are claimants or policyholders of an insolvent insurer.\u201d \u00a7 9-302(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Insurance companies must be members of PCIGC as a condition of their authority to transact business in Maryland. \u00a7 9-304(b). As members, they must pay an annual assessment to cover the expenses of PCIGC, including expenses arising from any member\u2019s insolvency. \u00a7 9-306(d). This assessment, levied by PCIGC, is in the same proportion that \u201cthe net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year ... bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.\u201d \u00a7 9-306(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Manor Care of America, Inc. (Manor Care) is a Delaware corporation that owns and operates nursing homes and other long-term health care facilities throughout the country. Manor Care had its principal place of business in Maryland until September 1998, when it moved to Ohio. From June 1,1993, through June 1,1997, while a resident of Maryland, Manor Care was insured under a comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by PHICO Insurance Company (PHICO), a company authorized to sell insurance in Maryland. Manor Care contends that the premiums it paid to PHICO during this four-year period were remitted in part to PCIGC as part of PHICO\u2019s annual assessment, though PCIGC disputes this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">In February 2002 PHICO was declared insolvent and ordered into liquidation by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. Manor Care thereafter requested that PCIGC fulfill the obligations that PHICO should have fulfilled under the policy: that is, cover liability claims asserted against Manor Care (and its related affiliates and subsidiaries) for incidents occurring during the policy period, June 1, 1993, through June 1, 1997. PCIGC repeatedly refused to provide coverage on the ground that Manor Care is not a Maryland resident under the guaranty fund statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In December 2002 Manor Care sued PCIGC in diversity in the U.S. District for the District of Maryland, seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that its claims are \u201ccovered claims\u201d under \u00a7 9-301(d), and (2) damages from PCIGC\u2019s failure to defend and indemnify it against malpractice and other claims that would have been covered by its policy with PHICO. The district court allowed limited discovery on whether the claims are covered under \u00a7 9-301(d). The parties stipulated that none of the parties suing Manor Care (the claimants) are Maryland residents. After the limited discovery ended, PCIGC filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Manor Care is not a Maryland resident within the meaning of \u201ccovered claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The district court granted summary judgment to PCIGC upon concluding that eligibility for coverage turns on current residency \u2014 that is, residency at the time the policyholder submits a claim to PCIGC. Because Manor Care was not a Maryland resident in 2002 when it submitted its claims to PCIGC, the court concluded that Manor Care\u2019s claims are not \u201ccovered claims\u201d under \u00a7 9-301(d). Manor Care appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The dispute centers on when a policyholder must be a Maryland resident for a claim to be a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 9-301(d)(l)(i)(l). \u201cCovered claim\u201d is defined in part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">an insolvent insurer\u2019s unpaid obligation, including an unearned premium[,] that ... arises out of a policy of the insolvent insurer <em>issued to a resident </em>or payable to a resident on behalf of an insured of the insolvent insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cResident,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201can individual domiciled in the State\u201d or a \u201ccorporation or entity whose principal place of business is in the State.\u201d \u00a7 9-301(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">PCIGC argues that to qualify for coverage a policyholder must be a current resident, specifically, a resident at the time it submits a claim to PCIGC (and after its insurer has gone insolvent). Manor Care counters that current residency has no bearing on whether a claim is covered. Rather, residency at the time that the relevant insurance policy was issued is controlling. Because Manor Care was a resident of Maryland when PHICO issued the policy on June 1, 1993, and renewed it on June 1, 1994, June 1, 1995, and June 1, 1996, Manor Care maintains that it is a resident within the meaning of \u201ccovered claim,\u201d \u00a7 9-301(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Maryland\u2019s rules of statutory interpretation are in line with the norm. \u201cThe cardinal rule ... is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The starting point for determining legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. Courts generally do not look beyond the statute\u2019s words if they are \u201cplain and free from ambiguity, and expressf ] a definite and simple meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the statutory language is ambiguous, courts consider \u201cnot only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986). In case of ambiguity, courts \u201cmay [also] consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 668 A.2d 1, 2 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We agree with Manor Care\u2019s reading of the statute. For a claim to be covered, it must arise out of an insurance policy that was \u201cissued to a resident.\u201d \u00a7 9-301(d)(l)(i)(l). The meaning of this phrase is plain and free from ambiguity. The phrase unmistakably tethers the residency requirement to a particular event, the issuance of the policy. To be eligible for coverage, a policyholder must have been a Maryland resident when the policy was issued, not when the claim is submitted to PCIGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This interpretation is not upended by the statute\u2019s present-tense definition of a corporate \u201cresident.\u201d \u00a7 9-301(h)(2) (\u201c \u2018Resident\u2019 means ... a corporation ... whose principal place of business is in the State.\u201d). When the definition of a corporate resident is read into the \u201cissued to a resident\u201d language in \u00a7 9 \u2014 301(d)(l)(i)(l), it is clear that the Maryland residency must be contemporaneous with the issuance of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Although we find no ambiguity in the provision at issue, further analysis reveals that our straightforward reading is in line with \u201c[t]he setting, the objectives and purpose of the [guaranty fund] enactment.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>517 A.2d at 732. Our reading, moreover, achieves a result that is logical, reasonable, and consistent with common sense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In 1986 the Maryland legislature established PCIGC in its current form, creating a self-financing guaranty fund. <em>See Ward Elec. Servs., Inc. v. PCIGC, </em>325 Md. 1, 599 A.2d 81, 85-86 (1991) (discussing concerns of General Assembly and aims of 1986 enactments). The legislature made clear that PCIGC is not \u201c \u2018an instrumentality of the State\u2019 \u201d and that its liabilities are not the State\u2019s. <em>Id., </em>599 A.2d at 86 (citing preamble, Chapter 161 of Acts of 1986). PCIGC is instead a private corporation that assesses each of its members, or authorized insurers, an annual fee \u201cin amounts necessary to pay\u201d its expenses, including the covered claims of insolvent insurers. \u00a7 9-306(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">As a practical matter, a portion of the premiums that Maryland residents pay to authorized insurers are passed onto PCIGC in the form of annual assessments. As the Maryland Court of Appeals has observed, \u201cThe legislative purpose [behind PCIGC] was to protect Maryland policyholders <em>who would pay as part of their premiums the assessments levied by PCIGC </em>to pay the covered claims in the [indemnity company\u2019s] insolvency.\u201d <em>Ward Elec. Servs., Inc., </em>599 A.2d at 86 (emphasis added). In light of this purpose, it would be illogical to exclude from coverage a policyholder that was a resident when its policy was issued and whose premiums helped finance PCIGC, but award coverage to a new or recent resident whose premiums did not support the guaranty fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">PCIGC\u2019s counterarguments are unavailing. PCIGC points primarily to the statute\u2019s legislative history and divergence from the Model Insurance Guaranty Association Act (Model Act) to argue that only claims of current residents are covered. The legislative history, as sparse as it is, does not support PCIGC\u2019s position. Before 1975 the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d specified that the claimant or insured must be \u201ca resident of this State at the time of the insured event.\u201d 1975 Md. Laws, ch. 651 at 2999 (setting forth in brackets the language to be deleted by amendments). In 1975 the Maryland legislature deleted this language as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d and adopted the current definition with its \u201cissued to a resident\u201d language. (The legislature added the affiliated definition of \u201cresident\u201d eleven years later, in 1986. <em>See </em>1986 Md. Laws, ch. 440.) Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>cording to PCIGC, the Maryland legislature intended this change to benefit current residents, not past residents. This argument goes too far, however. The Maryland legislature, by deleting \u201cresident at the time of the insured event,\u201d did not delete <em>all </em>references to past events; it simply replaced one past referent with another. Instead of being a resident at the time of the insured event, the policyholder must be a resident when the insurance policy was issued. For example, if a one-year policy was issued to a Maryland resident on January 1, 2004, the policyholder would still be considered a \u201cresident\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 9-301(d) if it had moved to another state by the time that the event giving rise to the claim occurred, say six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">For similar reasons, PCIGC\u2019s reliance on the relevant Model Act is unpersuasive. Like the pre-1975 Maryland statute, the Model Act incorporates the phrase, \u201cresident of this state at the time of the insured event,\u201d into the definition of \u201ccovered claim.\u201d Model Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n Act \u00a7 5(F)(1). PCIGC contends that as of 1975 the Maryland legislature intended its guaranty fund statute to diverge from the Model Act and benefit only current residents, not past residents. <em>Cf Bethesda Mgmt. Servs. Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Licensing and Regulation, </em>276 Md. 619, 350 A.2d 390, 395 (1976) (explaining in another context that the Maryland legislature, in adopting but sightly altering the Model State Administrative Procedure Act, left \u201clittle doubt\u201d that it intended to modify that particular model act). Endorsing Manor Care\u2019s interpretation would, in PCIGC\u2019s view, contravene this legislative intent by effectively adopting the Model Act\u2019s language. But, as just explained, our holding today does <em>not </em>align the Maryland statute with the Model Act. Rather, it recognizes what the plain language and the statutory purpose make clear. A policyholder, to be eligible for coverage, must be a resident at the time its insurance policy was issued, not at the time of the insured event (as the Model Act provides) or at the time of submitting a claim to PCIGC (as PCIGC urges).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to PCIGC. A policyholder is a Maryland resident within the meaning of \u00a7 9-301(d)(l)(i)(l) if it was a resident when its insurance policy was issued. Because Manor Care was a Maryland resident between 1993 and 1997, it satisfies the residency requirement for a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the statute. On remand the district court will enter summary judgment in favor of Manor Care on the residency issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b340-8\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ADL\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">I concur in the result reached by the majority. I write separately to note that I would hold that the statutory phrase \u201cissued to a resident\u201d is ambiguous. Under Maryland law, a statute is ambiguous \u201c[wjhen there is more than one reasonable interpretation\u201d of the statute. <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 879 A.2d 1111, 1113 (2005). I believe that the phrase \u201cissued to a resident\u201d could reasonably be interpreted to mean (1) issued to one who was a resident at the time the policy was issued, or (2) issued to one who is currently a resident. Notwithstanding this ambiguity, I believe that the legislative history and policy behind the statute, as discussed in the majority opinion, lead to the conclusion that the majority\u2019s result is correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
