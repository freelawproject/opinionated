McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). Ramsey alleged that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when defendant nurse Spoores caused an injury to his ear while cleaning it on April 3, 2003, and the other defendants failed to treat him. Following the <em>Spears </em>hearing, at which Ramsey was questioned about his allegations and about his prison medical records, the magistrate judge determined that Ramsey was alleging only negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Ramsey argues that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous, in failing to grant him an opportunity to amend his complaint, and by using his medical records to counter his allegations. Although Ramsey has suggested that Spoores intentionally damaged his ear by using the \u201cwrong\u201d syringe attachment, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that these allegations suggested only a non-cognizable claim of negligent treatment. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 839-40, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The magistrate judge did not err in using Ramsey\u2019s medical records to elicit his admissions that a nurse Hodges had given him medications and that Ramsey had been repeatedly treated by defendant Dr. Nafrawi. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Wilson v. Barrientos, </em>926 F.2d 480, 481 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1991). Finally, that Ramsey may have written two letters about his medical treatment to defendant Warden Duke was insufficient to establish the causal connection necessary to show that Duke was personally liable. <em>See Evett v. DETNTFF, </em>330 F.3d 681, 689 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">For the reasons discussed above, we affirm. The affirmance of the dismissal of Ramsey\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Ramsey is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
