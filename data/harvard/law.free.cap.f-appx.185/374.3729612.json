He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rodriguez contends that \u00a7 1326(b) must be severed from the remainder of the statute and his conviction reduced to one under \u00a7 1326(a). The Government argues that the waiver provisions in Rodriguez\u2019s plea agreement preclude his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) and that he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">However, Rodriguez cannot succeed in this appeal because his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in hght of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the'basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lapez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in fight of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
