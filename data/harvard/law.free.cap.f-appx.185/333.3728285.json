Vu argues that the immigration judge (IJ) erred when he precluded any witnesses other than Vu from testifying on Vu\u2019s behalf and that this error violated Vu\u2019s due process right to fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">This court does not have to determine whether the IJ erred because there was substantial evidence in the record before the BIA to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Vu\u2019s positive equities were outweighed by his negative attributes. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Vu is not entitled to relief since he is unable to establish that any error made his hearing fundamentally unfair, might have led to the denial of justice, or caused him substantial prejudice. <em>See Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Animashaun v. INS, </em>990 F.2d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Vu also argues the IJ mistakenly determined that Vu\u2019s prior \u00a7 212(c) waiver made him ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver now. The IJ did not make such a determination; he found that Vu did not deserve another opportunity to remain in the country. Accordingly, Vu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
