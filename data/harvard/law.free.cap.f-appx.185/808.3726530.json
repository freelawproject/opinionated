We apply the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), because he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion after the act\u2019s effective date. We granted a Certificate of Appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGy\">Whether the district court erred by concluding that Lattimore knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to raise an ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in light of the magistrate judge\u2019s (1) failure to inform Lattimore at the plea colloquy that he was waiving his right to collaterally attack his sentence and (2) statement at the colloquy that Lattimore was not waiving his right to the effective assistance of counsel by entering into a guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">As we discuss in detail below, we find that Lattimore did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 habeas motion, and remand for consideration of the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">Lattimore\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver wherein he waived the right to challenge his sentence \u201cdirectly or collaterally, on any ground except for an upward departure by the sentencing judge or a sentence above the statutory maximum or a sentence in violation of the law apart from the sentencing guidelines, or the applicability of the \u2018safety valve\u2019 provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Lattimore argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>that because the magistrate judge did not specifically discuss his sentence appeal waiver with him at his change of plea hearing, his waiver was not knowing and voluntary. He contends that the district court erred when it (1) expressly advised him that he did not give up his right to effective assistance of counsel by pleading guilty, and (2) failed to advise him that he was giving up the right to collaterally attack his sentence. Lattimore further argues that it is not otherwise \u201cmanifestly clear\u201d from the record that he understood the full significance of the waiver, and that the requirements of <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351-52 (11th Cir. 1993), were not met. Finally, he asserts that, even if the appeal waiver was valid, it did not waive his \u00a7 2255 challenge concerning ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Whether an appeal waiver is enforceable is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1352. We will enforce a sentence appeal waiver if the government demonstrates either that \u201c(1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. For instance, during the plea colloquy, it is insufficient for the district court to merely inform the defendant that he may appeal \u201cunder some circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352-53. Rather, the court must explain to the defendant, with specificity, the nature and extent of the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>131 F.3d 1005, 1008 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Here, the magistrate judge, during the Rule 11 colloquy, explained to Lattimore that he had the right to plead not guilty, the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to a jury trial, and \u201cthe right to the effective assistance of a lawyer at every stage of the proceedings.\u201d The magistrate judge further explained that by pleading guilty, Lattimore waived all of these rights except for the right to effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate judge also examined the plea agreement and explained that Lattimore had \u201cthe right to appeal any sentence imposed by the District Judge on any ground.\u201d The magistrate judge further explained that under the plea agreement Lattimore was waiving the right to appeal his sentence on any ground except five grounds that the magistrate judge expressly enumerated. The magistrate judge continued, \u201cBut except in those five circumstances ..., [Lattimore] would not be allowed to appeal.\u201d When asked if he understood, Lattimore responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Viewing the magistrate judge\u2019s statements as a whole, Lattimore reasonably could have understood that he reserved his right to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, in a \u00a7 2255 motion. The magistrate judge stated and reiterated that, by pleading guilty, Lattimore was not waiving his right to the effective assistance of counsel throughout the proceedings, including sentencing. Although the magistrate judge, in explaining the sentence appeal waiver, stated that Lattimore had only five bases under which he could appeal his sentence, this was not enough to overcome the impression created by the magistrate judge\u2019s earlier statements regarding Lattimore\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel throughout the criminal proceedings. Given the lack of clarity, we are not satisfied that Lattimore knowingly and voluntarily waived his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>right to claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during sentencing. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1352-53 (finding a waiver unenforceable given the district court\u2019s confusing language). Additionally, a thorough review of the record fails to show that Lattimore \u201cotherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Lattimore\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and remand for consideration of the merits of Lattimore\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-14\">. In a case involving a sentence-appeal waiver nearly identical to Lattimore's, we held that the petitioner had waived his right to appeal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to his sentencing. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1341 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 246, 163 L.Ed.2d 226 (2005). However, we did not reach the issue of whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary, <em>id. </em>at 1341 n. 1, which is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">. The magistrate judge later explained that the defendant had other trial rights (i.e., the right to confront witnesses, and the right to testify on his own behalf), and reiterated that those rights \"[would] all go away\u201d except for the right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
