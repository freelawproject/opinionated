For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-23\">It is well-settled that whether to file a 35(b) motion is a matter left to the government\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b); <em>see also United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993). However, a court may grant a downward departure in the absence of a government motion if: (1) the government has obligated itself in the plea agreement to move for a departure or (2) the government\u2019s refusal to move for a departure was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We find neither circumstance present here and thus conclude the Government retained absolute discretion as to whether to pursue a Rule 35(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion to withdraw its previously filed conditional Rule 35(b) motion and the order denying Keller\u2019s motion for reconsideration for the reasons stated by the district court. We dispense with oral ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>gnment because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
