California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, the record, and the appellant\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The motion for leave to supplement pleadings with a memorandum of law is DENIED as unnecessary as we have considered the appellant\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
