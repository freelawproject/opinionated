Because he had a prior drug conviction, to which he admitted, Hall was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) of 120 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Hall challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 851 after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because \u00a7 851 allows the government to increase the maximum punishment without proving the facts supporting the increase to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or alleging those facts in an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">We find Hall\u2019s allegation that \u00a7 851 is unconstitutional foreclosed by the prior conviction exception discussed in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005) (recognizing continuing validity of prior conviction exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
