Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000), Spinks was sentenced as an armed career criminal. After calculating each of his offenses, the presentence report set a range of 595 to 653 months\u2019 imprisonment under the advisory sentencing guidelines. The district court sentenced Spinks to the shortest term possible under the applicable statutes, 540 months\u2019 imprisonment, determining this sentence to be reasonable given Spinks\u2019 age. Spinks now appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Spinks contends the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal on all counts but the fifth, to which he admitted his guilt at trial. We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United States v. Lentz, </em>383 F.3d 191, 199 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 979, 125 S.Ct. 1828, 161 L.Ed.2d 732 (2005). Where, as here, the motion was based on insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We have \u201cdefined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">With these principles in mind, we find a reasonable factfinder would find the evidence sufficient to support Spinks\u2019 convictions. For his part, Spinks characterizes the officers who testified at trial as unreliable and urges a finding that his testimony was credible. However, in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not \u201cweigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). Where the evidence supports differing reasonable interpretations, the jury decides which interpretation to believe. <em>Id., </em>In this case, the jury found the testimony of the officers to be credible and Spinks\u2019 testimony to lack credibility. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find the district court did not err in denying Spinks\u2019 Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Spinks also contends his sentence as an armed career criminal violates the Sixth Amendment. However, he acknowledges this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1463,164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006) (holding that the use of prior offenses to invoke the statutory armed career criminal enhancement under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) is permissible without indictment presentment or jury submission so long as no facts extraneous to the facts necessary to support the enhancement need be decided to invoke the enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Spinks\u2019 convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
