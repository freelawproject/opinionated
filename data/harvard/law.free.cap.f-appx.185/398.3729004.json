He was sentenced to 72 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Carranza argues that the district court erred in treating his Texas burglary conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(n). Because burglary of a habitation is the equivalent of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d and is therefore an enumerated offense, Carranza\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, n. 1(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">Carranza argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred when it imposed a condition of supervised release that requires him to cooperate in the collection of his DNA. Carranza\u2019s claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim, and this portion of the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-21\">Carranza challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Carranza\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Carranza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carranza concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
