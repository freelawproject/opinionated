Defendant argues that the sentence imposed must be remanded under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court deemed the Guidelines mandatory. Because the Government does not address Defendant\u2019s appeal waiver, it has waived its right to enforce it. <em>See United States v. Lang, </em>440 F.3d 212, 213 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">Regardless whether the error Defendant has identified is characterized as a <em>Booker </em>or Fanfan error <footnotemark>**</footnotemark>, Defendant preserved that error by raising a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397 (5th Cir. 2006). When a preserved <em>Booker </em>or Fan-fan error is presented, as here, this court looks to whether the Government has met its burden to show harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt in the imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>Based on the record before the court, this court cannot determine what the district court would have done absent the mandatory Guidelines. Therefore, the Government has not met its burden of proving that the <em>Booker </em>or Fanfan error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-22\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses prohibit the district court from applying <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial opinion to her case was squarely rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Defendant\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b464-19\"><em> See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.)
