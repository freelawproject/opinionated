Because it is plain on the record that Jung waived his right to appeal, the BIA was authorized to dismiss his appeal summarily without further briefing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(G), (e)(3). The BIA\u2019s finding that Jung made no argument in his notice of appeal challenging that waiver is conclusive, because no reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See id. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-23\">Because Jung did not raise, before the BIA, a challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Accordingly, this court is precluded from reviewing his argument that the appeal waiver was not made knowingly and intelligently. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1). Similarly, we will not address Jung\u2019s argument, not raised before the BIA, that he was denied due process before the IJ because he did not have representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The petition for review is DENIED. Jung\u2019s motion for stay of removal pending resolution of the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
