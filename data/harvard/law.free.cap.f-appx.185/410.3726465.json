Because Reynolds was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Reynolds\u2019s argument that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights and his Sixth Amendment rights when it sentenced him based on a drug amount found by a preponderance of the evidence and not on the drug amount found by the jury is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006). Reynolds\u2019s argument that the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>does not apply to him, because he committed his offense before <em>Booker </em>was decided, is likewise unavailing. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Reynolds\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court followed the guidelines recommendation for offenses involving crack cocaine does not amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v.
