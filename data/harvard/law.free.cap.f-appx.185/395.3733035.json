Galvan\u2019s argument that his prior burglary conviction in Texas does not qualify as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). Gal-van\u2019s argument that this court did not properly apply the categorical analysis of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), is tantamount to arguing that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was wrongly decided. <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>resolved the issue raised in this case; one panel of this court may not ignore the precedent set by a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999). Because Galvan\u2019s conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) and provided a basis for the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement of his offense level, this court need not address whether his prior robbery conviction in Texas was also a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Galvan also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Galvan contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Galvan properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
