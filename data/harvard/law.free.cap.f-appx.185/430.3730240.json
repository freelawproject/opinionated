Maracalin challenges his underlying conviction and sentence by arguing that: (1) he was not advised of the nature of charges against him during the guilty-plea colloquy in violation of Fed.R.CrimP. 11(c)(1); (2) he was arrested pursuant to a non-existent indictment and thus the prosecutor, arresting officers, and the court committed fraud; (3) he was sentenced in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); (4) his indictment should be dismissed because it failed to allege that he was being charged pursuant to the penalty provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); (5) the use of judicially-found facts in determining his sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (6) <em>Apprendi </em>applies retroactively to his case; and (7) his indictment should be dismissed because it failed to charge a drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Athough Maracalin seeks to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he has not shown that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). To the extent Maracalin argues that the <em>Booker </em>or <em>Apprendi </em>lines of authority apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and entitle him to file a \u00a7 2241 petition, his argument is unavailing in light of <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
