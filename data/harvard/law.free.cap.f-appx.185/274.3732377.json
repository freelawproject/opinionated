On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues: whether (1) the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in conducting Florence\u2019s plea hearing, and (2) the sentence was reasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">We do not find that the district court plainly erred at Florence\u2019s plea hearing. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 393 (4th Cir.2002) (stating review standard). The court complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in conducting the hearing. Next, we do not find that Florence\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (stating review standard); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (same). Therefore, these claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>We have examined the entire record in this case, in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
