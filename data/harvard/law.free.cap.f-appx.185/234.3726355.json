She asserts that the district court plainly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), in making a two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2004), based on her perjured trial testimony. The government concedes error under <em>Booker. </em>For the reasons explained below, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. We grant Bokel\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, but conclude that her claims of ineffective assistance are not properly raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The district court determined at the sentencing hearing, over Bokel\u2019s objection, that she had obstructed justice by giving perjured testimony at trial. With the adjustment for obstruction of justice, Bokel\u2019s guideline range was 27-33 months. The court imposed a sentence of thirty-three months imprisonment. We agree with Bokel and the government that Bokel\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker. </em>Based only on the facts found by the jury and without the two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice found applicable by the court over her objection, Bokel\u2019s offense level would have been 16. Because she was in criminal history category I, her guideline range would have been 21-27 months. Bokel\u2019s sentence of thirty-three months thus exceeded the maximum sentence permissible based on facts found by the jury. We conclude that Bokel has demonstrated plain error that warrants correction. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Bokel has submitted a pro se supplemental brief in which she claims that her appointed attorney\u2019s assistance has been ineffective in several respects and that the district court erred in refusing to appoint new counsel. To succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal, a defendant must show conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (providing standard and noting that ineffective assistance of counsel claims generally should be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000)). Here, the record does not conclusively demonstrate that Bokel\u2019s counsel was ineffective. Therefore, her claims are not properly raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. We </em>grant Bokel\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
