Adams argues on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint under the Younger<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine because federal courts must intervene whenever they have the power and there is an injury, and alternatively, that his loss of freedom constitutes a sufficient irreparable injury to justify intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-20\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-21\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has said that federal courts have a \u2018virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\u2019 But \u2018virtually\u2019 is not \u2018absolutely,\u2019 and in exceptional cases federal courts may and should withhold equitable relief to avoid interference with state proceedings. While non-abstention remains the rule, the <em>Younger </em>exception is an important one.\u201d <em>31 Foster Children v. Bush, </em>329 F.3d 1255, 1274 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted). \u201cAlthough <em>Younger </em>concerned state criminal proceedings, its principles are \u2018fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Younger </em>doctrine bars federal court intervention in state noncriminal proceedings where the proceedings constitute an ongo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>ing state judicial proceeding, the proceedings implicate important state interests, and there is an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">As alleged in his complaint, Adams\u2019s state child support enforcement case falls within these three prongs. The conduct he seeks to enjoin \u2014 a civil contempt finding accompanied by a threat of jail \u2014 indicates that the proceeding is pending. The ability to collect child support payments is an important state interest. Adams has also indicated that he had the opportunity to not only raise his constitutional issues in the state court proceedings, but also appeal them to a Florida District Court of Appeals. Therefore, we conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion by abstaining, under the <em>Younger </em>doctrine, from exercising its jurisdiction over Adams\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\">. <em>Younger v.
