(OMV), brought this action in Superior Court to recover unpaid rent on two commercial leases. OMV appeals from judgment notwithstanding the verdict entered in favor of the defendant, Mirror Image Internet, Inc. (Mirror Image), the corporate parent of the defendant lessee, Clearway Acquisition, Inc. (Clearway). The primary issue on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence to hold Mirror Image liable, on a theory of corporate disregard, for amounts owed on the leases executed by Clearway. We also address cross appeals concerning proof of OMV\u2019s intention to accept Clearway\u2019s surrender of one of the leases, and the appropriate measure of damages on OMV\u2019s claim against Mirror Image directly, for use and occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">We recount the facts from the record, taken in the light most favorable to OMV, as they pertain to OMV\u2019s corporate disregard claim, reserving additional facts bearing on the cross appeals for our discussion, <em>infra. </em>OMV, as owner of the Park Square Building at 31 St. James Avenue in Boston, entered into two commercial leases with Clearway Technologies, LLC (Clearway Technologies), in September, 1999, and March, 2000, for suites 925 and 912, respectively, both for five-year terms. At the time, Clearway Technologies was a start-up company engaged in creating software to improve business users\u2019 ability to use the Internet more efficiently. Mirror Image was developing a similar technology but had no involvement with Clearway Technologies when the leases for the Park Square Building were signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In late 2000, Mirror Image became interested in combining its technology with that of Clearway Technologies and set about to acquire Clearway Technologies. To that end, in January, 2001, Clearway Technologies created Clearway as a subsidiary, the stock of which was then purchased by Mirror Image through a series of transactions not pertinent here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clearway Technolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>gies transferred most of its assets and all of its liabilities to Clearway. Mirror Image did not purchase the assets and liabilities of Clearway as part of the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">At the time of the acquisition, Clearway\u2019s Internet technology was not commercially viable and the company was close to insolvent, owing approximately $4.2 million to its creditors. Clearway received no cash infusion as part of the purchase but was provided with a $10 million secured loan from Mirror Image\u2019s parent, Xcelera, Inc., which Mirror Image guaranteed. The two leases with OMV were transferred from Clearway Technologies to Clearway, which the leases permitted in those circumstances, without OMV\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Upon learning of Mirror Image\u2019s acquisition of Clearway, OMV changed its internal records regarding the rental account from Clearway Technologies to Clearway. Throughout Clearway\u2019s tenancy, OMV addressed its invoices and correspondence to Clearway, and OMV\u2019s internal records listed Clearway as the tenant. Clearway paid the rent to OMV with checks from a Clearway bank account. OMV\u2019s property manager, Jennifer Cote, testified at trial that she received no rent checks from Mirror Image and that she sent the rent bills and default notices for the leased premises to Clearway and not Mirror Image. Cote also testified, however, that it was her impression that after January, 2001, Mirror Image was responsible for the leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Following the acquisition, Mirror Image and Clearway worked together to try to combine their technologies, and some of Mirror Image\u2019s employees began working at the Park Square Building. Cote testified that she observed that Mirror Image was occupying suite 925, and that a Mirror Image sign was posted near the entry of the suite. Mirror Image and Clearway combined their Web sites, and if Clearway were sought on the Internet, the user would be routed to the Mirror Image Web site. A Mirror Image document was introduced at trial describing Clearway as a division of Mirror Image, and a press release indicated that Mirror Image\u2019s Boston sales office was located at 31 St. James Avenue. The two companies shared the same president, chief financial officer, vice-president of engineering, and director of human resources. Most of the members of the board of directors for Mirror Image were on the board of Clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>way as well. There was evidence of some confusion among the officers and employees of both companies concerning who worked for whom and which company did what. According to the respective corporate records, however, the boards conducted separate meetings, the two companies maintained separate bank accounts and payrolls, and Mirror Image maintained its separate offices in Woburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Following September 11, 2001, security at the Park Square Building was tightened and employees of the building\u2019s tenants were issued identification cards, which were then required to access the building. A Mirror Image employee requested that OMV provide such identification cards to some of its employees, to permit entry without the need to sign in with building security.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Ultimately, Mirror Image\u2019s plan to combine the two companies\u2019 technologies was unsuccessful, and its efforts to utilize Clearway\u2019s technology ceased. Clearway stopped paying rent to OMV for both suites after October, 2001. OMV brought this action against Clearway and Mirror Image seeking, among other things, to hold Mirror Image liable for Clearway\u2019s obligations under the leases pursuant to a theory of corporate disregard. Relevant here, OMV also sought to recover against Mirror Image directly on a claim for use and occupancy of suite 925. Among its defenses, Clearway maintained that OMV had accepted Clearway\u2019s surrender of the lease for suite 912 in October, 2001, thereby releasing Clearway from any further obligations on that lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The claims were tried to a jury. The jury found for OMV on its claim for corporate disregard against Mirror Image, but the judge allowed Mirror Image\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to that claim. The jury found for Clearway on its claim that OMV had accepted its surrender of the lease for suite 912; the judge allowed OMV\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to that claim. Finally, the judge entered findings in OMV\u2019s favor on its claim against Mirror Image for damages for use and occupancy of suite 925, as the jury did not reach that claim. A judgment encompassing the jury\u2019s verdict and the judge\u2019s orders on the postverdict motions was entered by a different judge on July 10, 2008. OMV filed this appeal, and Mirror Image and Clearway filed cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>1. <em>Corporate disregard. </em>When considering a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, \u201cthe judge\u2019s task, taking into account all the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, [is] to determine whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury reasonably could return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>443 Mass. 52, 55 (2004) (citation omitted). The judge considers whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). We apply the same standard on review. <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>443 Mass. at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The judge properly instructed the jury in accordance with <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 620 (1968). She explained that OMV had to prove either that there was active and pervasive control of the related business entities by Mirror Image, with fraudulent or harmful consequences from the inter-corporate relationship, or that there was confused intermingling of activity between Mirror Image and Clearway, and ambiguity in relation to OMV, about the manner and capacity in which the two corporations and their representatives were acting. In addition, the judge outlined the twelve factors from <em>Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Checkers, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 10, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1985), that the jury could consider as part of their inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In granting Mirror Image\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge reasoned that, even assuming the evidence showed that Mirror Image exercised pervasive control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>of Clearway under the first prong of the analysis, evidence of a causal connection between that control and OMV\u2019s injury was lacking. We agree. \u201c[Cjontrol, even pervasive control, without more, is not a sufficient basis for a court to ignore corporate formalities.\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>450 Mass. 760, 768 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">First, there was no evidence that Mirror Image used its inter-corporate relationship with Clearway to perpetrate fraud on OMV. See <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Antaramian, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 73, 79 (1994) (buyer\u2019s corporate disregard claim futile due to lack of evidence of fraud or deception against seller for its representations about reliability of property\u2019s tenants); <em>TechTarget, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spark Design, LLC, </em>746 F. Supp. 2d 353, 357 (D. Mass. 2010) (no allegations that parent\u2019s pervasive control of subsidiary was used to deceive or manipulate plaintiff). Cf. <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 342, 344-345 (1980) (parent misrepresented subsidiary\u2019s assets to landlord in using subsidiary to sign lease and shield parent from liability for long-term commitment).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Nor was the evidence sufficient to causally link Mirror Image\u2019s arguably pervasive control of Clearway to OMV\u2019s injury, and certainly not in a manner that could be found grossly inequitable. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>450 Mass. at 768 (corporate disregard \u201crequires a determination that the parent corporation directed and controlled the subsidiary, and used it for an improper purpose\u201d). Rather, the evidence established that, as a result of acquisition by Mirror Image, Clearway, nearly insolvent at the time, received a $10 million loan from Mirror Image\u2019s parent, guaranteed by Mirror Image. This permitted Clearway to pay its creditors and stay afloat for several more months, as the two companies worked together to try to combine their technologies. When that effort failed and Clearway defaulted on the leases, Mirror Image was left owing approximately $9 million as guarantor of Clearway\u2019s loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In light of their over-all relationship, evidence that Mirror Image did not compensate Clearway employees who performed work for Mirror Image, or that Mirror Image did not pay Clearway for the use of the leased premises by some of Mirror Image\u2019s employees, could not reasonably be viewed as proof that Mirror Image siphoned away Clearway\u2019s funds or otherwise wrongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>used its control to cause Clearway\u2019s default on the leases. See <em>Birbara </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>99 F.3d 1233, 1241 (1st Cir. 1996) (not a case of asset siphoning where parent bought subsidiary \u201cknowing that it was insolvent and pumped a great deal of money into [it] to try to make it profitable again\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">With regard to the second prong of the corporate disregard analysis, the judge specifically instructed the jury that they were to determine whether there was confused intermingling of activities and operations between Clearway and Mirror Image \u201cin relation to the landlord, OMV,\u201d that caused injury. In entering judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge acknowledged there was evidence of confused intermingling between the two corporations, but ruled it insufficient to establish serious ambiguity about the manner or capacity in which they were acting, a factor that is required to disregard their separate corporate identities.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On appeal, OMV highlights evidence of confused intermingling that it claims the judge ignored. While we agree that the evidence would support a finding of confused intermingling from the perspective of certain employees of Clearway and Mirror Image, or even, perhaps, the public at large, the evidence did not support a finding of confused intermingling in relation to OMV. See <em>TechTarget, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spark Design, LLC, </em>746 F. Supp. 2d at 357 (confused intermingling and pervasive control was not alleged to be used to deceive or manipulate the plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">First and foremost, the relationship between Clearway and OMV was established by the written lease agreements. We believe a contract-based relationship, where the parties are plainly identified and their rights and obligations clearly defined, is less likely to present the sort of rare situation that calls for corporate disregard in order to prevent gross inequity. For that reason, \u201c[s]everal courts and commentators have suggested that it should be more difficult to pierce the [corporate] veil in a contract case than in a tort case.\u201d <em>Birbara </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>99 F.3d at 1238, and authorities cited. Our cases reflect that view.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By contrast, the situation where a third party cannot discern which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of two or more related corporate entities is involved in a given transaction has more typically arisen in the context of a tort, rather than in a contractual relationship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Here, the evidence did not show that OMV was confused or misled as to the entity with which it contracted for payment of rent pursuant to the leases. It is undisputed that Mirror Image was not involved with Clearway at the time the leases were executed. Once Mirror Image purchased Clearway, there is nothing in the record indicating that Mirror Image misled OMV or manipulated corporate identities in relation to Clearway\u2019s obligations under the leases. See <em>TechTarget, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spark Design, LLC, </em>746 F. Supp. 2d at 357 (parent did not acquire subsidiary until after contractual relationship with plaintiff began and, despite pervasive control, did not engage in any dubious manipulation of corporate identities relevant to the contractual relationship). Compare <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co. </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Moreover, according to the record, the identities, rights, and obligations of the contracting parties to the leases remained unchanged over the course of Mirror Image\u2019s presence on the scene, despite Cote\u2019s stated impression to the contrary. See <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Antaramian, </em>36 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>App. Ct. at 79 (no basis to disregard corporate form for breach of lease where \u201cplaintiffs knew that as buyers they were succeeding to a lease with a corporation and no other\u201d). See generally <em>Gordon Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>358 Mass. 632, 638-639 (1971) (insurance policy disclosed no intention to treat separate corporations as a single entity for insurance purposes, either when policy was entered into or subsequently). The evidence showed that until its default, Clearway paid tibe rent to OMV, drawn on Clearway\u2019s own account. OMV sent all correspondence concerning the leases to Clearway, and OMV changed the name of the lessee in its internal records from Clearway Technologies to Clearway when it received notice of the January, 2001, acquisition, but made no further changes to reflect its impression that Mirror Image became responsible for the leases. Compare <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. 546, 557 (2000) (actions of plaintiffs showed that they were confused as to the entity that owned the property).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">OMV\u2019s evidence of confused intermingling between Mirror Image and Clearway, while showing that Mirror Image and Clearway shared certain employees and assets and worked together at the leased premises, did not support a reasonable inference that OMV, itself, was confused regarding the entity responsible for the leases. In particular, it was not reasonable to infer that OMV, an experienced commercial landlord, was misled by a Mirror Image sign at the entry of one of the suites or by information on the companies\u2019 Web sites. Nor was a finding warranted that Mirror Image\u2019s request for building identification cards confused OMV as to the party obligated to pay rent under the written lease agreements. See <em>Westcott Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Constr. Co., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 299 (1975) (related corporate entities may pool their resources for certain purposes without creating \u201c \u2018serious ambiguity\u2019 as to which entity is acting\u201d in a particular situation). \u201cTo be reasonable, the inference [or conclusion] \u2018must be based on probabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>rather than possibilities and cannot be the result of mere speculation and conjecture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>443 Mass. at 55, quoting from <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 706 n.3 (1990). In the context of a sophisticated landlord seeking to recover rent from the corporate parent of the lessee on a written lease, we conclude that the requisite confusion of activities and operations, in relation to OMV, was not established by the kind of intermingling evidenced here.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are also mindful that \u201cdisregard of the separate corporate identity is reserved for \u2018rare particular situations to prevent gross inequity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Antaramian, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 79, quoting from <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. at 620. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 555 (\u201cdoctrine of corporate disregard is an equitable tool\u201d to be used \u201cin rare situations ... to avoid injustice\u201d). The jury here were instructed accordingly, i.e., that the confused intermingling, in addition to causing OMV\u2019s injury, must be such that it would be grossly unfair or unjust to respect the corporate boundaries between Clearway and Mirror Image.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The evidence did not support the jury\u2019s verdict on that score. The fact that OMV took no action to protect itself, when it claims to have developed the impression that Mirror Image was responsible for the leases, cuts against a finding of gross inequity and unfairness in these circumstances. See <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Antaramian, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 79 (\u201cthe fact that the plaintiffs took no pains to investigate the corporation and were conspicuously unconcerned about it\u201d suggested an absence of gross inequity, in the case of a sophisticated as-signee to a lease seeking corporate disregard as to the lessee). As in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Antaramian, supra </em>at 78, we think OMV here is attempting \u201cto exact what in effect would be a guarantee\u201d of the Clearway leases from Clearway\u2019s parent after the fact, a strategy the equities do not favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">2. <em>Surrender of the lease. </em>Clearway cross appealed from the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict, in OMV\u2019s favor, on the jury\u2019s finding that OMV accepted Clearway\u2019s surrender of the lease for suite 912. The judge ruled that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>insufficient, as a matter of law, to warrant the jury\u2019s finding that OMV accepted Clearway\u2019s surrender, either expressly or impliedly, based on OMV\u2019s rights under the parties\u2019 written lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Introduced into evidence were two letters, which Clearway claimed constituted a surrender and an acceptance thereof. The first was an October 18, 2001, letter from Clearway to OMV, stating, in relevant part, that it was unable to pay for the leased space \u201cbeyond [a] few more months,\u201d and that \u201c[o]ur only alternative is to give the space back to you and cancel both leases.\u201d With respect to suite 912, which at the time was under a sublease with Oxford Bioscience in Corp. (Oxford Bioscience), until February 28, 2002, Clearway went on to say: \u201c[W]e suggest that you would assume the position of direct lessor for the sub-lease immediately.\u201d By letter dated October 19, 2001, Cote, on behalf of OMV, responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cI am in receipt of your letter dated October 18, 2001, and have forwarded it along to our legal counsel for review. Please inform Oxford BioScience that all future sublease rents should be submitted to my office, and these funds will be applied against the sublease charges on your rental account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Evidence favorable to Clearway indicated that Oxford Bio-science paid rent between November, 2001, and February, 2002, to OMV directly. OMV stopped sending rent invoices to Clearway after February 28, 2002, when the Oxford Bioscience sublease expired. On March 1, 2002, OMV relet suite 912 to Oxford Bioscience directly, on a month-to-month basis, without notice to Clearway. Oxford Bioscience vacated suite 912 on July 15, 2002, but OMV failed to bill Clearway for rent after Oxford Bioscience\u2019s departure and never served Clearway with a notice of default. OMV did not include a claim against Clearway for unpaid rent for suite 912 until it filed its second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The jury were instructed that Clearway had the burden of proving a clear intention on the part of OMV to release Clearway from any further obligation under the lease. In granting OMV\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge observed that there was no evidence of an express ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ceptance of Clearway\u2019s surrender; on appeal, Clearway does not appear to contend otherwise. But Clearway challenges the judge\u2019s ruling that evidence of Clearway\u2019s conduct did not support a reasonable inference that OMV had accepted Clearway\u2019s surrender in October, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">To begin, the judge properly rejected the written correspondence between Clearway and OMV as providing proof of an implied acceptance of Clearway\u2019s surrender. OMV\u2019s October 19, 2001, response to Clearway\u2019s surrender characterized Oxford Bioscience as a subtenant and made reference to applying the subtenant\u2019s rent payments to Clearway\u2019s rental account, thereby communicating OMV\u2019s position that Clearway remained the tenant on the lease. See <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 222 (1992) (notice to tenant that landlord would seek to relet the premises, \u201cin effect for the tenant\u2019s account[, did not support] an inference of acceptance of surrender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Clearway counters that the evidence of OMV\u2019s conduct was sufficient to establish OMV\u2019s acceptance of Clearway\u2019s surrender, despite OMV\u2019s October 19 response indicating otherwise. Clearway argues that OMV\u2019s acceptance may be implied from OMV reletting the premises on March 1, 2002, to Oxford Bioscience, without giving notice to Clearway. See <em>id. </em>at 221. (acceptance of surrender of a lease may come about inferentially, by substituting a new tenant). But the lease expressly authorized reletting the premises upon Clearway\u2019s default. \u201cWhen a landlord relets in accordance with rights reserved in the lease, there is no acceptance of a surrender in the absence of expression of a clear intention to release the tenant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. As here, relet-ting the premises was \u201ca course of conduct. . . foreseen in the lease which in this case governs the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Given the express terms of the lease, and OMV\u2019s conduct in accordance with its rights thereunder, reletting the premises was insufficient to support an inference that OMV clearly intended to accept Clearway\u2019s surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Furthermore, in light of Cote\u2019s October 19 letter to Clearway, we are hard pressed to view OMV\u2019s lapses in pursuing Clearway for the rent, once Oxford Bioscience\u2019s sublease ended, as supporting a reasonable inference that OMV had previously accepted Clearway\u2019s October 18, 2001, surrender. In that light, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>OMV\u2019s failure to send Clearway invoices or a notice of default, or OMV\u2019s delay in bringing a claim, fell short of establishing OMV\u2019s clear intention to release Clearway from its obligations under the lease. It was Clearway\u2019s burden to prove OMV\u2019s clear intention to accept Clearway\u2019s surrender, and not OMV\u2019s burden to demonstrate, by aggressive pursuit of its remedies, that it had rejected the surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">3. <em>Use and occupancy. </em>The jury, having found Mirror Image liable for the rent under a theory of corporate disregard, did not reach OMV\u2019s alternate claim against Mirror Image to recover damages for use and occupancy of suite 925. Upon allowing Mirror Image\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the corporate disregard claim, the judge made findings of fact on the use and occupancy claim, ruling in OMV\u2019s favor and awarding damages in the amount of $29,039.06 for the period from February 1, 2002, to March 9, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Mirror Image challenges the judge\u2019s finding that Mirror Image occupied the space. According to Mirror Image, at best the evidence showed that a small number of its employees visited suite 925 on occasion to work with a much larger group of Clearway employees during the period when Clearway ceased to pay rent under the lease. But the judge found that between July, 2001, and March 9, 2002, some Mirror Image employees worked at the Park Square building \u201con a quite regular basis,\u201d based on evidence that the engineering teams of the two companies were working together during that period and that Mirror Image requested building identification cards from OMV to permit easier access to the leased premises for Mirror Image employees. The judge also found that Mirror Image had an implied agreement with OMV to use the premises, as evidenced in OMV\u2019s issuance of those identification cards to Mirror Image employees. Based on our review, those findings were not clearly erroneous. See generally <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>459 Mass. 115, 119 n.3 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Mirror Image fails to persuade us that the damages for its use and occupancy should be reduced to account for the small number of Mirror Image employees using the premises in relation to those of Clearway. In measuring damages, the judge properly focused on OMV\u2019s inability to use the premises while Mirror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Image employees were there.
