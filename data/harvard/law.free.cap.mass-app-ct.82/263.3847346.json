Carcieri knew that on August 27, 2002, Wyman Gordon was holding extra cash in its safe in anticipation of a long holiday weekend and end-of-month paychecks. At approximately 7:50 a.m. that morning, she telephoned 911 to report that an unknown man had forced his way into the bank behind her as she was opening Wyman Gordon for business and that he had compelled her to open the safe. Several circumstances, including the fact that Carcieri was only loosely bound when police arrived at the scene, made investigators suspicious of her story. Suspicion solidified two days later when bundles of cash in denominations stolen from Wyman Gordon, including some still wrapped in distinctive bands from the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve), were found in the couple\u2019s home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Many other circumstances confirmed the idea that the defendants were responsible for the theft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A jury convicted Carcieri of embezzlement from a bank by a bank employee, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, and Labadie as a joint venturer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The primary questions with which we are presented<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>raised first on appeal) are whether a Federal credit union is a \u201cbank\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, and, if it is, whether the crime of embezzlement from a Federal credit union is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts. We also consider Labadie\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his counterfeiting convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">1. <em>Embezzlement from a Federal credit union. </em>The indictment charged Carcieri with violating G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, as \u201can employee of Wyman Gordon Federal Credit Union, [who] did fraudulently convert or fraudulently take and secrete with intent to do so, money belonging to such bank.\u201d Labadie was charged as a joint venturer in the same crime. General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 52, as amended by St. 1934, c. 270, \u00a7 3, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cAn officer, director, trustee, agent or employee of a bank, <em>as defined in section one of chapter one hundred and sixty-seven, </em>who fraudulently converts, or fraudulently takes and secretes with intent so to do, any bullion, money, note, bill or other security for money which belongs to and is in possession of such bank, or which belongs to any person and is deposited therein, shall, whether intrusted with the custody thereof or not, be guilty of larceny from said bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">(Emphasis added). As the emphasized language indicates, only thefts from banks that fall within the definition contained in G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1, are subject to prosecution under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">A \u201cbank,\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 2004, c. 461, \u00a7 1, is \u201cany association or corporation chartered by the commonwealth under chapter 168, 170, 171 or 172, or an individual, association, partnership or corporation incorporated or doing a banking business in the commonwealth subject to the supervision of the [Commissioner of Banks (Commissioner)].\u201d It is undisputed that Wyman Gordon is not chartered or incorporated by or in the Commonwealth; the undisputed evidence at trial was that Wyman Gordon was authorized under Federal law. There was also no evidence at trial that Wyman Gordon is under the oversight or supervision of State banking authorities. On this basis, the defendants argue that Wyman Gordon is not a \u201cbank\u201d within G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Although the Commonwealth acknowledges that Wyman Gordon is not chartered or incorporated by or in the Commonwealth, it argues that Federal credit unions generally (and therefore Wy-man Gordon particularly) are within the purview of the Commissioner by virtue of 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 50.01 (2010) and, therefore, Wyman Gordon is a \u201cbank\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1. Title 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 50.00 (2010) is entitled \u201cParity with Federal Credit Unions\u201d and 209 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 50.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cThe purpose of 209 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 50.00 is to specify authorized powers and activities of credit unions, pursuant to [G. L.] c. 171, \u00a7 6A, and to establish procedures and requirements, applicable to credit unions seeking to exercise powers granted to or conduct activities authorized for federal credit unions under federal law, to the extent that such powers are not otherwise prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cIn determining whether or not to authorize any power or activity, the Commissioner shall also determine whether or not competition among credit unions will be unreasonably affected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cA credit union may, under [G. L.] c. 171, \u00a7 6A and 209 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 50.00, exercise only those powers and engage in only those activities expressly authorized by the Commissioner as set forth in 209 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 50.00. Powers and activities not so authorized are prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We see nothing in this regulation that subjects Federal credit unions to supervision by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. Indeed, for purposes of the regulation, the term \u201ccredit union\u201d is defined as one \u201cchartered pursuant to [G. L.] c. 171 and subject to examination and supervision by the Commissioner under [G. L.] c. 167.\u201d 209 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 50.04 (2010).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, Federal credit unions are referred to in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 50.01 only to identify the types of <em>non-Federal </em>credit unions that are subject to the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Even were we to assume that Federal credit unions are \u201cbanks\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1, the language and history of the embezzlement statute, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, demonstrate that the Legislature did not intend to bring thefts from Federal credit unions within its reach. From 1825 through 1836, the statute applied only to embezzlements from banks incorporated within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute was amended in 1836 to extend to embezzlement from \u201cany incorporated bank,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and similar language was used in the 1860, 1892, 1902, and 1911 versions of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This amended language was \u201cbroad enough to include banking corporations organized under the laws of the United States and located in Massachusetts, as well as like corporations created by the laws of this state.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Felton, 101 Mass. 204, 205 (1869), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tenney, 97 Mass. 50, 56 (1867). Although embezzlement from a national bank was within the broad language contained in the statute from 1825 until amended in 1922, see note 13, <em>infra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that embezzlement from national banks was outside the jurisdiction of our State courts because Congress enacted its own act in 1864 making \u201cfull and ample provision for the punishment of the crime of embezzlement and fraudulent appropriation of any funds of a national bank by any cashier, &amp;c., of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bank.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 206.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, although the language of our embezzlement statute was broad enough to encompass Federal banks, our case law made clear that application of the statute to Federal banks was outside our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The United States Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in 1903. In an opinion citing, among other cases, <em>Felton, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cUndoubtedly a State has the legitimate power to define and punish crimes by general laws applicable to all persons within its jurisdiction. So, likewise, it may declare, by special laws, certain acts to be criminal offences when committed by officers or agents of its own banks and institutions. But it is without lawful power to make such special laws applicable to banks organized and operating under the laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Easton </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>188 U.S. 220, 239 (1903). The criminal conviction at issue in that case (a Federal bank officer accepting funds knowing the bank to be insolvent) was accordingly reversed on preemption grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Apparently acknowledging that Federal law preempts State prosecution of embezzlement from national banking institutions, the Legislature in 1922 amended G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, reducing its application from all incorporated banks to only those chartered by the Commonwealth or subject to supervision by the Commissioner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> G. L. c. 167, \u00a7 1. This narrowed scope has remained in the statute\u2019s language to this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">In sum, we conclude that Wyman Gordon is not a \u201cbank\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>within the ambit of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52. Indeed, apart from the absence of any legislative intent to extend the statute\u2019s reach to that length, any construction of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 52, purporting to extend the statute to embezzlement from national banks would be preempted by Federal law. <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>188 U.S. at 239. The crime of embezzlement (whether as a principal or a joint venturer) from a Federal bank is outside the jurisdiction of our courts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>101 Mass. at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Although Federal law preempts a State prosecution for embezzlement from a Federal banking institution, the lesser included offense of larceny (as opposed to embezzlement) from a Federal bank is not preempted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marsino, </em>252 Mass. 224, 232 (1925); <em>People </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>194 A.D.2d 496, 497 (N.Y. 1993). For this reason, we have considered whether we might remand for entry of conviction on the lesser included offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 562 (2007). However, \u201c[a] verdict or finding that is supported by the evidence but is rendered by a court without jurisdiction to try the offense cannot be transmuted into a verdict or a finding on a lesser included offense solely because the court had jurisdiction to try the lesser offense.\u201d Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2.1, at 34-35 (3d ed. 2007). See <em>Ariel A. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 281, 287 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zawatsky, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 397 n.6 (1996). That said, because the original convictions were nullities in light of the lack of jurisdiction, double jeopardy does not preclude retrial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>374 Mass. 394, 397-398 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">2. <em>Counterfeiting convictions. </em>Labadie argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions of attempted possession of counterfeit notes and possession of counterfeiting tools. We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found each element of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u201c[A] conviction of attempt under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6, requires \u2018an intention to commit the underlying offense, [and] also an overt act toward its commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marzilli, </em>457 Mass. 64, 66 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>408 Mass. 463, 470 (1990). Possession of counterfeit notes under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 12, amended by St. 1974, c. 369, \u00a7 4, requires possession of \u201cfalse, forged or counterfeit bills or notes . . . with intent to utter or pass the same or to render the same current as true.\u201d Possession may be shown by proof that the defendant had knowledge of and the ability and intent to control the counterfeit notes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989). The evidence supported a reasonable inference that Labadie used the computer seized from the defendants\u2019 home. The computer\u2019s hard drive contained several scanned images, including an advertisement for Labadie\u2019s roofing business, and the computer had been used to search for information about franchising donut and coffee shops. The hard drive contained scanned images of a portrait of Andrew Jackson from a Federal Reserve note, a ten-dollar note, the front and back of a new fifty-dollar note, and the front and back of a new twenty-dollar note. There were two eight-by-ten sheets of paper in the scanner with images of a ten-dollar bill aligned on a grid. An expert testified that the paper was \u201cvery close color to U.S. currency.\u201d Moreover, the computer had been used to visit the Web sites Google, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves to conduct searches including, \u201chow to make counterfeit money,\u201d \u201chow to counterfeit money,\u201d and \u201ccounterfeiting paper.\u201d The computer also showed visits to \u201cmoneyfactory.[gov],\u201d which the expert testified is \u201cthe official website of the U.S. government of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\u201d The jury could reasonably infer that Labadie had used the computer to research counterfeiting and to try the process himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">General Laws c. 267, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1974, c. 369, \u00a7 5, prohibits possession of any \u201ctool, instrument or implement, . . . or . . . paper or other material adapted and designed for the forging or making of a false and counterfeit note, . . . with intent to use the same ... in forging or making such false and counterfeit\u201d notes. Labadie argues that the computer equipment seized from the defendants\u2019 home cannot constitute counterfeiting tools under this statute. We conclude that the computer, scanner, and printer constitute implements \u201cadapted to and designed for\u201d making counterfeit currency within the meaning of the statute. Although none of these items was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>manufactured for the purpose of counterfeiting, they had been customized and integrated into a system for producing counterfeit notes, which was not the intended use of the products.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The computer operated Windows 98 and Microsoft Paint, software that could be used to manipulate images of currency. At trial, former Secret Service Agent Edward Bradstreet testified as an expert to the fact that most counterfeit money is produced with personal computers, scanners, and ink jet printers. He opined that counterfeiters take detailed scans of a bill, zooming in on the serial number, in order to capture detailed security features. The Windows 98 operating system provides a technical advantage to counterfeiters because Microsoft Paint, an image editing program, is built in. In addition, the computer\u2019s hard drive contained scanned images of Federal Reserve notes. The jury could reasonably infer that the scanner had been used to scan these images and that the printer was used to print the manipulated images on paper the color and consistency of United States currency. Additionally, as discussed above, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that Labadie was the one who used the computer, scanner, and printer for these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Labadie\u2019s counterfeiting judgments are affirmed; the embezzlement judgments as to both defendants are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">A search of the home was conducted pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Among other things, the evidence showed that the couple was having financial difficulties at the time of the robbery. An expert testified that around the time of the robbery, the defendants had low or negative balance in their bank accounts, owed more than $40,000 to the Lottery Commission, and had debt of approximately $115,000 associated with their gasoline station. The day after the robbery, Labadie used cash to purchase approximately $20,000 in money orders, some of which were used to pay the Lottery Commission. In addition, in the days leading up to the robbery, Labadie had expressed interest in purchasing expensive commercial donut-making equipment that he thought would increase business at the couple\u2019s gasoline station. He stated that he did not have the funds to make the purchase at that time. The machinery was bought after the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Labadie was also convicted of attempted possession of counterfeit notes, G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 12, and G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6; and possession of counterfeiting tools, G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 13. Carcieri was acquitted of these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Neither defendant raised these issues below, and only Carcieri argued them in her brief on appeal. Labadie adopted the arguments at oral argument and in postargument submissions.
