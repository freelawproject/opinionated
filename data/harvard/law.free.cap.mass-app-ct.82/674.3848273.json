L. c. 209A (all to be recounted in greater detail) provide the following basic information. On February 2, 2011, a verbal argument flared between the defendant, Shevren Henderson, and his girlfriend. She reported that he had physically battered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>her. When police and emergency medical technicians arrived at her residence, he had left. An ambulance transported her to the hospital. She displayed bruises on her face, and she received stitches to her lip and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">At the time, the defendant was serving probation. He had pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and battery (separate incidents) and one count of criminal harassment. He had received three concurrent sentences, each of two and one-half years in the house of correction, six months to be served and the balance suspended for one year. The conditions of probation included the standard requirement of obedience to \u201call court orders and all local, [S]tote, and [Fjederal laws.\u201d His probation was scheduled to end on June 30, 2011. As a result of the incident of February 2, 2011, his probation officer issued three notices of violation, each charging the defendant with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, a shod foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">A revocation hearing went forward in the District Court on March 11, 2011. The probation officer had summoned both the girlfriend and the responding police officer. However, neither appeared. From a notarized letter submitted by the girlfriend, the judge found her to be an uncooperative witness and her absence supported by good cause. The judge found also that the police officer had not received timely service and had a previously scheduled medical appointment at the time of the hearing. Those circumstances supported good cause for his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The judge received the testimony of the probation officer, the girlfriend\u2019s affidavit in support of her complaint for a G. L. c. 209A abuse prevention order submitted on the day after the incident, the police report, and the girlfriend\u2019s notarized letter reporting her unwillingness to participate in the revocation hearing and requesting the judge to maintain the defendant\u2019s probation. The judge found the defendant in violation of his probation and reinstated the original concurrent sentences. The defendant has appealed upon the ground that the evidence submitted at the revocation hearing lacked the trustworthiness required by due process for revocation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Analysis. </em>For the following reasons, the evidence presented at the revocation hearing satisfied the standards of due process and practical fairness established by the governing case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 118-122 (1990), and criteria established as a result of that decision by rule 6(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings (2000). Those standards establish that the revocation of probation may rest exclusively upon hearsay evidence of the alleged violation so long as the hearsay carries the indicia of substantial reliability and provides a reasonable preponderance of evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">1. <em>Standards. </em>Ordinarily the revocation judge should excuse the witness originating the hearsay information only for \u201cgood cause\u201d; however, if the hearsay information satisfies the standard of substantial reliability or trustworthiness, the need to show good cause disappears. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 122. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 691 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>446 Mass. 54, 58-59 (2006). Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 932 n.4 (1999), the commentary to rule 6(b) offers five criteria of substantial reliability: (1) whether the statements are \u201cfactually detailed, rather than generalized and conclusory\u201d; (2) whether the statements are \u201cbased on personal knowledge and direct observation by the source\u201d; (3) whether the statements are \u201ccorroborated by evidence submitted by the probationer\u201d; (4) whether the statements were \u201cprovided under circumstances . . . supporting] the veracity of the source . . .\u201d; and (5) whether the statements come from \u201ca disinterested witness.\u201d Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, at 95-96 (LexisNexis 2011-2012). This list, of course, is not exhaustive. At a revocation hearing, the hearsay information need not satisfy all five criteria of trustworthiness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>458 Mass. 119, 133 (2010). As one more specific indicium of reliability, sworn statements in the nature of affidavits and deposition testimony have traditionally been eligible for admission at revocation hearings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 114-115, citing <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972), and <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 783 n.5 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>2. <em>Application. </em>In this instance, the District Court judge was entitled to rely upon four sources of hearsay information: (1) a G. L. c. 209A complaint and supporting affidavit executed by the defendant\u2019s girlfriend on the day after the alleged assault and battery; (2) the police report drafted on the day of the incident by the police officer responding to the scene; (3) the girlfriend\u2019s letter of February 28, 2011 (twenty-six days after the incident), to the District Court judge requesting that the judge not revoke probation; and (4) the testimony of the probation officer reporting his conversation with the responding police officer about the officer\u2019s observations at the scene. The three documents (the c. 209A papers, the police incident report, and the girlfriend\u2019s subsequent letter of February 28, 2011) all came into evidence as exhibits. The judge relied especially upon the c. 209A complaint and supporting affidavit, as well as the police incident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In the G. L. c. 209A complaint, the girlfriend reported that she was \u201cin a dating or engagement relationship\u201d with the defendant, that he \u201cplaced [her] in fear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d and that he \u201ccaused [her] physical harm.\u201d Her attached affidavit narrates the incident. It appears in the margin. Its gist is that the defendant instigated a fight with her and that, as a result, she went to the hospital and received stitches to her upper lip and foot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The responding police officer wrote his incident report on the evening of the event. He described the girlfriend\u2019s account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the incident and his observations that she \u201csustained visible bruises to her face as well as a cut lip\u201d and that an ambulance transported her to Baystate Medical Center.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The girlfriend\u2019s subsequent letter of February 28, 2011, reported to the judge that she was \u201cno longer willing to participate in legal proceedings concerning Mr. Henderson,\u201d and she requested the judge \u201cnot to revoke his probation.\u201d Her letter did not renounce or revise in any respect her allegations of the G. L. c. 209A complaint and affidavit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She was retreating from the sanctions for the battery, but not from her account of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The final element of evidence consisted of the probation officer\u2019s testimony that his conversation with the responding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>police officer confirmed that the officer had remembered the victim\u2019s bloody lip.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In these circumstances, the hearsay information satisfies the criteria of substantial reliability prescribed by the <em>Durling </em>decision and by rule 6(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings. The G. L. c. 209A affidavit is \u201cfactually detailed, rather than generalized and conclusory,\u201d as required by criterion one of the rule. The statements of the same affidavit are \u201cbased on personal knowledge and observation by the source,\u201d as required by criterion two of the rule. The statements arose \u201cunder circumstances that support the veracity of the source,\u201d as required by criterion four of the rule: that is, the circumstances consisted of the submission of a formal c. 209A complaint to a judge on the day following an alleged battery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statements of the police incident report originated from \u201ca disinterested witness,\u201d as required by criterion five of the rule. See commentary to rule 6(b), <em>supra. </em>The incident report qualifies under the <em>Durling </em>standard of trustworthiness (a) because it contains a percipient observation by the police author of the bruises and bloody lip of the girlfriend, and (b) because the creation of a false police report would carry serious sanctions for the officer. 407 Mass, at 121. Finally, the girlfriend\u2019s subsequent letter did not contradict or in any way revise the specific allegations of her c. 209A affidavit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the these reasons, we affirm the order revoking probation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">As a secondary argument, he contends that the evidence failed to show the use of his shod foot as a dangerous weapon. The absence of that element from the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is immaterial.

No materiality arises from the distinction between the revocation ground of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (shod foot) and the described simple assault and battery by punches to the face of the victim. The probation agreement required categorically that the probationer comply with the law. Beating a weaker victim constitutes an elemental violation of the law with or without the aggravation of a shod foot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Our reasoning and result hold the use of reliable documentary evidence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>proof of ground for revocation to be permissible, not preferable. Revocation judges possess ample discretionary authority to require the presence of witnesses in instances in which they are not satisfied of the proposed good cause for their absence and in which they find documents insufficient in the absence of live testimony and cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Ti\">(dissenting). The defendant maintains on appeal that his probation revocation was not supported by reliable hearsay. I agree, and I therefore dissent. It is well established that when hearsay evidence is found reliable, it may be offered as evidence in a probation revocation proceeding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 118 (1990). The evidence must \u201cbear[] substantial indicia of reliability and [be] substantially trustworthy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>441 Mass. 685, 691 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In my view, it was error for the judge to rely solely on the police report and the victim\u2019s affidavit to revoke the defendant\u2019s probation. \u201cUnsubstantiated and unreliable hearsay cannot, consistent with due process, be the entire basis of a probation revocation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra. </em>At the hearing, the judge had only the testimony of the probation officer, the victim\u2019s affidavit, the police report, and a notarized letter from the victim requesting that the defendant\u2019s probation not be revoked. The judge found the defendant in violation of his probation, based on the police report and the victim\u2019s affidavit. Both of those exhibits lacked sufficient and carefully tailored details to warrant a finding of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, a shod foot. The only causal connection that the defendant used his foot was the victim\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that she received stitches to her foot. Throughout the proceeding, the Commonwealth never connects or mentions the defendant\u2019s foot being used as a dangerous weapon. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>446 Mass. 54, 59 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Additionally, all parties concede that the victim\u2019s affidavit, standing alone, is vague and thus unreliable. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>458 Mass. 119, 134 (2010). Even coupled with the police report, as the judge did here, the evidence is still insufficient. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 741 (2008), we reversed a probation revocation as the evidence presented was \u201c[a] narrative [police] report merely relating] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>what the alleged victim told the officers.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 904, 906 (2003) (reversal of probation revocation where evidence was merely officer\u2019s repetition of complainant\u2019s account and his personal observation of damage to vehicle). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emmanuel E., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 454 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Here, the police report only includes one sentence regarding Officer Williams\u2019s personal observation of the victim\u2019s bruises, the victim being transported to the hospital and being advised of her G. L. c. 209A rights, and the defendant\u2019s absence from the scene. The three additional statements merely recounted the victim\u2019s version of the incident. In sum, the police report in and of itself is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Furthermore, the police report and the victim\u2019s affidavit do not align. Without the victim\u2019s appearance at the hearing, it is impossible to understand the sequence of events. Even if the judge had relied on the probation officer\u2019s testimony \u2014 the uncorroborated hearsay evidence \u2014 his testimony would not have provided any competent additional insight. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podoprigora, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 136, 139 (1999). It is not enough to conclude that because there is some indication that a criminal act occurred, a probationer has violated probation. The crime charged must be reflected in the evidence relied upon. In this case, the judge\u2019s factual findings do not provide a sufficient basis for revoking the defendant\u2019s probation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 756 (2006), and I would reverse the order revoking probation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
