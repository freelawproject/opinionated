Ct. Ch. 2006) <em>(Kessler). Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 790. The court also vacated the judgment of dismissal in the wife\u2019s equity suit in which the wife had sought an accounting and equalization of income derived from the parties\u2019 S corporations during a specified period. <em>Id. </em>at 796-799.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On remand, and after separate trials in the divorce and equity proceedings, the probate judge revalued the S corporations and entered a fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce dividing the assets. By a judgment on the complaint in equity, the judge ordered the husband to pay the wife a certain sum but stated that there shall be no payment of statutory interest on the money owed. The parties\u2019 appeals from the divorce and equity judgments have been consolidated in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s thoughtful analysis of the <em>Kessler </em>approach, set out in her supplemental findings of fact and rationale in the divorce case, for the reasons discussed below we are constrained to vacate the fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce as it pertains to the valuation of the S corporations and remand the matter again to the Probate and Family Court. We affirm the judgment on the complaint in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">A. <em>The divorce case. </em>1. <em>Valuation of the S corporations/tax affecting, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>The general background of the divorce case is set out in <em>Bernier I </em>and need not be rehearsed in detail. We concentrate here on the issue of tax affecting of the S corporations and draw liberally, both in our background description and discussion of the law, from the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>opinion. During the marriage the parties achieved financial success through the operation of two supermarkets that were owned by two S corporations, of which the husband and wife each owned one-half. <em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 777.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the initial trial in 2002, the parties agreed to an equal division of assets. At trial, the testimony centered principally on the value of the supermarkets, with the parties agreeing to establish the valuation of the markets as of December 31, 2000, the date of the last reconciliation of accounts prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 778 &amp; n.5. Each party presented the testimony of an expert witness on valuation: Mark Leicester prepared the wife\u2019s valuation, and Joel Horvitz prepared the husband\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>at 778. Although \u201cLeicester and Horvitz were in broad agreement on key points,\u201d including that \u201cthe buyer of the supermarket shares would seek an investment that would yield the buyer\u2019s required rate of return,\u201d and that the most accurate estimate of the supermarkets\u2019 value would be achieved by employing the \u201cincome\u201d approach to valuation, the experts arrived at markedly different appraisals of the supermarkets. <em>Ibid. </em>Leicester opined that the fair market value of the supermarkets was $16,391,000; Horvitz fixed the fair market value at $7,850,000. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The discrepancy in the experts\u2019 valuations, the Supreme Judicial Court noted, was due primarily to Horvitz\u2019s application of \u201ctax affecting,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as certain other discounts to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>calculations of fair market value,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Leicester\u2019s omission of those considerations. <em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 778-779. The positions of the parties\u2019 experts were described by the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cHorvitz tax affected as if the S corporation were a C corporation, at what he termed the \u2018average corporate rate\u2019 of thirty-five per cent.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] ... He testified that tax affecting the S corporations at the C corporation rate was proper because, among other things, a person contemplating the purchase of an S corporation would factor into his probable rate of return the tax consequences of the purchase. Leicester, on the other hand, did not tax affect the supermarkets\u2019 income in his valuation because, as he testified, an S corporation, unlike a C corporation, does not pay taxes at the entity level, and because no sale of the business was contemplated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The judge in the initial trial rejected Leicester\u2019s valuation as \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cadopted substantially without change Horvitz\u2019s method of applying tax affecting and key [person] and marketability discounts to the supermarkets, and adopted his conclusion that the fair market value of the supermarkets on the relevant date . . . was $7,850,000.\u201d <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 780. Thereafter, the judge entered a supplemental judgment on August 18, 2003 (which was later the subject of further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>supplementation), awarding the husband the option to purchase the wife\u2019s fifty percent ownership interest in the supermarkets for $3,925,000,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and certain other relief. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On the wife\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the judge erred in adopting Horvitz\u2019s valuation that tax affected the fair market value of the parties\u2019 S corporations at a presumed \u201caverage corporate rate\u201d of a C corporation. <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 775.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying the C corporation rate of taxation to an S corporation, the court stated, \u201cseverely undervalues the fair market value of the S corporation by ignoring the tax benefits of the S corporation structure and failing to compensate the seller for the loss of those benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 776. The court reasoned that such a result was particularly misplaced in this case in view of the uncontroverted evidence that the supermarkets would continue to operate as S corporations after the parties\u2019 divorce; that they would continue to be owned by one of the existing shareholders; and that the supermarkets were profitable and would continue their historic practice of making cash distributions. <em>Id. </em>at 790. On the other hand, the court continued, in the circumstances of this divorce case, \u201cfailure entirely to tax affect an S corporation artificially will inflate the value of the S corporation by overstating the rate of return that the retaining shareholder could hope to achieve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 776. After review of the scant case law and pertinent literature on the subject, the court decided on an alternative approach to these two extremes and \u201cadopt[ed] generally the metric employed by the <em>Kessler </em>court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>As explained in <em>Bernier </em>I, <em>Kessler </em>involved a radiology practice, operating as a closely held S corporation, where the dealings between the majority and minority shareholders were constrained by fiduciary considerations. <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 787. Three of the eight shareholders of the corporation (the Kessler group) wanted the majority shareholders (the Broder group) to buy out their shares. <em>Id. </em>at 787-788. The parties\u2019 experts differed markedly in their valuation of the shares \u2014 the expert for the Broder group treated the S corporation as a C corporation in his valuation (applying forty per cent as the tax rate to the business\u2019s earnings); the Kessler group\u2019s expert did not tax affect earnings at all. The Delaware court found, for reasons similar to those set out by the Supreme Judicial Court, see supra,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that neither expert\u2019s testimony concerning tax treatment was fair. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court then summarized the so-called <em>Kessler </em>metric or approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cHaving rejected the rationale and conclusions of both experts, the Delaware court proposed an alternate approach. This approach attempted to capture the tax benefit to the buyer of S corporation shares (the Broder group) of receiving cash dividends that are not subject to dividend taxes. The court observed that, as is the case here, the buyout was an \u2018involuntary removal,\u2019 and not an arm\u2019s-length purchase. To calculate the effect of taxes on the buyers and the sellers in these circumstances, the judge asked: if the S corporation at issue were a C corporation, at what hypothetical tax rate could it be taxed and still leave to shareholders the same amount in their pockets as they would have if they held shares in an S corporation? In other words, the judge asked what the effective corporate tax rate would be for the S corporation shareholder, although the entity itself paid no corporate tax. Assuming a dividend tax rate of fifteen per cent and a personal income tax rate of forty per cent (the shareholders were wealthy physicians who paid individual taxes at the highest rate), the court imputed a \u2018pre-dividend\u2019 corporate tax rate of 29.4 per cent to the S corporation.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The result was to leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the shareholder of an S corporation with the same amount of money in his or her pocket as the shareholder of a C corporation being taxed at a (fictitious) 29.4 per cent corporate tax rate. Applying this rate to the earnings of the entity measures \u2018with the greatest practicable precision the fair value of the . . . interest in the going concern value of\u2019 the business.\u201d (Citations and footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 788-789. For an illustration of this approach, see the chart in Appendix B to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court stated that although the probate judge did not have the benefit of the <em>Kessler </em>decision at the time she rendered her judgment, the judge, in the circumstances, should have looked past the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach of the parties\u2019 experts and paid particular attention to the facts of the case over more abstract considerations. <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 790. The court concluded that \u201cthe metric employed by the <em>Kessler </em>court provides a fairer mechanism for accounting for the tax consequences of the transfer of ownership of the supermarkets from one spouse to the other in the circumstances of record.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we have indicated, the court directed the judge, on remand on the issue of valuation, \u201cto employ the tax affecting approach adopted in <em>Kessler.\u201d Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">b. <em>The proceedings on remand. </em>The proceedings on remand were marked by some uncertainty, and disagreement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the parties, as to what the Supreme Judicial Court intended when it directed that the <em>Kessler </em>metric or the <em>Kessler </em>approach be applied. The uncertainty arose in large part from the fact that, as the judge explained and the parties agree, when the <em>Kessler </em>valuation was set in 2004 the applicable Federal dividend tax rate was fifteen percent. However, as the judge and the parties also concluded, the applicable dividend tax rate on December 31, 2000, the date the parties agreed was to remain the valuation date of the supermarkets, was forty percent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The probate judge (the same judge who presided at the <em>Bernier I </em>proceedings) noted that the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bernier I </em>did not address the change in the dividend rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The wife\u2019s business valuation expert, Howard Gordon, testified that he used the formula set forth in <em>Kessler </em>but applied the dividend tax rate that was in effect in 2000 (i.e., forty percent). This resulted, as the judge noted, in a zero percent tax affecting rate because the personal dividend tax rate at the time of the stipulated date of valuation was the same as the applicable personal income tax rate, forty percent. For illustration, see the chart contained in Appendix C to this opinion. Utilizing a tax affecting rate of zero percent, Gordon valued the supermarkets at a combined value of $14 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">David Merfeld, the husband\u2019s tax expert,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> took a different approach. In his report, which was an exhibit at trial, Merfeld stated that S corporation income flowing out to the shareholders of the two markets is subject to Federal and State tax as ordinary income. Merfeld, the judge found, thus applied a 5.85 percent Massachusetts State tax based upon the tax on income allocable to an individual residing in Massachusetts in 2000, and a 39.6 percent Federal tax rate as in effect for tax year 2000. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>judge stated that, in total, Merfeld tax affected the value of the markets at approximately forty-six percent by combining the State and Federal individual tax rates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Merfeld ultimately valued the markets at $9,349,193.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Finding that both parties \u201ctook unreasonable positions in regards to their interpretation of the [Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s] ruling\u201d in <em>Bernier I, </em>the judge rejected both experts\u2019 new valuations for the markets. More specifically, the judge found that the Gordon valuation, which utilized a zero percent tax affecting rate, overlooked the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s \u201cclear mandated\u201d that \u201cnot tax affecting the valuation was unfair.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge stated that she did not agree that the intent of the Supreme Judicial Court \u201cwas to literally plug in the formula utilized in <em>Kessler </em>if in fact the tax rate was substantially different and would have resulted in a [zero percent] tax [affecting] rate.\u201d Similarly, the judge found that Merfeld\u2019s valuation ignored the import of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Bernier I </em>that (in the probate judge\u2019s view) any tax affecting rate above the rate of thirty-five per cent would undervalue the markets. The judge stated that to adopt a tax affecting rate of forty-six percent, which is higher than the husband\u2019s originally proposed \u201ccorporate tax rate\u201d of thirty-five percent<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (a percentage, the judge indicated, the Supreme Judicial Court determined to be \u201ctoo high\u201d) \u201cwould lead to an even more significant undervaluation of the supermarkets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Having rejected the opinions of valuation of the parties\u2019 experts, the judge arrived at a different valuation of the supermarkets. Stating that the Supreme Judicial Court, in adopting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the metric of the <em>Kessler </em>court, found that the application of a tax affecting rate of 29.4 percent was appropriate, the judge determined that she would use that tax rate in order to calculate the value of the markets. Indeed, the judge stated that the tax affecting rate of 29.4 percent was the only rate that she could apply to the valuation of the markets in the light of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Kessler. </em>Using a tax affecting rate of 29.4 percent, the judge found that the supermarkets had a combined total value of $11,366,129.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">By a fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce dated September 1, 2009, the judge ordered that the husband purchase the wife\u2019s fifty percent interest in the markets for the sum of $5,683,065. The husband was provided sixty days in which to pay the wife the sum of $1,758,065, representing the difference between the fifty percent payment under the third amended supplemental judgment ($3,925,000)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and fifty percent of the value of the markets as found by the court on remand ($5,683,065).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge also ordered the husband to pay the wife the sum of $328,529, in order to equalize certain attorney\u2019s fees and costs paid by the markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">c. <em>Analysis. </em>On appeal, each party claims error in the judge\u2019s valuation of the supermarkets. The wife takes the position that the judge, on remand, was required to follow strictly the mandate of the Supreme Judicial Court to apply, in valuing the supermarkets, the method defined by the <em>Kessler </em>court, and that the judge \u201cessentially ignored <em>Kessler\u2019s </em>method and the formula it and the Supreme Judicial Court adopted, and instead . . . , and incorrectly, used the tax rate that the <em>Kessler </em>court applied in the case before it,\u201d a rate which was predicated on a valuation date of 2004, not 2000. The husband, while acknowledging that a strict application of the <em>Kessler </em>metric (applying tax rates for the year 2000) results in a zero percent tax affecting rate,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>argues that <em>Bernier I </em>(and Kessler), and the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s later decision in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>459 Mass. 361, 388-390 (2011) (involving partnership interests), stand for the proposition that subchapter S corporation earnings must be tax affected to avoid an inequitable result in the valuation process. In the husband\u2019s view, the \u201caccident of timing\u201d with respect to applicable tax rates should not control the outcome of this case. The husband argues that to avoid the \u201capparent inequities when the <em>\u2018Kessler </em>metric\u2019 is applied strictly on the basis of pure mathematics,\u201d the \u201ctax rate to be applied by the trial court in tax affecting the valuation\u201d of the supermarkets should be the Federal and State tax rates that were in effect in 2000 (i.e., an entity level tax of 4.5 percent [see note 13, <em>supra], </em>the Massachusetts individual income tax of 5.85 percent, and the Federal individual income tax of 39.6 percent).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">While resolution of the issue is not a foregone conclusion, in interpreting <em>Bernier I, </em>we think the wife presents the more cogent position. Consequently, we reject the approaches taken by the judge on remand and by the husband, both on remand and on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As we have stated, the Supreme Judicial Court adopted generally the metric employed by the <em>Kessler </em>court and directed the judge, on remand on the issue of valuation, to apply the tax affecting approach adopted in <em>Kessler. </em>The wife\u2019s expert, Gordon, as both the judge and the husband appear to acknowledge, utilized the <em>Kessler </em>metric in valuing the markets. Strictly speaking, the valuation proffered by Gordon is consistent with the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s mandate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, application of the <em>Kessler </em>metric, even if it results (as in the present case) in a zero percent tax affecting rate, does not necessarily lead to an inequitable result. There is a distinction to be drawn between failing to tax affect at all the earnings of the supermarkets because an S corporation does not pay Federal taxes at the entity level (a basis for the approach taken by the wife\u2019s expert, Leicester, in <em>Bernier I), </em>and utilizing a zero percent tax affecting rate arrived at through application of \u201call applicable rates, as [the Supreme Judicial Court] ordered in <em>Bernier [I]\u201d Adams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>v. <em>Adams, </em>459 Mass. at 390. See note 21, <em>infra. </em>The <em>Kessler </em>metric, as we have stated, attempts to capture the tax benefit to the buyer of S corporation shares of receiving taxable cash dividends that were not already taxed at the corporate level. <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 788. It does so by \u201ccalculating] the effect of taxes on the buyers and the sellers,\u201d to wit, the judge asks: \u201cif the S corporation at issue were a C corporation, at what hypothetical tax rate could it be taxed and still leave to shareholders the same amount in their pockets as they would have if they held shares in an S corporation?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789. In the instant matter, because the dividend tax rate in effect in 2000 was forty percent, a tax affecting rate of zero percent was necessary to achieve that result.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">At best, the husband\u2019s argument is that <em>Bernier I </em>requires generally a tax affecting <em>Kessler </em>\u201capproach,\u201d not literal application of the <em>Kessler </em>metric. Putting to one side the fact that such an argument ignores much of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s tax affecting discussion in <em>Bernier I, </em>there was no evidence that the methodology proposed by the husband on remand, i.e., the combination of personal income tax rates, constituted an accepted form of tax affecting for purposes of valuing an S corporation. As we have stated, Merfeld, the husband\u2019s sole expert, was a tax expert who had never valued a business or S corporation. The husband on remand offered no expert testimony from a business valuation expert concerning tax affecting. To the extent the husband claims additional support for his valuation/tax affecting position in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, supra, </em>we fail to discern anything in that case that would cause us to reach a different result.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>2. <em>Postjudgment interest on new valuation of markets. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s orders for remand in <em>Bernier I </em>contain no direction with respect to the calculation of interest on the judgment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In various papers filed at the proceedings on remand, the wife requested interest on the new valuation of the markets, citing at one point to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8 (providing, inter alla, \u201c[ejvery judgment for the payment of money shall bear interest from the day of its entry . . .\u201d), as appearing in St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 2. See <em>Karellas </em>v. <em>Karellas, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 471 (2002) (\u201cA judgment is the act of the trial court finally adjudicating the rights of the parties including a decision by the court that a party shall recover a sum certain\u201d). Interest under the statute is paid as \u201ccompensation for delay.\u201d <em>Trinity Church in the City of Boston </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>405 Mass. 682, 684 (1989). Although the fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce is silent with respect to interest, the judge, as the wife points out, stated at the hearing on the husband\u2019s later motion to stay judgment, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s why I did not award interest on this money, which normally I would have, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>I think, because of the uniqueness of the issue.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It would appear that the wife\u2019s request for interest was implicitly denied by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The wife, invoking both Massachusetts and Federal authority,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> argues that the probate judge erred in failing to order post-judgment interest on the $1,758,065 award to her pursuant to the new valuation of the markets for the period from the initial supplemental judgment on August 18, 2003, to the entry of the fourth amended supplemental judgment on September 1, 2009<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (see the discussion in part A.l.b, <em>supra). </em>The wife asserts that this court should reverse and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court with an order that she is entitled to postjudgment interest on any payment \u201cattributable to the valuation of the markets made pursuant to appellate and/or remand proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As we are vacating that portion of the fourth amended supplemental judgment concerning the valuation of the supermarkets (under which the figure of $1,758,065 was derived) and remanding the matter for additional adjustments, we also treat as vacated the implicit denial of postjudgment interest on the specific amount awarded. In the circumstances presented here, where (among other things) new orders concerning the valuation of the markets and the payments to be made by the husband have yet to enter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>there are uncertainties with respect to the time frame in which the wife seeks interest (see note 25, <em>supra), </em>and there is no indication the probate judge was afforded the opportunity to consider the specific arguments (and authorities) now advanced by the parties, we think the question of postjudgment interest should be revisited by the probate judge at the proceedings on further remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">B. <em>The equity case. </em>1. <em>Background. </em>As explained in <em>Bernier I, </em>the parties entered into stipulations for temporary orders during the divorce that provided, among other things, that both \u201cwould continue to own the supermarkets and equally share their profits during the pendency of the divorce.\u201d <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 796. The net income of the supermarkets was equalized through the end of 2000, leaving unequalized income of about $3.6 million yearly for the period from January 1, 2001 (the day after the last reconciliation of the parties\u2019 accounts), to February 2, 2004 (the date the husband exercised his option to purchase the wife\u2019s ownership interest in the supermarkets), \u201cduring which the wife continued to be a fifty per cent shareholder of the supermarkets.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Following a corporate meeting of the supermarkets on July 10, 2003, at which the husband asserted that the income of the supermarkets was entirely his, the wife, on July 28, 2003, filed a complaint in equity (later amended) seeking, among other things, \u201can accounting and equalization of income for the post-2000 period.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>In July, 2004, the judge dismissed the wife\u2019s equity action, stating, inter alla, that the wife\u2019s claims were barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 797. On the wife\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court vacated the judgment of dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 799. More specifically, the court concluded that the judge\u2019s actions and rulings in the case \u201ceffectively deprived the wife of a reasonable opportunity to bring the issue of income equalization during the post-2000 period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>before the court at an appropriate juncture, and that the equity complaint was therefore wrongfully dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Following a trial on the amended complaint in equity, where the issue was the equalization of the net income of the markets during the period in question,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the probate judge, by a judgment dated September 1, 2009, ordered the husband to pay the wife the sum of $762,375.30 on her claim for an accounting, and stated that there shall be no payment of statutory interest on the money owed. The judge dismissed with prejudice the remaining counts of the amended complaint (see note 26, <em>supra). </em>Both parties have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">2. <em>Tax liability. </em>In arriving at the amount to be paid to the wife, the judge considered \u201cwhat deduction should be made from the market[s\u2019] net distributable income for income taxes between 2002 [and] 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The husband and wife filed individual tax returns in those years, and the husband paid the taxes on all of the income for all of the business entities, including the markets. It was the wife\u2019s position at trial that the judge should not deduct the actual taxes paid by the husband for 2002, 2003, and 2004. Rather, the wife argued that the deduction for taxes should be based on a hypothetical tax she would have paid if her share of the distributable income had been paid to her in each calendar year. The parties agreed that, if the judge were to utilize the wife\u2019s tax rate for her one-half of the income in the years at issue, her taxes would have been $245,279 less than the husband actually paid.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The wife claimed that this was a loss for which she should be compensated, a claim the judge rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Contrary to the wife\u2019s assertion, we fail to discern error in the judge\u2019s failure to, essentially, credit her with the additional sum of $245,279. Among other things, the judge noted that the parties had entered into various stipulations that became orders of the court, which required the husband to make tax payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>for the supermarkets. Those stipulations were in effect until August 18, 2003, when the supplemental judgment of divorce was entered. The judge found specifically that the husband relied on these stipulations, as well as various judgments of the court that did not change his obligation to pay all corporate taxes, in paying estimated and final taxes (the taxes accrued in 2002 and 2003).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> That the husband\u2019s final tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were actually filed after the wife filed her complaint in equity on July 28, 2003, and after the divorce judgment entered on August 18, 2003, does not, in our view, require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">3. <em>Prejudgment interest. </em>The wife argues that she was entitled to, and the judge erred in failing to order, statutory prejudgment interest pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C (interest added to damages in contract actions), \u00a7 6H (interest on damages not otherwise provided by law), and \u00a7 6B (interest added to damages in specified tort actions),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> on the equalization payment of $762,375.30, from July 28, 2003, to the date of the equity judgment, September 1, 2009. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>419 Mass. 377, 381 (1995) (section 6C, concerning prejudgment interest in contract actions, commands a ministerial act in which interest attaches automatically). In the wife\u2019s view, the husband was found to have long owed her the sum of $762,375.30, and the accounting and payment could only be ordered as a result of breach of agreement (the parties\u2019 stipulations or the parties\u2019 S corporation agreements) or \u201cbreach of fiduciary duty/restitution.\u201d We fail to discern error, for the reasons set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As the husband suggests in his brief, the complaint in equity in this case cannot be viewed in a vacuum; it arises from the marital relationship and the divorce proceedings, which called for a division of the marital assets. As we have indicated, the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Bernier I </em>set out the chronology of the wife\u2019s attempts, through different procedural vehicles filed within a short period of time, to introduce the matter of income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>equalization. See note 26, <em>supra. </em>Among other things, the wife moved specifically to amend the divorce judgment on the property division after her complaint in equity had been filed (appending to her motion a copy of the equity complaint) to provide for equalization of the supermarkets\u2019 income.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 796-797. Such an approach would presumably call for the income equalization to be effectuated through a property division \u2014 it would not constitute an award of damages. Had the wife been successful on her motion, it is difficult to perceive how she would have been entitled to prejudgment interest on the equalization amount. See <em>Karellas </em>v. <em>Karellas, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Through her alternate request for an accounting and an order for payment in her equity action (the dismissal of all other counts is not challenged on the appeal) the wife sought, similarly, to equalize the markets\u2019 income. However, the wife now appears to characterize the judge\u2019s income equalization award as damages under the prejudgment interest statutes. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, and the context in which the matter of income equalization arose, we are not persuaded that the judge\u2019s accounting and order for payment constitute an award of damages on which prejudgment interest is to be added.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">C. <em>Equalization of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>At the close of its discussion of the complaint in equity in <em>Bernier I, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court commented with respect to the equalization of attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">\u201cIn the novel and complex circumstances of this case, we conclude that valuation of the markets and equal distribution of property are not issues that are easily separable. The parties\u2019 original stipulations provided that the supermarkets would advance the parties\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, with the payments \u2018debited to the party\u2019s account who has incurred those expenses,\u2019 and that such payments would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>be considered loans repayable by each party on the \u2018final division of [the] marital assets.\u2019 The parties agreed to an equal division of the marital assets and the supermarkets. Each party has expended a considerable sum for legal representation toward the joint goal of valuing the supermarkets and dividing these assets. A final equalization of the supermarkets should incorporate the fees paid to attorneys for each party, and be treated so that each party is effectively debited with half of the attorney\u2019s fees. To fail to do so would leave the wife to pay her entire legal expenses out of her own pocket while the husband effectively would receive a windfall by simply moving money from one source under his control to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 798-799.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The court concluded that \u201cthe valuation of the supermarkets should be adjusted to take into account advances of legal fees for both parties since the December 31, 2000, reconciliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">At the proceedings on remand, the parties disagreed as to the meaning and intent of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s directive with respect to the \u201ctime frame\u201d over which the attorney\u2019s fees were to be equalized. The husband argued that the probate judge was to equalize the attorney\u2019s fees through the date of the entry of the supplemental divorce judgment dated August 18, 2003. The wife took the position that the end date for the equalization period, although not specified by the Supreme Judicial Court, must be the termination of the proceedings before the Probate and Family Court, including the appeal and remand proceedings. The wife also asserted that the equalization of attorney\u2019s fees should apply to the equity case as well as the divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The judge ultimately concluded that it was the intention of the Supreme Judicial Court that the equalization of attorney\u2019s fees occur as of August 18, 2003, and, in the fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce, ordered the husband to pay the wife, as an additional payment for her share of the business, the sum of $328,529.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The judge stated in her findings in the divorce case that there was nothing in <em>Bernier I </em>that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>entitle the wife to an equalization of postjudgment fees and fees for the equity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Seizing upon the language of the Supreme Judicial Court that the parties agreed to an equal division of the marital assets and the supermarkets and that \u201c[a] final equalization of the supermarkets should incorporate the fees paid to attorneys for each party,\u201d <em>Bernier I, </em>449 Mass. at 799, the wife argues that \u201cwhere a critically important part of the equalization could only occur well after the initial judgment, it was error for the court to impose an August 18, 2003 cutoff date.\u201d Put another way, the wife asserts that the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s rationale \u2014 the parties\u2019 equal sharing of the cost of getting a right result in these cases \u2014\u25a0 logically extends the equalization through the present appeal. The wife also argues that the probate judge erred by failing to equalize the attorney\u2019s fees from the equity case, particularly where the Supreme Judicial Court ordered equalization specifically as part of its discussion in the equity case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We agree with the probate judge that the probable intent of the Supreme Judicial Court was to equalize the attorney\u2019s (and other) fees as of August 18, 2003. At the outset, the Supreme Judicial Court made reference to the parties\u2019 original stipulation concerning the advancement to the parties of attorney\u2019s fees and the payment of those fees. That stipulation, as the probate judge noted, was dated January 10, 2001. The Supreme Judicial Court indicated that the stipulations of the parties \u201cwere entered as temporary orders to govern spending (e.g., salary, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses) only until the divorce judgment entered.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 797-798. Furthermore, the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>specific concern that the husband might benefit unfairly (i.e., receive a \u201cwindfall\u201d) by simply moving \u201cmoney from one source under his control to another,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 799, appears directed toward a period prior to a division of the parties\u2019 property. Finally, as the probate judge stated, the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s directive, that the valuation of the supermarkets should be adjusted to take into account <em>advances </em>of legal fees for both parties, does not order the parties to equalize all attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred after monies were no longer advanced from the corporation. In the circumstances, we also agree with the judge that the wife was not entitled to an equalization of attorney\u2019s fees for the equity action.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">D. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the portion of the fourth amended supplemental judgment of divorce concerning valuation of the parties\u2019 S corporations (as well as the implicit denial of the wife\u2019s request for postjudgment interest) and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings and amendment to the judgment not inconsistent with this opinion. On remand, the judge may hold such hearings as she deems necessary. That judgment is otherwise affirmed. The judgment on the complaint in equity is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">General illustration of Federal income tax benefit to S Corporation shareholders, adapted from <em>Delaware Open MRI Radiology Assocs. </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>898 A.2d 290, 329 (Del.

Unlike a traditional C corporation, the income of which is \u201csubject to income tax at both the corporate (or entity) level and the shareholder level on dividends, if any, paid to shareholders . . . , the income of an S corporation is not subject to Federal tax at the entity level . . . but is passed through and taxed to the shareholder when earned by the corporation, whether or not the corporation pays dividends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775 n.2.

To derive this fictional figure, the court worked in reverse. To achieve a posttax income of sixty dollars (after corporate entity tax and dividend tax), the figure to tax would be $70.60 (fifteen per cent of $70.60 is $10.60, and subtracting the latter from the former arrives at sixty dollars). To arrive at $70.60 from the total one hundred dollars of earnings, the court subtracted 29.4 per cent, the appropriate fictional tax rate. Phrased differently, the court asked at what rate a C corporation would be taxed at the entity level to permit the shareholder to receive a distribution of sixty dollars (as he would from an S corporation) rather than the fifty-one dollars he would have received as a C corporation shareholder.

There is no Massachusetts analogue for rule 37(b). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The parties disagree as to the meaning of the judge\u2019s comment, in context, and what the judge was referring to when she explained that she did <em>not </em>award interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">See, e.g., <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>20 Mass.

See also <em>Loughman </em>v. <em>Consol-Pennsylvania Coal Co., </em>6 F.3d 88, 97 (3d Cir. 1993) (\u201cThe standard for determining whether post-judgment interest should run from the original judgment is well established. . . .

Notwithstanding her statement in the \u201cargument\u201d section of her brief that the judge erred by failing to order interest on the $1,758,065, from August 18, 2003, the wife indicates in the \u201cconclusion\u201d section of her brief that she is entitled to interest from February 4, 2004. Similarly, although the wife indicates at one point in her brief, as we have stated, that postjudgment interest should run to September 1, 2009, she states at another point that it should run to March 1, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The amended complaint in equity contained four counts: (1) request for an accounting and an order for appropriate payment to the wife; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) waste of corporate assets; and (4) constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court noted that the wife had also sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce the matter of income equalization through a complaint for contempt and a motion to amend the divorce judgment on property division.

No further fees were paid for her benefit after that date. During that same period the supermarket entities paid fees and costs on behalf of the husband in the amount of $545,594.36. Any legal fees incurred after August 18, 2003, and even through January 22, 2004, the date of the third supplemental judgment of divorce, were not paid by the corporations but by the parties individually. As the total legal and other fees amounted to $1,748,246, the judge determined that a payment by the husband to the wife of $328,529 \u201cwould have each party pay $874,123 of legal fees, costs and expert fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In a footnote in its discussion of the equity action, the court stated: \u201cThe stipulations controlled what monies the parties could take from the super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>markets\u2019 income from January 1, 2001, until judgment entered (which occurred on August 18, 2003): the horse farm\u2019s expenses, $2,100 per week for the wife\u2019s basic living expenses, $5,000 per week as a salary for the husband, and various other expenses.\u201d <em>Bernier </em>I, 449 Mass. at 798 n.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The husband argues on appeal that the judge erred in calculating the adjustments to be made for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.
