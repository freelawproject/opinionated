L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c). At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case in a jury-waived trial, Sepheus filed a motion for a required finding of not guilty, which the judge denied. The defendant was convicted, and now argues in a timely appeal that the evidence was not sufficient to support a finding that he intended to distribute the three, separately wrapped rocks of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine that were found in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judge therefore correctly denied the motion for a required finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 678 (1978). We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><em>Background. </em>With the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677-678, the trial judge could have found the following facts: On September 30, 2009, Springfield police Officer William Lopes, an experienced narcotics investigator, received information<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the defendant, who was wanted on an outstanding warrant, was in the general area of 585 Wilbraham Road in Springfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After receiving this information at the start of his 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. shift, Lopes drove to the area in an unmarked police cruiser.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lopes initially drove to the intersection of Bristol Street and Wilbraham Road, then expanded his search to include the Daily Mart convenience store and gasoline station at the intersection of Alden Street and Wilbraham Road a short distance away. He arrived at that location at or around 5:00 p.m. After circling around the parking lots of the Daily Mart and gasoline station, Lopes, with the aid of a photograph, observed the defendant standing with a small group of three to five males outside the Daily Mart. Lopes radioed for backup to assist him with the arrest. As Lopes waited for other officers to arrive, an individual who was not the defendant suddenly left the group and conducted what Lopes observed to be a drug transaction through the window of a vehicle, in plain view of the group of men and Lopes. This individual then walked back to the group. The group, including the defendant, then walked together into the Daily Mart. Officer Lopes, and seven to ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>other officers who had responded to his call, entered the store and placed the defendant under arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Springfield police Officer John Wadlegger, who had responded to the scene in an unmarked police cruiser, transported the defendant to the police station. Before driving to the station, and based on the defendant\u2019s movements while in the backseat of the cruiser, Wadlegger searched the defendant. Inside the center pocket of the defendant\u2019s gray hooded sweatshirt, Wad-legger found three rocks of what appeared to be crack cocaine, each inside a small plastic baggie twisted off near the comer. A chemist later testified that one of the rocks was weighed and tested positive for cocaine. Wadlegger also found $312 in the defendant\u2019s pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Wadlegger, like Lopes, was an experienced narcotics investigator. He testified that he found no smoking apparatus on the defendant, and that, in his experience stopping users of either cocaine or heroin, he usually found something on their person to ingest the drug. Wadlegger testified that not every user was arrested with a smoking apparatus but stated that such a circumstance was the exception to the very general rule. He testified that the packaging of the drugs found on the defendant was consistent with the street-level sale of narcotics, and that the total street value of the drugs was around sixty dollars. Wadlegger testified that the absence of any device to ingest the drag, the packaging of the cocaine, and the nature of the area where the defendant was arrested were consistent with possession with the intent to distribute the drags.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>In considering whether a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty is proper, \u201c[w]e review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 771 (2009) <em>(Little), </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 401 (2004) <em>(Wilson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\u201cThe two basic elements for conviction of possession with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the intent to distribute cocaine are (1) knowingly possessing the drug and (2) intending to transfer it physically to another person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavernier, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 355 (2010). The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on the possession element, but argues that evidence of the essential element of his intent to distribute was lacking. In this case, the defendant\u2019s intent to distribute \u201cis a matter of fact, which may not be susceptible of proof by direct evidence. In that event resort must be had ... by inference from all the facts and circumstances . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 517 (2012) <em>(Keefner), </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 648 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Here the defendant was found to possess three small individually wrapped rocks of crack cocaine, with a total weight of approximately .4 grams. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 731 (1992) <em>{Gonzales), </em>we ruled that although the defendant was arrested with only .32 grams of heroin, \u201c[t]he fact that the amount of drugs seized was small does not, by itself, require a finding of not guilty to so much of the indictment as states \u2018intent to distribute.\u2019 A dealer\u2019s inventory of drugs may have been reduced before his arrest to a small amount by a number of sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In <em>Gonzales, </em>the conviction of possession with intent to distribute was affirmed based on factors that included the packaging of the .32 grams of heroin in ten glossine packets, which according to expert testimony was \u201cconsistent with distribution rather than personal use,\u201d the presence of a \u201cscorpion\u201d mark on each of the bags that was indicative of a dealer\u2019s brand name, and the defendant\u2019s possession of $167 in cash, despite being unemployed. <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, as in <em>Gonzales, </em>although the approximately .4 grams Sepheus possessed would not alone support a finding of intent to distribute, sufficient additional evidence was presented at trial that ultimately supports such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\"><em>Additional evidence. </em>Several factors have been acknowledged by this court and the Supreme Judicial Court to be probative, while not individually dispositive, of a defendant\u2019s intent to distribute. These include, inter alla, the manner in which the drugs were packaged, the amount of cash the defendant had on his person when arrested, and the absence of smoking para-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>phemalia. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. 111, 113, 116-117 (2002) <em>(Gollman) </em>(2.71 grams of crack cocaine and no smoking paraphernalia held to be sufficient evidence to uphold conviction); <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. at 400-402 (one-half ounce of marijuana in twenty bags packaged for sale, no smoking paraphernalia, and $476 cash held to be sufficient evidence to uphold conviction); and <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 768, 771-772 (fifteen bags of marijuana packaged for sale, $254 cash, and no smoking paraphernalia held to be sufficient evidence to uphold denial of motion for required finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In the present case the defendant possessed three rocks of crack cocaine, with a total weight of approximately .4 grams, packaged individually in small sandwich bags, twisted off near the corner, in a manner that Officer Wadlegger testified was \u201cconsistent with street level sale.\u201d The defendant also possessed no device with which to smoke or otherwise ingest the rocks of cocaine, and was arrested with $312 in cash on his person.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, Officer Lopes testified that the area around the Daily Mart was \u201ca high crime area\u201d that has seen \u201cnumerous violations and arrests for narcotics, shootings, stabbings, [and] other violent offenses.\u201d Although the amount of contraband possessed by the defendant differs in each case, similar \u201cplus factors\u201d have contributed to the upholding of several past convictions for possession with intent to distribute. See <em>Gonzales, supra; Gollman, supra, Wilson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Furthermore, the circumstances in which the police encountered Sepheus and his conduct prior to his arrest could have properly been considered by the judge as additional evidence supporting an inference of intent to distribute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>44 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 79-80 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dessour-ces, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 232, 238 (2009) (where marijuana packaged for sale was found on defendant, conviction of possession with intent to distribute was affirmed in part because arresting officer \u201cobserved three other individuals seated near the defendant passing a pipe commonly used to smoke marijuana\u201d). Here, the defendant was observed standing with a group of men that included an individual whom Officer Lopes observed conduct a \u201cdrug transaction\u201d through the window of a vehicle. Sepheus was subsequently seen walking with that same group of men into the Daily Mart. The judge also could have properly inferred that Sepheus had been located in the general area of his arrest<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from at least about 4:00 p.m., the time the officers received the information regarding his whereabouts, to approximately 5:00 p.m., the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge could have reasonably concluded that a user would not likely remain at the point of purchase for such an extended period of time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The dissent states that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence here is equally probative of innocence as it is of guilt. More specifically, it argues that the evidence supports an inference that Sepheus was a drug buyer as much as it supports an inference that he was a drug seller, and that to conclude the latter requires an impermissible speculative leap.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not agree. Considering, as we must, \u201call the facts and circumstances,\u201d <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. at 517, and the proper inferences to be drawn from such facts and circumstances, we conclude that an individual arrested in possession of crack cocaine packaged for sale, with an amount of cash in excess of $300 in his pocket, in possession of no apparatus to ingest the drug, who was first observed standing in an area known for narcotics trafficking in a group that included an individual whom an arresting officer observed make a drug transaction, is more likely to be a seller than a buyer of crack cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 215 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>460 Mass. 12 (2011) (\u201cIf, from the evidence, conflicting inferences are possible, it is for the [fact finder] to determine where the truth lies, for the weight and credibility of the evidence is wholly within [the fact finder\u2019s] province\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Additionally, this conclusion is supported by Officer Wadlegger\u2019s expert testimony at trial. Wadlegger\u2019s testimony was germane, because the ability to distinguish between drugs possessed for the purpose of distribution and those for personal use \u201cis not a matter within the common experience of [fact finders].\u201d <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 769, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grissett, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 457 (2006). As a result, judges have allowed police officers with experience in narcotics investigation to give their expert opinion as to whether the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>of the case were more consistent with distribution or with personal use. See <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. at 115-116; <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. at 400-401; <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 768-770. In this case, Officer Wadlegger testified that the crack cocaine found on Sepheus suggested that he was a distributor as opposed to a buyer of drugs, and the officer based this opinion on, inter alla, the manner in which the drugs were packaged, the absence of smoking paraphernalia, and the high incidence of crime in the area where Sepheus was arrested.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge could have properly considered Wadlegger\u2019s testimony to support an inference of an intent to distribute. See <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. at 401-402; <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In this case, the defendant was found with three individually wrapped rocks of crack cocaine, had $312 in cash in his pocket, and carried no paraphernalia for ingesting the drugs. A police expert testified that several of these facts suggested that the defendant intended to distribute the drugs he possessed. Further, the judge could have inferred that the defendant had been located in an area known for drug sales for at least an hour, and was in the company of an individual who conducted a drug transaction in his presence. The inference of an intent to distribute based on these facts and circumstances is both \u201creasonable and possible,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 54 (1975), and amounts to more than mere \u201cconjecture and speculation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>452 Mass. 133, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>(2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 170 (1991). The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The record does not reveal the source of this information or any indication of its reliability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Lopes testified that this was a high crime area where numerous arrests for firearm violations and drugs had been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">This evidence was admitted without objection on direct examination and was referenced repeatedly by defense counsel on cross-examination. Other testimony concerning the contents of the informant\u2019s tip (that the defendant was armed and selling cocaine in that area) was excluded and is therefore not necessary nor appropriate to recite for any purpose here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In addition to the defendant, the only other person arrested by the police was Dwayne Griffith, the man who was observed to have made a drug sale outside the Daily Mart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The presence of cash on the defendant\u2019s person has in some past cases been paired with evidence of the defendant\u2019s unemployment to indicate that the defendant was more likely to have obtained the cash from drug sales. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 947, 947 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sendele, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 758-759 (1984). Although such evidence here would have bolstered the Commonwealth\u2019s case, in several cases the denial of a motion for a required finding has been upheld where cash was deemed probative of possession with intent to distribute, without any evidence of the defendant\u2019s employment status. See, e.g., <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. at 401-402 ($476 cash without any evidence of unemployment). See also <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 768, 771-772 ($254 cash without any evidence of unemployment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 265-266 (2010) ($56 cash without any evidence of unemployment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Officer Lopes was directed to the Bristol Street and Wilbraham Road area, which Officer Wadlegger described as being in the \u201cgeneral area\u201d of where the defendant was ultimately found, at the intersection of Alden Street and Wilbraham Road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The police observed Sepheus only for as long as was necessary to identify him, because they were not conducting a drug investigation, but were at the scene to execute an arrest warrant. Only later did Sepheus\u2019s extended presence in the general area of his arrest become relevant and probative of his intent to distribute. All relevant times and locations were admitted in evidence without objection and are therefore available for their full probative value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The dissent invokes the \u201cmere presence\u201d doctrine to discount entirely the defendant\u2019s proximity to the drug transaction. However, on the facts of this case the doctrine is misapplied. The \u201cmere presence\u201d cases discourage the practice of finding either (1) constructive possession of contraband or (2) evidence of joint venture solely from a defendant\u2019s physical proximity to contraband or a possessor of contraband. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gonzalez, 452 Mass. 142, 147 (2008) (\u201cmere presence in the apartment with knowledge that drugs are present is not enough to show constructive possession\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deane, </em>458 Mass. 43, 50 (2010) (\u201cMere presence is insufficient to establish joint venture liability\u201d). This case, however, is neither a constructive possession case nor a joint venture case. Rather, the defendant was apprehended while in <em>actual </em>possession of three rocks of cocaine and more than $300 in cash. The only element that was inferred in part from his proximity to a drug deal was his intent to distribute the drugs he <em>already actually possessed, </em>not those possessed by the other dealer. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980) (\u201cpresence with knowledge of the planned act is insufficient alone to be the basis of a <em>conviction of a person for the acts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>of another\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 330 (2010) (\u201c[E]vidence that a defendant associated with persons who committed <em>the crime </em>does not lead to an inference that he also participated in <em>the crime\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]). Here, the defendant was charged with intending to distribute the drugs on <em>his </em>person at the time of his arrest, and the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d at the time of his arrest help support the judge\u2019s reasonable inference that he had the intent to do so. Cf. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. at 517 (probable cause on motion to suppress).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">For this proposition the dissent cites to a line of cases beginning with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croft, </em>345 Mass. 143, 145 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The judge did not make a specific finding that Wadlegger was qualified to act as an expert witness. However, a judge is not required to do so in the absence of a request by the defendant. See <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. at 770 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Wadlegger testified that when he \u201cstop[s] somebody that\u2019s a user of either cocaine or crack cocaine or heroin, they usually have something on their person normally, to ingest that drug.\u201d Although he later conceded, on cross-examination, that not every user ever arrested was found to possess a crack pipe at the time, his testimony nonetheless was that the absence of such paraphernalia was the exception to the general rule, and was more indicative of selling than buying drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The fact that some of Wadlegger\u2019s opinion was based on the inadmissible content of the informant\u2019s tip goes to the weight, not the admissibility of the remainder of his expert opinion. Consequently, although some of Wadlegger\u2019s testimony was struck, his identification of the factors mentioned above as probative of an intent to distribute was not and therefore was properly before the judge. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>455 Mass. 1, 22 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b803-6\">Milkey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8i_\">(concurring). I write separately for two reasons. First, I want to note my disagreement with the conclusion the majority opinion draws with respect-to how long the defendant had been at the gasoline station. Even reading the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the most that could be said is that the police had information that \u2014 an hour before they found the defendant at the Daily Mart convenience store and gasoline station \u2014 the defendant reportedly was somewhere in the general vicinity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That fact has no bearing whatsoever on the question whether the defendant intended to distribute the drugs found on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Second, I want to note my discomfort with the extent to which the Commonwealth has sought to rely on opinion testimony to prove the ultimate factual issue in dispute. Such efforts are particularly troubling in light of the fact that the police expert here acknowledged that he formed his opinion \u201cpredominantly\u201d based on facts that never came into evidence, that were not independently admissible, and that were of questionable reliability. Nevertheless, the only issue the defendant has raised on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence, and \u2014 on that narrow question \u2014 I ultimately agree that the evidence was sufficient (if barely so). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Farnsworth, 76 Mass. App. 87, 98-99 (2010) (sufficiency of evidence \u201cis to be measured upon that which was admitted in evidence without regard to the propriety of the admission\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The unidentified informant had told police that the defendant \u201cwould be in the Bristol Street and Wilbraham Road area.\u201d Officer Lopes testified that the defendant was not actually found in that specific area, but instead was located only after the police \u201cexpanded out our scope of the area.\" The police eventually found the defendant at the intersection of Wilbraham Road and Alden Street. Although there was testimony from which it could be inferred that this location was \u201cin the general area of\u201d where the informant had said the defendant could be found, <em>ante </em>at note 6, there was no testimony about how close the two locations specifically are to each other. And this leaves aside the fact that the judge expressly admitted the testimony about the informant\u2019s tip not for its truth but instead solely to explain the conduct of the officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Agnes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abb\">(dissenting). \u201cFacts are stubborn things, and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case consists of evidence that the defendant had possession of three plastic \u201ctwists,\u201d each containing a small rock of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> along with $312 in United States currency, in unknown denominations. Based on this evidence, and conjecture from evidence that is as probative of possession for personal use as it is of possession with intent to distribute, the majority concludes that the judge below was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on so much of the indictment as charged possession with the intent to distribute. This result finds no support in any previous decision by this court or the Supreme Judicial Court, and is incompatible with the constitutionally based standard, enunciated in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 678 (1978), by which we must test sufficiency of the evidence claims like the one presented in this case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">1. <em>The evidence. </em>I disagree with my colleagues in the majority about what evidence was available for the judge\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">First, while it is true that this case originated with a tip from an informant,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the contents of the tip were not admitted for the truth of the matters asserted, and thus cannot supply the basis for an inference that the defendant was in the general area where he was arrested from between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Compare <em>ante </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Second, the police observations of the defendant\u2019s conduct prior to his arrest took place over the span of a minute or two at the most.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compare <em>ante </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Third, while it is true that another man with whom the defendant was standing when he was first seen by the police was observed to make what appeared to be a hand-to-hand sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>drugs to someone in a motor vehicle, there is no evidence linking the defendant to this other person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>ante </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Fourth, Officer Wadlegger\u2019s contribution as an expert witness was very limited, and, for reasons discussed <em>infra, </em>of dubious validity. The record indicates he offered only two opinions relating to the central issue of the defendant\u2019s intent: (1) that the drugs possessed by the defendant were packaged and of a size \u201cconsistent with street level sale\u201d; and (2) that the absence of a pipe or implement for smoking crack cocaine on the defendant\u2019s person indicated he was \u201cnot a user.\u201d He did not opine about the significance of the money found in the defendant\u2019s pocket. Neither did he opine that the defendant\u2019s proximity to a drug sale had significance, or that the defendant\u2019s movements were indicative of a joint venture. Furthermore, on cross-examination, he made concessions that undermined the probative value of his other opinions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, of special significance is Officer Wadlegger\u2019s admission on cross-examination that his opinion that the defendant was a drug dealer was based \u201cpredominantly on information that was supplied by outside sources.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed <em>infra, </em>this concession calls into question the probative value of his expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>2. <em>Unreasonable factual inferences. </em>The Commonwealth may satisfy the <em>Jackson-Latimore </em>due process standard based on reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 325 (2000). It is only necessary that the inferences drawn from the facts be reasonable and possible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 54 (1975). However, when the relationship between the facts and the inferences drawn from those facts is not one that a rational person would regard as reasonable, inference crosses over into the realm of conjecture. See <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>39 A.3d 1262, 1269 (D.C. 2012).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Here at least two of the factual elements of the case relied upon by the majority do not support an inference that is more consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt than his innocence on so much of the indictment as charges possession with the intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">a. <em>Defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area. </em>As noted above, the majority\u2019s observation that the judge could have inferred that the defendant was in the vicinity of the Daily Mart and gasoline station \u201cfrom at least about 4:00 p.m., the time the officers received the information regarding his whereabouts, to approximately 5:00 p.m., the time of his arrest,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 770, is not supported by the record. The only way such an inference could be drawn is to accept as credible the content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>informant\u2019s tip. However, the judge did not admit this evidence for its truth. A fair reading of Officer Lopes\u2019s testimony is that no more than a minute or two elapsed from when the defendant was first spotted at the Daily Mart until he was arrested inside the store. Prior to this, the whereabouts and activity of the defendant were unknown, and the whereabouts and activity of Dwayne Griffiths, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>were unknown.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, in this case, the mere fact that the defendant was present in a so-called high crime area sheds no light on whether the defendant\u2019s criminal activity consisted of unlawful possession or of unlawful possession with the intent to distribute, for obviously such locations are where both buyers and sellers of drugs congregate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 648-649 (1997) (police officers observed defendant make several hand-to-hand exchanges; evidence that incidents were in \u201can area known for drug dealing\u201d buttressed inference that the observed transactions were drug deals).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">b. <em>Defendant\u2019s proximity to a person who sold drugs. </em>The evidence also is not sufficient to permit the fact finder to infer a connection between the defendant and Griffiths, who was observed to sell drugs \u2014\u2022 that is, there is no evidence on which to base an inference that because Griffiths engaged in a drug sale, the defendant intended to do so also. See <em>ante </em>at 770. As noted above, the evidence is that the defendant was observed in the presence of Griffiths for only a minute or two. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>evidence of what the defendant or Griffiths was doing, or even whether they were in proximity to each other, before the brief observation made by Officer Lopes. The only way to establish an association between the two is to engage in conjecture and speculation, because mere presence at the scene where a crime is committed is not probative of guilt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cIndeed, [even] presence with knowledge of the planned act is insufficient alone to be the basis of a conviction of a person for the acts of another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>357 Mass. 149, 151 (1970) (\u201cThere was evidence that the defendant knew the three persons who entered the liquor store and committed the robbery and assault, that he associated with them, and that he was in their company both before and after the robbery. But that, without more, is not enough to convict the defendant on either charge. There can be no finding of guilt by association\u201d). Even less does the evidence here permit an inference that the defendant himself intended to commit the same act as another person merely because they were standing in a group together for a minute or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The ability to distinguish between the possession of drugs for the purpose of distribution and possession for personal use \u201cis not a matter within the common experience of [fact finders].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 769 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grissett, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 454, 457 (2006). The majority tries to have it both ways; it attaches significance to an expert opinion because nonexperts would not understand possession with intent to distribute, while simultaneously asserting, based <em>solely </em>on its own, nonexpert intuition, that the defendant\u2019s proximity to a person who sold drugs once in his presence is indicative of his own intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">3. <em>The absence of traditional factors considered probative of an intent to distribute, </em>a. <em>Quantity of drugs. </em>The quantity of cocaine possessed by the defendant (approximately .4 grams) is not an amount that alone may raise an inference of an intent to distribute. See note 15, <em>infra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 836, 840-841 (2012) (3.16 grams of cocaine not sufficient quantity to alone raise inference of intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Further, none of the traditional factors that allow a reasonable inference to be drawn that a defendant\u2019s possession of a small quantity of drugs was, nonetheless, with the intent to distribute are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">b. <em>Packaging of the drugs. </em>The testimony by Officer Wadleg-ger that the size and packaging of the three twists of crack cocaine found in the defendant\u2019s pocket was consistent with \u201cstreet level sale\u201d is not probative of intent to distribute as opposed to possession for personal use. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, supra </em>at 841 (\u201cNor was there anything distinctive or unique about the five twist bags [of cocaine] to indicate they were intended for transfer or sale as opposed to personal use\u201d). There was no expert testimony or other evidence that purchasers of street-level quantities of drugs alter the packaging of the drugs upon receipt. Further, there was no expert testimony or other evidence suggesting that drugs purchased on the street are consumed immediately after they are purchased or within any particular period of time. The reasoning employed by Officer Wadlegger in recommending that the fact finder draw an inference that the defendant intended to sell the drugs rather than possess them for personal use on the basis of such evidence is nothing more than \u201cspeculation based upon a generalization.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 16, 18 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The mere fact that an expert states such speculation as an opinion does not make it any less speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">c. <em>Conduct of the defendant. </em>In other cases involving small quantities of drugs, the circumstances in which the police encounter the defendant can signal whether his role is as a seller or a user. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 76-77, 79-80 (1997), the police observed the defendant holding a clear plastic envelope containing a white powder, while the person he was conversing with took some currency out of his pocket. When the defendant saw the police approaching, he yelled \u201ccops\u201d and tried to flee. He was subdued by the police, who found the plastic bag clenched in his hand. It contained 2.88 grams of cocaine. The police also found ten glossine bags, bundled together, containing .21 gram of heroin and a small quantity of marijuana in his pockets. Although the defendant argued there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he intended to distribute the heroin, the court held the evidence that at the time he possessed the heroin he was engaged in the sale of another drug, along with the packaging of the heroin and the fact he possessed three drugs, was sufficient to warrant a rational fact finder in finding intent to distribute the heroin beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>id. </em>at 79-80.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the present case, by contrast, there is no evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct, either before or after his arrest, that suggests his possession was with the intent to distribute as opposed to personal use. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 517-518 (2012) (no probable cause to search where police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>did not observe any illegal or suspicious behavior of defendant indicating intent to distribute marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">d. <em>Implements associated with distribution. </em>In some cases, the defendant\u2019s possession of small quantities of drugs is determined to be more indicative of an intent to distribute than of mere possession because the defendant is found with or in the vicinity of paraphernalia associated with the distribution of drugs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the present case, there is no evidence connecting the defendant to any of the items often used by drug dealers to facilitate the packaging and distribution of drugs. Further, in view of the fact that the defendant possessed only three rocks of crack cocaine, weighing a total of approximately .4 grams, the mere fact that the drugs were packaged for street level sale is not probative on the \u201cdealer versus user\u201d question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>e. <em>Possession of currency. </em>The fact that a person found in possession of drugs also has on his person or under his control a \u201ca large amount of cash,\u201d <em>Pena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 1015, 1018 (1998), may suggest his direct involvement in drug distribution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the present case, the defendant had $312 in cash on his person. Officer Wadlegger did not offer an opinion that the possession of this cash was a factor that suggested the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs was with the intent to distribute. See <em>Jowers </em>v. <em>State, </em>593 So.2d 46, 47 (Miss. 1992) (\u201c[N]ot everyone who has $356.00 in cash is a drug dealer . . .\u201d). The cash was not marked as an exhibit. There is no evidence that the cash consisted of denominations of bills corresponding to the proceeds of street level sales. Further, there is no evidence that the defendant was unemployed or had no known source of income. In these circumstances, the cash found on the defendant\u2019s person has little, if any, evidentiary value.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">f. <em>The </em>Gonzales <em>case. </em>The principal case on which the majority relies is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 731 (1992), in which we held that, although the question as to sufficiency of the evidence was \u201ca close one,\u201d an inference of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>possession with the intent to distribute was possible, with the aid of expert witness testimony, even though the amount of the drugs was small (.32 grams). The differences between the present case and <em>Gonzales </em>are significant. There, although the amount of the drugs was small, an expert witness testified that the possession of a \u201cbundle\u201d of ten individually wrapped and distinctively stamped packets of heroin, tied together by an elastic, was consistent with possession with intent to distribute rather than personal use, and the defendant had $167 in \u201cloose currency\u201d despite being unemployed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, by contrast, there were only three packets of cocaine. There was also no evidence the defendant was unemployed and thus unlikely to have this amount of cash in his pocket. In sum, there was less evidence in this case than in <em>Gonzales, </em>which the court considered to be a \u201cclose\u201d case. <em>Ibid. </em>There is no appellate authority in this Commonwealth for the view that the possession of a small quantity of drugs and an amount of cash as in this case ($312) without more permits a reasonable inference that the drugs were possessed with the intent to distribute. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 647-649 (1997) (although defendant had only two bags of cocaine weighing respectively .18 and .23 grams and twenty dollars, his conviction of possession with intent to distribute was warranted by evidence that police observed him engage in hand-to-hand sales of drugs from apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">4. <em>Opinion testimony by Officer Wadlegger. </em>a. <em>Lack of adequate foundation. </em>The opinion testimony of an experienced narcotics investigator may supply additional evidence necessary to enable a fact finder to determine that a defendant\u2019s possession of drugs was with the intent to distribute. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. 111, 115-117 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>436 Mass. 369, 371-372, 376-377 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 265 n.9 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Officer Wadlegger contributed two opinions in his capacity as an expert witness in this case. First, he opined that the size and packaging of the drugs was \u201cconsistent with street level sale.\u201d \u201cThis much-used word has certain chameleon-like qualities. Many activities may be \u2018consistent\u2019 with a certain state of af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>fairs, but equally, if not more, consistent with completely different ones. The probative effect of \u2018consistent\u2019 evidence depends upon the extent to which the consistency is exclusive of other explanations, and elicited testimony using the word should make this clear.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>601 A.2d 45, 52 n.23 (D.C. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The present case illustrates the weakness of relying predominantly on expert witness opinion that certain facts are \u201cconsistent with\u201d intent to distribute, because, here, without added information that the defendant was actually loitering in a high crime area and doing something in some way associated with the sale of drugs, the inference that the defendant was a seller as opposed to a recent buyer \u2014 that is, that any \u201cstreet level sale\u201d was by the defendant rather than to the defendant \u2014 is a matter of speculation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 16, 18-19 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Officer Wadlegger\u2019s second opinion was that the defendant was more likely a seller rather than a user because he did not have a pipe in his possession. While this adds something to the equation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 401-402 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 770, 792 (2009), to infer intent to distribute on the basis of this opinion, even in combination with the first opinion, would also be based on speculation given the absence of other indicia of an intent to distribute<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the fact that Officer Wadlegger conceded that he had arrested and charged other persons with mere possession of crack cocaine even though they were not in possession of implements for smoking the cocaine, that other common items such as soda cans can be used to smoke crack cocaine, and that crack cocaine can be mixed with marijuana and smoked in the form of a cigarette. See <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751 (1958) (\u201can opinion given by an expert will be disregarded where it amounts to no more than mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts that do not give adequate support to the conclusion reached\u201d). In sum, even though this opinion provides evidence that, when stopped, users of cocaine \u201cusually have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>something on their person ... to ingest [the] drug,\u201d it also states that that is not always the case; thus, it is not sufficient to provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the element of intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">b. <em>Inadmissible hearsay basis for expert opinion. </em>The trial judge sustained seven hearsay-based objections by defense counsel over the course of Officer Wadlegger\u2019s brief testimony. On cross-examination, this telling exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cAnd there is nothing about the fact that it\u2019s three rocks that suggests to you that he\u2019s a dealer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cThe manner in which it was packaged, our information about [the defendant], the area, the observations beforehand, and the way it\u2019s packaged, and the amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cLet me ask you this: Did you personally see [the defendant] engage in narcotics transactions on September 30, 2009?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cI did not, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd so you\u2019re relying predominantly on information that was provided by Outside sources?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">A.: \u201cYes. From a reliable informant, correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd the informant\u2019s name?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-13\">A.: \u201cI don\u2019t have that. It wasn\u2019t my informant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Although defense counsel did not move to strike the remainder of Officer Wadlegger\u2019s opinion testimony, this testimony casts a pall over his other opinion testimony. This case falls into that narrow and exceptional class of cases in which the failure to object to evidence at trial must be noticed for the first time by an appellate court because the record on appeal demonstrates that the error was plain and trial counsel\u2019s failure to object created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Massaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 508 (2003) (\u201cThere may be instances, too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an appellate court <em>sua sponte\u201d); Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 811 n.4 (2006). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frisino, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 551, 553-554 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lester, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 63-66 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The principal problem with Officer Wadlegger\u2019s opinion testimony is that, as he testified on cross-examination, it was based predominantly on inadmissible hearsay, and it thus violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation insofar as it channeled information from an informant who was not a witness at trial or even identified, and whose reliability was unknown. See <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705, 2713, 2716 (2011). See also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221 (2012) (plurality opinion). Without it, any inference that the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs was with the intent to distribute would be based only on speculation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986) (\u201cfindings based on legally insufficient evidence are inherently serious enough to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">5. <em>Application of the </em>Jackson-Latimore <em>standard, </em>a. <em>Deference to rational fact finder. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 374, citing <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. at 318-319, the Supreme Judicial Court adopted the governing Federal due process standard for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case. This test has multiple parts. Sufficiency of the evidence challenges in most cases are resolved on the basis of the first part of the <em>Jackson-Latimore </em>standard, which is relied upon by the majority. We defer to the jury or judicial fact finder\u2019s judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence when, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. at 319. This case, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ever, is not one in which the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to infer an intent to distribute beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">b. <em>Conclusions based on conjecture insufficient to support conviction. </em>The second part of the <em>Jackson-Latimore </em>standard is reserved for cases such as this where proof of an essential element such as intent has been deemed sufficient by the fact finder on the basis of a conjecture, as opposed to a reasonable inference, from the evidence. \u201c[I]t is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">It is possible that the defendant in this case had possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it. One could speculate that the defendant had sold ten to fifteen twists of crack cocaine for twenty dollars apiece before the police arrived and arrested him, which might account for much of the cash in his pocket. One could speculate that the absence of a pipe with which to smoke crack cocaine means that the three twists of crack cocaine in the defendant\u2019s possession were being held with the intent to distribute. One could speculate that the defendant was standing in an area known for drug sales with a group of individuals, one of whom was a drug dealer, before they entered the Daily Mart store because he too was a drug dealer. However, our duty as an appellate court requires us \u201cto take a hard look at the record and to reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative. . . . This function is especially important in criminal cases, given the prosecution\u2019s obligation to prove every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spinney, </em>65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mon-talvo, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 329-330 (2010). An inference here that the defendant had the intent to distribute \u201cmay be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>plausible, but cannot bear the weight of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>456 Mass. 578, 582 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">c. <em>The evidence of intent to distribute is insufficient to satisfy the </em>Jackson-Latimore <em>standard because it tends equally to sustain two inconsistent propositions. </em>The principle that in certain situations the fact finder can permissibly draw either of two conflicting, but nonetheless reasonable and possible, inferences, is illustrated by the facts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 260-261, 264-266 (2010). There, the police observed a van parked with its engine running and lights on. The passenger side door was open and a man was observed bending over behind a dumpster. The man then entered the van, and it drove away. The police followed the van and pulled it over after a traffic violation. <em>Id. </em>at 260-261. The experienced narcotics officers suspected that drugs had been either dropped off or picked up. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant was pat frisked. The police found a cellular telephone in his right pants pocket and, in the pocket of a pair of athletic style shorts underneath his pants, a clear plastic bag filled with 13.98 grams of powder cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 262. During booking, the detectives also removed $56 in cash. <em>Id. </em>at 261. A police witness acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s activity at the dumpster, combined with the discovery of cocaine in his inner pocket, \u201cwould suggest that the defendant was a buyer, but he further opined, without objection, that the quantity of cocaine in the defendant\u2019s pocket, the cellular telephone, and the fifty-six dollars found during the patfrisk were consistent with possession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. According to the police officer\u2019s testimony, \u201cstreet sales typically involve amounts of cocaine up to one gram; the defendant had 13.98 grams, almost one half ounce of cocaine.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Despite the absence of paraphernalia indicative of drug dealing or items indicative of personal consumption, the critical additional evidence was supplied by another police witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cTestifying as an expert, he identified the North Common Street area where the defendant was first seen behind the dumpster as a high drug crime area. He described typical street level cocaine transactions in Lynn as involving one gram, one-half gram, or one-quarter gram bags, called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u2018twists,\u2019 being sold for twenty to forty dollars. He also testified that larger quantities of cocaine, such as five to six grams, are amounts more typical of purchases by a \u2018mid level dealer,\u2019 and can be broken down into smaller twists for sale to individual users. He expressed the opinion that a one-half ounce of cocaine is \u2018not usually for personal use\u2019 because \u2018[i]t\u2019s a lot of cocaine to have on hand\u2019 for one user, saying that the common practice of street-level users is to buy one or two small twists at a time because they do not have the money to buy larger quantities. He conceded that some people do acquire larger amounts for personal use, but in his experience on the streets of Lynn, one-half ounce of cocaine is \u2018an awful lot of cocaine\u2019 for that purpose. He estimated that the amount of cocaine found on the defendant would sell for about $600 as a single package, but could be divided into fifty-six separate one-quarter gram twists, sold on the street at twenty dollars each.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 262.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In <em>Hernandez, supra </em>at 264-265, we explained that the familiar and often cited axiom from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croft, </em>345 Mass. 143, 145, (1962), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>305 Mass. 393, 400 (1940) (\u201cWhen the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof\u201d), was not applicable: \u201cThis case does not involve such a small amount of drugs; the drug expert opined that a typical package sold on the street is one-quarter of one gram. Here, the defendant was in possession of a bag containing 13.98 grams, which, as the expert permissibly stated, can be broken down into fifty-six one-quarter gram street bags.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. In other words, in <em>Hernandez, </em>based on the quantity of the cocaine and the police officer\u2019s expert testimony concerning typical street level transactions and the significance of this amount, the inference from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>evidence that the defendant possessed the cocaine for personal use was not as likely as the inference that he possessed it with the intent to distribute it, and therefore the fact finder had a rational basis for choosing to draw the latter inference instead of the former inference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 272 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 245 (1981) (\u201cTo the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \u2018it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. at 116-117. Here, on the other hand, considering the totality of the evidence, even if the two opinions contributed by Officer Wadlegger (the significance of the size and packaging of the three rocks of crack cocaine and the absence of a pipe) are given evidentiary weight, the inference of possession with intent to distribute and the inference of possession for personal use are inconsistent and equally plausible.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croft, </em>345 Mass. at 145; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dostie, </em>425 Mass. 372, 376 (1997) (\u201c[A] jury may not use conjecture or guesswork to choose between alternative inferences\u201d; rather, \u201ceach inference must be a reasonable and logical conclusion from the prior inference\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>456 Mass. at 583 (\u201cinference . . . may be plausible, but cannot bear the weight of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d where inconsistent conclusion \u201cequally inferable\u201d). And, without Officer Wadlegger\u2019s opinions, the speculative leap required to reach the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s possession was with the intent to distribute would be even greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The question in this case is not the plausibility or implausibility of any hypothetical theory of innocence, but simply whether the evidence the Commonwealth presented was constitutionally sufficient to permit a rational finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the three rocks of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute. The stubborn facts and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them in this case are inadequate as an evidentiary foundation to support a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt of intent to distribute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rodriguez, 456 Mass. at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">For the above reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a finding of guilty on so much of the indictment as charges unlawful possession of cocaine and resentencing.

Not only is this view of the evidence unsupported by the direct testimony of Officer Lopes, quoted above, but it is also at odds with the testimony of Officer Lopes about his search for the defendant. Officer Lopes did not testify that he went directly to the location of the arrest at the Daily Mart at 585 Wil-braham Road. Rather, he testified that he first went to the \u201cBristol Street and Wilbraham Road area.\u201d We can take judicial notice of the fact that this location is six streets and about 2,000 feet away from the Daily Mart, which is located in an easterly direction from Bristol Street at 585 Wilbraham Road. See Mass.G.Evid. \u00a7 201(c) (2012). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 69 n.9 (1997). However, Officer Lopes testified further that he did not find the defendant in that location and expanded his search by traveling on Wilbraham Road \u201cto the area of Alden Street.\u201d There, according to Officer Lopes, he made an observation of the defendant \u201cin front of the Daily Mart.\u201d The testimony given by Officer Wadlegger was that he went to \u201cthe area of 585 Wilbraham Road.\u201d However, the only reasonable inference to draw from his testimony is that Officer Wadlegger was part of the backup response called for by Officer Lopes when the defendant was spotted in the vicinity of the Daily Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Thus, the statement by the majority that \u201c[t]he judge also could have properly inferred that Sepheus had been located in the general area of his arrest from at least about 4:00 p.m., the time the officers received the information regarding his whereabouts, to approximately 5:00 p.m., the time of his arrest,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 770, is not supported by any admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Locations and distances referred to in this note are based on data supplied as of June 12, 2012, by Google Maps at http://maps.google.com.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The other person arrested for the hand-to-hand sale was later identified as Dwayne Griffiths. There is no evidence connecting the defendant to Griffiths beyond the fact that they were observed by Officer Lopes standing in a group of three to five males for a few moments before the individuals entered the Daily Mart and with the group for a minute or two inside the Daily Mart. Officer Lopes testified, for example, that the defendant did not wave at any cars or approach any vehicles and did not assist Griffiths. In fact, Officer Lopes conceded that the defendant was approached and arrested inside the Daily Mart on account of the outstanding warrant and not based on a suspicion that he was involved in drug sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">On cross-examination, Officer Wadleggger conceded that (1) he has arrested and charged persons with simple possession of crack cocaine who did not have possession of a pipe or implement for smoking the drug; (2) he has arrested and charged persons in possession of more than three rocks of crack cocaine with simple possession; and (3) three rocks of crack cocaine could be consumed in an hour or two and are less than a day\u2019s supply for an occasional user.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The reference here is to the unknown informant, whose reliability was never established. In fact, based on the testimony of Officer Lopes about his search for the defendant and the absence of a firearm or weapon on his person, the information reported by the informant was clearly not reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\u201cAs the name \u2018circumstantial evidence\u2019 suggests, the strength of a particular piece of evidence turns on the specific circumstances that accompany the evidence. Wigmore observed that, \u2018[a]side from autoptic preference, ... all evidence must involve an inference from some fact to the proposition to be proved.\u2019 See 1A John Henry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 25 (Tillers rev. 1983). But as the inferential leap between the fact and the proposition to be derived grows, the probative value of the evidence diminishes. See Irene Merker Rosenberg &amp; Yale L. Rosenberg, \u2018Perhaps What Ye Say Is Based Only on Conjecture\u2019 \u2014 Circumstantial Evidence, Then and Now, 31 Hous. L.

Bank, N.A., </em>648 F.2d 879, 895 (3d Cir.), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 893 (1981): \u201cThe line between a reasonable inference that may permissibly be drawn by a jury from basic facts in evidence and an impermissible speculation is not drawn by judicial idiosyncracies. The line is drawn by the laws of logic. If there is an experience of logical probability that an ultimate fact will follow from a stated narrative or historical fact, then the jury is given the opportunity to draw a conclusion because there is a reasonable probability that the conclusion flows from the proven facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Furthermore, the majority appears to assume that the evidence that the defendant possessed the drugs for personal use depends on the belief that he bought them from Dwayne Griffiths. See <em>ante </em>at 770 (\u201c[A] user would not likely remain at the point of purchase for such an extended period of time\u201d). The Commonwealth did not raise this argument below. Here, the defendant has no burden of proof with regard to where he purchased or acquired the three rocks of crack cocaine. Certainly, we may assume there were potential sources other than Dwayne Griffiths.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Caution must be exercised in relying on the general character of a location as a \u201chigh crime\u201d area because \u201cso-called high crime areas are inhabited and frequented by many law-abiding citizens who are entitled to be protected against being stopped and frisked just because of the neighborhood where they live, work, or visit. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 663 (2001). The term \u2018high crime area\u2019 is itself a general and conclusory term that should not be used to justify a stop or a frisk, or both, without requiring the articulation of specific facts demonstrating the reasonableness of the intrusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>454 Mass. 159, 163 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">\u201c[E]vidence that a defendant associated with persons who committed the crime does not lead to an inference that he also participated in the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, 16 </em>Mass.

In <em>DeJesus, </em>the facts indicated that \u201cthe defendant was gathered with the other occupants in a small bedroom in which he was surrounded by drugs, cash, and packaging materials; [this] suggests a close connection between him and the heroin sales operation; drug sales had been conducted over a period of time with several buyers while the defendant was in the apartment and, therefore, a witness to those transactions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>44 Mass.
