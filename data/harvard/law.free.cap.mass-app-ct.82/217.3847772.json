L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), upholding a determination of the Department of Developmental Services, formerly the Department of Mental Retardation (department), finding Tartarini to be a person with borderline intelligence, not mental retardation, and therefore ineligible for services. See G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 39; 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.01 &amp; 6.04(1) (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>reverse the judgment and order a new judgment remanding the case to the department for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>Statutory and regulatory background. </em>Because this case turns on the relationship between the statutory and regulatory definitions of mental retardation, we begin with the pertinent statute and regulation. General Laws c. 123B, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cmentally retarded person\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201c[A] person who, as a result of inadequately developed or impaired intelligence, <em>as determined by clinical authorities as described in the regulations of the department </em>is substantially limited in his ability to learn or adapt, <em>as judged by established standards </em>available for the evaluation of a person\u2019s ability to function in the community\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">As relevant here, 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01, as adopted in 2006, provides the following definition of \u201cmental retardation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cMental Retardation means <em>significantly sub-average intellectual functioning </em>existing concurrently and related to <em>significant limitations in adaptive functioning. </em>Mental retardation manifests before age 18.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The same regulation defines \u201csignificantly sub-average intellectual functioning\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">\u201can intelligence test score that is indicated by a score of 70 or below as determined from the findings of assessment using valid and comprehensive, individual measures of intelligence that are administered in standardized formats and interpreted by qualified practitioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">The mechanism for measuring intelligence is set forth in 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.02(3)(b) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">In addition, the regulations define \u201cadaptive functioning\u201d to include three areas: (1) independent living/practical skills; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>cognitive, communication, and academic/conceptual skills; and (3) social competence/social skills. 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01. Significant limitations in adaptive functioning are defined, in part, by reference to scores on standardized tests that measure the individual\u2019s adaptive functioning in these areas. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>Tartarini had intelligence (IQ) test scores of 71 at age 18, 69 at age 40, and 71 at age 42. The department\u2019s hearing officer found that the score for the test administered closest to the age of 18 was determinative,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the standard error of measurement of plus or minus 5 points should not be applied in view of Tartarini\u2019s education and work history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both the department\u2019s expert witness and the hearing officer found that the IQ score of 71 exceeded the cut-off score of 70, and that it was therefore not necessary to consider evidence of adaptive functioning. However, both did assess, in the alternative, Tartarini\u2019s adaptive functioning. The department\u2019s expert testified that Tartarini\u2019s scores on standardized tests of adaptive functioning did not meet the eligibility requirements set forth in \u00a7 2.01, and that Tartarini\u2019s scores were consistent with information concerning her education, work history, and daily living. The hearing officer found that Tartarini had tested sufficiently well on standardized tests of adaptive functioning to conclude that she did not have significant limitations in this area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Superior Court judge, noting the deference which administrative decisions must be accorded, affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, Tartarini challenges the validity of the regulatory scheme. Tartarini argues that the definition of significantly sub-average intellectual functioning in 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 is in excess of statutory authority and contrary to law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). We do not reach the other arguments raised by Tartarini, as we hold that this is the rare case where the departmental regulation is invalid because it is inconsistent with the legislation that authorized it. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(b). See also <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Authy., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 274 (2008), <em>S.C., </em>453 Mass. 614 (2009), citing <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006) (questions of interpretation of regulations, like statutes, receive de nova review). For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the definitions of mental retardation and significantly sub-average intellectual functioning, as they are currently drafted, do not adequately fulfil the legislative directive that clinical authorities be described in the regulations. As a result, we conclude that the department cannot deny services on the basis of an assessment of intellectual functioning as provided in 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201cIn determining the validity of the subject regulation, we recognize that an administrative regulation is \u2018not to be declared void unless [its] provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate, and enforcement of such regulation[] should be refused only if [it is] plainly in excess of legislative power.\u2019 <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 613 (1997), quoting from <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992). Further, a party who questions the facial validity of a regulation \u2018bears the heavy burden of \u201cproving on the record \u2018the absence of any conceivable ground upon which [the regulation] may be upheld\u2019 \u201d \u2019 (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 612.\u201d <em>Green\u2019s Case, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001). This principle, however, is one of deference, not abdication. <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>452 Mass. 162, 166 (2008). <em>Gauthier </em>v. <em>Director of the Office of Medicaid, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>790 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The definition of mental retardation applicable to this case was adopted by the department in 2006. The regulation in effect before 2006 did describe clinical authorities, see G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><em>\u201cMental retardation </em>means, consistent with the currently (1994) accepted clinical authority of the American Association on Mental Retardation, substantial limitations in present functioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 (1994). The previous regulation further stated that \u201c[m]entai retardation begins before age 18, and is manifested by significantly sub [-] average intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The pre-2006 regulation did not contain a specific definition of sub-average intellectual functioning, instead relying on the incorporated clinical authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The department revised the regulations in 2006 after a judge of the Superior Court, relying on the guidelines promulgated by the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) (now the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities [AAIDD]), entered judgment on behalf of an applicant whose IQ scores ranged from 75 to 83. The judge rested his decision on the AAMR guidelines, finding that there was \u201cno reference to a bright-line IQ cut-off score on which the [department's argument depends.\u201d See <em>Melican </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>20 Mass. L. Rep. 723, 727 (Super. Ct. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The department argues that it was entitled to amend its regulations to respond to the omission identified in the decision. The department also argues that it was entitled to reject the AAMR standards as controlling when it promulgated the 2006 regulations. It maintains that the 2006 regulations, in fact, are based on \u201cevolving standards\u201d and that the regulations are based on \u201cstandardized testing\u201d and the \u201cappropriate exercise of clinical judgment.\u201d We agree that the department may alter or amend its regulations, consistent with applicable law, and that it has considerable discretion in defining sub-average intellectual functioning in accordance with clinical authorities. See <em>Massachusetts Fedn. of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 774 (2002). However, contrary to the statutory requirement, the 2006 regulations fail to describe the clinical authorities upon which the clinical judgments regarding intelligence are made. Cf. <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 774-775 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Legislature did not give the department unfettered discretion to define mental retardation. The statute requires that the department\u2019s regulations be based on \u201cclinical authorities.\u201d G. L. c. 123B \u00a7 (1). The statute further requires that the clinical authorities be \u201cdescribed in the regulations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The statutory language is unequivocal. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000) (\u201c[a]n agency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts\u201d). See also <em>Bureau of Old Age Assistance </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>326 Mass. 121, 123-124 (1950). We are not at liberty to ignore such a clear legislative command. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633 (2005) (\u201cif [court] concluded] that the statute is unambiguous, [it] give[s] effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent\u201d). See also <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>411 Mass. 183, 194 (1991) (\u201can administrative agency has no authority to promulgate rules or regulations that conflict with the statutes or exceed the authority conferred by the statutes by which the agency was created\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The department has discretion to choose the clinical authorities upon which to rely, but it may not omit reference to those authorities in its regulations, nor may it rely upon standards and clinical judgments that are undisclosed and untethered to the statutory mandate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See generally <em>Smith, supra </em>at 646-647 (agency must include in its regulations and consider all criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>enumerated by Legislature). Here, the legislative requirement that the regulations describe clinical authorities fulfils two important purposes. First, it ensures that the department\u2019s regulations comport with accepted medical standards. Second, the legislative mandate gives clear context and direction to applicants. In the absence of a description in 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 of clinical authorities,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applicants (and reviewing courts) lack the standards by which they can understand and evaluate claims for services. Compare <em>Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>428 Mass. 805, 812-817 (1999) (regulations failed to define terms in meaningful manner and conflicted with governing Federal statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The proceedings in this case demonstrate the pitfalls inherent in applying the regulations without the benefit of anchoring clinical authorities. The department has taken disparate positions in this case regarding the meaning of mental retardation and sub-average intellectual functioning. In its Superior Court memorandum filed in opposition to Tartarini\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings (memorandum), the department stated that its \u201cdefinition [of mental retardation] relies upon elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of the definition of the American Psychological Association (2000) and the American Association on Mental Retardation (2002), but is also informed by the insights of the National Research Council (2002).\u201d None of these authorities is described in the regulations. The department also stated in its memorandum that \u201c[a]n IQ of 70 is not an absolute ceiling for the psychologist determining eligibility in all cases, but it is the common professional benchmark.\u201d This statement is at odds with the testimony of the department\u2019s expert who treated the score of 70 as a cut-off score.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing officer also considered the score to be a cut-off. On appeal, the department now argues that the regulation does establish a \u201cceiling.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, in the absence of anchoring principles, the application of the regulatory definition of mental retardation became a moving target. The applicant may not be made to guess at the standards governing eligibility for services. See generally <em>Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the proceedings before the Superior Court both parties attempted, for the first time, to introduce evidence of clinical authorities in support of their respective positions. A judge conducting a review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, generally does not consider matters outside the administrative record, whether by affidavit or judicial notice. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(6); <em>She Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bldg. Code Appeals Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 273 (1985). However, even if we were to consider the authorities of which the department sought judicial notice, that review would only underscore the interpretive problem. First, the clinical authorities have not been described in the regulations, and there is no showing that the regulations were based on these authorities. Second, the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>orders IV-TR (4th ed. text revision 2000) (DSM-IV-TR), upon which the department relies, provides that individuals with IQs between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive functioning may be diagnosed as mentally retarded, <em>id. </em>at 41-42, and that \u201c[impairments in adaptive functioning, rather than a low IQ, are usually the presenting symptoms in individuals with [m]entai [Retardation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely, the DSM-IV-TR also states that an individual with an IQ below 70 who exhibits \u201cno significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning\u201d would not be diagnosed as a person with mental retardation. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the DSM-IV-TR references a score of \u201cabout\u201d 70 as the upper limit of clinical mental retardation, <em>id. </em>at 41, and not a bright line as the department suggests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These nuances reinforce the wisdom of the statutory mandate requiring the department to describe the clinical authorities upon which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We recognize that the difficulties inherent in drawing the line between borderline intelligence and significantly sub-average intelligence cannot be overstated, and that the department is entitled to substantial deference in that regard. It is for this reason that the statutory anchor of clinical authorities assumes central importance. This opinion does not express a view whether the regulations comport with clinical authorities. Nor does it express a view whether Tartarini is a person with an intellectual disability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Tartarini\u2019s present classification as a person with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>borderline intelligence derives from application of an inadequate regulatory definition. That determination is therefore invalid. The regulations defining inadequately developed or impaired intelligence must, pursuant to G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 1, identify and describe the clinical authorities on which they are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new judgment is to enter remanding the case to the department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The statutes have been amended to change the name of the department, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>effective June 30, 2009, see G. L. c. 19B, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 2008, c. 182, \u00a7\u00a7 9 &amp; 115, &amp; St. 2008, c. 451, \u00a7\u00a7 28 &amp; 187, and to substitute the words \u201cintellectual disability\u201d for the words \u201cmental retardation,\u201d effective November 1, 2010, see G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 2010, c. 239, \u00a7\u00a7 39-41. Because this matter arose under the previous statutes, the parties and the court have used the term \u201cmental retardation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">A contemporaneous evaluation described Tartarini as having \u201cborderline intelligence.\u201d A later evaluation described her as mildly mentally retarded. Because the regulations require that mental retardation manifest before age 18, the hearing officer looked to the evaluation most proximate to that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The evidence showed that Tartarini had completed high school, had received a certificate from a community college, and had held jobs at a Boston law firm (from which she was fired for engaging in inappropriate conduct) and at the Federal Reserve Bank, from which she had been laid off. She traveled to and from the bank by public transportation. The evidence also showed that she lived at home with her mother at all times and was assisted in substantial measure by her mother in many aspects of daily living; that she experienced difficulty maintaining her personal hygiene, managing time and money, cooking and caring for herself; and that she may have placed herself at risk in her dealings with strangers, demonstrating both gullibility and naivet\u00e9, as well as an ill-defined sense of sexual boundaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Although there was evidence in the record concerning mental health conditions as well, including specific diagnoses, the impact of these conditions on Tartarini\u2019s intellectual functioning and adaptive abilities was not considered by either the department\u2019s expert or the hearing officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The implicit, if not explicit, theme of the department\u2019s argument is that once it identifies the objective tests and requires a clinician\u2019s review in its regulations, it has identified the relevant clinical authorities. We recognize that the term clinical authorities can have a dual meaning. For example, the interstate compact on mental health, 18A Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. c. 123 App. \u00a7 1-1, art. IV(\u00bfz), makes reference to clinical authorities in this and other States who are responsible for examining and receiving patients under the compact. Here, however, the department itself has acknowledged in its previous regulations and its memorandum in the Superior Court that the term clinical authorities means standards or findings by recognized external professional experts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>associations, not employees of the department. This only makes sense. Otherwise, the definition of clinical authorities in this context would be completely circular. Similarly, the standardized tests described in the regulations are measurements of intelligence or adaptive abilities; they are not clinical authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In contrast to the Federal government\u2019s process for publication of Federal regulations, Massachusetts maintains no published history of the comments on regulations. Nor were the regulations at issue here accompanied by a preamble that would explicate which authorities were adopted in whole or in part. Further, we \u201care not permitted to take notice\u201d of the unpublished regulatory history. <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Lic. Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 926 (1980). See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">We note that in other contexts where the Legislature has required that an agency adopt standards or guidelines by regulation, the agency has promulgated regulations which specifically reference the clinical authorities upon which they are based. For example, the regulations of the Department of Mental Health incorporate by reference the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 2000) in defining \u201cclinical criteria.\u201d 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 29.04(2)(a)(3) (2009). See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 38 (requiring that department \u201cadopt regulations . . . which establish ... the highest practicable professional standards\u201d). Similarly, the Sex Offender Registry Board has promulgated extensive regulations which cite numerous clinical studies. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(1); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2)-(21) (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The expert did not testify whether she applied the standard error of measurement of plus or minus five points to the IQ score. The hearing officer did consider the standard error of measurement and found it inapplicable. The department here argues that under the regulations only qualified practitioners, in this case its expert, may consider and apply these \u201cpsychometric properties\u201d pertaining to the standard error of measurement when reviewing a particular test. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.02(3)(2) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The department leaves the adjustment of scores based on the standard margin of error to its clinicians.

No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764, 776 &amp; n.20 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Tartarini relies on an AAIDD definition of \u201cintellectual disability\u201d (which also was not part of the administrative record) that states \u201can IQ test score of around 70 or as high as 75 indicates a limitation in intellectual functioning.\u201d The department states that this portion of the AAIDD guidelines was rejected by the department. We do not know which part of the AAIDD guidelines was relied on by the department. See <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We also recognize that the hearing officer found that Tartarini also did not meet the adaptive functioning test. Because the statute links the definition of sub-average intelligence with the functional test, and because we cannot be sure whether, upon explicit adoption of clinical authorities, the same finding would again be made with respect to the intelligence prong, on remand the department shall give this matter full reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
