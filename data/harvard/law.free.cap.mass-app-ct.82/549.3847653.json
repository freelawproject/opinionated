App. Ct. 218, 222 (2011) (citation omitted), made a decision that is supported by substantial evidence and correctly applied the law in determining that the plaintiff, Reta Maguire, lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>a period of her eligibility for long-term care coverage when she transferred her former residence, valued at $140,300, to her daughter Karen for one dollar. MassHealth determined that the transfer did not qualify under the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exception found in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d) (2006). As a result, MassHealth determined that Maguire was ineligible for MassHealth benefits for a period of 548 days. This had the effect of forcing Maguire or her family to pay for her care during the ineligibility period. The Office of Medicaid board of hearings (board) affirmed MassHealth\u2019s denial of benefits, and Maguire appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A Superior Court judge denied Maguire\u2019s renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings, and entered judgment for the defendant holding that there was substantial evidence in the record supporting the decision by the board\u2019s hearing examiner upholding the decision made by MassHealth. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the judge that substantial evidence supports the ruling made by the hearing officer that Maguire\u2019s transfer did not qualify under the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>The following facts are based on the hearing examiner\u2019s decision on Maguire\u2019s appeal of her disqualification for MassHealth long-term care benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maguire was an eighty-eight year old widow when she was admitted to a nursing facility on July 5, 2007. Her daughter Karen had been living with her for the previous two years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 24, 2007, Maguire transferred her former residence, a one-bedroom condominium valued at $140,300, to Karen for one dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Karen is one of four children of Maguire. Karen began to live with her mother in 2004. The arrangement was designed to assist Maguire, who was in declining health, and to provide Karen with a place to live at minimal cost. Karen helped her mother with housecleaning, laundry, meal preparation, and taking medications. Bathing of Maguire was done by Karen\u2019s sisters Maureen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Kathryn. Maureen occasionally slept over at Maguire\u2019s home on Saturday evenings. Karen\u2019s brother Joseph visited often and spent Sundays with Maguire.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">During the relevant years in question, Karen often spent Saturday nights and part of Sunday at her boyfriend\u2019s house. Karen also worked at various jobs between 2005 and 2007 and during at least some of the time she was at work while her mother was alone at home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2006, Karen worked for Manpower International, Inc., for six months and for other staffing services during the remainder of the year. For at least several months during 2007, Karen worked full time, forty hours per week. In the period \u201cimmediately prior to her institutionalization,\u201d Maguire spent days at home alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Maguire did not require physical assistance with the activity of dressing and undressing during the entire time Karen lived with her. Maguire received assistance from all of her children, including Karen, in getting to her medical appointments. Karen submitted an undated affidavit stating that since she moved in with her mother in 2004, she \u201chad to assist her with many of her activities of daily living.\u201d However, \u201c[t]he detailed testimony from Karen\u2019s siblings verifies that Karen did not assist her mother with . . . transfers, bathing, toileting, or dressing, but that Karen instead helped with more instrumental homekeeping activities, such as housekeeping, meal preparation, and taking her mother to doctor\u2019s appointments.\u201d \u201cKaren\u2019s entire testimony suggests that she assisted more with housekeeping and cooking related tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">There is evidence in the record that Maguire was diagnosed as suffering from some form of dementia,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that during the relevant time period she had periods of confusion and expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>reluctance to leave her home or to be cared for by persons other than family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On July 19, 2007, shortly after Maguire was admitted to a nursing facility, her nurse practitioner wrote a letter to MassHealth in which she stated that Maguire, who had been under her care \u201cfor several years,\u201d \u201chas diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and dementia which have progressed over the past three years,\u201d and \u201chas required progressive assistance for many of her activities of daily living from her daughter, Karen Maguire[,] over this time period.\u201d The letter concludes with the following opinion: \u201cShould she return home from rehab in the future she will never be independent and will continue to require very significant assistance from her family.\u201d However, there is no evidence in the record to support the interpretation of this letter placed on it by Maguire, namely, that her inability to live independently in the community extended back in time to the entire period when Karen was living with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The Legislature has directed that a deferential standard of review should be applied to administrative agency decisions of this nature based on the agency\u2019s \u201cexperience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge,\u201d and \u201cthe discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, \u201c[djeference is not abdication. It does not permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>a detectable \u2018error of law\u2019 by the agency.\u201d <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 203, 209 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Assessments of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters committed to the discretion of the hearing examiner. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>446 Mass. 611, 617 (2006). This commitment of discretion to the hearing officer does not excuse an appellate court from the duty to ensure that the subsidiary findings made by the hearing examiner are adequate and sufficiently detailed to disclose the basis for and support the ultimate finding. See <em>Mc-Elroy\u2019s Case, </em>397 Mass. 743, 746 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\u201cOur deferential standard of review does not permit a court to treat the proceeding [under G. L. c. 30A] as a trial de nova on the record which was before the administrative board. A court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de nova.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 528-529 (2007) (citation and quotation omitted). As a result, Maguire has the burden of establishing that the decision made by MassHealth is invalid, and we are obliged to uphold the decision unless it was \u201c[bjased upon an error of law\u201d or is \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), (e). See <em>Forman, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">2. <em>Whether the hearing examiner applied the regulatory framework correctly. </em>Maguire objects to several aspects of the manner in which the hearing officer applied the regulatory framework. We hold that the hearing officer properly interpreted this framework. We start with the basic proposition that, generally, the transfer of one\u2019s home by a \u201cnursing-facility resident\u201d for less than \u201cfair-market value\u201d during the \u201clook-back period\u201d is deemed a \u201cdisqualifying transfer\u201d that results in a loss of eligibility for the payment of services by MassHealth. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(C) (2006). \u201cMassHealth has strict limitations on asset transfers made by applicants before applying for these benefits, in order to prevent individuals from giving away their assets to their family and friends and forcing the government to pay for the cost of nursing home care.\u201d <em>Gauthier </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Director of the Office of Medicaid, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>779 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">One exception to this role is a transfer to a \u201ccaretaker child.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d). Under 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d), a transfer of a former principal residence by a \u201cnursing-facility resident\u201d to her child for less than market value during the look-back period is \u201cpermissible\u201d provided that \u201cthe nursing-facility resident\u2019s child ... [1] was living in the nursing-facility resident\u2019s home for at least two years immediately before the date of the nursing-facility resident\u2019s admission to the institution, and [2] who, as determined by the MassHealth agency, provided care to the nursing-facility resident that permitted him or her to live at home rather than in a nursing facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In order to qualify under the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exemption, Maguire\u2019s asset transfer to Karen had to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d). Here, there is no dispute with regard to the first prong of the two-part test contained in \u00a7 502.019(D)(6)(d). With regard to the second prong, the issue is whether, during the two-year period, in the absence of the care provided by Karen, Maguire would have required a nursing-facility level of care, i.e., that she would have required institutionalization. See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001 (2007) (defining nursing-facility resident to include \u201ca resident in any institution\u201d). Institutionalization is defined in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001 as \u201cplacement of an individual in one or more medical institutions\u201d for an actual or expected \u201ccontinuous period of at least 30 days.\u201d Medical institutions are, in turn, defined as facilities \u201cproviding acute, chronic, or long-term care.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The requirement that an applicant seeking the benefit of the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exemption demonstrate that the care she received while at home enabled her to avoid institutionalization is consistent with Federal Medicaid law that imposes the same obligation on an applicant, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(A)(iv) (2006), and defines \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d and \u201cnoninstitutionalized\u201d care as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>mutually exclusive. Compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(h)(3) (an individual is deemed to be \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d when she is a resident of a nursing facility or inpatient in a medical institution for whom payment is made on the basis of the level of care provided by the nursing facility), with \u00a7 1396p(h)(4) (an individual is deemed to be \u201cnoninstitutionalized\u201d when she is receiving nonacute services, including personal care services, at home or in a community setting). Thus, a person who receives care in a community setting such as an assisted living facility<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is not receiving \u201cacute, chronic, or long-term care\u201d and thus is not to be regarded as \u201cmstitutionalized\u201d or as receiving \u201cinstitutionalized care.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001. See note 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Contrary to Maguire\u2019s view, the hearing examiner did not apply the wrong legal standard by making reference to certain provider regulations that define \u201cactivities of daily living\u201d in connection with a nursing home\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid reimbursement for patient care. See 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 456.409(B), 515.001 (1998).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Karen filed an affidavit that makes specific reference to helping her mother \u201cwith many of her activities of daily living.\u201d Although provider regulations such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>as 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 456.409(B) and 515.001 were not written to make the determination required by \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d), they shed light on the functional needs of persons who require institutionalized versus noninstitutionalized care and thus are relevant to cases like this involving a \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d) determination. Moreover, these regulations are useful in evaluating the level of care actually provided by Karen. It was thus reasonable for the hearing examiner to compare the services Karen testified she actually provided to her mother (cleaning, laundry, preparation of meals, help with taking medications, and sometimes the selection of clothes to wear) with what are regarded as the activities of daily living.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Finally, both parties have cited the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) policy manual regarding Medicare part A, as set forth in the SSA\u2019s program operations manual system (POMS)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> supplemental security income (SI) 01150.122C, which contains an exception to the rule against a transferor, who becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>institutionalized, transferring a home to a son or daughter at less than market value. The policy, POMS SI 01150.122C, provides as follows (subject to exceptions not applicable here):<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cC. Policy \u2014 Providing care for the transferor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cThe transfer of a home exception requires that the son or daughter (who received the transferred home) provided care that enabled the transferor to reside at home instead of in an institution or facility. Such care is substantial but not necessarily full-time care. A son or daughter is providing care for purposes of this exception if he/she does most of the following for the transferor on regular basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c\u2014 prepares meals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c\u2014 shops for food and clothing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c\u2014 helps maintain the home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u201c\u2014 assists with financial affairs (banking, paying bills, taxes);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201c\u2014 runs errands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">\u201c\u2014 provides transportation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">\u201c\u2014 provides personal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">\u201c\u2014 arranges for medical appointments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">\u201c\u2014 assists with medication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">The Superior Court judge gave appropriate consideration to the relationship between POMS SI 01150.122C and \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d). In this regard Federal law and Massachusetts law are consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-17\">3. <em>Whether there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in support of the findings and rulings made by the hearing examiner. </em>The hearing examiner ruled that Maguire had not established that from July, 2005, to July, 2007, the two years preceding her admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to a nursing facility, Karen provided her with care that permitted her to live at home \u201crather than in a nursing facility.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d). The hearing examiner noted that although Maguire\u2019s needs were related to the onset of dementia more than they were related to the type of physical limitations often associated with admission to a nursing facility, she still \u201ccould have used her assets and/or property, remained in the community, and privately paid for placement in an appropriate Assisted Living Facility for a long period of time.\u201d According to the hearing examiner, \u201cthe assistance that [Maguire] may have received from Karen and the rest of her children may have allowed them to avoid changing the community setting for [Maguire] to another type of community setting, but may not have prevented any need for \u2018institutionalization.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3L\">The hearing examiner\u2019s decision relating to whether the care provided to Maguire by Karen during the two-year period prior to Maguire\u2019s admission to a nursing facility qualified for the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exemption is supported by substantial evidence. The hearing examiner was not required to accept the testimony of Karen or her siblings that Maguire could not live safely at home without Karen\u2019s presence. The hearing examiner was entitled to credit the evidence that indicated that for at least several months prior to Maguire\u2019s move to a nursing facility, Karen was working full time and Maguire was alone for substantial periods of time, and that prior to that Karen was employed, and thus away from her mother\u2019s home, on an intermittent basis. In particular, and contrary to the assertion by Maguire, the testimony by Karen and her siblings that Maguire was reluctant and resistant to allowing persons outside her family to care for her does not, even if credited, compel a finding that Maguire could not have been cared for in a community-based setting such as an assisted living facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>While in an undated affidavit Karen made reference to performing services for her mother that were comparable to activities of daily living, the hearing examiner found that Karen had not regularly performed such services but, instead, had provided her mother with personal care services such as cleaning, doing laundry, preparing meals, and assisting with taking medications. Although there is some overlap between such services and those that are set forth in POMS SI 01150.122C, the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Karen did not satisfy the requirements of Massachusetts law precludes a finding that she satisfied the requirement set forth in POMS SI 01150.122C that \u201c[a] son or daughter is providing care for purposes of this exception if he/she does most of the following for the transferor on regular basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The final item of evidence relied upon by Maguire is the one-page, two-paragraph letter from her nurse practitioner. It was for the hearing examiner to weigh the significance of this letter. It is not accurate to describe the contents of the letter as \u201cuncon-troverted\u201d because it must be considered in light of the firsthand accounts of the services provided to Maguire by Karen and her siblings, and the inferences that could be drawn from this testimony about Maguire\u2019s condition during the two years when Karen resided with her. It was not unreasonable, therefore, for the hearing examiner to discount the letter\u2019s significance because it does not describe Maguire\u2019s condition in any detail over the several years preceding her admission to a nursing facility (other than to say her dementia had \u201cprogressed\u201d over that period of time), and is vague about the precise nature of the services provided by Karen during that period of time (\u201c[Maguire] has required progressive assistance for many of her activities of daily living from her daughter, Karen . . . , over this time\u201d). Although the fact that the letter was not prepared until after Maguire entered the nursing facility affected the hearing examiner\u2019s assessment of its weight, the more significant consideration is its lack of detail. Ultimately, the hearing examiner was not required to credit the nurse practitioner\u2019s conclusion that but for the care provided by Karen, Maguire would have required institutionalized care two years sooner.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, the decision made by the hearing examiner is not based upon any error of law and is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-15\">See generally G.

One of the difficulties with the record in this case is the lack of evidence, testimonial and documentary, about the state of Maguire\u2019s medical condition over the two-year period while Karen resided with her and how it affected her day-to-day life, including, in particular, the activities of daily living that are set forth in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.001 (2006). A diagnosis of \u201cdementia,\u201d without more, does not permit a determination of a person\u2019s specific needs. We understand the challenges faced by a family who must care for a loved one who suffers from dementia, but the law governing this case imposes on Maguire the burden of demonstrating that she qualified for the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exemption. See Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.019(D)(6)(d). This, in turn, requires her to establish that without the care provided by Karen she would have had to enter a nursing facility two years earlier than she did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">For example, the \u201ccaretaker child\u201d exception that is at the heart of the dispute in this case specifically states that whether the child has provided the level of care required in order to render a transfer of assets permissible is to be determined by MassHealth.
