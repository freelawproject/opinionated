See <em>Papleacos </em>v. <em>Town of Tewksbury, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 1133 (2012). This opinion in general follows the rule 1:28 memorandum and order.

Papleacos, Jr., appeals from a summary judgment dismissing his complaint seeking reinstatement after he was terminated from his position as a permanent intermittent police officer for the town of Tewksbury (town). Papleacos alleges that the motion judge erred in concluding that his proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tionary period was extended for an additional twelve months and that, therefore, he was not entitled to the protections of a tenured employee. Resolution of the appeal thus requires a determination of when, under the applicable statutes, Papleacos\u2019s probationary period began and ended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Background. </em>Papleacos was appointed as a permanent intermittent police officer with an employment start date of October 27, 2003. He attended a regional police academy from October 20, 2003, through March 12, 2004.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>On March 16, 2004, Papleacos was appointed as an intermittent police officer for the town, and on March 18, 2004, he was sworn in by the town clerk. Based on the recommendation of the chief of police, the town terminated Papleacos\u2019s employment on October 27, 2004. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>At issue is the length of Papleacos\u2019s probationary period. Two different statutory provisions affect the probationary period for intermittent police officers \u2014 G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, and G.L. c.41, \u00a7 96B.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The town argues that Papleacos\u2019s probationary period began upon his original appointment with a start date of October 27, 2003, relying on the civil service unit certification handbook for permanent intermittent police officers issued by the human resources division of the Executive Office for Administration and Finance, which explicitly states: \u201c[T]he probationary period for . . . intermittent employees begins on the first date of their appointment, as recorded by the Appointing Authority on the Authorization Employment Form 14.\u201d The town then argues that because, due to his attendance at the training academy, Papleacos did not actually perform the duties of the position for thirty days during that probationary period, the probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>period was extended, pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34,\u00ae for an additional twelve months.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Papleacos argues that his probationary period did not commence to run until he completed his tenure at the police academy. See <em>Selectmen of Brookline </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 813, 814 (2003) (\u201ctime spent in the police academy does not count towards the one-year probationary period required before achieving tenure\u201d). The premise of Papleacos\u2019s argument is that police officers, who are required to undergo training prior to beginning their work as officers, must be treated differently than other civil service employees. Accordingly, he argues that his probationary period expired in September, 2004, prior to his termination, and that he is entitled to all the protections of a tenured employee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Papleacos\u2019s argument is off the mark because the statutes involved \u2014 G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, and G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B \u2014 treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>full-time police officers differently from intermittent officers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Reading those statutes in harmony, it is clear that the Legislature sought to distinguish full-time police officers from intermittent or reserve police officers. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 34, first par., inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, provides, as to full-time employees, that \u201c[f] olio wing his original appointment ... a person shall actually perform the duties of such position on a full-time basis for a probationary period of six months.\u201d The third paragraph of \u00a7 34 applies to intermittent employees and provides for a six-month probationary period <em>\u201cimmediately </em>following such appointment\u201d (emphasis supplied). The third paragraph goes on to state that the probationary period \u201cshall include the actual performance of the duties of such position.\u201d That language is not present in the statutory language governing the probationary period of full-time police officers. For that reason, the town distinguishes this court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 814, which involved the appointment of permanent full-time officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We have no need to address this specific dispute, as we decide the question on another ground. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 96B, requires that full-time officers undergo training at a police academy prior to exercising police powers. See 550 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03(1) (1997). In recognition of the explicit training academy requirement for full-time officers, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96B, first par., as appearing in St. 1994, c. 333, provides that full-time officers \u201cshall be exempted from the provisions of chapter thirty-one\u201d while undergoing training. See 550 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.03(1) (1997) (full-time municipal police officers). Thus, it reasonably may be inferred that this exemption would encompass the probationary period provisions of c. 31, \u00a7 34. No such exemption, however, appears for intermittent officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, on May 3, 2012, we concluded that Papleacos\u2019s six-month probationary period started after his appointment on October 27, 2003, and properly was extended for twelve months when Papleacos did not actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>perform the duties of the position for thirty days during that probationary period.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\">At the appellate level, the court examines a grant of summary judgment de nova. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Papleacos raises the issue whether he was obligated to complete the police training course. The civil service unit certification handbook for permanent intermittent and reserve service is not as helpful as it could be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\">When two statutes control, \u201cthe two statutes can be read together, giving meaning and purpose to both.\u201d <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>457 Mass. 663, 673 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">That section, inserted by St. 1973, c. 393, \u00a7 11, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cFollowing his original appointment as a permanent employee to a less than full-time civil service position, including a reserve, intermittent, call, recurrent, or part-time position, a person shall serve a probationary period of six months immediately following such appointment, which shall include the actual performance of the duties of such position for not less than thirty working days or the equivalent thereof during such period, before he shall be considered a less than full-time tenured employee, provided that if such person has not performed such duties for such thirty working days or the equivalent thereof, his probationary period shall be extended for <em>an additional twelve months, </em>at the end of which time such person, if his employment has not been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be deemed to be a tenured employee\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b475-13\">It is undisputed that in the six months following his completion of training at the police academy, Papleacos performed the duties of the position for more than thirty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b475-14\">He also argues, but only in a footnote, that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether he worked as a police officer for more than thirty days in the six months after his October of 2003 \u201cemployment date.\u201d This does not rise to the required level of appellate argument. See <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>442 Mass. 582, 603 n.18 (2004). The town argues that Papleacos waived the argument by failing to raise it and further contends that Papleacos worked only twenty-five and one-half days in the probationary period. Papleacos\u2019s reply brief for the first time directs us to some record support for his assertion that he worked more than thirty days during his probationary period, but again gives us no analysis. In any event, deciding as we do, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Prior versions of G.
