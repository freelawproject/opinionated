(Long Bow), operates a Web site that contains information critical of plaintiff Jenzabar, Inc. (Jenzabar). During the relevant time period, an Internet user who conducted a search for the term \u201cJenzabar\u201d using the Web site Google.com (Google) would have found Long Bow\u2019s site prominently listed among the search results. According to Jenzabar, that listing was likely to confuse Internet users into believing that the Long Bow site was sponsored by or affiliated with Jenzabar. Claiming that such confusion was caused by Long Bow\u2019s unauthorized use of the trademark \u201cJENZABAR,\u201d Jenzabar sought to enjoin that use pursuant to State and Federal trademark law. A Superior Court judge granted Long Bow\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\"><em>Standard of review. </em>We review a decision to grant summary judgment de nova, to determine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bank of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>460 Mass. 327, 331 (2011), quoting from <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). \u201c[T]hat some facts are in dispute will not necessarily defeat a motion for summary judgment. The point is that the disputed issue of fact must be material.\u201d <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>431 Mass. 1, 5 (2000), quoting from <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 607 (1991). \u201cA fact is \u2018material\u2019 only if it might provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>basis for a fact finder to find in favor of the [nonmoving] party.\u201d <em>Liss </em>v. <em>Studeny, </em>450 Mass. 473, 482 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the essential facts, reserving certain details for later discussion. Except where specifically noted, the facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">1. <em>The parties. </em>Jenzabar is a Boston-based software company that designs complex software systems for use by colleges and universities. The company was founded in 1998 by Ling Chai, who remains Jenzabar\u2019s president and chief operating officer. Jenzabar holds a Federal registration in the word mark JENZA-BAR for use in connection with the sale of computer software and various related functions. Although the mark is not registered in Massachusetts, there is no dispute either as to the validity and protectability of the mark or as to Jenzabar\u2019s ownership of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Long Bow is a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation based in Brookline. Long Bow produces educational films and documentaries about Chinese history and culture. Long Bow does not sell its films directly to the public; instead, they are available only through a network of independent distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">2. <em>Long Bow\u2019s Web site. </em>In 1995, Long Bow released \u201cThe Gate of Heavenly Peace,\u201d a documentary about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. A slightly abbreviated version of the film was broadcast on public television stations in 1996. In connection with that broadcast, Long Bow created a Web site to give background information about the film and the protests. The site, which has been updated periodically since its creation, contains over 2,000 pages of text in English and Chinese, as well as an interactive map of Tiananmen Square and a \u201cmedia library\u201d that includes photographs, music, and video clips. It has been recognized by a number of media organizations and educational institutions as a valuable educational resource.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Among the many resources on Long Bow\u2019s site is a section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>containing information about sixteen of the \u201ckey characters\u201d in the film. One of those characters is Chai, who was a student leader in the Tiananmen Square protests. The site contains a short biography of Chai, briefly describing her role in the protests and noting that she declined to be interviewed for the film. It also contains excerpts from Chai\u2019s criticism of the film and of her portrayal in it. After learning that Chai had founded a software company, Long Bow added a link from Chai\u2019s biography to a new page containing information about Jenzabar. That page, titled simply \u201cJenzabar,\u201d is the principal subject of the parties\u2019 present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">3. <em>Google\u2019s search results.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since at least 2006, a Google user searching for \u201cJenzabar\u201d would find Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenza-bar\u201d page listed on the first page of results. A representative example of the initial search results, as they appeared prior to the summary judgment hearing, is reproduced in the Appendix. The listing for Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d page specifically appeared as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cJenzabar</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">The information on these pages about Chai Ling and Jenzabar, the software company she runs with her husband, Robert Maginn, contains excerpts from and links . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">www.tsquare.tv/film/jenzabar.html - Cached - Similar\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">As is generally true, Google created this listing by applying its proprietary algorithms to the computer code of Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d Web page. The information that Long Bow supplied in its code included both the visible content of its page and data that a viewer of the page would not be able to see (known genetically as \u201cmeta data\u201d or \u201cmeta tags\u201d). The relationship between the information that Long Bow provided and the content of Google\u2019s listing varied somewhat among the three main components of the listing: its title; its short description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>referenced Web page; and the \u201cuniform resource locator\u201d (URL) for that page.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The title of the referenced Web page (\u201cJenza-bar\u201d) came from a \u201ctitle tag\u201d selected by Long Bow.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A Web site\u2019s creator can also insert a \u201cdescription meta tag\u201d to control the description that appears in a search listing. However, because Long Bow had not done so at the time suit was filed, the description that appeared in the listing for Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d page was simply \u201cripped\u201d by Google from the opening text that appeared on that page. The URL was chosen by Long Bow.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The order in which Google lists its search results is determined by its proprietary algorithms. Although the specifics of those algorithms are not publicly available, the summary judgment record indicates that Google relies in part on information that the page\u2019s creator provides (i.e., the content of the Web site) and information from other sources (e.g., the quantity and nature of other pages in Google\u2019s index that link to that page). Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Jenzabar, we treat as true Jenzabar\u2019s contention that a Web page\u2019s author can improve the page\u2019s ranking in Google search results through the use of \u201ckeywords meta tags.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Long Bow used the term \u201cJenza-bar\u201d as a \u201ckeywords meta tag\u201d on its Jenzabar page and on several subsidiary pages linked to it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">4. <em>Correspondence between the parties. </em>In February, 2007, Jenzabar contacted Long Bow with a number of complaints about Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d page and two related pages. At that time, the pages contained excerpts from and links to media <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>accounts of several lawsuits that had been filed against Jenzabar by some of its former top executives. Jenzabar complained that some of the quoted statements were false and demanded their removal. In addition, Jenzabar objected to Long Bow\u2019s uses of the JENZABAR mark in the URL and title of Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d page and in all three pages\u2019 meta tags. According to Jenzabar, the use of its mark as a keyword was calculated to \u201cmaximize the prominence of [Long Bow\u2019s] Web pages on Internet search engines, in order to deliberately divert Internet users who are looking for the Jenzabar Web site.\u201d Jenzabar demanded that Long Bow remove the term \u201cJenzabar\u201d from the title, URL, and meta tags of its Web pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Long Bow made several changes to its site as a result of Jenzabar\u2019s letter. These changes included posting certain additional information regarding Jenzabar\u2019s disputes with its former executives; revising the language of the pages to ensure that readers would be aware that Jenzabar disputed the accuracy of some of the accounts; and adding prominent disclaimers to all of the pages on which Jenzabar was mentioned stating that the pages were \u201cthe sole responsibility of the Long Bow Group, and are in no way affiliated with or sponsored by Jenzabar, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">5. <em>The lawsuit. </em>Unsatisfied with Long Bow\u2019s response, the plaintiffs filed an eight-count complaint in Superior Court on May 14, 2007. The first two counts alleged defamation and trade libel. The remaining counts alleged trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition, under both Massachusetts and Federal law. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1125(a) &amp; (c) (2006); G. L. c. 110H, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13, 16; G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Long Bow moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). On August 20, 2008, a judge allowed Long Bow\u2019s motion as to the two defamation counts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the plaintiffs have raised no issue on appeal regarding that dismissal. On the trademark counts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the judge held that although Jenzabar seemed unlikely to prevail, it had adequately pleaded the claims to survive a motion to dismiss. Following extensive discovery, Long Bow moved for summary judgment. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). After a hearing, a second judge concluded that the evidence was insufficient to allow a jury to find that Long Bow\u2019s use of the JENZABAR mark created any likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He granted Long Bow\u2019s motion in full on December 7, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Trademark infringement. </em>To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must show (1) that the plaintiff owns a valid and protectable mark; (2) that the defendant made a commercial use of that mark without the plaintiff\u2019s consent; and (3) that the defendant\u2019s use of the mark is likely to create confusion, thus causing harm to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114(l)(a), 1125(a)(1)(A) (2006). There is no dispute in this case as to the first element, so we begin by examining Long Bow\u2019s use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">a. <em>Commercial use. </em>To be liable under the Lanham Act, a defendant must use a mark \u201cin connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(l)(a). See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1). Because its Web site\u2019s purpose is educational rather than commercial, Long Bow argues with some force that its use of the JENZA-BAR mark was not \u201cin connection with any goods or services,\u201d and that it thus cannot be liable for trademark infringement. See, e.g., <em>Bosley Med. Inst. </em>v. <em>Kremer, </em>403 F.3d 672, 678 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Cir. 2005); <em>Utah Lighthouse Ministry </em>v. <em>Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research, </em>527 F.3d 1045, 1052-1053 (10th Cir. 2008). According to Jenzabar, however, the fact that a page on the Long Bow site contains contact information for the distributors of Long Bow\u2019s films is sufficient to render any use on the site a use \u201cin connection with the sale\u201d of those films. This position finds some support in the Federal case law. See, e.g., <em>Taubman Co. </em>v. <em>Webfeats, </em>319 F.3d 770, 775 (6th Cir. 2003). We need not resolve this issue, because our decision rests on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">b. <em>Likelihood of confusion. </em>The core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion, i.e., whether the defendant\u2019s use of the plaintiff\u2019s mark is likely to confuse consumers about the \u201csource, sponsorship or affiliation\u201d of the defendant\u2019s goods or services. <em>Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>657 F.2d 482, 492 (1st Cir. 1981). Although likelihood of confusion is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, it may be resolved on summary judgment if the plaintiff has failed to present evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that consumers are likely to be confused. See <em>id. </em>at 486; <em>International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Winship Green Nursing Center, </em>103 F.3d 196, 199-200 (1st Cir. 1996). See generally 6 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 32:120 (4th ed. 2010) (McCarthy on Trademarks). In an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of a trademark defendant, it is our job as \u201cthe reviewing court [to] decide whether the evidence as a whole, taken most hospitably to the markholder, generates a triable issue as to likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Wkrs., supra </em>at 201. The trademark plaintiff must show \u201ca probability of confusion; it is not sufficient if confusion is merely possible.\u201d <em>Nora Bevs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Perrier Group of America, Inc., 269 </em>F.3d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2001), quoting from <em>Estee Lauder Inc. </em>v. <em>The Gap, Inc., </em>108 F.3d 1503, 1510 (2d Cir. 1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Jenzabar thus \u201cmust demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>strate a substantial likelihood of confusion to survive summary judgment.\u201d <em>Beacon Mut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>OneBeacon Ins. Group, </em>376 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Jenzabar\u2019s claim of potential consumer confusion is an exceptionally narrow one. There is no allegation that someone might buy one of Long Bow\u2019s films under the mistaken impression that it was produced by or in affiliation with Jenzabar. Nor does Jenzabar allege that a visitor to any page on Long Bow\u2019s Web site would be confused about whether Jenzabar had created or endorsed the site (a proposition that would have been untenable even before Long Bow added prominent disclaimers to its site). Instead, Jenzabar claims only that an Internet user viewing the results of a Google search for the term \u201cJenzabar\u201d might click the result for Long Bow\u2019s \u201cJenzabar\u201d page under the mistaken belief that the linked page is officially sponsored by Jenzabar. According to Jenzabar, this momentary confusion, dispelled the moment the Internet user reaches Long Bow\u2019s site, is actionable under the principle of \u201cinitial interest confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">c. <em>Initial interest confusion. </em>\u201cInitial interest confusion occurs when the defendant uses the plaintiff\u2019s trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion.\u201d <em>Nissan Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Nissan Computer Corp., </em>378 F.3d 1002, 1018 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 974 (2005), quoting from <em>Interstellar Starship Servs., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Epix, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 936, 941 (9th Cir. 2002). Several Federal courts of appeals, including the First Circuit, have characterized initial interest confusion as a type of \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic whereby the infringer impermissibly trades on the good will of the plaintiff\u2019s mark. <em>Beacon Mut. Ins. Co., 376 </em>F.3d at 16 n.4, quoting from <em>Dorr-Oliver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fluid-Quip, Inc., </em>94 F.3d 376, 382 (7th Cir. 1996). See <em>Checkpoint Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Check Point Software Technologies, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 270, 294 (3d Cir. 2001); <em>Lamparello </em>v. <em>Falwell, </em>420 F.3d 309, 317 (4th Cir. 2005), cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1069 (2006); <em>Vail Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Vend-Tel-Co., Ltd., </em>516 F.3d 853, 872 (10th Cir. 2008); 4 McCarthy on Trademarks \u00a7 23:6 (2011). The essence of a claim of initial interest confusion is thus that the defendant has \u201cacted in a way which traded on the goodwill of [the plaintiff\u2019s] trademark.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Interstellar Starship Servs., </em>304 F.3d at 944. Absent such misappropriation of good will, an \u201cerroneous guess\u201d on the part of a consumer about the source of a Web site \u201cdoes not generally amount to a likelihood of initial interest confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In determining whether a defendant is engaging in the type of <em>\u201cbait </em>and switch\u201d behavior that gives rise to actionable initial interest confusion, courts have generally focused on five factors. Those factors are (1) the relatedness of the parties\u2019 goods or services; (2) the level of care exercised by the relevant consumers; (3) the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s mark; (4) the defendant\u2019s intent in using the plaintiff\u2019s mark; and (5) evidence of actual consumer confusion. See, e.g., <em>Network Automation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Advanced Sys. Concepts, Inc., </em>638 F.3d 1137, 1154 (9th Cir. 2011). In cases that involve Internet search results, courts have also examined the visual appearance of the particular link or advertisement in context on the screen. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Hearts on Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Nile, Inc., </em>603 F. Supp. 2d 274, 289 (D. Mass. 2009). We believe that these six factors are the salient considerations in the specific factual circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">No single factor in the analysis is dispositive. However, in determining whether the defendant has appropriated the good will of the plaintiff\u2019s mark in such a way as to cause actionable initial interest confusion, courts have focused especially on the first two factors. <em>Interstellar Starship Servs., </em>304 F.3d at 945 (\u201cactionable initial interest confusion on the Internet is determined, in large part, by the relatedness of the goods offered and the level of care exercised by the consumer\u201d). See also <em>Checkpoint Sys., Inc., </em>269 F.3d at 296-297; <em>Promatek Indus., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Equitrac Corp., </em>300 F.3d 808, 812 (7th Cir. 2002); <em>Sensient Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>SensoryEffects Flavor Co., </em>613 F.3d 754, 766 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1603 (2011). These factors are paramount because \u201c[w]hen products are similar, a firm is more likely to benefit from the goodwill of a firm with an established mark. And when consumers do not exercise a high level of care in making their decisions, it is more likely that their initial confusion will result in a benefit to the alleged infringer from the use of the goodwill of the other firm.\u201d <em>Checkpoint Sys. Inc., supra at </em>296-297. Accord <em>Interstellar Starship Servs., supra </em>at 945. \u201cConversely, in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of these factors, some initial confusion will not likely facilitate free riding on the goodwill of another mark, or otherwise harm the user claiming infringement. Where confusion has little or no meaningful effect in the marketplace, it is of little or no consequence\u201d in the analysis of whether any actionable initial interest confusion is likely. <em>Checkpoint Sys., supra </em>at 297. See <em>Nissan Motor Co., </em>378 F.3d at 1019 (holding in context of summary judgment motion that defendant\u2019s use of NISSAN mark was actionable only to extent that defendant \u201ctraded on the goodwill of Nissan Motor by offering links to automobile-related websites\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">(i) <em>Relatedness of the parties\u2019 goods. </em>In this case, there is no similarity between the parties\u2019 goods. Jenzabar sells complex software systems; Long Bow sells documentaries about China. Jenzabar has never sold documentary films, and Long Bow has never sold computer software of any kind. The most that Jenza-bar can say on this factor is that both parties sometimes sell their goods to institutions of higher education. \u201cThe most favorable inference that may be drawn from [this] evidence ... is that both parties\u2019 products are used in the [education] field. However, such a broad inference is not sufficient to demonstrate that a genuine issue exists\u201d on this factor. <em>Astra Pharmaceutical Prod., Inc. </em>v. <em>Beckman Instruments, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 1201, 1206 (1st Cir. 1983) (affirming summary judgment in favor of trademark defendant). Because the parties\u2019 goods are unrelated,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> this factor strongly suggests that no actionable confusion is likely as a matter of law. Cf. <em>Hasbro, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clue Computing, Inc., </em>232 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2000) (in affirming summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ment in favor of trademark defendant, endorsing District Court\u2019s \u201crefusal to enter the \u2018initial interest confusion\u2019 thicket . . . given the unlikelihood of \u2018legally significant\u2019 confusion\u201d in a case \u201cinvolving such disparate products and services\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">(ii) <em>Sophistication of consumers. </em>\u201cIf likelihood of confusion exists, it must be based on the confusion of some relevant person; i.e., a customer or purchaser.\u201d <em>Astra Pharmaceutical, </em>718 F.2d at 1206. It is not sufficient for Jenzabar to suggest that a careless Web user might be confused by Long Bow\u2019s search result. To defeat summary judgment, Jenzabar must instead produce evidence from which a jury could conclude that Jenzabar\u2019s actual or potential customers were substantially likely to be confused. The undisputed sophistication of those customers, and the degree of care they exercise in selecting their software, strongly indicates that no actionable confusion is likely as a matter of law. According to Jenzabar, \u201cthe purchase of [Jenza-bar\u2019s] software is expensive and includes a multi-year maintenance and service contract between the institution and the vendor.\u201d For this reason, \u201ccustomers typically engage in extensive due diligence over a period of months or years prior to making a decision to purchase or upgrade a Jenzabar system, or to switch from a Jenzabar system to a competitor\u2019s system.\u201d \u201cThere is always less likelihood of confusion where goods are expensive and purchased after careful consideration.\u201d <em>Peoples Fed. Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>People\u2019s United Bank, </em>672 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2012), quoting from <em>Astra Pharmaceutical, </em>718 F.2d at 1206. \u201cWhen consumers exercise heightened care in evaluating the relevant products before making purchasing decisions, courts have found there is not a strong likelihood of confusion. Where the relevant products are expensive, or the buyer class consists of sophisticated or professional purchasers, courts have generally not found Lanham Act violations.\u201d <em>Checkpoint Sys., Inc., </em>269 F.3d at 284. See <em>Sensient Technologies Corp., </em>613 F.3d at 766 (on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that no initial interest confusion was shown between similar products where customers were sophisticated and exercised high degree of care).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(iii) <em>Strength of Jenzabar\u2019s mark. </em>\u201cThe stronger a mark \u2014 meaning the more likely it is to be remembered and associated in the public mind with the mark\u2019s owner \u2014 the greater the protection it is accorded by the trademark laws.\u201d <em>Network Automation, Inc., </em>638 F.3d at 1149, quoting from <em>Brookfield Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Coast Entertainment Corp., </em>174 F.3d 1036, 1058 (9th Cir. 1999). This factor is relevant to the likelihood of initial interest confusion in an Internet search because \u201ca consumer searching for a distinctive term is more likely to be looking for a particular [entity], and therefore could be more susceptible to confusion\u201d if a link to a different entity\u2019s Web site appears in the search. <em>Network Automation, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In the context of a motion for summary judgment we accept Jenzabar\u2019s contentions that JENZABAR is a fanciful term invented for use as the company\u2019s name and that the mark has developed a strong reputation in the higher education community. This factor thus favors Jenzabar.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, this factor must be viewed in light of the two factors we have already examined. See <em>id. </em>at 1149-1150. In particular, this factor\u2019s significance is diminished by the fact that Long Bow\u2019s site actually does contain information about Jenzabar rather than, for example, linking to a competing or similar product. Compare, e.g., <em>Promatek Indus. Ltd., </em>300 F.3d at 812-813 (finding likelihood of confusion where defendant used direct market competitor\u2019s mark in meta tags). An Internet user who performs a search even for an extremely strong trademark may be searching for information <em>about </em>the mark\u2019s holder rather than for the mark holder\u2019s official Web site. A search result leading to a third-party Web site that contains such information thus may not be confusing at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">(iv) <em>Long Bow\u2019s intent. </em>In examining the likelihood of initial interest confusion, as in other contexts, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Courts assume that the defendant\u2019s intentions were carried out successfully\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Netscape Communications Corp., </em>354 F.3d 1020, 1029 (9th Cir. 2004). See <em>WCVB-TV </em>v. <em>Boston Athletic Assn., </em>926 F.2d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1991). Cf. <em>Planned Parenthood of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Problem Pregnancy of Worcester, </em>398 Mass. 480, 488 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Jenzabar has produced no direct evidence that Long Bow intended to confuse consumers through its use of the mark. Instead, Jenzabar points to the fact that \u201cLong Bow has deliberately used the JENZABAR mark in the title tag, website description, metatags, and other metadata.\u201d This certainly is evidence of Long Bow\u2019s intent to <em>use </em>Jenzabar\u2019s mark, and for summary judgment purposes we assume that Long Bow\u2019s use of the mark in its meta tags was for the purpose of improving its site\u2019s ranking in a Google search for \u201cJenzabar.\u201d See note 7, <em>supra. </em>However, \u201cthe only relevant intent is intent to confuse.\u201d <em>Starbucks Corp. </em>v. <em>Wolfe\u2019s Borough Coffee, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 97, 117 (2d Cir. 2009), quoting from 4 McCarthy on Trademarks \u00a7 23:113 (2011). Given that Long Bow\u2019s site actually contains information about Jenzabar and does not sell goods that compete with Jenzabar, the most natural inference arising from Long Bow\u2019s use of the word \u201cJenzabar\u201d is not of intent to confuse but rather of intent to accurately describe the page\u2019s contents and to bring it to the attention of Internet users searching for information about Jenzabar, who would find it relevant to their search.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We also note that much of the undisputed evidence suggests that Long Bow is not attempting to confuse Internet users. Long Bow makes use only of the word \u201cJenzabar\u201d (necessary to describe the site\u2019s contents), without imitating any stylistic elements of Jenzabar\u2019s logo or Web site in a way that might tend to mislead Internet users. \u201cJenzabar\u201d is included as a keyword for pages that contain information about Jenzabar, but not for any of the other pages in Long Bow\u2019s site. When Jenzabar contacted Long Bow with complaints about the site, Long Bow responded promptly and conscientiously, posting Jenzabar\u2019s objections on the Long Bow site so that visitors could judge for themselves and adding prominent disclaimers of any affiliation with Jenzabar to every page on which the company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>mentioned. After Jenzabar filed an amended complaint identifying the description that appeared in the Long Bow site\u2019s Google listing as potentially problematic, Long Bow took additional steps to clarify the site\u2019s relationship to Jenzabar in terms that are impossible to misread.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Most significantly, it is undisputed that Long Bow had no knowledge of where its pages ranked in the results of a Google search for \u201cJenzabar\u201d until Jenzabar contacted Long Bow in 2006. Although matters of intent generally involve credibility determinations for juries to resolve, \u201cthe summary judgment rule would be rendered sterile ... if the mere incantation of intent or state of mind would operate as a talisman to defeat an otherwise valid motion.\u201d <em>Nora Bevs., Inc., </em>269 F.3d at 125, quoting from <em>Resource Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., </em>926 F.2d 134, 141 (2d Cir. 1991) (affirming summary judgment in favor of trademark defendant). Given the over-all factual context of this case, Jenzabar has not produced legally sufficient evidence of Long Bow\u2019s intent to create a genuine dispute on this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(v) <em>Evidence of actual confusion. </em>For obvious reasons, evidence of actual consumer confusion is always relevant to the question whether consumers are likely to be confused. See <em>Venture Tape Corp. </em>v. <em>McGills Glass Warehouse, </em>540 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2008), cert, denied, 556 U.S. 1128 (2009). Jenzabar has produced no evidence of actual confusion. The fact that a number of visitors reached Long Bow\u2019s site via a Google search for \u201cJenzabar\u201d is not evidence that those visitors were confused. Jenzabar has submitted no evidence, either through consumer surveys or even merely anecdotal, showing that those visitors were searching for the Jenzabar Web site and were confused by the Long Bow site\u2019s search listing. \u201c[I]t is improper to assume that using a trademarked keyword means that the searcher wanted to find the trademark owner. . . . Finding searcher \u2018diversion\u2019 is not possible until one knows where searchers were heading in the first place.\u201d 4 McCarthy on Trademarks \u00a7 23:6, at 23-55 n.13 (2011), quoting from Goldman, Deregulating Relevancy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Internet Trademark Law, 54 Emory LJ. 507, 566 (2005). This is especially true because, as Jenzabar concedes, the types of consumers most likely to be running a Google search for Jenza-bar would be inclined to do \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d on the company. This factor cannot aid Jenzabar in averting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">(vi) <em>Appearance of the search results. </em>Finally, we turn to an objective examination of how the results of a Google search for \u201cJenzabar\u201d actually appeared on an Internet user\u2019s screen at the time of suit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We first note that the top result in such a search has at all times been Jenzabar\u2019s official corporate home page. An Internet user searching for that page would therefore find it exactly where she expected to \u2014 at the top of the search results for \u201cJenzabar.\u201d Such a searcher could click the top link and complete her search unconfused and unimpeded by any act of Long Bow\u2019s. There would be no reason to continue down the list of search results unless she was looking for further information about Jenzabar, in which case the Long Bow site would be relevant and helpful rather than confusing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Moreover, the Long Bow site\u2019s listing did little affirmatively to suggest official endorsement by Jenzabar. The description was an accurate summary of the page\u2019s contents, and was phrased in a neutral manner that did not suggest official sponsorship by Jenzabar. The URL, prominently displayed in the search engine listing, was visibly different from the official Jenzabar URLs that appeared all around it; all of the official sites contained the JENZABAR mark in their domain names, while Long Bow\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>domain name is \u201ctsquare.tv\u201d \u2014 a name that does not suggest affiliation with Jenzabar. The only aspect of the listing that was even potentially confusing was its single-word title: \u201cJenzabar.\u201d Although Jenzabar may be correct that it is unusual for a Web page\u2019s title to be the unadorned trade name of an entity unaffiliated with the page, the title does little affirmatively to suggest official sponsorship by or affiliation with Jenzabar.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Internet users, especially those who influence buying decisions regarding expensive software for large educational institutions (the class of consumers whose confusion would be relevant), understand that a Google search returns a list of pages of varying relevance from a wide range of sources. \u201cThey fully expect to find some sites that aren\u2019t what they imagine based on a glance at the . . . search engine summary,\u201d and they \u201cdon\u2019t form any firm expectations about the sponsorship of a website until they\u2019ve seen the landing page \u2014 if then.\u201d <em>Network Automation, Inc., supra </em>at 1152-1153, quoting from <em>Toyota Motor Sales </em>v. <em>Tabari, </em>610 F.3d 1171, 1179 (9th Cir. 2010). To be sure, an Internet user searching for Jenzabar\u2019s products who came across the listing for Long Bow\u2019s Web site (after already having found Jenzabar\u2019s official site) perhaps might be uncertain about this additional site\u2019s relationship to Jenzabar. However, Jenzabar has not shown how Long Bow would capitalize on any such uncertainty in a way that trades on Jenzabar\u2019s good will. See <em>Interstellar Starship Servs., </em>304 F.3d at 946 (finding no likelihood of confusion where the defendant \u201ccould not financially capitalize on [a] misdirected consumer even if it so desired\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the circumstances of this case, such potential uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>would be a result of \u201csensible agnosticism, not consumer confusion.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Sales, supra. </em>Where the balance of factors otherwise so strongly favors Long Bow, we decline to hold that such uncertainty creates a material factual dispute on the likelihood of actionable initial interest confusion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">d. <em>Summary. </em>To avert summary judgment, Jenzabar bore the burden of \u201cadducing significantly probative evidence tending to show that an appreciable number of [relevant consumers] were in fact likely to be confused or misled.\u201d <em>International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, </em>103 F.3d at 201. Upon examining the relevant factors, we agree with the motion judge that Jenzabar \u201chas not reached this plateau.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Based on the undisputed facts presented here, no rational trier of fact could find that Long Bow\u2019s use of the JENZABAR mark trades on that mark\u2019s good will in such a way as to create a likelihood of initial interest confusion actionable under the trademark laws.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">2. <em>Trademark dilution. </em>Under G.

Instead, Long Bow\u2019s use actually tends to reinforce that quality, since Long Bow uses the mark only to refer to Jenzabar itself. As for \u201cinjury to business reputation,\u201d the only possible injury of that nature stems from the critical content of Long Bow\u2019s site. This is not a trademark harm. \u201cTrademark injury arises from an improper association between the mark and products or services marketed by others.\u201d <em>Universal Communication Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lycos, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 413, 423 (1st Cir. 2007). \u201cIf the injury alleged is one of critical commentary, it falls outside trademark law, whether the criticism is warranted or unwarranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. See 6 McCarthy on Trademarks \u00a7 31:148. Summary judgment was proper on Jenza-bar\u2019s dilution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">3. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, makes unlawful any \u201c[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Jenzabar maintains that summary judgment on its c. 93A claim was improper because c. 93A\u2019s reach is potentially broader than that of the trademark laws. However, even assuming that to be the case,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Jenzabar has identified no specific way in which the added breadth of c. 93A brings Long Bow\u2019s otherwise lawful conduct within that statute\u2019s reach. We have already concluded that Long Bow\u2019s conduct does not possess \u201ca tendency to deceive.\u201d <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., Inc., </em>442 Mass. 381, 394 (2004), quoting from <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 156 (1985). When a Web site contains truthful commentary about a company and does not sell products that compete with the company, attempting to bring the site to the attention of Internet users searching for information about that company does not violate \u201cany recognized or established common law or statutory concept of unfairness.\u201d <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 624 (1994). No claim remains that the content of Long Bow\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Web site is false or misleading. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree with the motion judge that Jenzabar\u2019s c. 93A claim cannot stand in the absence of its defamation and trademark claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>After judgment entered on the trademark claims, Long Bow moved for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Mass. R.Civ.P. 7(b), 365 Mass. 749 (1974); Rule 9A of the Superior Court (2009); and \u00a7 35(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) (2006). Aware that Jenzabar was pursuing an appeal, the judge found that the motion was \u201cpremature on the ground of judicial economy.\u201d For that reason, the judge \u201cdecline[d] to act on [the] motion at [that] time,\u201d and denied it without prejudice. Although Long Bow filed a cross appeal challenging that ruling, both parties agree that the question of attorney\u2019s fees now needs to be addressed and that the Superior Court is the appropriate forum to do so. Without specifically endorsing the approach taken by the motion judge, we remand the question of attorney\u2019s fees for a Superior Court judge to resolve in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order granting Long Bow\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed. The order on Long Bow\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\">We acknowledge the helpful amicus briefs submitted by the Boston Patent Law Association in support of Jenzabar, and by the Digital Media Law Project in support of Long Bow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Because our review of the summary judgment record is de nova, the extent to which the motion judge may have inappropriately engaged in fact finding is ultimately beside the point</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-11\">For example, the parties\u2019 statement of undisputed material facts notes that as of November, 2009, Heidelberg University\u2019s Internet Guide for Chinese Studies listed the site as an \u201cessential\u201d resource on the history of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Although the record contains some information about results generated by other search engines, the parties have focused their discussion primarily upon Google, the most widely used Internet search engine.

I respectfully dissent. The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114(l)(a) and 1125(a)(1)(A) (2006), prohibits Long Bow Group, Inc. (Long Bow), from using the trademark of Jenzabar, Inc. (Jenzabar), in a way that is likely to confuse Internet users to believe that the Long Bow Web site is somehow connected to, or affiliated with, Jenzabar \u2014 which it is not. This confusion, suggesting a nonexisting affiliation with Jenza-bar, is crafted through a \u201cnegative\u201d omission of an identifying Long Bow title and a \u201cpositive\u201d singular reference to the trade name Jenzabar. The trade name Jenzabar is thus embedded within an Internet link, which actually belongs to Long Bow, <em>not </em>Jenzabar. The confusing and misleading link diverts the Internet user to the secondary Long Bow site by trading on the Jenzabar name.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Further, the record demonstrates that Long Bow deliberately used Jenzabar\u2019s trademark in its search listing and Web site hypertext markup language (HTML) code in order to create \u201cinitial interest confusion\u201d that trades wrongly on Jenzabar\u2019s mark. Perhaps the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of initial interest confusion, which is violative of the Lanham Act, is seen in the page produced by a search of the Web site Google.com (Google) using the trademark Jenzabar. That best evidence of the Google search page is attached as an Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I read the majority to acknowledge that initial interest confusion may support liability under the Lanham Act. \u201cMost courts now recognize the initial interest confusion theory as a form of likelihood of confusion which can trigger a finding of infringement.\u201d 4 McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 23:6 (4th ed. 2011) (McCarthy on Trademarks), which cites the following supporting case law: <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Pegasus Petroleum Corp., </em>818 F.2d 254 (2d Cir. 1987); <em>Checkpoint Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Check Point Software Technologies, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 270 (3d Cir. 2001); <em>Pebble Beach Co. </em>v. <em>Tour 18 I, Ltd., </em>942 F.

Mich. 1997); <em>Sensient Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>SensoryEffects Flavor Co., </em>613 F.3d 754 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S.

Cir. 1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Federal courts usually consider several factors in cases of initial interest confusion. These include (1) the relatedness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>of the parties\u2019 goods or services; (2) the level of care exercised by the relevant customers; (3) the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s mark; (4) the defendant\u2019s intent in using the plaintiff\u2019s mark; (5) the evidence of actual consumer confusion, <em>Network Automation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Advanced Sys. Concepts, Inc., </em>638 F.3d 1137, 1154 (9th Cir. 2011); and (6) the visual appearance of the link or advertisement in context of the screen, <em>Hearts on Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Nile, Inc., </em>603 F. Supp. 2d 274, 289 (D. Mass. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In my opinion, three of the afore-described factors are present in this Jenzabar case such that the grant of summary judgment was error of law. These three present factors relate to (1) the strength of Jenzabar\u2019s trademark; (2) the confusing appearance of the Internet listing line for Long Bow, which omits the Long Bow name and references only the Jenzabar trademark; and (3) Long Bow\u2019s intent to confuse. I address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">1. <em>The strength and reputation of the Jenzabar trademark. </em>The majority acknowledges that the Jenzabar company has developed a strong reputation in the higher education community over several years, and that the company has always been uniquely tied to its trademark. The \u201cJenzabar\u201d trademark does not refer to anything other than the Jenzabar company. The mark is likely to be associated only with the Jenzabar company, and is therefore accorded greater protection by trademark law. See <em>Network Automation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Advanced Sys. Concepts, Inc., </em>638 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">2. <em>The confusingly similar appearance of the Internet search listing line crafted by Long Bow. </em>The likelihood of confusion in search engine cases \u201cwill ultimately turn on what the consumer saw on the screen and reasonably believed, given the context.\u201d <em>Hearts on Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Nile, Inc., </em>603 F. Supp. 2d at 289. Google search result listings generally comprise three elements: a title, a short page description, and a Web address. (See the Appendix, which, as previously noted, sets forth a Google search for Jenzabar that leads the searcher to the Long Bow site, notwithstanding that the name Long Bow is hidden.) Again to be emphasized is that the search listing devised by Long Bow, and at issue here, bears only the trademark \u201cJenzabar\u201d \u2014 that is, the listing bears only the unique and unadorned trade name of the Jenzabar company. The predominant term in this search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>listing is <em>not </em>Long Bow \u2014 indeed the title Long Bow does <em>not </em>appear anywhere in the search listing that takes the viewer to the Long Bow site address. <em>Instead, the dominant term in the search listing devised by Long Bow is \u201cJenzabar. \u201d </em>The design of this search listing yields precisely the likelihood of initial interest confusion prohibited by the Lanham Act. The challenged description and Web address, which appear below the trademark Jenzabar, fail to mention Long Bow or clarify ownership of the page in any way. The challenged Internet listing of Long Bow trades on the name Jenzabar and, thereby, achieves immediate placement behind the trademark for Jenzabar and the Jenzabar primary Internet pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It may be that a sophisticated Internet user \u2014 even though the name Long Bow is hidden \u2014 may be able to differentiate the challenged search listing from the Jenzabar search listings appearing above and below. And it may be that the Long Bow page is not quite so confusing once an Internet user arrives there. But that second step-away does not dispel the first step-in, which yields initial interest confusion under the Lanham Act. Put another way, neither the savvy of some Internet users, nor the actual content of Long Bow\u2019s actual page, if one goes to that page, permits Long Bow to design a listing that will initially confuse Internet users. Given that Jenzabar\u2019s established trade name served as the highlighted title path to the Internet listing, where the name Long Bow is hidden, the visual appearance of the Internet listing is obviously likely to confuse as a matter of law under the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">3. <em>Long Bow\u2019s intent to confuse potential Jenzabar customers. </em>From all that appears, Long Bow deliberately designed its listing to exploit the Jenzabar trademark and confuse Internet users. \u201cA defendant\u2019s intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion: Courts assume that the defendant\u2019s intentions were carried out successfully\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Netscape Communications Corp., </em>354 F.3d 1020, 1028 (9th Cir. 2004). The majority recognizes that intent to confuse creates a presumption of successful confusion. Accord <em>Venture Tape Corp. </em>v. <em>McGills Glass Warehouse, </em>540 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1128 (2009) (presuming likelihood of confusion because defendant admitted intent to confuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>As noted, Long Bow chose the unadorned, trademarked name of the Jenzabar company as the complete title of its page. Long Bow also included the Jenzabar trademark in the HTML code of its Web site, so that search engines would suggest the Long Bow site to users searching for \u201cJenzabar.\u201d See <em>Brookfield Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Coast Entertainment Corp., </em>174 F.3d 1036, 1044 (9th Cir. 1999). These undisputed facts are sufficient to establish for summary judgment analysis that Long Bow designed its listing to create initial interest confusion in Jenzabar\u2019s potential customers and, thus, that Long Bow\u2019s listing was likely to confuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As the Boston Patent Law Association (BPLA) notes in its amicus brief, an Internet diverter (Long Bow) may violate the Lanham Act even though it may have a public, political, or nonprofit motive and does not commercially compete for business with the trademark holder (Jenzabar). Phrased differently, using a trademark to trigger confusing Internet links constitutes trademark infringement, even absent direct competition or a commercial motive because competition is not a prerequisite for relief under the Lanham Act. See <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Pegasus Petroleum Corp., </em>818 F.2d at 257-258; <em>Niton Corp. </em>v. <em>Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc., </em>27 F. Supp. 2d 102, 103 (D. Mass. 1998). \u201cConfusion, or the likelihood of confusion, not competition, is the real test of trademark infringement.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Pegasus Petroleum Corp., supra. </em>Accord <em>Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. </em>v. <em>Penguin Books USA, Inc., </em>109 F.3d at 1404.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor is it necessary that the defendant have a profit motive. See <em>SMJ Group, Inc. </em>v. 417 <em>Lafayette Restaurant LLC, </em>439 F. Supp. 2d 281, 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Further, as the BPLA points out, this case implicates the usability of the Internet. In the BPLA analysis, to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Jenzabar claim would, in effect, allow Long Bow, as a third party, to trade on any Internet good will earned by Jenzabar to divert Internet users, either directly or indirectly, to the Long Bow Internet site. By including Jenzabar\u2019s trademark in keyword \u201cmetatags\u201d and in the title of the link to its page, Long Bow practiced a form of \u201cInternet search engine optimization.\u201d The prominent display of a link to Long Bow\u2019s Web site following a point of origin search for \u201cJenzabar\u201d optimized the functioning of the search engine tool \u2014 to the benefit of Long Bow \u2014 by the good will of Jenzabar\u2019s established trademark. Search engine optimization \u2014 the use of specific keywords and metatags to increase the visibility of a Web page in a list of search results \u2014 is implicated when ambiguous title tags or poorly labeled text describe the search result link or the displayed advertisement, as is the case here with the ambiguous Long Bow link, which uses only the name Jenzabar, and not Long Bow. This is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">I believe this case presents a matter of import because of the growing significance of Internet search engines in trademark law. I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the Lanham Act is not violated by Long Bow\u2019s confusing use of Jenzabar\u2019s trademark. Therefore, I dissent from the affirmance of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">While the above cited series of Federal cases support the concept of initial interest confusion as a Lanham Act violation, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has not addressed initial interest confusion.
