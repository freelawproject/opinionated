L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6), and mayhem, pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14. On appeal, the defendant raises arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence and the correctness of the jury instructions on the possession of a dangerous weapon conviction. He also alleges insufficiency of the evidence on the mayhem conviction, ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the introduction of pretrial statements made while he was in detention,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and error on the part of the trial judge in failing to give a missing witness instruction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Factual background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>1. <em>The stabbing. </em>Late in the evening of September 5, 2005, Robert DeMenzes (the victim) and his girlfriend, Kendra Anderson, were \u201changing out\u201d in Ruggles Park in Fall River. Earlier that evening the victim had departed from the park looking to buy marijuana from an individual named \u201cE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The incident at the heart of this case occurred when \u201cE\u201d and the defendant pulled up to the park in a black car with a dent on the side. At this point, the victim was quite drunk. The defendant was holding an item that Anderson at first thought was a pipe or a bat, but later ascertained was \u201csomething teenagers now call pimp canes.\u201d Anderson described the \u201cpimp cane\u201d as between twelve and eighteen inches long. At another point she said it was eleven inches long including the handle, admitting she was \u201cnot really sure about the length.\u201d The defendant began speaking in another language while advancing into the park. \u201cE\u201d was standing right behind the defendant, scream<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ing that he had a gun and that everybody should \u201cback the F up.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">At this point, the defendant pulled the cover off the \u201cpimp cane,\u201d revealing, Anderson testified, a \u201cbig blade\u201d that was about eleven inches long.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant ran at the victim, screaming things. After a warning shout from Anderson, the victim ran from the defendant. At around the same time, Anderson jumped on the defendant\u2019s back and tried to pull him away from the victim. Although Anderson was somewhat successful at first, the defendant broke free and ran after the victim. The victim fell to the ground, either because he tripped or due to his intoxication, at which point the defendant caught up with him. The defendant then repeatedly stabbed the victim with the blade, through his back and arm and \u201cfrom side to side in his stomach.\u201d The victim attempted to block these attacks with his arms, which were sliced as a result. The defendant then kicked the victim in the head three times with his sneakers. At this point, the black car came down the street and both \u201cE\u201d and the defendant jumped in. The car then drove off. The whole incident lasted less than five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Anderson picked the victim up and carried him to the steps of a house near the street. The victim was \u201ccovered in blood\u201d and his intestines were hanging out. Something fell out of his side while they were on the steps of the house.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The police and an ambulance eventually arrived at the scene and took the victim to the Charlton Memorial Hospital. The doctor who treated the victim at the hospital determined that he had suffered at least three stab wounds. The victim had dried blood in a variety of areas and was described as minimally responsive and in critical condition. The doctor further stated that the victim\u2019s wounds were \u2018\u2018life-threatening.\u2019\u2019 The victim\u2019s blood pressure was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cquite low,\u201d which, in conjunction with the stab wounds, led the doctor to believe that he had severe internal bleeding. The doctor did what he could to stabilize the victim but, due to the complexity of his injuries, decided to transfer him to the trauma center at the Rhode Island Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">2. <em>The jailhouse recordings. </em>The defendant was indicted on December 16, 2005, and held pending trial. While in the Bristol County house of correction, he had conversations in which he made incriminating statements. At the Bristol County house of correction, all inmate telephone calls except attorney calls were recorded pursuant to department policy. The defendant was made aware of this policy by the \u201cBristol County Sheriff\u2019s Office Inmate Orientation, Handbook &amp; Rules,\u201d a four-page document that he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth sent a subpoena to John Silva at the Bristol County sheriff\u2019s office, directing him to appear before the court on or before June 1, 2006,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in order to \u201cgive evidence\u201d regarding the defendant\u2019s case. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68. The subpoena specifically requested that Silva bring with him any audio recordings of calls to or from the defendant from September 15, 2005, through June 1, 2006. The subpoena further requested that Silva forward an additional copy of the recordings directly to the Bristol County district attorney\u2019s office. On May 3, 2006, the sheriff\u2019s office sent the recordings to the district attorney\u2019s office. On June 1, the prosecution sent the recordings to the defense counsel along with other discovery materials he planned to use at trial. The recordings were accompanied by a letter indicating that the prosecutor intended to introduce the incriminating calls in evidence and that he would call Silva as a witness at trial. The trial began on October 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Possession of a dangerous weapon, </em>a. <em>Statutory standard. </em>The crime of possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\u00bf),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as amended through St. 1986, c. 581, \u00a7 1, is a single offense which can be proved in one of two different ways depending on whether the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>was carrying the weapon at the time of his arrest. Where, as here, the weapon is not on the defendant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest, the Commonwealth is required to prove that the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201ccarrie[d] on his person . . . any stiletto, dagger, or a device or case which enables a knife with a locking blade to be drawn at a locked position, any ballistic knife, or any knife with a detachable blade capable of being propelled by any mechanism, dirk knife, any knife having a double edged blade, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device by which the blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). In contrast, the statute provides for an alternative mode of proof of guilt in cases in which the defendant is arrested on a warrant or for a breach of the peace and has the alleged dangerous weapon on his person at the time of arrest. In such cases, the statute provides that the defendant is guilty of a \u00a7 10(6) violation if he is \u201carmed with or has on his person ... a billy or other dangerous weapon other than those herein mentioned and mentioned in paragraph (c) . . . .\u201d In each case, the offense is a felony punishable by up to five years in State prison. The effect of the statute\u2019s language is that if a person is not armed at the time of his arrest, as in this case, the Commonwealth is required to prove that the defendant possessed one of the weapons enumerated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In this case, the prosecutor did not argue at trial that the weapon possessed by the defendant was one of those specific weapons enumerated in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). However, the prosecutor argued on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and also argues on appeal, that the defendant\u2019s weapon was a \u201cdirk knife,\u201d one of the enumerated weapons in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the weapon described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>by the witness falls under none of the weapons prohibited by the statute. Because we find that the weapon possessed by the defendant could not be considered a \u201cdirk knife\u201d under the statute, we explore the definitional scope both of \u201cdirk knife\u201d and of the other prohibited weapons listed in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 <em>10(b), </em>in particular that of \u201cdagger[s].\u201d In so doing, we are mindful that in interpreting statutes, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d except where they have acquired a \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning in law.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 20 (2004).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We must presume that the Legislature is familiar with common-law definitions of the terms it uses in a statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 116, 120 (2002).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIf the language of the statute is \u2018fairly susceptible [of] a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result\u2019 ... we will construe [it] so \u2018as to make [it an] . . . effectual piece[] of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>427 Mass. 59, 62 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 251, 254 (1983). However, regardless of the interpretive rule applied, any construction of a statute must give way when its observance \u201cwould involve a construction inconsistent with the manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>intent of the law-mating body.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 11 (2011).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We note also, as Justice Kaplan put it in a different context, no form of words is \u201cself-interpreting.\u201d <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. 847, 851 (1973). Finally, because this is a criminal case, the statute must be construed strictly, and any ambiguity resolved in favor of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lupo, </em>394 Mass. 644, 649 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The leading case in Massachusetts on the definition of \u201cdirk knife\u201d is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 694 (1986). That case noted that Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 642 (1971) defined a \u201c \u2018dirk knife\u2019 [as] a \u2018clasp knife,\u2019 . . . having a large blade like that of a dirk.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 695. This definition is consistent with the usage of the term since before the statute was enacted in 1906 (St. 1906, c. 172, \u00a7 2). See Webster\u2019s International Dictionary 417 (1890) (\u201cDirk Knife\u201d defined as \u201c[a] clasp knife having a large, dirk like blade\u201d; \u201cDirk\u201d defined as \u201c[a] kind of dagger or poniard\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 709 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \u201cdirk knife\u201d as \u201ca large clasp-knife with a dirk-shaped blade\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Currently, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 642 (2002) also defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201cdirk knife\u201d as a \u201cclasp knife having a large blade like that of a dirk.\u201d \u201cDirk\u201d is defined as \u201ca long straight blade dagger . . .\u201d or \u201ca short sword . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>A \u201cclasp knife\u201d is, in turn, defined as \u201ca large pocketknife the blade or blades of which fold or shut into the handle.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 416 (2002).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While <em>Miller </em>did not directly address whether a weapon must be folding in order to be considered a \u201cdirk knife,\u201d that question is central to our analysis here. Based on these definitions, we conclude that one of the prerequisites for a weapon to be considered a \u201cdirk knife\u201d is that its blade folds into its handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Daggers, however, are a class of weapons that do not have this limitation. Historically, the term \u201cdagger\u201d has been considered a \u201cgeneral term\u201d for a \u201cshort weapon used for stabbing\u201d that includes poniards, stilettos, and dirks. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary 365 (1890). See A Standard Dictionary of the English Language 464 (1895) (\u201cdagger\u201d defined as \u201c[a] short edged and pointed weapon fitted primarily for stabbing; a general term covering the dirk, stiletto, poniard, etc.\u201d). The broad scope of this term remains to this day. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 570 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>342 S.W.3d 908, 914 (Mo. App. 2011).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">As we recognized in <em>Miller, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 696, the legislative purpose of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, was \u201cto outlaw the carrying of those knives which are primarily designed for stab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>bing human beings or for other unlawful objectives.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions, perhaps recognizing a similar legislative intent, have interpreted the term \u201cdagger\u201d to mean a blade that, by design, is intended for stabbing. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettway, </em>233 Cal. App. 3d 1067, 1069-1070 (1991) (\u201cDirk and dagger are used synonymously and consist of any straight stabbing weapon .... They may consist of any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing\u201d);<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Giltner, </em>56 Haw. 374, 375 (1975) (dagger as used in statute prohibiting carrying certain dangerous weapons defined as \u201ca short weapon used for stabbing\u201d); <em>Huebner </em>v. <em>State, </em>103 Nev. 29, 30 n.l (1987) (\u201ca dagger is a short weapon used for thrusting and stabbing\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pruett, </em>37 Or. App. 183, 187 (1978) (Joseph, J., concurring) (\u201cDirks and daggers are designed and are useful almost exclusively for stabbing\u201d); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 280, 290 (Va. 2009) (\u201cA \u2018dagger\u2019 is \u2018a short knife used for stabbing\u2019 \u201d). In light of the long-standing definitions of the terms and of the purpose of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6), we recognize that, under that section, a dagger is any blade of relatively short length primarily designed or modified for stabbing. This definition excludes common household items such as a steak knife which are designed primarily for utilitarian purposes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>We determine sufficiency of the evidence under the familiar standard, \u201cwhether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nee, </em>458 Mass. 174, 180 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, there was not sufficient evidence that the weapon in question is a \u201cdirk knife\u201d under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As outlined <em>supra, </em>a \u201cdirk knife\u201d is, by definition, a weapon in which the blade folds into the handle. No evidence was presented to suggest that the blade of the weapon possessed by the defendant folded into its handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">However, sufficient evidence was presented to the jury to find that the weapon possessed by the defendant was a \u201cdagger\u201d under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997) (appellate court free to affirm ruling on grounds different from those relied on by motion judge). As noted <em>supra, </em>\u201cdagger\u201d is a general term that refers to a relatively short weapon primarily designed for stabbing. The weapon possessed by the defendant was described as a \u201cbig blade\u201d which with the handle measured \u201celeven inches.\u201d The blade was contained in what initially appeared to be a \u201cpipe or a bat\u201d that was \u201c[bjetween twelve and eighteen inches\u201d in length, but which the witness later realized was a \u201cpimp cane.\u201d That the blade could be held within a cane leads to a strong inference that it was a slim blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational trier of fact could find that the blade was a \u201cdagger\u201d under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). The efficacy of the weapon at stabbing was graphically and tragically demonstrated by the stab wounds sustained by the victim in this case. That the weapon was designed for stabbing is buttressed by the inference that it was a relatively slim weapon. The defendant has suggested no alternative innocuous usage for the weapon, nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>one apparent. A rational jury could easily conclude that the weapon possessed by the defendant was designed primarily for stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Nor is the blade too long to be considered a dagger. While the blade in question was referred to by the witness and the Commonwealth as a \u201csword,\u201d this does not preclude it from being considered a \u201cdagger\u201d under the statute. There is not a bright line dividing longer daggers and shorter swords. See 3 Oxford English Dictionary 7 (1978) (defining dagger as \u201c[a] short . . . weapon, like a small sword, used for thrusting and stabbing\u201d); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 364 (1973) (defining dagger as \u201ca short, swordlike weapon\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leatherman, </em>100 Wash. App. 318, 323 (2000) (pointing out one of dictionary definitions of \u201cdagger\u201d also \u201ca weapon resembling a short sword\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Our decision not to artificially create such a bright line is consistent with the legislative purpose, noted <em>supra, </em>of outlawing the possession of weapons primarily designed for stabbing human beings. The weapon in this case is not so long as to fall outside the realm of daggers. Thus, a rational jury could conclude that the weapon in question had all of the characteristics of a dagger.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">c. <em>Improper jury instruction. </em>The jury were improperly instructed on the elements of possession of a dangerous weapon where the weapon was not found on the defendant at the time of the arrest. The judge defined \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in this instruction by referring to an earlier instruction in the context of the elements of mayhem. That earlier instruction, properly in that context, stated that the jury had to find that an item is \u201cinherently dangerous because it can be readily used to cause death or great bodily harm\u201d for it to qualify as a dangerous weapon for the purposes of mayhem. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 614-615 (1948). The instruction was, however, not correct on the charge of possession of a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6), as it did not require the jury to determine whether the sword possessed by the defendant fell within one of the categories of weapons outlined in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Because there was no objection to the jury instruction below, we review to determine whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>446 Mass. 693, 696 (2006). Generally, there is not a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice where an improper jury instruction concerned an element that the defendant did not contest at trial because he pursued a defense of misidentification. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 107 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 292 (1999). Here, the defendant chose to pursue a defense based on mis-identification and did not contest that the weapon in question was a dangerous weapon prohibited by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). In these circumstances, given that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the \u201cpimp cane\u201d described by the witness was a dangerous weapon under the statute, there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of mayhem. </em>The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence of the severity of the victim\u2019s wounds for a rational jury to convict him of the crime of mayhem. The crime of mayhem may be satisfied by a showing under one of two theories. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ogden O., </em>448 Mass. 798, 800 (2007). The Commonwealth may prove the crime of mayhem under the second theory by showing that a person, \u201cwith intent to maim or disfigure, assaults another person with a dangerous weapon, substance or chemical, and by such assault disfigures, cripples or inflicts serious or permanent physical injury upon such person.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14. The victim in this case was described by an eyewitness as covered in blood with his intestines hanging out. In addition, he was in critical condition when he arrived at the Charlton Memorial Hospital, his wounds were described as \u201cUfe threatening,\u201d and the doctor inferred that he had severe internal bleeding. There is no doubt that, under the standard of <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 676-678, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that such wounds constituted \u201cserious . . . physical injury.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">3. <em>Effective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s telephone statements made while in pretrial detention. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and, if that is found, (2) that this ineffectiveness \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dodgson, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 307, 315 (2011), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In 2009, the Supreme Judicial Court held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odgren, </em>455 Mass. 171, 172 (2009) <em>(Odgren), </em>that the Commonwealth may not subpoena the production of records from a third party in advance of a trial or an evidentiary hearing under the authority granted by G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 68, without first obtaining judicial approval pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2), 378 Mass. 886 (1979), as construed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 268-271 (2004). See Mass.G.Evid. \u00a7 1108 (2012). It is uncontested that the Commonwealth violated the rule in <em>Odgren </em>by not seeking judicial approval under Mass. R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2) for issuing a subpoena, in advance of trial, for the recordings of the defendant\u2019s telephone calls made during his pretrial detention.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, the defendant\u2019s trial ended in October of 2006, three years prior to the <em>Odgren </em>decision. The practice overruled by <em>Odgren </em>was apparently commonly used before it was found to be unlawful. See <em>Odgren, </em>455 Mass. at 173 n.5 (correction facility\u2019s telephone system administrator had received \u201cthousands\u201d of such subpoenas from various district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>attorney\u2019s offices over ten-year period).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, it is doubtful that the defense attorney\u2019s failure to move for suppression of the materials in this case was conduct falling \u201cmeasurably below\u201d that expected from an ordinary, fallible lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Even were that the case, the defendant has not shown a likelihood that such a motion would have succeeded. While <em>Odgren </em>did not preclude the possibility of suppression for an improperly issued subpoena, it found two reasons that suppression was not warranted in that case, both of which are applicable here. See <em>id. </em>at 187-188. Just as in <em>Odgren, </em>the defendant here has not shown a violation of a constitutional right that would warrant suppression. See <em>id. </em>at 188. In addition, the defendant here was provided copies of the subpoenaed recordings well before trial, much like in <em>Odgren, </em>and thus cannot show prejudice in his ability to prepare for trial that would warrant suppression. See <em>ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant was thus not likely deprived of a substantial ground of defense by any misstep his lawyer may have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">4. <em>Missing witness instruction. </em>The defendant alleges that the judge\u2019s decision not to give a missing witness instruction due to the victim\u2019s failure to testify was manifestly unreasonable. \u201cThe decision whether to provide a missing witness instruction to the jury is within the discretion of the trial judge, and will not be reversed unless the decision was manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saletino, </em>449 Mass. 657, 667 (2007).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For a missing witness instruction to be appropriate, a party who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>has failed to call a witness must \u201cha[ye] knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667-668, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 280 n.1 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>413 Mass. 193, 199 (1992). See Mass.G.Evid. \u00a7 1111 (2012). The prosecutor indicated that the Commonwealth had made \u201cevery effort\u201d to locate the victim but was unable to do so. The defendant has not shown the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of this claim to be manifestly unreasonable. The judge thus properly determined that the victim could not be located and that a missing witness instruction would have been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>There was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that the weapon possessed by the defendant fell within the definition of a \u201cdagger\u201d under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A). While the jury instructions regarding what constitutes a dangerous weapon for the crime of possession of a dangerous weapon where the weapon was not found on the defendant\u2019s person at the time of arrest were clearly erroneous, we find no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice given the defendant\u2019s failure to contest the issue. None of the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions has merit. The defendant\u2019s convictions and the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The defendant also makes a due process argument regarding the introduction of these statements, but tacitly admits that this argument is precluded by <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>454 Mass. 685, 688-690 (2009).

L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6), can form the basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction, the argument fails. Unlike the present case, the defendant in <em>Molligi </em>was carrying the relevant weapon at the time he was arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 109. As a result, as discussed <em>supra, </em>under the terms of the statute, the Commonwealth could satisfy its burden of proof without tying the weapon to one specifically listed in G.
