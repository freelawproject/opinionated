The defendant was charged with one count of aggravated rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(a), </em>and two counts of assault by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(&amp;). A jury convicted him of rape as a lesser-included offense of aggravated rape, and one count of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. On appeal, he challenges the admission of three types of evidence: (1) expert testimony on domestic violence, (2) multiple first complaint testimony, and (3) evidence of bad character and prior bad acts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence admitted at trial relevant to the issues before us. Alice met the defendant in April, 2006, during her freshman year of high school, when she was fifteen and he was seventeen. They began dating in My, 2006, and the relationship became sexual. Although dating stopped around May, 2007, they continued to engage in a sexual relationship over the next few months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alice testified in detail about their relationship and the defendant\u2019s behavior, including the two incidents that underlie the charges in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">1. <em>The first incident. </em>In June, 2007, the parties were no longer dating but regularly engaged in sexual relations when Alice\u2019s parents were out of the house. Alice testified that one morning the defendant called and asked to come over and was angry when she refused to see him. While she was brushing her teeth, she heard the garage door open. She stepped out of the bathroom and saw the defendant standing in the hallway pointing a gun at her. She fled to her parents\u2019 bedroom, with the defendant following, and begged him not to kill her, to which he replied, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I? Why shouldn\u2019t I kill you now?\u201d When Alice\u2019s dog entered the room, the defendant pointed the gun at the dog, and she asked him not to hurt the dog. Thereafter, the defendant calmed down and they had consensual sex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This incident gave rise to the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon on which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>2. <em>The second incident. </em>Between late June and mid-July, 2007, the defendant again came over to Alice\u2019s house without her permission. She testified that after spending the night on the living room couch, she awoke to find the defendant standing nearby. She asked how he had gotten into the house, and he stated, \u201cI have my ways.\u201d At some point, they moved to her bedroom. The defendant had a gun with him, which he placed on the bedside table. He then suggested that they have anal sex. She testified that she refused, but he forced her. Specifically, the defendant picked up the gun from the bedside table. He did not point it at her but picked it up \u201cso that [she] would recognize the fact that it was there.\u201d He \u201ckind of held [her] down a little bit . . . us[ing] his weight to kind of keep [her] in place so [she] wouldn\u2019t move.\u201d When the defendant stopped to get lubrication, she told him, \u201cYou know this is rape, right? What did your father teach you? I have rights, you know,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cBitch, you don\u2019t have any rights. Get back down there,\u201d and continued the act. This event gave rise to the charge of aggravated rape and the conviction of the lesser-included offense of rape. After the incident, Alice continued to see the defendant because she thought she \u201ccould be a good force in his life,\u201d \u201cdid love him still,\u201d and was \u201ca little bit intimidated by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">3. <em>Ensuing events. </em>Alice also testified to subsequent bad acts by the defendant, but she continued to see him until at least August, 2007. Then, in October, 2007, she started dating a new person. The next month, the defendant visited her at the supermarket where she worked, asked if she was dating anyone, and called her early the next morning, at 1:00 a.m. She replied by text message, and he responded, also via text message, that he wanted to \u201c|j]ust talk cuz I miss you.\u201d Then, on November 14, 2007, the defendant sent her a text message reading, \u201cU f\u2014 him yet?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Alice contacted the police around the date of the final text message. As part of the investigation, Deputy Chief Jeffrey Gillen of the Groveland police department spoke with both Alice and Salem Lahlali, an acquaintance to whom she had complained of the defendant\u2019s actions. All three testified as prosecution witnesses. The Commonwealth also called Amesbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>police Detective Robert Wile as an expert on the general characteristics of domestic violence and the behavioral characteristics of victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The defendant first challenges the admission of Detective Wile\u2019s testimony on domestic violence. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 640 (1997) (Goetzendanner), this court explained that, \u201c[t]o the average juror, untutored in the psychological dynamics of domestic violence, the victim\u2019s vacillating behavior toward the defendant \u2014\u2022 in particular, her back and forth attempts to end the relationship \u2014 might have seemed counterintuitive and might even have suggested that her version of events was inherently unreliable and unworthy of belief.\u201d As in <em>Goetzendanner, </em>the Commonwealth here offered expert testimony by Detective Wile on the behavioral characteristics of victims in order to help the jury evaluate Alice\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Detective Wile heads the domestic violence unit for the Ames-bury police department. At the time of his testimony, he had been a police officer for over twenty-one years and had worked solely on domestic violence cases since 1999. Based on his experience and training, he testified about the different types of domestic violence, including verbal, emotional, psychological, and physical abuse. He described the three-phase \u201ccycle of violence,\u201d which includes a period of \u201ctension building,\u201d a \u201cbattering incident,\u201d and, finally, a \u201choneymoon phase.\u201d He also testified about \u201cminimization\u201d of abuse, recantation, and the reasons why victims may remain in abusive relationships.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Last, he testified about the unique aspects of teenage victims. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">a. <em>Expert qualifications. </em>As a threshold matter, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge erred in qualifying Detective Wile to offer expert testimony. \u201cThe decision to qualify a witness as an expert on a particular matter that is within that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>witness\u2019s field of expertise will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion or error of law.\u201d <em>Goetzendanner, supra </em>at 642. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702 (2012). \u201cThe crucial issue is whether the witness has sufficient education, training, experience, and familiarity with the subject matter of [his] testimony.\u201d <em>Goetzendanner, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Letch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>401 Mass. 65, 68 (1987). The judge reviewed Detective Wile\u2019s qualifications during a voir dire examination. Wile was experienced in working with at least 480 victims in the prior year alone, had attended several trainings on domestic violence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and had conducted extensive training of other officers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was ample evidence to support his qualifications based on his \u201cextensive training, education, and experience in investigating allegations of sexual assault, ... in particular, in interviewing . . . victims of such assault.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 183 (1996). See <em>id. </em>at 183 n.4 (police sergeant in sexual assault unit qualified to testify about child sexual assault); <em>Goetzen-danner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 642 (expert qualified based on \u201cextensive experience in training and educating other professionals on BWS [battered woman\u2019s syndrome]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">b. <em>Subject matter. </em>The defendant next argues that domestic violence is not a proper subject of expert testimony because the testimony is neither helpful to the jury nor reliable. \u201cA trial judge has broad discretion with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 421 (1990). In his role as gatekeeper, a judge must determine that expert testimony is both \u201cbeyond the common knowledge of jurors\u201d and \u201creliable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Polk, </em>462 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>23, 31 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 783 (2010), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. at 421-422. Here, after careful consideration, the judge found that Wile\u2019s testimony would be \u201cbeyond [the ken] of at least some average juror.\u201d He explained that although significant information about domestic violence has become available to the public in recent years, \u201cnot everybody\u201d pursues such knowledge on their own. See <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 640 (average juror may not understand vacillating behavior of domestic violence victims). The judge further concluded that <em>Goetzendanner </em>governed the testimony\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We agree that <em>Goetzendanner </em>controls. <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 640-641, held that testimony \u201cabout domestic violence generally and about BWS specifically\u201d was admissible to help jurors understand the potentially counterintuitive behavior of victims when assessing a victim\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 627-630 (1989) (expert testimony on \u201cgeneral behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children\u201d admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. at 421-422 (rape trauma syndrome); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 724 (1991) (battered child syndrome). Other courts have concluded, in line with <em>Goetzendanner, </em>that expert testimony on domestic violence that does not specifically address battered woman\u2019s syndrome is admissible. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>33 Cal. 4th 892, 895, 906-908 (2004) (expert testimony on \u201cthe behavior of victims of domestic violence\u201d covered the \u201ccycle of violence\u201d and counterintuitive characteristics of victim reporting); <em>Odom </em>v. <em>State, </em>711 N.E.2d 71 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (upholding admission of expert testimony on domestic violence that did not specifically address battered woman\u2019s syndrome). As the judge discussed, there is significant literature on the effect of domestic violence on victims\u2019 behavior. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>33 Cal. 4th at 898-900, and authorities cited. There is also behavioral science support for the value of expert testimony on domestic violence that does not fall neatly into the category of battered woman\u2019s syndrome as it is currently defined. See <em>id. </em>at 900, 903, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>13 Cal. 4th 1073, 1083 n.3 (1996) (\u201cpreferred term among many experts today is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u2018expert testimony on battering and its effects\u2019 or \u2018expert testimony on battered women\u2019s experience\u2019 \u201d), Bowman, A Matter of Justice: Overcoming Juror Bias in Prosecutions of Batterers Through Expert Witness Testimony of the Common Experiences of Battered Women, 2 So. Cal. Rev. L. &amp; Women\u2019s Stud. 219, 226 n.31 (1992), and Dutton, Understanding Women\u2019s Responses to Domestic Violence: A Redefinition of Battered Woman Syndrome, 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1191, 1200-1201 (1993). The judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that domestic violence was a proper subject for expert testimony under <em>Goetzendanner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">c. <em>Impermissible vouching and abuser profiling. </em>We also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that Detective Wile impermis-sibly vouched for Alice\u2019s credibility. While an expert may describe the general behavioral characteristics shared by victims of abuse, \u201c[djeference must be preserved for the role of the jury as the final judge of credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Federico, 425 Mass. 844, 848 (1997). Expert testimony must be \u201cconfined to a description of the general or expected characteristics shared by typical victims,\u201d Goetzendanner, 42 Mass. App. Ct. at 644, and \u201cmay not relate directly to the symptoms exhibited by an individual victim . . . , nor may it include an opinion or diagnosis that that person suffers from the described condition.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIf that link is avoided, and the testimony does not focus on the specific [victim], the testimony is usually allowed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Deloney, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 55 (2003). The defendant does not allege that Wile explicitly linked his opinion to the actual victim but, rather, that he implicitly invited the jury to make that comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">As the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deloney </em>explained, \u201ceven absent explicit linking of the [expert] opinion to the [victim], the jury may impermissibly be invited to find an identity between the hypothetical subjects of the expert testimony and the specific [victim] . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, the defendant challenges three aspects of Wile\u2019s testimony as implicit vouching: (1) a description of the \u201ccycle of violence,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) testimony that vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>tims often have feelings of \u201cworthless[ness]\u201d and \u201clow self-esteem,\u201d and return to abusive relationships because, among other reasons, they \u201csay they\u2019re in love,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) the particularization of his testimony to teenage victims. The defendant argues that these statements were consistent with those of the actual teenage victim in this case, implicitly linking the opinion to Alice. Alice testified about acts of abuse followed by periods of calm in the relationship, feelings of low self-worth and low self-esteem, and remaining in the abusive relationship because she loved the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">This court has acknowledged the \u201capparent oddity that . . . the more numerous the similarities between the individual . . . victim and a \u2018standard\u2019 . . . victim created by an expert witness, the more likely it is that the expert testimony will be excluded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deloney, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 56. However, the mere fact that an expert\u2019s testimony is consistent with that of the victim does not, alone, render it impermissible vouching. To the contrary, it demonstrates the relevance of the expert opinion as an aid to the jury in understanding a victim\u2019s counterintuitive actions. See <em>ibid, </em>(\u201cexpert testimony that explains to the jury that child abuse victims may behave in ways that to lay persons may seem illogical\u201d is permissible so long as it does not \u201csuggest[] that child victims in a particular case have acted typically when compared to a \u2018norm\u2019 of child victims\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 289, 291 (2000) (\u201cexpert testimony on the . . . general behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children is admissible and does not, of itself, constitute an opinion on the credibility of the complaining witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Detective Wile\u2019s testimony was appropriately generalized. <em>Goetzendanner </em>specifically upheld the allowance of expert testimony about the \u201ccycle\u201d of domestic violence and the underlying emotional state of victims. See 42 Mass. App. Ct. at 641 (expert \u201cexplained the cyclical nature of abusive relationships\u201d and that \u201cwomen victims of battering often experience a strong desire to understand why the abuse occurred\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. at 628 (expert testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that \u201csexually abused children exhibit impaired trust, withdrawal, depression, guilt, shame, anxiety, and hypervigilance\u201d); <em>People </em>v. Brown, 33 Cal. 4th at 897, 907 (expert testimony covered the \u201ccycle of violence\u201d and counterintuitive reporting behaviors of victims who \u201cmay still love the defendant and hope that things will get better\u201d); <em>Odom </em>v. <em>State, </em>711 N.E.2d at 74 (domestic violence victims may recant allegations based on, among other reasons, \u201cemotional attachment to the perpetrator\u201d and \u201ca desire to mollify the defendant\u2019s anger\u201d). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 221 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 66 (1987) (abuse can cause \u201ca decrease in self-esteem, an emotional dependence upon the dominant male and [a] type of psychological \u2018learned\u2019 helplessness\u201d). While the particularization of Detective Wile\u2019s testimony to teenage victims may have brought his statements closer to the actual victim in this case, his testimony did not cross over the line into impermissible vouching. He stated only that teenagers look at controlling behaviors \u201cas affection\u201d showing \u201cthe person really loves them.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the teenage victim in this case did not testify that she saw the defendant\u2019s abusive behavior as affection. Wile\u2019s testimony falls far short of the \u201cvivid portrait\u201d of the actual victim drawn by the expert opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deloney, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 58. See <em>id. </em>at 57-59 (impermissible vouching where expert offered eight examples that closely matched actual victim, including testimony that child victims often have cognitive limitations or learning disabilities, are told to keep the abuse secret, and receive positive rewards from the abuser). Additionally, Detective Wile had not interviewed Alice, nor did he respond to hypothetical presenting the facts of the case. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. at 186; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 148-149 (1994). We conclude that he provided \u201cpermissible expert testimony that suggest[ed] to the jury that certain behavior on the part of the victim . . . does not necessarily exculpate the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deloney, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Nor did the expert opinion impermissibly profile perpetrators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of abuse. The defendant argues that Wile\u2019s testimony about types of abuse echoed Alice\u2019s recitation of the events so closely that, in effect, it created a profile of a typical abuser. An expert must not \u201cprofile or describe the typical attributes of the perpetrators of crimes.\u201d <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 644. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass. at 850. However, the defendant has not pointed to any statement describing an abuser as opposed to describing typical acts of abuse. Impermissible abuser profile testimony includes, for example, statements that abusers often date single mothers and abuse their children while the mothers are at work, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass, at 724, or that \u201ca batterer acts out of a \u2018belief in his right to control his partner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 641 n.5. See <em>id. </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">By contrast, the defendant challenges Wile\u2019s statements that (1) psychological abuse includes \u201cthrowing things, not directly at [the victim], but in the general area where they are,\u201d and \u201cthreaten[ing] to hurt themselves,\u201d and (2) verbal abuse includes \u201cbelittling\u201d and \u201cname-calling.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reiterate that the fact that some of a victim\u2019s testimony closely aligns with an expert\u2019s description of abuse shows the utility of the expert opinion; it does not necessarily transform the opinion into an abuser profile. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 671 (1998) (permissible for police officer qualified as an expert to offer an \u201cexplanation of the modus operandi employed in transacting drug sales\u201d but not a \u201cdescription of a characteristic of drug buyers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Finally, the judge gave an appropriate, timely jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>on the use of expert testimony. Detective Wile was the final witness, and on the same day, following a recess and closing arguments, the judge charged the jury on how to assess expert testimony, as set out in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cSuch limiting instructions safeguarded the jury\u2019s proper use of [the] expert testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. at 629. We perceive no error in the allowance of Detective Wile\u2019s expert opinion regarding either the victim or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">2. <em>First complaint testimony. </em>The defendant next argues that the judge erroneously allowed \u201cpiling on\u201d of first complaint testimony. He challenges testimony by Alice, by Salem Lahlali, and by Deputy Chief Gillen as violating the first complaint doctrine. The doctrine limits testimony about a victim\u2019s complaints of sexual assault to a single witness, generally the first person told. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 243 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) (first complaint is most pertinent to jury\u2019s assessment of victim\u2019s motivation for coming forward and credibility); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 844-845 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>The defendant did not object to any of the complaint testimony at trial, and we therefore review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 846. \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice exists when we \u2018have a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error not been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 174 (1999). \u201cIn analyzing a claim under the substantial risk standard, we review the evidence and case as a whole and ask four questions: \u2018(1) Was there error? ... (2) Was the defendant prejudiced by the error? ... (3) Considering the error in the context of the entire trial, would it be reasonable to conclude that the error materially influenced the verdict? . . . [and] (4) May we infer from the record that counsel\u2019s failure to object or raise a claim of error at an earlier date was not a reasonable tactical decision?\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 298 (2002). We grant relief under this standard only if all four questions are answered in the affirmative. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 297-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">b. <em>Complaint witnesses. </em>At trial, Alice testified about two separate instances of abuse underlying the charges on which the defendant was convicted \u2014 an initial incident when the defendant threatened her and her dog with a gun (for which the defendant was convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon), and a second incident when he anally raped her (for which the defendant was charged with aggravated rape, and was convicted of the lesser-included offense of rape). The Commonwealth called Salem Lahlali, an acquaintance of Alice\u2019s, as the designated first complaint witness. Lahlali testified about a single telephone conversation with Alice in late July. He recounted that she called him crying and told him that the defendant \u201chad a gun up to her and raped her,\u201d and \u201cgun . . . slapped her dog.\u201d The defendant argues that Lahlali\u2019s testimony echoed Alice\u2019s description of the first incident and thus does not implicate a sexual assault at all, taking it out of the first complaint rubric and rendering the testimony inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">A full reading of Lahlali\u2019s testimony shows, however, that he was not explicit about whether his understanding was that the acts he described, as recounted to him by Alice in their July conversation, were all part of a single incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that his testimony differed from that of Alice, it was for the defense to exploit any inconsistencies. Defense counsel did so vigorously in his closing, arguing that the discrepancies between Alice\u2019s and Lahlali\u2019s testimony showed either that Alice had lied to Lahlali (due to a romantic interest) or that Lahlali was now lying on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Turning to Alice\u2019s testimony, the defendant contends that she impermissibly testified about multiple complaints to Lahlali, as well as complaints to the police. First complaint testimony is limited to the initial complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 222-223 (2009) (\u201cwhere a complainant makes successive complaints to the first complaint witness, the initial complaint is the only evidence admissible as first complaint\u201d). During her direct examination, Alice testified, \u201cI did definitely tell him about the first incident, and then I do believe I told him \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was the same exact time that I saw him, but I do remember I ended up telling him about the times that [the defendant] forced me to have anal sex with him.\u201d It was only on cross-examination that she clearly said she discussed with Lahlali the defendant\u2019s actions \u201c[a]t least twice,\u201d and \u201cdefinitely more than once.\u201d To the extent that repetition of the complaint to Lahlali bolstered her credibility, any error was compounded by the defendant. More importantly, \u201cwe must consider whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the testimony could have been a tactical decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. at 852. Defense counsel emphasized Alice\u2019s multiple complaints when cross-examining her and relied on inconsistencies between her and Lahlali\u2019s complaint testimony in his closing argument.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s conviction of only the lesser-included offense of rape and one count of assault by means of a dangerous weapon supports a conclusion that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>testimony of the witness[] inured to the defendant\u2019s benefit, [and] it is reasonable to infer that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object was a tactical decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The defendant also argues error in the admission of Alice\u2019s statement that she complained to the police. However, the prosecutor elicited this testimony at the request of the defense. Earlier in the trial, the Commonwealth had addressed a desire to show when the police investigation began. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. at 226-227 (even where a police officer is not the first complaint witness, testimony concerning the circumstances giving rise to the police involvement in a sexual assault case may be admissible as part of the prosecution\u2019s casein-chief). In order to avoid an inference by the jury that the police independently began investigating the defendant for other conduct, defense counsel requested that the police involvement be introduced through evidence that Alice complained to them. Counsel expressed his preference that Alice testify that she went to the police in November, and indicated that he had no objection to that testimony. Again, the defense made a reasonable strategic choice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. at 852-853. Consequently, Deputy Chief Gillen\u2019s statement that he interviewed Alice during his investigation was cumulative and nonprejudicial. The multiple first complaint testimony did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">3. <em>Bad character and prior bad act evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth introduced a litany of bad character and bad act evidence with the sole purpose of portraying the defendant negatively. For example, the defendant points to testimony that he called Alice vulgar names and threatened her. \u201cThe prosecution, of course, may not introduce evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct to demonstrate bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>444 Mass. 678, 681-682 (2005). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404 (2012). However, \u201c [ejvidence of relevant prior misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>may be admissible for other purposes, . . . such as to show intent or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, supra </em>at 682 (allowing evidence of defendant\u2019s emotional abuse of victim over years leading up to her murder). In the context of sexual assault, \u201cevidence of uncharged conduct may be admissible to give the jury a view of the entire relationship between the defendant and the alleged victim, and \u2018the probative existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 128-129 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 794 (1994). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981) (at murder trial, \u201c[i]t was well for the jury to have a view of the entire relationship between the defendant and . . . the alleged victims\u201d). \u201cThese determinations are left to the sound discretion of the judge, . . . whose decision to admit such evidence will be upheld absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>443 Mass. 782, 790 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As the acts complained of consist almost entirely of acts showing the defendant\u2019s poor treatment of Alice, we need make only a few remarks.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, while the defendant argues that evidence that he had sex with Alice when he was seventeen and she was fifteen shows the \u201cbad act\u201d of statutory rape, the Commonwealth never mentioned statutory rape. Nor did the prosecution focus on the defendant\u2019s age beyond a cursory mention by Alice of their ages upon meeting and entering into a relationship, which the judge could consider relevant to the dynamics of the relationship. Second, the defendant\u2019s status as a high school dropout is the only act that arguably did not provide the jury a view of the parties\u2019 \u201centire relationship\u201d and the defendant\u2019s passions or emotions during the rape and assault. Thus, with this one exception, \u201c[t]he challenged testimony, if credible, established] the defendant\u2019s pattern of disrespect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>hostility toward the victim that continued until the day he [raped] her.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>444 Mass. at 682. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 433 (2002). The evidence of these acts did not overwhelm the evidence of incidents underlying the charges. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. at 128-129 (detailed testimony of seven uncharged incidents of sexual assault overwhelmingly prejudicial).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly encouraged the jury to convict the defendant based on these bad acts. As he failed to object to both the bad act evidence<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). The Commonwealth may refer in its closing to bad act evidence that was properly admitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delong, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 122, 133 (2003). Here, the only improperly admitted evidence was that of the defendant\u2019s status as a high school dropout. We cannot conclude, in view of all of the evidence before the jury, that the Commonwealth\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s high school status on direct examination and in its closing created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Tliey had completely ceased relations by mid-November, 2007, when Alice contacted the police complaining of misconduct by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Alice testified that she still cared for the defendant at this time and continued to see him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">See generally <em>Goetzendanner, </em>42 Mass.
