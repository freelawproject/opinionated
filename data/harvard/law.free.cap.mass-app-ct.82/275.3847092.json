L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7. The c. 209A order ordered the defendant \u201cnot to abuse the [p]laintiff [the victim in this case] by harming, threatening or attempting to harm the [pjlaintiff physically or by placing the [pjlaintiff in fear of imminent serious physical harm\u201d and \u201cnot to contact the [p]laintiff.\u201d Taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the testimony at trial showed that after the victim picked up her children from a visit with the defendant, the defendant threatened her in the presence of her mother, Carol; the victim\u2019s boyfriend, Carlos; and her mother\u2019s boyfriend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Roberto. The victim testified that after she walked away from the defendant, he got into his car, made a U-tum and pulled up next to the victim, rolled down the window, pointed, yelled at her, \u201cWatch your back, because you\u2019re dead,\u201d and sped off. The victim\u2019s mother testified to the same, and that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the defendant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The defendant raises three issues. He argues first that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on the theory that he violated the \u201cno abuse\u201d provision of the restraining order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). He acknowledges, however, that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction on the theory that he violated the \u201cno contact\u201d provision of th\u00e9 restraining order. We conclude that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s statement to the victim was sufficient to support his conviction of violation of the c. 209A order on the theory that he placed her \u201cin fear of imminent serious physical harm.\u201d See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1990, c. 403, \u00a7 2 (definition of \u201c[a]buse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">This conclusion also disposes of the defendant\u2019s second argument, that, because there was insufficient evidence with respect to one theory of liability, the general unanimity instruction was inadequate. The defendant argues that in the absence of evidence to convict him under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, on the theory of \u201cabuse,\u201d a specific unanimity instruction indicating unanimity on the \u201cno contact\u201d theory of guilt was required. As no such instruction was requested,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the defendant acknowledges, we would in any event review this claim only to determine whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 594 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Our determination that there was in fact sufficient evidence with respect to each theory of guilt eliminates the premise of the defendant\u2019s argument, and his argument is therefore without merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Federico, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 711, 719-720 (2007). The defendant does not argue that if there is sufficient evidence on each theory, failure to give a specific unanimity instruction creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Finally, the defendant argues that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness jury instruction with respect to the victim\u2019s boyfriend. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Spencer, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 52 (2001). Given the presence at trial of two other witnesses to the events in question, the judge\u2019s determination not to give a missing witness instruction on the basis that the victim\u2019s boyfriend was not called was not an abuse of discretion or otherwise erroneous. See Mass.G.Evid. \u00a7 1111(b)(3) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Nor is it clear that one is required in the absence of a request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
