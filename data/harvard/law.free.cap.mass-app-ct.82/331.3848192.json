We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\"><em>Background. </em>Freedman owned real estate located at 3162 Washington Street in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. Freedman leased the premises to Mirtha Encamaci\u00f3n and her husband, who owned and operated an automobile repair facility on the site known as Anthony\u2019s Auto Body Repair, Inc. Beginning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>May, 2003, Encamaci\u00f3n began to have trouble paying her rent and from time to time made partial payments. Freedman issued several notices to quit for nonpayment of rent, but did not follow through with eviction. There followed numerous events whereby Freedman harassed Encamaci\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On or about September 11, 2003, Encarnaci\u00f3n received numerous threatening and harassing telephone calls from Freedman, who threatened to have his wife come to the premises and beat her up. On December 26, 2003, Freedman called Encamaci\u00f3n at her home twenty-three times between 9:00 p.m. until approximately midnight. During these calls, Freedman would call Encamaci\u00f3n \u201cstupid\u201d and yell, \u201cFuck you. Where is my money? I want my money.\u201d Freedman further informed her that he was having the premises watched and that she should be careful. On January 9, 2004, Freedman went to the premises and started yelling at Encamaci\u00f3n in front of two customers. He demanded his money, and stated, \u201cStupid fucking Spanish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">As a result of Freedman\u2019s actions, Encamaci\u00f3n feared for her safety and began to suffer from increasingly severe anxiety attacks. She sought medical treatment (multiple visits to the emergency room at Faulkner Hospital) and was placed on various medications for stress and anxiety, and eventually she was referred to a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Following the January 9 incident, Encamaci\u00f3n filed a complaint against Freedman in the Superior Court, seeking a restraining order. In March, 2005, she amended her complaint, alleging both negligent and tortious intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as interference with business relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Freedman had been issued a commercial liability insurance policy (policy) from January 31, 2003, to January 20, 2004, by USE. Although USE initially agreed to defend Freedman against Encamaci\u00f3n\u2019s complaint, it reserved its rights and subsequently declined to provide a defense, asserting that there was no coverage under the policy because Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s injuries did not arise from an \u201coccurrence\u201d and that her injuries did not constitute \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Ultimately, Encarnaci\u00f3n prevailed on her complaint and was awarded $6,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">On March 20, 2009, Freedman commenced the present action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>against USL for breach of contract and violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge denied Freedman\u2019s motion and allowed USL\u2019s motion, concluding that Encamaci\u00f3n sought recovery solely for emotional distress, that her claims did not arise from \u201cbodily injury\u201d as that term is used in the policy, and that the policy thus did not provide coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the judge rejected Freedman\u2019s alternative theory that the policy provides \u201ccoverage for violation of Encamaci\u00f3n\u2019s right of private occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Freedman has appealed, arguing that the judge, in granting summary judgment, improperly looked to the form of Encama-ci\u00f3n\u2019s cause of action rather than the substance of her claims. He presses his argument based on the policy\u2019s coverage for \u201cPersonal and Advertising Injury,\u201d claiming that Encamaci\u00f3n\u2019s complaint roughly sketched (see <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>458 Mass. 194, 200 [2010]; <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>460 Mass. 352, 357 [2011]) a claim for \u201cinvasion of the right of private occupancy of premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We determine an insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured under a policy by looking to the complaint\u2019s allegations and any other facts known by the insurer. <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>393 Mass. 37, 40 (1984). \u201cThe process is not one of looking at the legal theory enunciated by the pleader but of \u2018envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7,12-13 (1989), quoting from <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). If the allegations in the complaint and other extrinsic facts are \u201creasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,\u201d the duty to defend arises. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146 (1984) (quotation omitted). See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Cas. Co., supra </em>at 319 (underlying complaint, even with general allegations, need only demonstrate a possibility that the liability claim falls within the insurance coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Upon review of the briefs and record appendix, we conclude that the entry of summary judgment in favor of the insurer was appropriate. It should no longer need to be said that at the appellate level, the court examines a grant of summary judgment de nova, viewing the evidence contained in the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The plaintiff contends that his incessant calls to Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s home, threats to do bodily harm, and yelling at Encamaci\u00f3n at the automobile body shop should be read as constituting more than emotional distress, i.e., encompassing personal and advertising injury. However, the language within the Encamaci\u00f3n complaint is clear. All three counts alleged \u2014 and indeed, the underlying facts suggest \u2014 that the plaintiff engaged in behavior that was specifically excluded in the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">To the extent Freedman claims the policy explicitly covers \u201cbodily injury\u201d arising out of \u201cthe wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord, or lessor,\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n never made any such claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She did not complain of Freedman\u2019s appearance on the premises as landlord nor did she deny his right to be there. Rather, she based her claims for emotional distress and interference with contractual relations on Freedman\u2019s harassing and threatening behavior while there. Accordingly, the motion judge could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>conclude, as she did, that the underlying suit was not an invasion of the right of private occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Finally, Freedman points out that the policy provides coverage for \u201coral or written publication of material that disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services.\u201d He goes on to argue that because Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s complaint implicates coverage for \u201cdisparagement or defamation,\u201d his statements were defamatory, pointing specifically to his use of offensive racial slurs. The short answer to this contention is that it was not raised below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> New theories of liability raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived. <em>Martins </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Sch., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 634 n.17 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Freedman does not contest on appeal that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment as to his c. 93A claim, but rather confines the appeal to the claim for breach of contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Freedman does not challenge this ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Exclusion a(l) of the policy states that coverage will not apply to actions \u201ccaused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict \u2018personal and advertising injury.\u2019 \u201d Cf. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cleary Consultants, Inc., </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 52-54 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">We agree with the judge\u2019s reasoning that \u201cEncarnaci\u00f3n did not base her claims against Freedman on violation of her right of private occupancy, or the concomitant covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d We also note that Freedman does not directly address the issue of bodily injury in his appeal. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>First Financial Ins. Co., </em>448 Mass. 1, 5 n.6 (2006); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 702, 703 (1999). See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>414 Mass. 129, 138 n.9 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Even though our review is de nova, we note the motion judge\u2019s failure even to mention it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
