L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and resisting arrest in violation of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>c. 268, \u00a7 32B. The following year, the defendant moved for a new trial seeking to vacate his guilty pleas. The same judge who had accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas denied the motion. On appeal, the defendant claims that it was an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion to deny the motion because there did not exist a sufficient factual basis from which the judge could have concluded that the guilty plea to the resisting arrest charge was intelligent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>As revealed in the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the evidence at the plea hearing, which was supplemented by the police report offered by the defendant at the hearing on the motion for new trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the following emerges. The police were dispatched to a possible domestic dispute that had occurred at the defendant\u2019s residence. While the police conducted their investigation, the defendant arrived at the scene and began yelling and screaming, \u201cWhat the fuck is going on,\u201d and \u201cThis is my fucking house.\u201d The police officers asked the defendant to calm down and they brought him outside, where a crowd of neighbors had gathered. The officers then returned inside to resume their investigation. The defendant made numerous attempts to gain access to the home, which interfered with that investigation, and he was told to wait outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">When the defendant gained access a final time, the officers escorted him outside, called for backup, and told the defendant that if he did not cease his actions, he would be arrested. The defendant then began yelling, \u201cFuck that bullshit, you better not touch me motherfuckers, I don\u2019t like the fucking police.\u201d The defendant did not calm down and continued to disturb the area, and when the officers \u201cwent to place him under arrest. . . , he resisted their arrest.\u201d In an earlier portion of the prosecutor\u2019s recitation, he stated that when the officers asked the defendant to calm down, the defendant \u201ccontinued to mouth off to the police and then he resisted a little bit when they went to arrest him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cA plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 569 (1989). \u201cGiven the solemnity of the event and its consequences, a variety of procedural protections govern the guilty plea process.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 616, 619 (2009). There are two constitutional requirements that are necessary to assure a counselled plea is valid: the decision to plead guilty must be both voluntary and intelligent. <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Tollett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267 (1972), and <em>Bousley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 618 (1998). The defendant claims that his motion for new trial should have been allowed on the ground that his plea was not intelligent because it was not supported with a sufficient factual basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The basic permissible record indicators of an intelligent admission of guilt are \u201c(1) an explanation by the judge of the elements of the crime; or (2) a representation that counsel has explained to the defendant the elements he admits by his plea; or (3) defendant\u2019s statements admitting facts constituting the unexplained elements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>451 Mass. 332, 335 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantoni, </em>396 Mass. 672, 679 (1986). See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 646 (1976); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 23.65 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">a. <em>Counsel explained the elements. </em>If there was an insufficient factual basis in the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the facts that purported to constitute the crime of resisting arrest, the analysis does not stop there. What the defendant and the dissent fail to consider is that a sufficient recitation of the facts admitted by the defendant is but one of three independent methods of demonstrating that a plea is intelligent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 107 (2009) (intelligence of guilty plea may be established by any one of three methods).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>In the course of the judge\u2019s colloquy with the defendant, the judge asked the defendant if he had discussed the charges with his attorney, and the defendant agreed that he had. The judge then confirmed with the defendant\u2019s attorney that he had in fact discussed the nature and elements of the offenses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> what the Commonwealth was obliged to prove, and any defenses that were available to the defendant. When asked, the defendant stated that he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice, and that his attorney had acted in the defendant\u2019s best interest. Finally, as the plea judge specifically acknowledged at the hearing on the motion for new trial, the defendant signed a waiver of rights form, known as the \u201cgreen sheet,\u201d which, among other things, confirms the representation that he was aware of the elements of the crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, supra </em>at 109 (\u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s signed waiver may properly be considered as part of the plea record to support a finding that the plea was made intelligently\u201d). These representations and acknowledgments justified the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In support of its conclusion that reversal of a conviction stemming from a guilty plea is required when the recited facts do not support the elements of the crime, the dissent relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. 288, 296-297 (1986), but that reliance is misplaced. <em>DelVerde </em>did not reshuffle the due process deck relative to guilty plea requirements. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>what the court held in that case was that the doctrine of substituted judgment would not be extended to permit a guardian to accept a plea bargain on behalf of an incompetent defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 296-298. The court reasoned that the procedure was not available because no matter what the factual basis was for establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt, \u201chis mental responsibility for those acts [was] in serious doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298. The court did not hold that the intelligence of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea could only be measured by the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the factual basis for the crime admitted to by the defendant. In fact, when discussing the need for a factual basis for a guilty plea, the court twice cited <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. at 645-646, which sets out the three methods of establishing the intelligence of a plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, supra </em>at 293, 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">b. <em>Sufficient factual basis. </em>Although we need go no further, we note our disagreement with the defendant\u2019s claim, accepted by the dissent, regarding the sufficiency of the factual basis that supported the guilty plea. The defendant claims that no facts existed to support the crime of resisting arrest. Similarly, the dissent concludes that there was no evidence that the defendant \u201cmouthed off\u201d or was \u201cdisturbing the area\u201d after the arrest whs effectuated or that the defendant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police. But both claims take too narrow a view of the facts and the law. As a starting point, a reasonable person, once warned to stop his interference with an investigation or face arrest, who then continues to interfere and make profanity-laden threats of his dislike of the police and directing them not to touch him in no uncertain terms, would have known he was being arrested. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 145-146 (2001) (occurrence of arrest measured objectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The dissent views too narrowly when an arrest is effectuated and thus excludes from consideration the defendant\u2019s words and actions occurring after the point in time in which the dissent deems that arrest to have been effectuated. As we have held, \u201c[f]or purposes of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, the act of preventing, or attempting to prevent, the effecting of an arrest does not invite a snapshot of a moment in time that is deemed to be \u2018the arrest\u2019 after which the defendant\u2019s behavior becomes wholly irrelevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Rather, effecting an arrest is a process that begins when the [three arrest] criteria are present and ends when the person is fully detained by his submission to official force or placed in a secure location from which he can neither escape nor harm the police officer or others nearby.\u201d (Footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 738-739 (2009). Indeed, an arrest is not necessarily complete when a suspect is handcuffed. <em>Id. </em>at 739. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262-263 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, the defendant\u2019s abusive and belligerent behavior, coupled with his interference with the investigation, which was twice described as \u201cresisting,\u201d was sufficient to constitute resisting arrest under either method provided by the statute. In addition, as we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavernier, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 357 (2010), the crime of resisting arrest is self-explanatory. The dissent endeavors to reject this notion with an explanation based on Tavernier\u2019s conduct in that case, instead of demonstrating why this is not a commonly understood phrase, which we believe it to be. While \u201cresisting arrest\u201d has a legal connotation, to \u201cresist\u201d carries as much, if not more, of a commonly understood meaning as does \u201crape.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>451 Mass. at 336-338 (admission he \u201cforcibly raped\u201d victim sufficient to satisfy missing element \u2014 sexual intercourse \u2014 based on common meaning of the term). Indeed, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1932 (2002), defines \u201cresist\u201d as to \u201cwithstand the force or effect of: to be able to repel or ward off\u201d; \u201cto exert oneself to counteract or defeat: strive against: oppose.\u201d Indeed, \u201cresisting arrest\u201d appears as an example of the word\u2019s use. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 723 (1997) (phrase \u201cassault with intent to kill\u201d in guilty plea self-explanatory on element of intent); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 97 (2000) (judge\u2019s use of term \u201cmarketing,\u201d along with statement as to amount Commonwealth would be required to prove, made cocaine trafficking charge self-explanatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defendant received, as due process required, \u201creal notice of the true nature of the charge against him.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. at 645, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 334 (1941). The denial of the motion for new trial was not \u201cmanifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Mass. 667, 673 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990). The dissent\u2019s conclusion to the contrary fails to give the motion judge, who was also the plea judge, the \u201cspecial deference\u201d he deserved. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986). The record reveals not only a valid guilty plea but the defendant\u2019s desire to accept the bargain so that he could serve his sentence and return to a job that was waiting for him. The record also reveals that the defendant\u2019s motivation for moving to withdraw his guilty plea was to avoid his State conviction from being used as a predicate offense to enhance his sentence in a Federal proceeding. The motion for new trial was properly denied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hiskin, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 640 (2007) (one does not plead guilty with his \u201cfingers crossed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for reconsideration affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The defendant does not challenge his disorderly conduct conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The defendant supplemented the record with the police report, from which the prosecutor read during the guilty plea colloquy.

Nor does he alleged that he was unaware of the intratrial rights he was forgoing by pleading guilty, or that his plea was made without a \u201csufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970). See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In support of its conclusion that reversal of a conviction based on a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>plea is required when the recited facts do not support the elements of the crime, the dissent cites to the Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12(c)(5)(A), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1438 (LexisNexis 2011-2012), which state, \u201cThe \u2018factual basis\u2019 standard <em>can </em>be met by having the prosecutor state for the record the evidence that the Commonwealth would have presented had the case gone to trial\u201d (emphasis supplied). As the above emphasis demonstrates, the Reporters\u2019 Notes indicate neither a mandatory nor exclusive method of establishing the crime that defendant is admitting he committed. Indeed, the Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(5), <em>id. </em>at 1437, specifically refer to the trilogy of methods referred to above as the \u201cthree ways that the record of a plea or admission can serve as satisfactory evidence that the defendant had the requisite knowledge of the elements of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b481-13\">At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the judge (who also accepted the defendant\u2019s plea) noted that the transcript of the plea colloquy included some portions that were noted as \u201cinaudible.\u201d Based on his practice of what he asks \u201cevery time,\u201d the judge specifically added that he asks whether defendants have been advised of the elements of the offense.

I agree with the majority, of course, that a constitutionally valid plea \u201cmust be voluntary and intelligent,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 616, 619 (2009), and that \u201c[a] guilty plea generally is voluntary and an intelligent admission of guilt \u2018if the record shows ... a representation that counsel has explained to the defendant the elements he admits by his plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>451 Mass. 332, 335 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantoni, </em>396 Mass. 672, 679 (1986). However, I am not satisfied that a defense counsel\u2019s explanation of the elements of the charge relieved the judge of the independent duty to ensure that there was a factual basis for the charge. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(5), as amended, 399 Mass. 1215 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. 288, 296-297 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.R 12(c)(5), \u201c[t]he judge shall conduct a hearing to determine the voluntariness of the plea or admission and the factual basis of the charge\u201d and \u201cshall not accept a plea of guilty unless the judge is satisfied that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>a factual basis for the charge.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>the court explained that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s choice to plead guilty will not alone support conviction; the defendant\u2019s guilt in fact must be established. . . . Whether the defendant admits to the crime in open court, or the Commonwealth shows the factual basis for the plea, a court may not convict unless there are sufficient facts on the record to establish each element of the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. at 296-297 (citations omitted) (record did not show requisite evidence of defendant\u2019s mental responsibility).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenner, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 763, 771-775 (1987) (under Mass.R. Crim.P. 12[c][5][A], trial judge must \u201cdetermine . . . whether the evidence which he ha[s] heard, plus any information he has obtained in the plea hearing, is sufficient, when considered with reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, to support the charge\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 418 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The analysis whether the defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary and intelligent is distinct from the determination whether there is a factual basis for the charge, and the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s complaint here is that there was no such factual basis. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 88 (2003), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>defendant argued that his plea was not intelligent. The court noted that with respect to intelligence, \u201cwe are concerned with the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature of the charged offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90 n.2. The court explained that the judge \u201cmust make ... a determination to ensure that a factual basis exists for each element of the offenses charged, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. [at] 297.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201cthe fact that he has done so does not conclude our inquiry as to the state of the defendant\u2019s understanding of the elements of the charges against him. This is because while it seems reasonable to suppose that the judge had a police report or some other factual synopsis before him that allowed him to ascertain the basis of the charges, the judge\u2019s state of mind is not at issue here; we are concerned with the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature of the charged offenses.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Likewise, \u201c[v]oluntariness and factual basis are distinct concepts,\u201d but \u201can inquiry concerning the factual basis of a charge \u2018can be of significant assistance to the judge in the performance of his duty to ensure that the plea is voluntarily and intelligently made,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 608 (1973).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 718-719 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">While the plea in this case may have been voluntary and intelligent, the evidence presented cannot provide a factual basis for the charge of resisting arrest. The prosecutor\u2019s recitation of facts provided the only evidence at the time of the plea hearing. In pertinent part, the prosecutor\u2019s narration was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cBasically, Judge, the facts of this case are this defendant came home, the police were there dealing with an argument from two other people. He said, \u2018What the \u201cF\u201d is going on? This is my \u201cf-ing\u201d house,\u2019 which, apparently, it was. They proceeded outside, there was a crowd gathering and then he continued to mouth off to the police and then he resisted a little bit when they went to arrest him are the essential facts, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201c[J]ust kind of, honestly, Judge, kind of hard to infer with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u2014 from the police report what exactly he did to resist. However, it says he interferes with the police. So \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cJudge, . . . this defendant arrived home, the police were at his residence when he arrived home. They asked him \u2014 He was excited, they asked him to calm down and they brought him outside. There was a crowd gathering; he continued to disturb the area. When the police went to place him under arrest for this, he resisted their arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Resisting arrest requires evidence that the defendant \u201cknowingly prevent[ed] or attempted] to prevent a police officer . . . from effecting an arrest . . . by: (1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or (2) using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.\u201d G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a), inserted by St. 1995, c. 276. \u201c \u2018[T]he crime [of resisting arrest] is committed, if at all, at the time of the \u201ceffecting\u201d of an arrest.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 145. An arrest is effected when there is (1) \u2018an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, [2] performed with the intent to effect an arrest and [3] so understood by the person detained.\u2019 <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 198 (1994). The standard for determining whether a defendant understood that he was being arrested is objective \u2014 whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances would have so understood.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 205, 208 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Here, the only facts before the judge at the plea hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were that the defendant swore twice, \u201cmouthed off,\u201d \u201cwas excited,\u201d was asked to \u201ccalm down,\u201d and \u201cdisturb[ed] the area,\u201d all prior to the police placing him under arrest. Aside from the conclusory statement that he \u201cresisted arrest,\u201d there is no evidence that he continued these actions after the arrest was effected. Nor is there any evidence that his conduct rose to the level of \u201cusing or threatening to use physical force or violence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>or \u201ccreating] a substantial risk of causing bodily injury\u201d once the arrest was effected. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The statement that the defendant \u201cresisted arrest\u201d provides no information about the underlying facts necessary to establish the elements of the crime charged. The majority relies on passing dicta in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavernier, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 357 (2010), to show that the charge of \u201cresisting arrest\u201d is \u201cself-explanatory\u201d such that the term obviated the need for additional facts on the record. In <em>Tavernier, </em>there was evidence that the defendant struggled when officers approached him after he had completed multiple drug transactions and attempted to place him in custody. <em>Ibid. </em>He acknowledged in his plea hearing that he \u201cused force against officers effecting a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court explained that a reasonable person would have known he was under arrest and that the defendant acknowledged sufficient facts in the hearing, before adding that \u201c[i]n any event, the charge is self-explanatory.\u201d <em>Ibid. Tavernier </em>did not analyze whether a prosecutor\u2019s mere statement that the defendant \u201cresisted arrest\u201d provided a sufficient factual basis for the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">I agree that \u201cresisting arrest\u201d carries a legal connotation, but disagree that to \u201cresist\u201d carries a commonly understood meaning so as to provide a factual understanding of the defendant\u2019s behavior. \u201cResisting arrest\u201d does not necessarily imply particular behavior by the defendant that would constitute \u201cusing or threatening to use physical force or violence\u201d or \u201cother means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury.\u201d G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a). This is made evident by the generalities in the definition cited by the majority such as to \u201cwithstand,\u201d \u201crepel or ward off,\u201d \u201cstrive\u201d and \u201coppose.\u201d By comparison, to \u201cforcibly rape[]\u201d commonly indicates the more specific behavior of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d that was required in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>451 Mass. 332, 336 (2008). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 91 (neither \u201cassault and battery\u201d nor \u201cintimidation of a witness\u201d are self-explanatory, regardless of whether they have \u201centered common parlance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The police report was not submitted at the plea hearing, and the judge did not have the benefit of it when determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>there was a sufficient factual basis for the plea on the record. Therefore it is irrelevant to the case before us. Even if the judge had had it, the report would not have provided the requisite factual basis. According to the report, the defendant arrived home while two officers were investigating a report of a possible domestic disturbance at his address. The defendant, who was yelling and swearing, repeatedly tried to enter the apartment despite being asked to calm down and wait outside. The officers escorted the defendant outside and called for backup. The defendant \u201cwas told . . . if he did not cease his actions he would be subject to arrest.\u201d He began yelling, \u201cFuck that bullshit, you better not touch me motherfuckers, I don\u2019t like the fucking police.\u201d \u201c[He] continued to yell and swear and was subsequently placed under arrest.\u201d He was then handcuffed, read his Miranda rights, and transported to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As with the plea colloquy, this evidence cannot, without more, establish the elements of resisting arrest. The police report is explicit that the arrest was made \u201csubsequent\u201d to the yelling and quoted statements. Although the police had warned the defendant to calm down or \u201che would be subject to arrest,\u201d a reasonable person would not construe a verbal warning that they could be arrested as initiating an arrest. Nor does the record reveal additional facts that might lead a reasonable person to understand that the warning was not actually a warning and that an arrest was, in fact, occurring. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 209 (defendant did not resist arrest when he fled from officers who intended to arrest him because they did not objectively communicate that intention to defendant before or during pursuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The imprecision in the majority\u2019s assertion that a reasonable person who is warned to discontinue his interference in an investigation or face arrest and then continues to interfere \u201cwould have known he was being arrested\u201d is a matter of real concern. Resisting arrest occurs \u201cat the time of the \u2018effecting\u2019 of an arrest,\u201d an element of which is the \u201cactual or constructive seizure or detention of the person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, supra </em>at 208, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. at 145, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. at 198. Since one cannot be criminally punished for resisting arrest based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>conduct that occurred prior to the commencement of the arrest, what the majority describes as the defendant\u2019s \u201cprofanity-laden threats of his dislike of the police and directing them not to touch him in no uncertain terms,\u201d which were part of the basis for his subsequent arrest, cannot amount to resistance to it. A defendant\u2019s conduct or statement does not initiate the actual or constructive seizure of a person; a police officer does. There is no information in the report about what the defendant did or said once the officer effected the arrest. The report thus provides no information that the defendant used or threatened physical force or created a substantial risk of causing bodily injury once the police initiated the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">As there is no view of the information before the judge at the time of the entry of the plea that can support the charge of resisting arrest, I would reverse. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenner, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 763, 771-775 (1987).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">See also Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12(c)(5)(A), Mass. Ann.
