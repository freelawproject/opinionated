L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(2). His employer, the city of Worcester (city), cross-appeals from the same decision, challenging (1) the board\u2019s affirmance of an award of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, permanent and total incapacity compensation; and (2) the board\u2019s reversal of a previous decision allowing the city to recoup disability benefits that were paid to Mac-Donnell while he was participating in a court-ordered alcohol treatment program. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Background. </em>On December 2, 2002, while employed as a stonemason with the city, MacDonnell injured his back. As a result, he suffered from low back spasms and radiating pain to his right ankle. Subsequent to his injury, MacDonnell also developed various psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">After the accident, MacDonnell filed a claim for G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, temporary total incapacity compensation and was eventually awarded G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, partial incapacity compensation by an administrative judge. In October, 2005, he filed a new claim for \u00a7 34 temporary total incapacity compensation in order to obtain additional compensation and psychiatric treatment. He eventually reached an agreement with the city for the payment of these benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In 2008, MacDonnell filed a claim for G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, permanent and total incapacity compensation. After a conference, the administrative judge ordered the city to pay Mac-Donnell \u00a7 35 partial incapacity compensation; ordered Mac-Donnell to repay the city $7,846.63 due to the city\u2019s payment of disability benefits while MacDonnell was incarcerated for eighty-two days pending trial for a federal offense; and reduced the statutory attorney\u2019s fee owed to MacDonnell\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">MacDonnell appealed from the conference order to a full hearing. As a result of this hearing, the administrative judge ordered the payment of \u00a7 34A permanent and total incapacity compensation; increased the amount MacDonnell must repay to $15,963.88, to include repayment for both the time that Mac-Donnell was actually incarcerated and the time that he spent in a court-ordered alcohol treatment program; and affirmed the reduction of the statutory attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Both parties appealed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to the board. The board vacated the repayment order relative to the disability benefits paid while MacDonnell was in the alcohol treatment program but otherwise summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. Both parties have now appealed from the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Treatment program. </em>The city claims that the board erred in vacating the portion of the administrative judge\u2019s decision requiring MacDonnell to repay benefits received while committed to a court-ordered alcohol treatment program. It argues that such commitment was equivalent to incarceration under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(2)(/),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitling it to recoup benefits paid during that period. As the board noted in its decision, whether court-ordered commitment in an inpatient treatment program constitutes \u201cincarceration\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 8(2)(/') is an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u201cWe exercise de nova review of questions of statutory construction . . . and we must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law.\u201d <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. 79, 81 (2006). However, \u201c[w]e give substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration [and] enforcement.\u201d <em>Bisazza\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 593, 597 (2008), quoting from <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). See <em>Arlington Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 441 (2009). \u201cWhen reviewing the board\u2019s decision we give \u2018due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u2019 of the agency.\u201d <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. at 81, quoting G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). Informed by these principles, we will not disturb the board\u2019s conclusion here that MacDonnell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>commitment to the treatment program was not incarceration for the purposes of \u00a7 8(2)(/).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As a starting point, we consider the structure of the sentence imposed by the United States District Court judge. MacDonnell pleaded guilty to interference with flight crew members. Pursuant to his guilty plea, he was sentenced to \u201cimprisonment of time served\u201d awaiting trial (January 28 through April 18, 2008) and a three-year term of supervised release with various conditions, including the successful completion of a ninety-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. In imposing sentence, the judge made clear that the component of time served reflected that MacDonnell had served \u201ca prison sentence,\u201d even if for a brief period of time. By contrast, with respect to the component of supervised release, the sentencing judge acknowledged it was \u201cfor all intents and purposes . . . the same as probation.\u201d Probation is an alternative to incarceration that \u201callows a criminal offender to remain in the community subject to certain conditions and under the supervision of the court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 111 (1990). \u201c[T]he consequence of a disposition of straight probation is the deferment of sentencing ... for a period of time in which the risk of incarceration can be eliminated by successful completion of the probationary period.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 579 (2001). Here, as the board noted, MacDon-nell\u2019s treatment program was a \u201cspecific condition of the employee\u2019s probation which, in turn, was a conditional sentence to be served in lieu of incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The fact that the treatment program was a condition of Mac-Donnefl\u2019s supervised release does not end the analysis. We may assume without deciding that with respect to \u00a7 8(2)(/), as the city argues, if \u201cthe deprivation of liberty to which the defendant was subjected approached incarceration,\u201d then \u201ca condition of probation might be the equivalent of incarceration.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Speight, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 32 (2003). Here, any deprivation of liberty experienced by MacDonnell during the treatment program does not approach incarceration due to his relative freedom of movement and his voluntary participation. MacDonnell testified that he was able to leave the treatment program during the daytime to attend Alcoholics Anonymous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>meetings \u201cand stuff.\u201d He may also have received weekend passes to visit home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, he volunteered to attend a treatment program as part of pretrial probation, which he successfully completed prior to sentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, at his sentencing hearing MacDonnell\u2019s counsel requested that participation in a treatment program be included as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">For these reasons, the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute was reasonable, and we defer to its determination, after consideration of judicial decisions noted below, that MacDonnell\u2019s commitment to the treatment program did not amount to incarceration under \u00a7 8(2)(/). See <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 52-54, 60 n.4 (1995) (defendant not entitled to credit toward his sentence of imprisonment for time spent in a treatment center pretrial); <em>Speight, 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 32 (\u201cat least for the purpose of determining credit for time spent in confinement, an inpatient drug treatment program as a condition of probation does not equal incarceration\u201d); <em>id., </em>quoting Massachusetts Sentencing Commission, Report to the General Court, at 33 (April 10, 1996) (\u201c \u2018residential programming\u2019 and \u2018substance abuse treatment\u2019 listed as <em>alternatives </em>to prison\u201d [emphasis in original]). Contrast <em>DuPont </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 909-910 (2003), cert, denied, 542 U.S. 943 (2004) <em>(prerelease </em>halfway house is the equivalent of a \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d because the defendant was specifically assigned to that facility, was not free to come and go, and could not choose to live elsewhere).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Appropriately, MacDonnell does <em>not </em>challenge the denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits during the eighty-two day period when he was incarcerated and had no freedom of movement or earning capacity. See <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>418 Mass. 848, 853 (1994). With respect to supervised release, on the facts of this case, where the condition of treatment \u201cwas not the equivalent of the involuntary confinement characteristic of a prison sentence,\u201d <em>Speight, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 32, we cannot say that the board\u2019s determination was inconsistent with the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Moreover, we note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>board\u2019s ruling is consistent with the principle that the act \u201cis to be interpreted \u2018so far as may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design. \u2019 Accordingly, \u2018we give this remedial statute a \u201cbroad interpretation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>453 Mass. 358, 361-362 (2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">2. <em>Section 34A benefits. </em>The city further claims that the board\u2019s summary affirmance of the award of \u00a7 34A benefits is arbitrary and capricious because MacDonnell failed to meet his burden to establish the required causal relationship between his work-related physical injury and his psychiatric disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our review on appeal is limited. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), requires this court to review decisions of the board in accordance with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(&lt;\u00bf) and <em>(f)-(g). Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 312 (2007). The board\u2019s decision \u201cis not to be reversed unless it is lacking in evidentiary support or a different conclusion is required as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359 (1980). In cases like this that involve summary affirmance, \u201cthe reviewing court is inspecting the findings and reasoning of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u201c[A]n employee whose emotional disability is the result of a work-related physical injury will be awarded compensation upon a simple demonstration of \u2018but for\u2019 causation between the injury and the employee\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 108 (2007). The employee has the burden of establishing causation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 592 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The administrative judge adopted the opinion of Dr. Nestel-baum, an impartial medical examiner. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. In his report, Dr. Nestelbaum stated, \u201cIt seems that most of [MacDonnell\u2019s] disability is likely related to his chronic back pain .... [I]f [MacDonnell\u2019s] pain symptoms should resolve it is more likely that his psychiatric disorders should not be of sufficient intensity most of the time to cause total[] disability. . . . [A]t the present time Mr. MacDonnell is in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>view totally disabled from his psychiatric disorders in large part due to his complaints of severe pain.\u201d While Dr. Nestelbaum in his discussion of causation did identify a number of \u201csignificant and stressful life events\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> since MacDonnell\u2019s 2002 work injury, he opined that some of these events were \u201cdownstream affects\u201d of the injury and ultimately concluded that MacDonnell\u2019s work-related injuries were \u201ca major factor\u201d in his current psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Based on Dr. Nestelbaum\u2019s report, the administrative judge did not err in concluding by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a causal relationship between MacDonnell\u2019s work-related physical injury and his subsequent psychiatric disability. See <em>Dube\u2019s </em>Case, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 128 (2007). MacDonnell was not required to present any additional evidence to meet his burden with respect to causation. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2). Moreover, the city had the opportunity to depose Dr. Nestelbaum to raise further questions regarding the issue of causation but chose not to do so. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2) (\u201cEither party shall have the right to engage the impartial medical examiner to be deposed for purposes of cross examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>MacDonnell claims that the board erred in summarily affirming the administrative judge\u2019s order to reduce MacDonnell\u2019s statutory attorney\u2019s fees because it was beyond the scope of the administrative judge\u2019s authority, arbitrary and capricious, or contrary to law to reduce those fees for a purely punitive reason. As noted above, in cases of summary affirmance, \u201cthe reviewing court is inspecting the findings and reasoning of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>Dalbec\u2019s </em>Case, 69 Mass. App. Ct. at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">MacDonnell\u2019s claim that the administrative judge exceeded his authority is without merit. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A(2), clearly provides that an administrative judge may reduce a prevailing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in light of \u201cthe complexity of the dispute or the effort expended by the attorney.\u201d Here, the administrative judge affirmed the conference order reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>MacDonnell\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees to one hundred dollars and noted that the reduction was a result of the \u201clack of precision and attention to detail on the part of the employee\u2019s attorney in his presentation of this case.\u201d In other words, the administrative judge reduced the statutory award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the lack of effort on the part of the attorney, a permissible reason under \u00a7 13A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">MacDonnell\u2019s claim that the administrative judge\u2019s application of \u00a7 13A(2) was arbitrary or capricious is similarly without merit. See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994) (decision is not arbitrary and capricious if it \u201cis factually warranted and . . . [has] adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclos[es] reasoned decision making\u201d). Here, MacDonnell\u2019s counsel made inaccurate representations to the administrative judge concerning MacDonnell\u2019s incarceration and MacDonnell\u2019s average weekly wage. The administrative judge reasoned that these inaccurate representations were indicative of a lack of precision and attention to detail and, thus, a lack of effort. Because there was sufficient evidence to support his clearly reasoned decision, the administrative judge\u2019s application of \u00a7 13A(2) was not arbitrary or capricious. There is no evidence to support MacDonnell\u2019s argument that the reduction in attorney\u2019s fees was motivated by an impermissible punitive motive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 8(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cAn insurer paying weekly compensation benefits shall not modify or discontinue such payments except in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201c(/) the employee has been incarcerated pursuant to conviction for a felony or misdemeanor and has thereby forfeited any right to compensation during such period . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The sentencing judge left the question of MacDonnell\u2019s eligibility for weekend passes to the discretion of the treatment program and the probation department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">MacDonnell received credit for the time spent in pretrial treatment against the court-ordered ninety days in treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On appeal, the city does not raise any defenses involving G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as it did at the hearing below. As such, the city has waived this issue on appeal. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Specifically, \u201c[MacDonnell\u2019s] mother died, his long term relationship ended, he lost his house.

General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A(2), does not authorize the administrative judge to reduce the city\u2019s counsel\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
