At a retrial, Riley was acquitted of all charges. Following passage of the Erroneous Convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Law, G. L. c. 258D, Riley brought this action seeking compensation for his wrongful conviction and imprisonment. The question before us is whether Riley falls within the class of persons eligible to seek compensation under the statute. More particularly, we must decide whether his conviction was reversed on \u201cgrounds resting upon facts and circumstances probative of the proposition that the claimant did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>458 Mass. 354, 362 (2010) <em>(Guzman), </em>quoting from <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 477 (2009). We conclude that the reversal based on the <em>Bruton </em>grounds here \u2014 that is, the erroneous admission of additional hearsay evidence of guilt provided by his codefendants \u2014 did not render him eligible for compensation, and we therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court judge denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>Background. </em>The facts underlying Riley\u2019s criminal case are as follows. Riley\u2019s friend Ramon Libran was involved in a fight with several individuals in Chelsea. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra </em>at 647. The following evening, Libran, Riley, Riley\u2019s brother, and two others drove around Chelsea looking for the men involved in the fight. <em>Ibid. </em>They eventually found three of the men. <em>Id. </em>at 648. Libran chased down one man and stabbed him repeatedly, killing him. <em>Ibid. </em>Riley\u2019s brother punched another of the men and cut him with a knife. <em>Ibid. </em>Riley was present but not active in the violence. See <em>id. </em>at 649. He was prosecuted only as a joint venturer. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe only contested issue [was] whether [he] had the requisite intent . . . <em>Id. </em>at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Much of Riley\u2019s statement to the police, which was admitted at trial, was exculpatory as to intent. See <em>id. </em>at 651. He stated that he joined the group shortly before they found the men they were looking for that evening. See <em>id. </em>at 652. He also indicated that he had told Libran before the stabbing, \u201c[T]his is crazy, I want to go home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651. Additionally, he stated that he tried to break up the fight involving his brother, and that he was surprised to learn that Libran had stabbed someone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. A codefendant\u2019s girlfriend partially supported Riley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>version of events, testifying that he told Libran, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, you shouldn\u2019t have stabbed him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. However, she also partially contradicted him, stating that \u201cprior to the incidents, all four defendants were talking about the fight the night before and about how they were looking for those who had been involved . . . [and how they] intended to beat up those people if they located them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In addition to this evidence, the statements of two nontestify-ing codefendants were admitted at trial under an interpretation of <em>Bruton </em>that was later repudiated by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>id. </em>at 649. These statements added materially to the evidence of Riley\u2019s intent. In particular, one codefendant stated that Riley had been driving around with the group for four hours looking for the men involved in the fight, and that \u201cpeople were going to get out of [the] car and have a fist fight with the people that jumped [Libran].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. The Supreme Judicial Court held that these statements were not wholly cumulative of other evidence and \u201ccould have affected [the] verdicts against\u201d Riley. <em>Id. </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">After the plaintiff filed his complaint for compensation in this action, the Commonwealth moved for judgment on the pleadings under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). It argued that the grounds for the reversal of Riley\u2019s conviction did not tend to establish his innocence, and therefore he was ineligible to bring the action. The motion judge denied the motion, ruling that Riley was eligible to sue, and the Commonwealth appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\"><em>Erroneous Convictions Law. </em>Under G. L. c. 258D, an individual who has been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned may sue for relief including damages of up to $500,000. See Guzman, 458 Mass, at 355-356 &amp; n.4; G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 5. A plaintiff is eligible to bring such a claim if, as relevant here, a State court reversed his felony conviction \u201con grounds which tend to establish the innocence of the [plaintiff],\u201d and he is later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>acquitted at a retrial. G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 l(B)(ii), inserted by St. 2004, c. 244, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In explaining the meaning of \u201cgrounds which tend to establish the innocence of the [plaintiff],\u201d the Supreme Judicial Court has relied in part on the legislative history of the provision. The relevant provision evolved from an earlier formulation rejected and returned by the Governor, which had provided for eligibility for compensation based on reversals on \u201cgrounds consistent with . . . innocence.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358. As the Supreme Judicial Court explained: \u201cThe Governor\u2019s amendment, eventually adopted into law, was plainly intended to limit the scope of the bill\u2019s original language.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court further explained that \u201cit is possible to envision many potential claimants whose convictions are reversed because of procedural or evidentiary errors or structural deficiencies at their trials that could well be \u2018consistent\u2019 with innocence without <em>any </em>tendency to establish it\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Ibid. </em>The court then provided a list of examples of such cases, including admission of ballistics certificates and closure of the courtroom in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; admission of expert deoxyribonucleic acid testimony without the necessary statistical explanations; ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to request a provocation instruction; incorrect jury instructions on the third prong of malice; prosecutorial misconduct by giving unsworn testimony and vouching for a key prosecution witness; erroneous disallowance of a defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge; and, most importantly for our purposes here, admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession \u201cin contravention of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 358 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">With these considerations in mind, the Supreme Judicial Court then defined the class of plaintiffs eligible for compensation as those whose convictions were reversed on \u201cgrounds resting upon facts and circumstances probative of the proposition that the claimant did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, quoting from <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 477.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Previous applications of the \u201cgrounds which tend to establish innocence\u201d test. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court has decided two instructive cases applying G. L. c. 258D. In <em>Guzman, </em>the plaintiff had been convicted of multiple drug offenses. <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 355. His defense at trial was mistaken identity, namely, that he had been mistaken for his cousin. See <em>id. </em>at 362-363. Two police officers testified that they had seen Guzman selling cocaine to two buyers. <em>Id. </em>at 363. Guzman\u2019s trial counsel had previously represented one of these buyers. <em>Ibid. </em>The buyers would have testified that Guzman was not the one who had sold them the cocaine, thus bolstering his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 363 &amp; n.15. However, in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, Guzman\u2019s counsel not only declined to call the buyers but also prevented the Commonwealth from calling one of them to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 363 &amp; n.16. A judge granted Guzman a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel due to the exclusion of key exculpatory evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 363-364 &amp; n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court held that Guzman was eligible to bring a G. L. c. 258D claim because \u201cthe erroneously omitted evidence was probative of the conclusion that the culprit was someone else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. It went on: \u201cEssential to our analysis here is that counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance took the form of depriving Guzman of the introduction of evidence tending to establish his actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The other reported case applying the statute is <em>Drumgold </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>458 Mass. 367 (2010) <em>(Drumgold), </em>decided the same day as <em>Guzman. </em>Drumgold was convicted of murder after masked gunmen shot and killed a twelve year old girl in the Roxbury section of Boston. <em>Id. </em>at 370. His defense at trial was misidentification, and he presented multiple alibi witnesses as well as his own testimony that he was elsewhere at the time of the shooting. <em>Id. </em>at 371. After Drumgold spent fourteen years in prison, a judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and previously withheld exculpatory evidence related to two key witnesses. See <em>id. </em>at 371, 375-376. Specifically, Drumgold presented evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that, when a critical witness identified him and when she testified at trial, she was suffering from terminal brain cancer, with symptoms including blurred vision, amnesia, and disorientation. <em>Id. </em>at 373. This condition obviously undercut the reliability of her identification. Separately, another significant witness recanted his trial testimony and testified that he had been given material undisclosed inducements by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 373-374. The Commonwealth conceded that the failure to disclose these inducements \u201cdeprived [Drumgold] of his constitutional right to cross-examine [the witness] effectively to show potential bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375 (first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The <em>Drumgold </em>court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Dmmgold was ineligible for compensation because the motion judge\u2019s ruling was based on the unfairness of the trial rather than a determination that Drumgold might be innocent. <em>Id. </em>at 377-378. Specifically, the court held that the new evidence and undisclosed evidence \u201cwere probative of the central issue at trial: the reliability of the identification of Drumgold as one of the shooters and, correspondingly, the veracity of his alibi defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. Because of the absence of this \u201ccritical evidence,\u201d \u201cthe fact finder was forestalled from making a fully informed decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\"><em>Application of \u201cgrounds which tend to establish innocence\u201d test in the instant case. </em>At the outset, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that <em>Guzman </em>established a categorical rule barring any plaintiff whose conviction was reversed due to a <em>Bruton </em>error from seeking compensation. It is our understanding that the footnote was meant to provide guidance on the types of reversals \u201cthat could well be \u2018consistent\u2019 with innocence without any tendency to establish it,\u201d but was not setting forth a definitive rule barring recovery for any of the types of errors listed in the footnote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358, quoting from <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 477. The test ultimately adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court requires us to look not only at the legal rationale for judicial relief but also at the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d on which the relief rests. See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 362, quoting from <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Nonetheless, in this case the facts and circumstances underlying reversal do not tend to show Riley\u2019s innocence. Rather, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, </em>455 Mass. 485, 495-496 (2009) <em>(Bacigalupo), </em>the facts and circumstances justifying the reversal are the erroneous admission of additional evidence of guilt, not the exclusion of evidence probative of innocence. See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 358 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In <em>Bacigalupo, </em>the identification of the defendant as the murder culprit depended on the testimony of \u201ca convicted felon testifying pursuant to a proffer agreement with the Commonwealth [who] did not name his assailants to the government until, four years after the shootings, he was in jeopardy of being charged with serious offenses.\u201d <em>Bacigalupo, supra </em>at 496. This shaky foundation was shored up through the admission of a codefend-ant\u2019s confession, in violation of <em>Bruton. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 492, 494-495. Although the evidence apart from the inadmissible confession was sufficient to convict Bacigalupo, his convictions were reversed because the error might have had an impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations. See <em>id. </em>at 491, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Similarly, the Commonwealth produced sufficient but not overwhelming evidence of Riley\u2019s intent, and the <em>Bruton </em>errors required reversal because they \u201ccould have affected [the] verdicts against him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>405 Mass. at 653. In neither Bacigalupo\u2019s case nor Riley\u2019s was evidence probative of the defendant\u2019s innocence kept from the fact finder. Compare <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Unlike in <em>Drumgold, </em>the fact finder here was not \u201cforestalled from making a fully informed decision.\u201d <em>Drumgold, supra </em>at 378. On the contrary, Riley\u2019s first jury had <em>too much </em>information, including the confessions that they should not have heard. The Legislature clearly did not intend to provide compensation merely because evidence of a claimant\u2019s guilt should have been suppressed or excluded. See G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1(F) (providing that, at trial on the merits of the compensation claim, \u201c[n]o evidence proffered by any party shall be excluded on grounds that it was seized or obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth [A]mendments to the Constitution of the United States, or in violation of Articles 12 or 14 of Part the First of the Constitution of Massachusetts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The absence of the codefendants\u2019 statements evidently \u201cchanged the . . . credibility calculation\u201d at Riley\u2019s second trial, where he was acquitted. <em>Drumgold, supra </em>at 378. But if this were enough to establish eligibility, any evidentiary error weighty enough to warrant reversal (including the <em>Bruton </em>error in <em>Bacigalupo) </em>would suffice. In order to pass the initial bar of G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 1(B), \u201cthe relief granted must be on grounds tending to do more than merely assist the defendant\u2019s chances of acquittal.\u201d <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 360. Nothing in the reversal of Riley\u2019s convictions on <em>Bruton </em>grounds, or the facts and circumstances underlying that relief, tends to show that Riley was innocent. The court\u2019s ruling only made it more difficult for the Commonwealth to prove that he did commit the crimes by excluding additional inadmissible evidence of guilt. Therefore, Riley is not eligible to pursue a claim under G. L. c. 258D.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is reversed. A new order shall enter dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">lev did, however, admit that he knew his brother and Libran had knives and that he had heard Libran talk about beating people up. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra </em>at 652.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">As no party has argued the appealability of this order, we assume without deciding that the Commonwealth is entitled to appeal under the doctrine of present execution. See <em>Drumgold </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>458 Mass. 367, 368 n.2 (2010) (\u201cThe Commonwealth filed an appeal from the judge\u2019s order denying summary judgment, claiming that the ruling was immediately appealable under the doctrine of present execution .... We do not role on the point\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">If the plaintiff meets these eligibility criteria, he then bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence, among other things, that \u201che did not commit the crimes or crime charged in the indictment or complaint.\u201d G. L. c. 258D, \u00a7 l(C)(vi). See <em>Guzman, supra </em>at 360-361. In other words, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>plaintiff must first show that the grounds for judicial relief were probative of his innocence, and then demonstrate that he was in fact innocent of the crimes charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The motion judge also properly rejected this categorical approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
