We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Our review is de nova, not only because this appeal arises on summary judgment, see <em>Bardige </em>v. <em>Performance Specialists, Inc., </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 99, 101-102 (2009), but also because the interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law. See <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Citation Ins. Co., </em>447 Mass. 663, 667 (2006). Our task is aided, however, by the motion judge\u2019s thorough and thoughtful memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In brief, the dispute may be summarized as follows. Commencing in 2004, Landmark provided excess coverage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the plaintiffs\u2019 properties on a scheduled basis, insuring the various locations for specific amounts as reported by the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cExcess Physical Damage Schedule\u201d of the policy lists the primary insurance and underlying excess limits as \u201c$2,500,000 per occurrence,\u201d and the limit insured as \u201c$100,000,000 per occurrence, not to exceed value reported.\u201d The stated values of the two Louisiana apartment complexes were reported and scheduled at a combined total of $8.7 million. It is not disputed that the plaintiffs\u2019 losses exceeded $8.7 million; nor is it disputed that the plaintiffs already have recovered $8.7 million from their insurance program: their primary insurer paid its entire \u201cper occurrence\u201d limits of $2.5 million, and Landmark paid $6.2 million under its excess policy. At issue is whether Landmark owes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>additional $2.5 million. According to the plaintiffs, payment of the primary policy limits merely triggered, but did not reduce, Landmark\u2019s obligation to pay up to the full amount of the stated values for the damaged properties. Thus, under the plaintiffs\u2019 view, they are entitled to a total recovery from their insurers of $11.2 million on properties with scheduled values of $8.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We observe at the outset that the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the policy is at odds with the usual operation of excess coverage, which typically insures \u201closs that exceeds the amount of coverage under another policy.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>454 Mass. 337, 340 n.7 (2009), quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 816 (8th ed. 2004). As between primary and excess policies, \u201c[t]he layer of risk each insurer covers is defined and distinct.\u201d <em>Allmerica Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>449 Mass. 621, 630 (2007). As explained by the Supreme Judicial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cAn insurance program involving a primary policy and one or more excess policies divides risk into distinct units and insures each unit individually. The individual insurers do not (absent a specific provision) act as coinsurers of the entirety of the risk. Rather, each insurer contracts with the insured individually to cover a particular portion of the risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 629-630.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 analysis depends upon \u201ccherry-picking\u201d two provisions \u2014 the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d and the scheduled limit of liability endorsement as it appears in their 2004 policy \u2014 and viewing them in isolation from other related policy terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is contrary to well-established principles of policy interpretation requiring that we consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>policy provisions in context and in light of the policy as a whole. See, e.g., <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, 499 (1988); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Southland Life Ins. Co., 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 439, 442-443 (2006). Viewed in light of these principles, neither the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d nor the scheduled limit of liability endorsement detracts from the clear and unambiguous intent of the excess policy to cover only that portion of the scheduled values that exceeded the primary policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d and the two preceding paragraphs together set forth the basic parameters of the policy\u2019s \u201cExcess Physical Damage Coverage Form\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201c1. Insuring Clause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201cSubject to the limitations, terms and conditions contained in this Policy or added hereto, the Company agrees to indemnify the Insured named in the schedule herein in respect of direct physical loss or damage to the property described in the schedule while located or contained as described in the schedule, occurring during the period stated in the schedule and caused by any of such perils as are set forth in Item 3 of the schedule, and which are also covered by and defined in the policy(les) specified in the schedule and issued by the Primary Insurer(s) stated therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201c2. Limit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">\u201cProvided always that liability attaches to the Company only after the primary and underlying excess insurer(s) have paid or have admitted to liability for the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability as set forth in Item 6 of the schedule and designated \u2018Primary and Underlying Excess Limit(s)\u2019[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and then the limits of the Company\u2019s liability shall be those set forth in Item 7 under the designation \u2018Limit Insured\u2019[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and the Company shall be liable to pay the ultimate net loss up to the full amount of such \u2018Limit Insured.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201c3. Definitions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201c(a) Loss: The word \u2018loss\u2019 shall mean a loss or series of losses arising out of one event or occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c(b) Ultimate Net Loss: The words \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 shall mean the loss sustained by the Insured as a result of the happening of the perils covered by this Policy after making deductions for all salvages, recoveries and other valid and collectible insurance <em>other than recoveries under the policy(les) of the primary and underlying excess insurers)\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Although the plaintiffs argue that the emphasized phrase in the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d means that Landmark is liable for the entire ultimate net loss without any deduction for amounts paid by the primary insurer, this interpretation is not reasonable. The definition does not purport to address Landmark\u2019s <em>liability </em>for ultimate net loss; that issue is addressed in the preceding paragraph, entitled \u201cLimit,\u201d which makes clear that Landmark\u2019s liability attaches after the primary and any other underlying insurers pay their respective portions of the ultimate net loss, and will not exceed the value reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the scheduled limit of liability endorsement is equally misplaced. That endorsement provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">\u201c1. In the event of loss hereunder, liability of the Company shall be limited to the least of the following in any one \u2018occurrence\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201ca. The actual adjusted amount of the loss, less applicable deductibles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">\u201cb. 100% of the individually stated value for each scheduled item of property insured at the location which had the loss as shown on the latest Statement of Values on file with this Company, less applicable deductibles. If no value is shown for a scheduled item then there is no coverage for that item; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">\u201cc. The Limit of Liability as shown on the Declarations page of this policy or as endorsed to this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Properly understood, the limit of liability endorsement sets the upper limits of Landmark\u2019s liability; it does not, in itself, purport to change the nature of the policy from one providing excess coverage to one providing overlapping coverage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This interpretation of the scheduled limit of liability endorsement is confirmed by the policy\u2019s \u201cdrop down\u201d provision,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which immediately precedes it. Entitled \u201cExcess Limit of Liability \u2018Drop Down\u2019 Clause,\u201d it states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that in the event of reduction or exhaustion of the underlying aggregate limit or limits, such insurance as is afforded by this Policy shall apply in excess of the reduced underlying limit, or if such limit is exhausted, shall apply as underlying insurance, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the terms and conditions of this Policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201cIt is further understood that, in the event of exhaustion of the underlying aggregate limit or limits, the deductible applicable to coverage provided by this Policy for the peril(s) for which underlying limit(s) have been exhausted shall be the same as the deductible(s) stated in the primary policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cIn no event, however, shall this Company be liable for more than the limits of liability, as specified in Item 7 of the Excess Physical Damage Schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201cIt is a condition of this Policy that the Policy(ies) of the primary and underlying excess insurers shall be maintained in full effect during the currency of this Policy except for any reduction or exhaustion of the aggregate limits contained therein solely by payment of losses during the Policy year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Were we to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>limit of liability endorsement, the operation of the drop down clause would be incongruous. If, as the plaintiffs contend, they are entitled to recover from Landmark 100 percent of the stated value of the damaged properties even after the $2.5 million primary policy limits have been paid, they would be afforded excess coverage in the full amount of the stated values in situations where the primary policy has been paid in full, even though, in drop down situations, they would be afforded coverage only in excess of the reduced underlying limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\u201cAn interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all of the provisions of a contract is to be preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable.\u201d <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 245 (1986), quoting from <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assurance Corp., </em>343 Mass. 354, 357 (1961). Thus, the provisions on which the plaintiffs rely must be read in conjunction with the requirement that the plaintiffs maintain their primary coverage in full effect, and with the drop down clause limiting Landmark\u2019s liability to the scheduled values and making clear that even in instances of drop down coverage, Landmark\u2019s liability will not exceed the stated value of damaged property. When we do so, it is readily apparent that Landmark\u2019s policy functions as an excess policy in the usual sense, and that Landmark has fully paid its share of the losses sustained by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The plaintiffs also own and operate numerous other properties that are located in Massachusetts, and the plaintiffs each have a place of business here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The policy form is labeled \u201cExcess Physical Damage Coverage Form.\u201d See <em>Mission Ins.

As we conclude that there is no merit to the plaintiffs\u2019 position even under the terms of the 2004 policy, we need not consider Landmark\u2019s argument that the receipt by the plaintiffs\u2019 broker of a binder for the 2005 policy bound the plaintiffs to a revised scheduled limit of liability endorsement expressly stating that the liability of the insurer to pay the stated value of a property would be reduced by primary and underlying excess limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Item 6 of the \u201cExcess Physical Damage Schedule\u201d lists the following: \u201cPrimary Limits and Underlying Excess Limits: $2,500,000 Per Occurrence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Item 7 of the \u201cExcess Physical Damage Schedule\u201d lists the following: \u201cLimit Insured: $100,000 Per Occurrence, not to exceed value reported and $7,500,000 Annual Aggregate each as respects Flood and Earthquake.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">The 2005 modification to the endorsement does not affect our analysis.
