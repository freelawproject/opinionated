L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii), and possession of child pornography as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues on appeal that the photograph of a naked adolescent girl that he printed from a computer at the Hingham public library (library) did not contain a lewd exhibition of the pubic area of the girl or of her breasts as required by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii). He contends that the jury instructions on lewd exhibition were incomplete, and that prejudicial, irrelevant evidence regarding other pictures he was viewing in the library was admitted. He also claims that defects in the indictment and <em>O\u2019Dell </em>violations in the grand jury process required dismissal of the indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 446-447 (1984). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Background. </em>A librarian, checking on a computer in an isolated alcove of the library, found the defendant printing out a photograph of a naked girl on a beach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The librarian told the defendant this was not what the computers were to be used for, and he tried to take the photograph away from the defendant. The defendant ripped the photograph away, leaving the librarian with only a small piece of it. As another picture started to print, the librarian turned the printer off and told the defendant that he could lose his library privileges. The librarian then contacted his supervisor, who came to speak to the defendant. The defendant informed the supervisor that the \u201cimages were heavily censored,\u201d to which the supervisor responded that it was irrelevant. The defendant then stated, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. It was a pop-up.\u201d The librarian then inquired, if that were so, why it printed. The defendant had no response. When asked his name, the defendant said, \u201cSmith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">After the library closed, the librarian reviewed the computer\u2019s Web site history and found the photograph the defendant had printed, as well as others of children on beaches and in other settings, with and without clothes. He determined the printed photograph came from a Russian-based Web site called \u201cPhoto-file.RU.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The grand jury were informed that the librarian also saw that the defendant had reviewed sex offender sites and that one of the names that the defendant had checked on the site was Mark Sullivan. The librarian \u201cran\u201d a search for that name and found it to be the name of a level three sex offender from Norwell. The librarian retrieved a photograph of Mark Sullivan on the sex offender registry Web site and identified it as a photograph of the library patron who had printed out the photograph the librarian had seen. The librarian contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\"><em>The indictment. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in not dismissing the indictment for failing to state a crime. Although very poorly drafted, the three-page indictment, when read as a whole, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">An indictment will not be dismissed \u201cif the offense is charged with sufficient clarity to show a violation of law and to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the defendant to know the nature of the accusation against him. It is not necessary for the Commonwealth to set forth in the . . . indictment every element of the crime to withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>430 Mass. 517, 520 (1999), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>530 U.S. 1281 (2000) (citations omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>462 Mass. 398, 402-405 (2012). Rather, it is acceptable for the indictment to contain \u201can appropriate legal term descriptive\u201d of the criminal act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 Mass. 565, 566 (1987), quoting from Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(a), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). Thus in <em>Green, </em>it was held sufficient to allege that the defendant \u201c[d]id indecently assault and beat\u201d the victim without specifying each element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 566-567.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The indictment here began with the following caption: \u201cINDICTMENT[,] PURCHASE OR POSSESSION OF VISUAL MATERIAL OF CHILD DEPICTED IN SEXUAL CONDUCT[,] GENERAL LAWS CHAPTER 272, SECTION 29C[,] COUNT A.\u201d Count A then provided that Mark Sullivan on or about February 14, 2007, in Hingham \u201cdid knowingly . . . possess a . . . photograph ... of any child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of eighteen years. See Count B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The indictment then continued with the caption to Count B, which provided: \u201cPURCHASE OR POSSESSION OF VISUAL MATERIAL OF CHILD DEPICTED IN SEXUAL CONDUCT, SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE[,] GENERAL LAWS CHAPTER 272, SECTION 29C.\u201d The language from Count A was then repeated, followed by the clause, \u201cafter having been previously convicted in.\u201d His ten previous convictions of possession of child pornography or posing or exhibiting children in a state of nudity were then listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendant argues that the indictment failed to charge him with a crime because he was accused only of knowing possession of a photograph of a child under eighteen. No crime was charged, he contends, because the indictment omitted the substance of subsection (vii) of c. 272, \u00a7 29C, inserted by St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 2, which provides that the child in the photograph the defendant possessed \u201cbe depicted or portrayed in any pose, posture or setting involving a lewd exhibition of the unclothed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>genitals, pubic area, buttocks or, if such person is female, a fully or partially developed breast of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We conclude that the entire indictment, which includes the captions and the subsequent offense portions of the indictment, provided the defendant with sufficient information to know both the nature of the accusation against him and the law that he was accused of violating. The indictment references the date and place of the offense. It also states that the defendant is being prosecuted for possession of a photograph of a child arising out of these events. The caption references the chapter and section of the statutory violation and further describes the conduct proscribed: visual material of a child depicted in sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Reliance on the caption is not improper. \u201cThe caption on an indictment has been used in aid of interpreting the text of an indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 459 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>430 Mass. 517 (1999), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>530 U.S. 1281 (2000). So long as they are not inconsistent with each other, the caption may be used to \u201cilluminate[]\u201d the meaning of the body of the indictment. <em>Ibid. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 833 (2009) (may not use caption to justify amendment of complaint after trial to include new form of vehicular homicide with additional elements and more severe maximum sentence). Here the body of the indictment is incomplete without the caption, but it is not inconsistent with the caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The subsequent offense portion of the indictment also informs the defendant of the nature of the accusation and the statutory violation. \u201c[T]he counts for the current offense and for the repeat offense are viewed as parts of one indictment and charge only one crime with a sentence enhancement provision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>430 Mass. at 520-521. The defendant\u2019s numerous prior convictions of possession of child pornography are listed in the indictment. The indictment informs the defendant that the new crime he is being charged with involving child pornography is a repeat offense, of which he is undoubtedly aware. \u201cHere, a reader of count B of the indictment would require practiced obtuseness not to understand the nature of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The indictment need not contain reference to the particular subsection or theory of culpability with which the defendant is being charged. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePace, </em>442 Mass. 739, 743 (2004), cert, denied, 544 U.S. 980 (2005) (\u201cThe statutory form of an indictment alleging murder that is not self-limiting to murder in the second degree encompasses all theories of murder in the first degree and is sufficient to charge murder by whatever means it may have been committed\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>453 Mass. 40, 52 (2009). Just as the Commonwealth is not required to \u201cpresent to the grand jury evidence of each theory under which the defendant may be found guilty at trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clayton (No. 1), </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 612 (2005), it need not reference the particular theory upon which it is proceeding in the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In sum, after reading the indictment in its entirety, the defendant was well informed of which statute he was accused of violating and why. This was sufficient to justify the judge\u2019s decision to deny the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Integrity of the grand jury process. </em>The defendant contends that by presenting unnecessary and prejudicial \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence to the grand jury, the Commonwealth \u201cimpaired the integrity of the grand jury proceedings,\u201d necessitating dismissal of the indictment obtained thereby. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 309 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. at 446-447.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201cIt is the general rule that a court should not inquire into the adequacy or competency of the evidence upon which an indictment is based.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 166 (1982). \u201cHowever, when it appears that the integrity of the grand jury process has been impaired, a defendant may attack the validity of the indictment by way of a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In order to prevail on such a motion, the defendant must prove that \u201c(1) the Commonwealth knowingly or recklessly presented false or deceptive evidence to the grand jury; (2) the evidence was presented for the purpose of obtaining an indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ment; and (3) the evidence probably influenced the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>455 Mass. 503, 509 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The evidence to which the defendant takes exception is the material uncovered by the librarian after the defendant was found printing out the photograph of the naked girl on the beach. After the defendant left the library, the librarian reviewed the Web sites that the defendant had been viewing, which included the sex offender registry and sex offender Web sites, where the defendant had been examining his own listing. The librarian found the defendant\u2019s listing as a level three sex offender and his photograph, from which the librarian identified the defendant. Prior statements to library personnel by other library patrons concerning their suspicions regarding the defendant\u2019s use of the library\u2019s computer to view pornography on other occasions further confirmed his identity. Submitting this evidence to the grand jury to establish the defendant\u2019s identity was neither false nor improper, especially where the defendant concealed his identity at the library by giving a false name, and was not apprehended at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Commonwealth also was required to establish the defendant\u2019s knowing possession of the photograph. When confronted by the librarian with the photograph printing out, the defendant had claimed it was a \u201cpop-up,\u201d that is, that he did not deliberately go to the Web site, choose the photograph, and print it. His Internet searches that day, including the other Web sites that he was visiting and the photographs he was viewing, were relevant to his knowing possession of the photograph at issue, as were his prior similar activities at the library.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">As the evidence was relevant to the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of the crime and neither false nor deceptive, the motion judge properly found that there was no <em>O\u2019Dell </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\"><em>Lewd exhibition. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29C, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cWhoever knowingly purchases or possesses a negative, slide, book, magazine, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction, or depiction by computer, of any child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 years of age and such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>child is . . . (vii) depicted or portrayed in any pose, posture or setting involving a lewd exhibition of the unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks or, if such person is female, a fully or partially developed breast of the child; with knowledge of the nature or content thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The statutory purpose underlying the prohibition of knowing possession of child pornography is set forth in \u00a7 1 of St. 1997, c. 181:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cThe general court hereby finds: (1) that the sexual exploitation of children constitutes a wrongful invasion of a child\u2019s right to privacy and results in social, developmental and emotional injury to such child and that to protect children from sexual exploitation it is necessary to prohibit the production of material which involves or is derived from such exploitation and to exclude all such material from the channels of trade and commerce; (2) that the mere possession or control of any sexually exploitative material results in continuing victimization of children as such material is a permanent record of an act or acts of sexual abuse or exploitation of a child and that each time such material is viewed the child is harmed; (3) that such material is used to break the will and resistance of other children so as to encourage them to participate in similar acts; (4) that laws banning the production and distribution of such material are insufficient to halt this abuse and exploitation; (5) that to stop the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, it is necessary to ban the possession of any sexually exploitative materials; and (6) that the commonwealth has a compelling interest in outlawing the possession of any materials which sexually exploit children in order to protect the privacy, health and emotional welfare of children and society as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The photograph in the instant case is of a naked adolescent girl sitting on her knees on a beach with her legs separated, but not spread, and her pubic area partially visible. The focal point of the photograph is her developing breasts and, to a lesser extent, her pubic area. Her developing left breast and nipple are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>prominently displayed. The tilt of her head, the shadow line it creates, the angle of her glasses and ponytail, and her right arm align with her right nipple, drawing the viewer\u2019s attention to it. Her left hand is pointed down and over, but not touching, her pubic area, placing half of her pubic area in shadow. Her hand position draws the viewer\u2019s attention to her pubic area. The girl is staring downward. She is not smiling, nor is she otherwise engaging with the photographer. Someone who knows the girl would be readily able to identify her from the photograph. She does not appear to be posed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">All but one of the statutory requirements are undisputedly satisfied here. The defendant does not challenge that the picture of the girl was a photograph or visual depiction by computer, that he knowingly possessed the photograph, that he was knowledgeable of the content of the photograph, and that he knew or reasonably should have known that the girl depicted in the photograph was under eighteen years of age. He also does not dispute that this was a subsequent offense. The only issue is whether the photograph is lewd.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Much has been written on what it means for an image to be lewd. In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 764 (1982), the United States Supreme Court, in interpreting a statute that prohibited the \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals\u201d of a child under sixteen years of age, explained that such a statute would not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, even if the exhibition did not \u201cappeal[] to the prurient interest of the average person\u201d or was not \u201cpatently offensive.\u201d The State was free to criminalize exhibitions of children that were lewd but not obscene. <em>Id. </em>at 753. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. 840, 848 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Court have carefully explained their reasons for this special standard of solicitude for children in the context of First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ment challenges to child pornography prosecutions. \u201cThe prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 757. This \u201cinterest in \u2018safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u2019 is \u2018compelling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, supra </em>at 848, quoting from <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 756-757. Moreover, \u201c[i]n cases involving child pornography, . . . \u2018the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake,\u2019 that States may constitutionally proscribe the production\u201d or possession of a lewd photograph of children, \u201cwhether or not it depicts works of value.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 761, 763-764.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Even with this heightened standard of protection of children, nudity alone is not enough to render a photograph lewd. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 112 (1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999) <em>(Amirault). </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 715 n.17 (2002) <em>(Bean). </em>It is a \u201clewd\u201d exhibition of the genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breast that is required. In deciding whether a particular exhibition of the naked body is lewd, the courts have utilized the so-called <em>Dost</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>factors as a starting point for analysis, recognizing that they are not dispositive or comprehensive, but aids to further analysis. See <em>Bean, supra </em>at 713-714; <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 32; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2006) <em>(Frabizio). </em>Those factors are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c1. whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area;[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201c2. whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201c3. whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201c4. whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201c5. whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201c6. whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\"><em>United States </em>v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987). See <em>Frabizio, supra </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The standard of review is disputed by the parties. The Commonwealth contends that the <em>Latimore </em>standard applies because there has not been an express First Amendment challenge to the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). The defendant, relying on <em>Bean, supra </em>at 714 &amp; n.15, states that whether the photograph constitutes a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d is subject to de nova review. We agree that <em>Bean </em>establishes the standard of review of the jury\u2019s determination, and that we are required to undertake an independent review of the photographic evidence to ensure that the jury have not encroached on expression protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\"><em>Bean </em>involved a prosecution under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A, which makes it a crime for any person, acting with lascivious intent, to pose a child, knowing he or she is under eighteen years of age, in a state of nudity. The defendant, an aspiring amateur photographer, had asked a teenager to pose with her boyfriend. 435 Mass. at 709. Four of the photographs he took depicted the minor with her breast exposed. <em>Id. </em>at 711. These photographs were the \u201cprimary evidence\u201d of whether the defendant had \u201clascivious\u201d intent. <em>Id. </em>at 714-715. The court stated that in evaluating this evidence, \u201cwe determine de nova whether the photographs are themselves \u2018lascivious\u2019 or otherwise provide sufficient evidence of lascivious intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714. See <em>Amirault, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>173 F.3d at 32-33. In the course of describing the nature of this independent review, the court distinguished it from the <em>Latimore </em>standard and stressed that \u201c[t]he fact finder is in no better position to evaluate the content and significance of these photographs than an appellate court.\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 714 n.15. The court relied on a line of United States Supreme Court cases decided under the First Amendment that required an \u201cindependent appellate review of the offending material to ensure that protected speech is not infringed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714. See, e.g., <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 505 (1984) (in First Amendment cases \u201cthe Court has regularly conducted an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits\u201d). This line of cases can be traced back to a concurrence by Justice Harlan in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476 (1957), an obscenity case, in which he stated that \u201ca reviewing court must determine for itself whether the attacked expression is suppressable within constitutional standards\u201d and \u201ccan[not] escape this responsibility by saying that the trier of the facts, be it a jury or a judge, has labeled the questioned matter as \u2018obscene.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 497 (Harlan, J., concurring). Rather, the appellate court must exercise \u201cits own independent judgment upon the character of the material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. Independent review is required in the instant case \u201cbecause photographs depicting the breast or genitals of a minor have been held to be protected by the First Amendment as long as they are not lewd or lascivious . . . .\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 714-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">With these standards in mind, we evaluate the photograph at issue to determine whether it is lewd. We begin with the six <em>Dost </em>factors. The first is whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the girl\u2019s genitalia, pubic area, or breasts. As explained above, we conclude that it is. The girl\u2019s developing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>left breast and nipple are in the front and center of the photograph. The girl\u2019s left hand points the viewer to her exposed pubic area. See <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 86 (reversing decision to exclude photographs from jury\u2019s consideration as photographs \u201ccould reasonably be seen as focusing on or particularly drawing attention to the girls\u2019 pubic areas\u201d). Compare <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 33 (lighting and composition of \u201cphotograph [are] not primarily directed at the genital region\u201d). The eye of the viewer is also directed to the girl\u2019s right nipple.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The setting of the visual depiction \u2014 the beach \u2014 is not generally sexually suggestive. See <em>ibid. </em>The pose, however, is more problematic. On appeal, the Commonwealth contends that the left hand placement depicts the girl as \u201cabout to touch herself there or masturbate.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although we are not prepared to adopt that interpretation, as the girl appears just to be about to dig in the sand in front of her, the direction and curve of the left hand toward her exposed pubic area could be viewed as sexually suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The girl is nude. She is also \u201con the cusp of puberty ... of an age when girls normally are clothed even when in nature or in a stream.\u201d <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 86. She is well past the age of the \u201cCoppertone girl.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The visual depiction of the girl does not suggest sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity, although the placement of the left hand, as explained above, is problematic. Finally, as the over-all design of the visual depiction is to direct the viewer to the girl\u2019s developing breasts and pubic area, and the pose could be seen as sexually suggestive, we conclude that it is designed to elicit a sexual response.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Recognizing the limitations of the <em>Dost </em>factors, and our obligation to ensure that First Amendment expression rights are not being infringed, our independent review of the photograph has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>also included a search for signs that the photograph is not a \u201cmere snapshot!] intended to titillate potential viewers\u201d and instead constitutes a form of artistic, educational, or other personal exhibition or expression protected by the First Amendment. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass, at 715. Although an exhibition of a child\u2019s breasts and pubic area may still be lewd even if it is contained within a work that includes other protected First Amendment expression, see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 761, 763-764, and <em>Bean, supra, </em>where First Amendment rights are at issue we must approach both the lewdness determination and the suppression of the photograph with even greater circumspection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We understand that such a photograph does not have to have any level of artistic or educational value to be protected. It just needs to be not lewd. The focus of this inquiry is whether, in addition to our application of the <em>Dost </em>factors, other evidence or characteristics of the photograph indicate that it is not lewd.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In the instant case, we discern no such signs that this photograph is other than a lewd exhibition of this girl\u2019s breasts and pubic area. Nor was any expert or other testimony presented that raises questions in this regard. Compare <em>Bean, supra </em>at 715 (\u201cconsistent with the testimony of Bean\u2019s expert in art history and theory, the photographs appear intended to have an artistic quality independent of their specific subject matter\u201d). The picture was found on a Russian photograph-sharing Web site, not in a medical textbook, National Geographic pictorial, or in an art museum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 772. The photograph appears to serve no educational purpose. It displays no obvious artistic sensibilities beyond a design that focuses the viewer\u2019s attention on the girl\u2019s breasts and pubic area. There is no indication that the photograph is commenting in some fashion on other artistic works. See Adler, Inverting the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ment, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 921, 967-968 (2001). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the focus on the girl\u2019s developing breasts and pubic area distinguishes it from ordinary family photographs simply memorializing a day at the beach. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>579 F.3d 672, 684 (6th Cir. 2009), cert, denied, 130 S. Ct. 1106 (2010). If there are any expressive interests at stake in this photograph, they are de minimis. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The statutory purposes further support our conclusion that this photograph is lewd and its possession is outlawed. As the General Court stated, \u201c[T]he sexual exploitation of children constitutes a wrongful invasion of a child\u2019s right to privacy and results in social, developmental and emotional injury to such child.\u201d This girl\u2019s developing sexuality is being exploited by the taking and sharing of this revealing snapshot of her breasts and pubic area. She is on \u201cthe cusp of puberty,\u201d <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 86, at a vulnerable stage in her sexual and emotional development, and her privacy is being invaded. She is of course readily identifiable in these photographs by anyone who knows her. The picture is also circulating in public and not concealed in a family drawer, thereby compounding the victimization of the girl. See St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1 (Legislature emphasizes that all child pornography needs to be removed to protect children from invasion of privacy). The viewing of the revealing photograph amounts to a \u201ccontinuing victimization\u201d of her. St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The photograph need not capture the child engaged in sexual activity, and therefore sexual abuse, to violate the statute, as the dissent suggests. The Legislature refers to both sexual abuse and sexual exploitation. The State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting children extends to their psychological and emotional well-being as well as their physical well-being. See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 757; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass, at 848. The lewd exhibition prong of this statute in particular targets exploitation that does not involve the child engaged in sexual acts, or even simulated sexual acts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, supra </em>at 850 n.7. The exhibition of the girl\u2019s breasts and pubic area also need not be obscene to be lewd. <em>Id. </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In sum, although this is not a simple case involving, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>example, a stark close-up of a naked child\u2019s open genitalia, our independent review confirms that this is a lewd exhibition of a child\u2019s breasts and pubic area and therefore an exploitation of her developing sexuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant also challenges the judge\u2019s failure to give two jury instructions regarding the meaning of \u201clewd exhibition\u201d that he repeatedly requested at trial. Those requested instructions were that \u201cmere nudity is not enough\u201d to constitute lewd exhibition and that the defendant\u2019s \u201creaction to the photograph and why he wanted to possess it\u201d is irrelevant to whether the photograph is a lewd exhibition. Although neither instruction was given as requested, the judge did instruct that \u201cwhat [the defendant] was going to do with the material is not for you to consider . . . . It is not relevant.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 300 (2008) (\u201cIt is not necessary to give the exact words of the instruction requested by the defense\u201d). Moreover, at the close of the case, defense counsel declared that her client was \u201ccontent\u201d with the instructions that the judge ultimately gave. We conclude that there was no error in refusing to give the mere nudity instruction, and if there was an error in the second instruction, it did not rise to the level of a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The judge\u2019s instructions tracked the statutory requirements and the <em>Dost </em>factors. She informed the jury that it was for them to \u201cdecide the weight, or lack of weight to be given to any of these factors.\u201d Additionally, the judge emphasized that the factors were \u201cnot exhaustive\u201d and provided only \u201csome guidance.\u201d She further informed the jury that \u201cas far as defining lewd exhibition, the courts say that those are words that are within the ken of ordinary jurors and that they should be given the meaning that ordinarily attach to those words.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 85, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arvin, </em>900 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1024 (1991) (\u201cIndeed, \u2018[t]here is a consensus among the courts that whether the item to be judged is lewd, lascivious, or obscene is a determination that lay persons can and should make\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We discern no error in the judge\u2019s instructions, as they correctly summarize the law. Although it was within her discretion to give the additional instruction that mere nudity is not enough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>it was not required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor would that instruction have been self-explanatory. The girl\u2019s age and pose, and the focal points of the photograph, were all relevant considerations here in addition to the child\u2019s nudity. Furthermore, defense counsel clearly made the \u201cmere nudity\u201d point in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As for the other requested instruction, the judge and prosecutor were concerned that the defendant\u2019s reasons for selecting the photograph were relevant to proving that the defendant knowingly printed out and possessed the photograph. That being said, the judge could have stated more clearly that the defendant\u2019s subjective reaction to the photograph was not relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of the lewdness of the photograph itself. Regardless, even if error, it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The judge properly recited the law and the <em>Dost </em>factors, which adequately instructed the jury on the lewdness inquiry. In addition, both the Commonwealth and the defendant focused the jury\u2019s attention on the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the photograph in measuring lewdness. Cf. <em>Frabi-zio, </em>459 F.3d at 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Admission of other photographs. </em>Finally, the defendant claims reversible error based on the admission in evidence, over his objection, of a number of other photographs of children that he viewed that day at the library. The defendant contends that these photographs were improperly admitted because he did not contest his knowing possession of the photograph in question, and therefore the only issue was whether the particular photograph was lewd.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">There was, however, no stipulation regarding knowing possession of the photograph. As explained in the discussion of the integrity of the grand jury process, when originally confronted by the librarian, the defendant claimed that the picture just \u201cpopped up.\u201d Additionally, some of the photographs were of the same girl at the beach, lending some context to the photograph. The photographs were also all found in a search category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>for \u201ckids,\u201d which was relevant to whether the child was under eighteen, an issue that was contested by the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge also provided a limiting instruction, charging the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cAny other pictures that this witness is discussing and that may be put into evidence for you to see are only to be used by you to determine whether [the defendant] intended to download this particular photograph, and whether that is the absence of mistake or inadvertence, and may be used by you secondly to go to his knowledge of what he was downloading. But it. . . should not be used at all for evidence of bad character or whether the other pictures were appropriate or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A similar instruction was also given during the final jury charge at the defendant\u2019s request. We discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s admission of these photographs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Hhis was a retrial of the defendant.

The Commonwealth\u2019s argument was not so limited, as it addressed other <em>Dost </em>factors. Nor has the defendant argued on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper.

Few things are as vile as the sexual abuse of children. It is therefore understandable that we, as a society, would implement severe measures to try to prevent such abuse from occurring. But when we imprison someone for mere possession of a photograph of a naked child playing on a beach, we have lost all perspective. For the reasons detailed below, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the indictment. </em>Because the defendant effectively conceded that he had adequate notice of the relevant charges against him, I am sympathetic to the majority\u2019s efforts to find the indictment sufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After all, if the principal purpose that the indictment is designed to serve has been satis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>fled, how can there be a problem? In addition, I have no quarrel with the idea that we may rely on the caption of an indictment to help inform the substance of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Nevertheless, the indictment here was so inexcusably mangled that I remain concerned about our deeming it sufficient.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> None of the cases on which the majority relies goes this far, and I am troubled by the standards we are setting. Moreover, assuming that the caption of the indictment can be taken to supply the key missing allegation that the photograph at issue was of the sort prohibited by the statute, the indictment would still fail to allege that the defendant had specific knowledge of the \u201cnature and content\u201d of the photograph. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii). This would appear to be at odds with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palladino, </em>358 Mass. 28 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although some of Palladino\u2019s \u201cbroad language has been limited by subsequent decisions,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Militello, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 339 (2006), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that case\u2019s narrow holding still appears to stand. Perhaps the Supreme Judicial Court would reverse <em>Palladino </em>if asked to do so, but until that happens, it is our role to follow that case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>1. <em>The photograph. </em>The underlying facts are not in dispute. The debate is not over what can be seen in the photograph,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but whether it makes out a crime when measured against the relevant legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The photograph shows an unclothed girl kneeling in the sand. A \u201cflip-flop\u201d sandal lies askew in the background, and there is no dispute that the setting is a beach. Although there is no way of knowing the girl\u2019s exact age, she appears to be approximately eleven to twelve years old, as the Commonwealth maintained and as reasonable jurors could have concluded. The girl is not looking at the camera, and her gaze instead appears focused on the area of the beach immediately in front of her, where there is a small hole in the sand. Her sand-flecked arms are pointed in that direction and they appear to be reaching toward the hole. Her left hand, captured by the photograph in mid-air, and the hand\u2019s shadow obscure a view of her genitals, although the area in the immediate vicinity of her genitals can be seen. Her partially developed breasts are also plainly visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The photograph has a distinct \u201csnapshot\u201d quality to it, and the Commonwealth never argued to the jury that the girl was posed. As the prosecutor acknowledged to the jury, \u201cit seems like [the girl] is completely unaware that someone is taking her picture.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury had no information about who the girl is, what beach she was on, or who the photographer was. Thus, for example, the jury did not know if this was a vacation photograph taken by a member of the girl\u2019s family, or if it was instead surreptitiously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>captured by a stranger. The defendant downloaded the photograph from a Russian photograph-sharing Web site. That Web site does not market itself as a pornographic site, and a Commonwealth witness acknowledged that it is a publicly accessible photograph-sharing site \u2014 similar to \u201cSnapfish,\u201d \u201cFlickr,\u201d and \u201cPicasa\u201d \u2014 that included what appeared to be \u201ca lot of vacation photographs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\">2. <em>The issue in dispute. </em>The photograph found in the defendant\u2019s possession unquestionably shows the girl\u2019s \u201cunclothed . . . partially developed breast[s].\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii). It is also fair to characterize the photograph as showing her unclothed \u201cpubic area\u201d (even if the anatomical boundaries of that statutory term remain unclear).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, for there to have been a violation of \u00a7 29C(vii), the photograph must additionally rise to the level of a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d of her unclothed breasts or pubic area. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, as both the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Court have long recognized, a statute that sought to punish the portrayal of mere nudity, even of children, would be constitutionally infirm. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 112-114 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>418 Mass. 416, 423 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. 708, 711, 715 n.17 (2002) <em>(Bean). </em>The cases have long established that nudity, without more, does not establish \u201clewdness\u201d or \u201clasciviousness.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Provost, supra; Bean, supra </em>at 715 n.17; <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Arvin, </em>900 F.2d 1385, 1391 (9th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1024 (1991); <em>United States </em>v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (Amirault); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>662 F.3d 831, 843 (7th Cir. 2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 1816 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">3. <em>The </em>Dost <em>factors. </em>As the majority accurately notes, in seeking to lend substance to the meaning of lewdness (or its linguistic twin, lasciviousness), courts have often looked to the so-called <em>Dost </em>factors. See <em>ante </em>at 302-303; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dost, </em>636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 856 (1987). For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit relied on the <em>Dost </em>factors in determining that a photograph of a naked girl on a beach was not a lascivious exhibition, <em>Amirault, supra, </em>and the Supreme Judicial Court relied on them in determining that a photograph that revealed a fifteen year old girl\u2019s breast did not establish the photographer\u2019s \u201clascivious intent.\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 715-716. The photograph here is not lewd under a straightforward application of the <em>Dost </em>factors. This should hardly be surprising, because even a cursory examination of those factors and of the decades of case law applying them reveals that they are principally aimed at a particular species of lewdness not presented here: photographs of children deliberately posed in a manner or setting designed to sexualize them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, the photograph here is a candid, unposed snapshot of a girl apparently playing on a beach. \u201cWhen a photographer selects and positions his subjects, it is quite a different matter from the peeking of a voyeur upon an unaware subject pursuing activities unrelated to sex.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steen, </em>634 F.3d 822, 828 (5th Cir. 2011).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In any event, the <em>Dost </em>factors do not support a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that this photograph contains a \u201clewd exhibition.\u201d As the Supreme Judicial Court has noted, a \u201cbeach setting is [a] \u2018natural landscape\u2019 that is not generally associated with sexual activity.\u201d <em>Bean, </em>435 Mass. at 716 n.18, citing <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 33. The girl is not engaged in any sexual activity (as the prosecutor expressly acknowledged to the jury), nor is she posed to exhibit any willingness to engage in such activity. Indeed, as the prosecutor also acknowledged below, she does not appear even to be aware that her picture is being taken. Such a photograph can be considered \u201clewd\u201d under the <em>Dost </em>factors only if those factors are stretched beyond recognition. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steen, supra </em>at 827 (questioning the applicability of the <em>Dost </em>factors \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s conduct . . . proved to be no more than voyeurism\u201d); United States vs. Johnson, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 2:10-CR-71 -FtM-36DNF (M.D. Fla. June 15, 2011) (finding that images obtained by secretly recording a minor not engaged in sexual activity \u201cconstitute voyeurism and not child pornography\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">To be sure, some of the <em>Dost </em>factors are sufficiently malleable that some argument can be made that they apply. However, a closer examination of those factors demonstrates the inappropriateness of resting a determination of lewdness on them, at least in this context. A good example is the first <em>Dost </em>factor: \u201cwhether the focal point of the visual depiction is on\u201d a forbidden anatomical area. 636 F. Supp. at 832. In her closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly referenced the child\u2019s developing breasts (and, to a lesser degree, her pubic area) as the \u201cfocal point\u201d of the photograph. She made no effort to explain what made them so. The majority strives to supply what eluded the Commonwealth at trial: a critical assessment of how the visual elements that make up the snapshot\u2019s \u201cdesign\u201d objectively accentuate the girl\u2019s sexuality. But one hardly needs such analysis to explain that a viewer\u2019s gaze may well be drawn to the girl\u2019s developing breasts. To the extent that one\u2019s eyes are drawn there, that fact is neither remarkable nor of significant import. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>As the Supreme Judicial Court emphasized in <em>Bean, </em>whether a viewer sees a naked breast or other body part as the focal point of a photograph is often \u201ca subjective assessment of little value.\u201d <em>Bean, supra </em>at 716.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To some extent, a viewer\u2019s attention may be drawn to the image\u2019s portrayal of the girl\u2019s breasts in part precisely because her evolving sexuality invokes cultural taboos. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d 80, 93 (1st Cir. 2006) (Torruella, J., concurring) (\u201cThe images are jarring, more because of the cultural taboo regarding nude pictures of prepubescent girls than because of the specific portrayal of the girls\u201d). In fact, here as with the beach photograph in <em>Amirault, </em>the \u201ctruly striking aspects of the photograph [are] the girl\u2019s nakedness and her youth.\u201d 173 F.3d at 35. But \u201c[t]hese factors alone are not enough to render the photo \u2018lascivious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Also problematic is the sixth <em>Dost </em>factor, which asks \u201cwhether the photograph is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\u201d 636 F. Supp. at 832. The First Circuit has identified this factor as \u201cthe most confusing and contentious of the <em>Dost </em>factors.\u201d <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 34. Applying this factor makes some sense in the context of a prosecution against the photographer. In that context, \u201c[i]t [is] logical ... to hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the picture[] [is] \u2018a lascivious exhibition because the photographer arrayed it to suit his peculiar lust.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>546 F.3d 245, 252 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1204 (2009), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d at 1244. Even in that context, some courts have noted that the sixth factor adds little, if any, independent value to a factors-based analysis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, e.g., United States vs. Clark, U.S. Ct. App., No. 10-4520, slip op. at 4-5 (3d Cir. Nov. 22, 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1778 (2012), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villard, </em>885 F.2d 117, 125 (3d Cir. 1989) (\u201cthe sixth factor, \u2018rather than being a separate substantive inquiry about the [depictions], is useful as another way of inquiring into whether any of the other five . . . factors [is] met\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The problematic role played by the sixth factor is heightened in a possession case given that the possessor of a photograph is not necessarily the one who \u201cintended or designed\u201d the composition. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 252 (\u201cThe sixth <em>Dost </em>factor is not easily adapted to a possession case\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the underlying considerations that animate the sixth factor are relevant in a possession case, it makes little sense to try to get at these considerations by shoe-homing them into one \u201cfactor\u201d in a six-part factor-based analysis. Put differently, the test of time has demonstrated that the <em>Dost </em>factors cannot bear the full analytical weight that has at times been placed on them. Rather than treating the <em>Dost </em>factors as providing the overarching doctrinal framework under which lewdness issues should be analyzed, it makes far more sense to treat them as helpful considerations especially designed to ferret out a particular type of lewdness not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">4. <em>Otherwise lewd. </em>Of course, a photograph that is not lewd under the <em>Dost </em>factors may still be lewd for other reasons. See <em>United States </em>v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d at 87 (sharply criticizing a District Court judge for resting on an \u201cunqualified application\u201d of the <em>Dost </em>factors and for failing to consider whether the beach photographs at issue there could be considered lascivious for other reasons). In <em>Frabizio, </em>the First Circuit emphasized that the <em>Dost </em>factors were never intended to be exclusive, and it aptly pointed out that, in upholding the original use of these factors, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit described them as \u201cover-generous to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>812 F.2d at 1244. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steen, </em>634 F.3d at 829 (Higginbotham, 1, concurring) <em>(Dost </em>\u201cfactors often create more confusion than clarity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Such observations are well taken as far as they go; while <em>Dost </em>was a well-meaning effort to lend some objectivity to the elusive question where the boundary between mere nudity and lewdness lies, its many shortcomings have been well documented.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, once one leaves the <em>Dost </em>factors behind, the question remains: against what standard should \u201clewdness\u201d be assessed? In the context of considering the analogous Federal statute, the First Circuit flatly declined to address this question, commenting that lasciviousness \u201cneeds no adornment.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 85-86 &amp; n.9.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial judge in this case followed this hands-off approach,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as does the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">This approach is untenable. One cannot hope to address whether a visual image of a naked child is \u201clewd\u201d without knowing what it means for something to be \u201clewd.\u201d Appellate courts have a responsibility to provide clarity on what demarcates the boundary between the exercise of free expression and a lengthy prison term.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Failing to provide such guidance threatens to leave the issue to unbridled subjectivity in an area ruled by emotions. That in turn raises both First Amendment and due process concerns. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. 840, 850 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977) (\u201cIt is well established that due process requires criminal statutes that are not \u2018sufficiently explicit to give clear warning as to proscribed activities\u2019 to be declared unconstitutional. . . . Prohibited imprecision includes ambiguity in the terms of a criminal statute, especially one implicating the right to freedom of expression, that might give rise to arbitrary enforcement\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Simply put, someone charged with the heinous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>crime of possessing child pornography is entitled to something more than a \u201ctrial by Rorschach test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">5. <em>What makes something \u201clewd\u201d? A </em>visual image of a naked child cannot be considered a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d unless it presents the child in an overtly \u201csexualized\u201d manner that is tantamount to sexual abuse or exploitation of the child.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As discussed below, at least three sources support that conclusion. I begin with the statute\u2019s stated purpose.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u201cThe Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute could not be clearer: \u2018[T]o protect children from sexual exploitation . . . [by] prohibiting] the production of material which involves or is derived from such exploitation and to exclude all such material from the channels of trade and commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>449 Mass. at 853, quoting from St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1(1). Moreover, with regard to the criminalization of the mere possession of child pornography, \u201cthe Legislature enacted G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, in recognition that the \u2018mere possession or control of any sexually exploitative material results in continuing victimization of children [because] such material is a permanent record of an act or acts of sexual abuse or exploitation of a child and that each time such material is viewed the child is harmed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 1(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">That G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, criminalizes behavior that amounts to the \u201csexual exploitation\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d of children is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>reinforced by the fact that it is this critical governmental interest that allows a direct content-based restriction on speech. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, the production of child pornography may be criminalized because that production \u201cis itself the crime of child abuse.\u201d <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech </em>Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 254 (2002). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>130 S. Ct. 1577, 1586 (2010), citing <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 759 (States have \u201ca compelling interest in protecting children from abuse,\u201d and child pornography constitutes a permanent record of that abuse).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cThe production of the work, not its content,\u201d is the target of valid child pornography statutes. <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, supra </em>at 249.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The dissemination of child pornography may also be criminalized, but that is because it provides \u201can economic motive for and [is] thus an integral part of the production of such materials.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra </em>at 761. In turn, in order to prevent the abuse inherent in the production of child pornography, States may even seek to \u201cstamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain\u201d by criminalizing its mere possession. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 110 (1990). Contrast <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557 (1969) (holding that the State may not criminalize mere possession of obscenity).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">A necessary corollary is that \u201cwhere the speech is neither obscene nor the product of sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, supra </em>at 251, citing <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 764-765. In other words, the class of speech that constitutionally may be restricted is limited to those images whose suppression actually advances the State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing the sexual abuse of children \u2014 namely, images whose production involved the sexual abuse or exploitation of actual children. See <em>id. </em>at 252-254. To the extent that a prohibition on possessing images of naked children fails to further such interests, it is unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 254, 256 (\u201cvirtual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>child pornography\u201d that does not depict actual children may not be criminalized).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Finally, insight can be drawn from the principle of ejusdem generis. \u201cWhen elements are listed in a series, the rules of statutory construction require the general phrase to be construed as restricted to elements similar to the specific elements listed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Zubiel, 456 Mass. 27, 31 (2010). The reference in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C(vii), to \u201clewd exhibition[s]\u201d appears at the end of a list of specific sexual acts that children cannot be shown doing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This strongly suggests that for a visual depiction of a naked child to rise to the level of a \u201clewd exhibition,\u201d it has to sexually exploit the child in a manner akin to that done by a photograph of the child engaged in the prohibited sex acts listed in the prior six subsections. It follows that, at a minimum, the photograph must \u201csexualize\u201d its portrayal of the child\u2019s nudity in some material way. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wallenfang, </em>568 F.3d 649, 657 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 130 S. Ct. 566 (2009), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kemmerling, </em>285 F.3d 644, 646 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 860 (2002) (\u201cA picture is \u2018lascivious\u2019 only if it is sexual in nature\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">6. <em>Is this photograph \u201clewd\u201d?</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the prosecutor affirmatively conceded below, \u201cthere is certainly no sexual activity in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>picture.\u201d In contending that the photograph is nevertheless lewd, the Commonwealth now focuses especially on the proximity of the girl\u2019s left hand to her pubic area. Although no one can say with certainty what exactly the girl is doing with her hands, she appears to be playing in the sand (as the majority acknowledges). However, according to the Commonwealth, the happenstance of where the girl\u2019s hand ended up frozen in time allowed a viewer to fantasize about the girl masturbating.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In other words, the Commonwealth\u2019s new theory is that the photograph is accidentally lewd. The majority appears to accept this argument, concluding that \u201cthe direction and curve of the left hand toward [the girl\u2019s] exposed pubic area could be viewed as sexually suggestive.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Perhaps this defendant selected the photograph for the very reason that the Commonwealth now highlights. However, whether the defendant found this photograph lewd is not the test. \u201cIf [the defendant\u2019s] subjective reaction were relevant, a sexual deviant\u2019s quirks could turn a Sears catalog into pornography.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Amirault, </em>173 F.3d at 34. How a platonic observer would view the placement of the hand is somewhat imponderable. Some reasonable viewers will view the girl\u2019s hand simply in motion on its way to (or back from) the hole in the sand in front of her. Other reasonable viewers will no doubt agree with the majority\u2019s view that the placement of the hand \u201ccould be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>viewed as sexually suggestive.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 305. However, the applicable test is whether the photograph sexualizes its portrayal of the girl\u2019s nudity in an objective and sufficiently material way to warrant a criminal conviction merely for possessing it. While the photograph need not be \u201cobscene\u201d (at least in the sense that that word is used in the context of adult pornography), it still has to be so noxious that one commits a felony merely by holding the photograph in one\u2019s hand. This photograph does not come even close to meeting that test. Indeed, it is not clear how any photograph that is at most subtly sexually suggestive could ever be deemed \u201clewd\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This conclusion does not undercut the purposes that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, was enacted to serve. The photograph cannot fairly be described as a permanent record of the girl being subjected to sexual abuse or exploitation; rather, it is a permanent record of her playing in the sand.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Of course, this is not to say that the girl expected or desired that her photograph would be taken that day on the beach, and needless to say, she might well be mortified if she knew that this photograph were available on the Internet. But the question before us is not whether whoever took the photograph (or placed it on the photograph-sharing Web site) broke the law in whatever jurisdiction this occurred. Nor is it whether the girl might have other remedies to address the invasion of her privacy. The question instead is whether the harm inflicted by the continued existence of the photograph is so substantial as to support treating its mere possession as a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">7. <em>The majority\u2019s methodology. </em>Some additional comment is warranted as to the methodology through which the majority determined the evidence sufficient. After having preliminarily determined that the photograph is \u201clewd,\u201d the majority goes on to examine whether \u201cother evidence or characteristics of the photograph indicate that it is not lewd.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 306. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>cally, the majority examines whether the photograph \u201cconstitutes a form of artistic, educational, or other personal exhibition or expression protected by the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>Finding such content lacking, the majority suggests that First Amendment values have been protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The majority\u2019s mode of analysis is problematic. Whether an image has artistic or other social value is irrelevant to the question whether it may constitutionally be proscribed as \u201cchild pornography.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If a photograph truly constitutes a \u201clewd exhibition\u201d of a naked child, then it thereby falls outside First Amendment protection, and no amount of redeeming social content can protect it. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 773. <em>Id. </em>at 774-775 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). This makes sense. If a visual image involves a child\u2019s having been subjected to sexual abuse or exploitation, then whether there might be artistic or scientific value in the image is beside the point. <em>Id. </em>at 761, quoting from Memorandum of Assemblyman Lasher in support of N.Y. Penal Law, Art. 263, \u00a7 263.15 (\u201cIt is irrelevant to the child [who has been abused] whether or not the material . . . has a literary, artistic, political or social value\u201d).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">By the same token, a judicial determination that a work <em>lacks </em>any redeeming value cannot justify a less rigorous inquiry into whether that work qualifies as child pornography. There is no sliding scale upon which a work deemed less valuable or artistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>is therefore more likely to be lewd than a more valuable work containing the same objective depiction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Judges are in any event ill-equipped to make such a determination. See, e.g., <em>Bleistein </em>v. <em>Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>188 U.S. 239, 251 (1903) (\u201cIt would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits\u201d); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>481 U.S. 497, 505 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cFor the law courts to decide \u2018What is Beauty\u2019 is a novelty even by today\u2019s standards\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Rather than judging the value of the work at issue, it is the role of the courts to guard the boundaries of free expression, permitting speech to be suppressed based upon its content only if it falls within one of the \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited classes\u201d that lie outside the First Amendment\u2019s protection. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>130 S. Ct. at 1584, quoting from <em>Chap-linsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571 (1942). Speech that fits comfortably within accepted social norms requires little judicial enforcement of First Amendment protections. Instead, the need for judicial intervention is implicated where the expression the government is challenging is unpopular or offensive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cIndeed, \u2018the point of all speech protection . . . is to shield just those choices of content that in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>131 S. Ct. 1207, 1219 (2011), quoting from <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., </em>515 U.S. 557, 574 (1995). While judges have an important role in making an independent review whether the expression at issue has crossed the boundary into unprotected speech, if that boundary has not been crossed, then judges have no proper role in determining whether particular speech merits protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The need for an independent judicial role is particularly acute in cases where the expression at issue involves a photograph of a naked child. Even where the child is not engaged in any of the sex acts specifically prohibited by the statute, and even though \u201cmere nudity\u201d is not (indeed, cannot be) prohibited by the statute, many members of the public would no doubt find any portrayal of a child\u2019s nakedness offensive (particularly where, as here, it depicts an adolescent\u2019s budding sexuality).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> That becomes increasingly likely to the extent one considers the possessor\u2019s motives for acquiring such a photograph. Given that the defendant had no other obvious reason for downloading the photograph, the jury readily could have inferred that he derived sexual excitement from it.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Indeed, defense counsel came close to conceding the point when she acknowledged to the jury that they probably found her client\u2019s conduct \u201cweird\u201d and that it \u201cprobably makes you uncomfortable.\u201d An adult\u2019s sexual attraction toward young children is highly disturbing. Needless to say, when an individual actively pursues such urges to the point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>crossing the boundary into objectively criminal behavior that exploits children, such conduct can and should warrant severe criminal sanctions. However, where the individual has not crossed that line, there is a risk that a jury will nevertheless seek to punish him or her based on the revulsion they feel for what is inside his or her head. Cf. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 566 (1969) (recognizing that the government \u201ccannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person\u2019s private thoughts\u201d). In this area perhaps more than in any other, \u201ca jury is \u2018unlikely to be neutral with respect to the content of [the] speech,\u2019 posing \u2018a real danger of becoming an instrument for the suppression of . . . unpleasant\u2019 expression.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>131 S. Ct. at 1219, quoting from <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 510 (1984). It is the responsibility of judges to try to ensure that this does not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">C. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Even if the evidence had been sufficient, the jury instructions were wholly inadequate. Notably, the principal theory of lewdness that the Commonwealth presented to the jury was that a photograph that shows an adolescent girl in a state of nudity is for that reason lewd. Specifically, the prosecutor urged the jurors to ignore \u201c[w]hat is acceptable or appropriate somewhere else,\u201d and to focus their attention on the question: \u201cDoesn\u2019t a child reach an age where her nakedness is private?\u201d According to the prosecutor, the girl \u201cis too old to be depicted in a picture with her developing breasts and her pubic area on display,\u201d and \u201cgiven the age of this girl and her physical development and the nakedness of her breasts and her pubic area in this picture, isn\u2019t that what makes this lewd?\u201d In this manner, the Commonwealth urged the jury to convict the defendant on a theory that is untenable on both statutory and constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s closing and specifically requested a curative instruction that nudity alone cannot make a photograph \u201clewd.\u201d When the judge declined to provide such an instruction, the defendant specifically objected to its absence. Because the principle that mere nudity is insufficient is well established by the case law, the requested instruction should have been given.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Regardless of whether the defendant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>end waived the issue (through his counsel\u2019s stating that she was \u201ccontent\u201d with the instructions), the absence of adequate instruction on lewdness created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Indeed, the import of the inadequate instruction is self-evident given that the Commonwealth urged the jury to conclude that mere nudity of an adolescent girl was by itself sufficient. In my view, it is not only possible, but likely that adequate instruction would have made a difference here.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> And that leaves aside the separate problem, recognized by the majority, that \u201cthe judge could have stated more clearly that the defendant\u2019s subjective reaction to the photograph was not relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of the lewdness of the photograph itself.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">D. <em>Introduction of the other photographs. </em>Finally, while I agree with the majority that the judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing in evidence the other images that the defendant viewed, I arrive at that conclusion by a different route. There is little merit to the Commonwealth\u2019s protests about its need to use the other photographs, and its entitlement to do so.

The Ohio Supreme Court had ruled that only \u201clewd exhibitions\u201d or those that had a \u201cgraphic focus\u201d on the child\u2019s genitalia could be subject to prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 113.

In dissent, in reference to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cgraphic focus\u201d language, Justice Brennan emphasized: \u201cNot only is this factor dependent on the perspective and idiosyncrasies of the observer, it is also unconnected to whether the material at issue merits constitutional protection.

However, the omission of the sixth factor from the definition of \u201clascivious intent\u201d appears to reflect the Legislature\u2019s recognition that the sixth <em>Dost </em>factor largely duplicates the overarching inquiry into whether a photographer acted with \u201clascivious intent\u201d in producing a photograph.

In such cases, \u201c[providing triers of fact with a general description of the type of communication whose content is unworthy of protection has not, in and of itself, served sufficiently to narrow the category, nor served to eliminate the danger that decisions by triers of fact may inhibit the expression of protected ideas.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frabizio, </em>459 F.3d at 94 (Torruella, J., concurring) (criticizing the majority opinion for not providing further guidance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The judge told the jury that \u201cas far as defining lewd exhibition, the courts say those are words that are within the ken of ordinary jurors and that they should be given the meaning that ordinarily attach to those words.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Here, having been convicted on a prior occasion of ten counts of the same or similar charges, the defendant received a mandatory prison sentence of ten to fifteen years (to be served concurrently with a sentence he was already serving).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney </em>upheld G.

Compare G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A, with G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C. Thus, whether the photographer was pursuing artistic aims was directly relevant to the court\u2019s analysis. Significantly, a photographer may be convicted under \u00a7 29A for posing a minor in a state of nudity even if the photographs produced are indisputably <em>not </em>child pornography, and would therefore be legal to possess. <em>Oakes II, </em>407 Mass, at 97-98 &amp; n.8. It is also undoubtedly the case that a photographer, though not acting with lascivious intent (and thus not subject to prosecution under \u00a7 29A), could nevertheless produce photographs which would fall outside the First Amendment\u2019s protection.

Although the judge did not provide the defendant his requested \u201cmere nudity is not enough\u201d instruction in the first trial either, she did instruct the first jury that whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was appropriate \u201chas no place here,\u201d because \u201cthe fact that it\u2019s inappropriate does not alone or necessarily mean it violates the statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Although there was no stipulation to that effect, defense counsel informed the jury during her opening statement that the defendant was not contesting possession, and she stuck by that statement throughout the trial (as she did in the first trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Most of the photographs are other candid snapshots of people at beaches, some walking along or lying on the sand, some in the water. The people, most but not all of whom are naked, include adults, children, and people of indeterminate age (either because their backs are to the camera or the photograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>is too blurry). In the setting of a nude beach, it is hardly \u201cunnatural\u201d for a child to be nude, regardless of whether the child passes the majority\u2019s new \u201cCoppertone-age\u201d test. At least one of the additional beach photographs shows the same girl depicted in the photograph for which the defendant was charged. This second photograph reinforces the candid, snapshot quality of the first. A second naked child, a toddler, has wandered into the camera\u2019s field of view, and a portion of a leg of someone lying in the sand can also be seen. To the extent that the majority suggests that the girl is trying to shield her breasts from the photographer in that second photograph, this is belied by the positioning of her forearm and the fact that her fingers are spread apart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">I also note that the defendant did not move to bifurcate resolution of the question whether the photograph was lewd from that of whether he knowingly possessed it. Having the jury initially consider whether the photograph was lewd would have presented an obvious means of allowing that issue to be tried without any extraneous considerations presented to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
