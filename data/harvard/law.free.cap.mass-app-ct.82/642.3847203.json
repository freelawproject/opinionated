At issue in this appeal is the application of the \u201cmajor cause\u201d standard of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), when an industrial injury combines with a noncompensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>preexisting condition to cause the employee\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the self-insurer claims that (1) the board\u2019s decision, which failed to treat the impartial medical examiner\u2019s opinion on causation as binding in the absence of any countervailing medical evidence, was arbitrary and capricious, and (2) the board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201ca major . . . cause\u201d was contrary to law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The employee was fifty-five years old at the time of the 2010 hearing before the administrative judge. He had worked his entire career for the self-insurer and its predecessors. During the prior seventeen years, he had worked as a pipefitter, which involved heavy physical labor. On December 29, 2008, while working overhead with two wrenches to repair a gas leak, the employee felt a \u201cpop\u201d in the back of his neck. Although he had experienced neck pain before, this pain was different, radiating down his right arm and much worse than the pain he had experienced in the past; he also experienced numbness in the arm. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) examination of his cervical spine revealed extensive degenerative disc disease and disc degeneration at multiple levels, with osteophyte formation, facet changes, and impingement of the thecal sac at the C4, C5, and C6 vertebrae, primarily on the right side. Surgery eventually provided relief, and the employee returned to work on a full duty basis on February 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">An impartial medical exam was performed by Dr. Nabil Basta pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. He diagnosed a cervical strain and aggravation of preexisting cervical spondylosis. Dr. Basta opined that the work injury was responsible for forty percent of the employee\u2019s disability and sixty percent was attributable to the employee\u2019s preexisting degenerative condition. His written report concluded that the work injury was not a \u201cmajor cause\u201d of the employee\u2019s disability or surgery, but only a \u201cminor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>component.\u201d Dr. Basta\u2019s conclusion, as he later explained at his deposition, was based on his belief that to be a \u201cmajor cause,\u201d the work injury must account for more than fifty percent of the disability. The administrative judge, who had no other medical expert testimony before him, adopted the medical findings in Dr. Basta\u2019s report, but concluded that the doctor used an improper legal standard in reaching his conclusion that the injury was not a \u201cmajor cause.\u201d The administrative judge found and ruled, based on all the evidence before him, that forty percent \u201cis sufficient to be a major cause of the employee\u2019s disability and need for treatment.\u201d The self-insurer appealed to the reviewing board, which affirmed in a written decision that is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court has summarized the guiding principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cAn aggrieved party may seek judicial review of a decision of the board concerning workers\u2019 compensation benefits. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2). As specified in. . . \u00a7 12(2), we review the board\u2019s decision in accordance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(d), (/), and (g). <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1994). Pursuant to these statutory standards, we may reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision when it is \u2018[i]n violation of constitutional provisions,\u2019 \u2018[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency,\u2019 \u2018[bjased upon an error of law,\u2019 \u2018[mjade upon unlawful procedure,\u2019 \u2018[Unwarranted by facts found . . . where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact,\u2019 or is \u2018[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(&lt;7), (/), and (g). Under these standards, in determining whether the board properly affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s findings, we consider \u2018whether the decision is factually warranted and not \u201c[arbitrary or capricious,\u201d in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making.\u2019 <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 258. . . . Where a statute is involved, \u2018[ajlthough \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), ultimately the \u201cduty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u201d <em>Slater\u2019s Case, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330 (2002).\u2019 <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Carpenter\u2019s Case, </em>456 Mass. 436, 439 (2010). In addition, we \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. See <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 427 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The self-insurer claims that the board\u2019s decision, which failed to defer to Dr. Basta\u2019s opinion on causation, was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree. \u201cFindings of fact, assessments of credibility, and determinations of the weight to be given the evidence are the exclusive function of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>Pilon\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 169 (2007). Dr. Basta opined that because the work injury was responsible for only forty percent of the employee\u2019s disability while sixty percent was attributable to the employee\u2019s preexisting degenerative condition that was not job-related, the work injury was not a \u201cmajor cause\u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A). The administrative judge was under no obligation to adopt all of Dr. Basta\u2019s opinion, especially because (as we discuss below) his conclusion was based on a legal misunderstanding of what qualifies as a \u201cmajor cause.\u201d See <em>Clarici\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 495, 497 (1960) (single member and reviewing board free to adopt any portions of medical testimony they deem credible). In other words, as the board stated, it was not within the purview of the impartial medical examiner to define the legal scope of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A). As the board determined, in light of Dr. Basta\u2019s misunderstanding of the meaning of \u201cmajor cause,\u201d the administrative judge, who applied the correct standard to Dr. Basta\u2019s assessment of the work injury as a forty percent cause, was warranted in concluding that the employee had met his burden of proof under \u00a7 1(7A). Indeed, where there are two identified causes of an employee\u2019s disability, a forty percent cause may be a \u201cmajor cause.\u201d As such, the board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The self-insurer also claims that the board\u2019s interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the phrase \u201cmajor cause\u201d was contrary to law. More specifically, the self-insurer claims that the board\u2019s conclusion that a \u201cmajor cause\u201d can be less of a factor than the most important cause was erroneous and inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In interpreting a statute, we look first to its language as \u201cthe principal source of insight into legislative intent.\u201d <em>Water Dept. of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. </em>Protection, 455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting from <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>453 Mass. 135, 142 (2009). Where the meaning of the language is plain and unambiguous, we will not look to extrinsic evidence of legislative intent \u201cunless a literal construction would yield an absurd or unworkable result.\u201d <em>Boston Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 162 (2010) (interpreting G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7[a], which was later amended by St. 2011, c. 198, \u00a7 1). See <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 630 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Section 1(7A) of c. 152, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cIf a compensable injury or disease combines with a preexisting condition, which resulted from an injury or disease not compensable under this chapter, to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the resultant condition shall be compensable only to the extent such compensable injury or disease remains a major but not necessarily predominant cause of disability or need for treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">This provision of c. 152 \u201cimposes a heightened proof of causation on an employee who claims benefits in a situation where the claimed injury may be owing to a resultant condition arising from a combination of injuries, the claimed compensable injury and a prior noncompensable injury. In those instances where the statute applies, as part of his proof of causation the employee must prove that the \u2018compensable injury or disease remains <em>a major but not necessarily predominant cause </em>of disability or need for treatment.\u2019 G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>MacDonald\u2019s Case, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 659 (2009). The emphasized language of \u00a7 1(7A) is clear: \u201ca major . . . cause\u201d need not be <em>the </em>\u201cmajor . . . cause.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Mandell, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (2004), quoting from <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996) (\u201c[Wjhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent\u201d). The Legislature\u2019s choice of the article \u201ca,\u201d rather than \u201cthe,\u201d to precede \u201cmajor . . . cause\u201d implies that there may be more than one major cause. See <em>May\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 212 (2006). In addition, the accompanying language (\u201cbut not necessarily predominant\u201d) makes it explicit that a major cause need not be the superior or greatest cause, i.e., one that is more than fifty percent of the cause of the disability. If we were to adopt the self-insurer\u2019s interpretation that a major cause cannot be less than the most important cause, we would render meaningless the Legislature\u2019s choice of articles as well as the explicit caveat regarding predominance. This we cannot do. See <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass, at 628 (\u201cWe give effect to each word and phrase in a statute, and seek to avoid an interpretation that treats some words as meaningless\u201d). There was no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In such cases the statute, quoted more fully <em>infra, </em>provides that \u201cthe resultant condition shall be compensable only to the extent [the] compensable injury or disease remains <em>a major </em>but not necessarily predominant <em>cause </em>of disability or need for treatment\u201d (emphases supplied). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14. This part of the statute is also known as the \u201ccombination injury\u201d provision. See <em>Carpenter\u2019s Case, </em>456 Mass. 436, 438 n.3 (2010); <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 117 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Relying on selected parts of Dr. Basta\u2019s deposition testimony, the self-insurer also argues that \u201cthere was no medical evidence ... to support a finding of anything more than a simple aggravation\u201d of the employee\u2019s preexisting condition. The argument is without merit. The administrative judge quite evidently did not credit this portion of the testimony, as was his prerogative. The remaining evidence, including the written report, amply supported his findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
