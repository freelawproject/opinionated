Vickery, was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the trial judge erred in not questioning each potential juror individually as to whether the juror was a victim of sexual abuse during childhood; and (2) the trial judge\u2019s comments to jurors deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\"><em>Individual voir dire. </em>\u201cGeneral Laws c. 234, \u00a7 28,. . . requires a trial judge to question prospective jurors individually when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>appears that their impartiality may be affected by extraneous issues.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 355 (1994). The Supreme Judicial Court has required judges, when requested, to \u201cinterrogate individually each prospective juror as to whether the juror has been a victim of a childhood sexual offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353. Broad discretion is reserved for the trial judge \u201cin determining what questions to ask potential jurors on this sensitive issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. The acquiescence of defense counsel to actions taken by the trial judge can constitute a waiver of any objection to the judge\u2019s actions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franchino, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 371-372 (2004) (failure to renew objection to jury charge amounted to waiver); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fling, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 232, 236 (2006) (agreement to frequent continuances).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Here, on both days of the jury selection, the judge asked the entire venire the question at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Everyone who affirmatively responded or wished to privately discuss his or her answer with the judge was told to form a line for individual questioning at sidebar. Juror no. 13 joined this line and spoke with the judge, who then instructed her to return to her seat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Following the questioning of the potential jurors who had raised their hands, the judge explained to all the jurors that the process would begin again and that he would question them individually because \u201cwe do everything twice in cases like this.\u201d At sidebar, the judge asked the complete question at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to all but two of the eventually-seated jurors. Specifically, jurors no. 3 and no. 13 were not asked whether they themselves had been the victims of a sexual offense. However, in context, it is clear that the subject was adequately explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In the second round of questioning, juror no. 3 was called to sidebar for the first time and questioned by the judge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">The court: \u201cHi, sir. I know you didn\u2019t raise your hand and [indiscernible . . . low audio at side bar], I have to ask some other questions ... Is there anything about these allegations that would cause you to not be fair and impartial?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWs\">Juror: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOP\">The court: \u201cNobody in your family or close relative or friend has ever been involved in a case like this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARr\">Juror: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8k\">The court: \u201cYou don\u2019t have strong feelings about cases like this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akr\">Juror: \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ1\">The court: \u201cAlright. Well, that\u2019s [indiscernible]. And you think you\u2019d be able to determine the facts based solely on a fair consideration of the evidence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyV\">Juror: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Juror no. 13, who had spoken with the judge previously, was asked a series of questions during the second round of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">The court: \u201cNow, I have to ask questions that [indiscernible] before, [indiscernible] but is there anything about these allegations that would affect your ability to give the Defendant a fair trial?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">Juror: \u201c[Indiscernible.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The court: \u201cHas anybody in your family, a close relative, or friend, [indiscernible] the victim or accused of a sexual assault?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">Juror: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">The court: \u201cYou think you\u2019d be able to determine the facts in this case based solely on a fair consideration of the evidence and nothing but?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Juror: \u201c[Indiscernible.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">The court: \u201cOkay. You can have a seat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">It was acknowledged at sidebar that neither of these two jurors raised a hand to any questions, including the key one. In addition, both of those jurors were asked whether they had friends or family who were victims of abuse. This question, along with the earlier one to the venire, provided them the opportunity to disclose personal abuse. It is difficult to believe, under these circumstances, that when asked whether anyone in one\u2019s family had been the victim of sexual abuse, a potential juror would not believe that he or she was not included, especially when that very question was earlier asked. In speaking with the jurors at sidebar, the judge was in a unique position to discern any discomfort or hesitancy. Furthermore, throughout the selection process, the defendant had numerous opportunities to bring the oversight to the judge\u2019s attention but failed to do so. By failing to act, the defendant waived any objection to the judge\u2019s voir dire procedure, and understandably so. Our reading of the record indicates that the issue was adequately addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\"><em>Judge\u2019s comments. </em>The defendant argues that the judge deprived him of a fair and impartial trial by making two comments, one to a juror during the selection process and the other during a preliminary jury instruction. Such comments are viewed in context and in their entirety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>426 Mass. 692, 701 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 250, 252-253 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">At sidebar, the judge discussed with a potential juror concerns about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial. Even if the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>comment to the juror in this instance could be considered troublesome, which we do not conclude, it occurred at sidebar and was made to a juror who was ultimately excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The defendant also claims error when the judge told the jury: \u201cA couple of things I have to tell you, some of which may sound ridiculous, and, frankly, they are a little bit, but I\u2019m required to tell you this. Don\u2019t hear anything about this on the radio . . . .\u201d The judge went on to mention newspapers and television, and concluded, \u201cI\u2019m not at all worried about that.\u201d Viewed in context, while arguably better left unsaid, it is difficult to see this as anything other than an inartful expression of the judge\u2019s opinion of the unlikelihood of jurors hearing about the trial in the media. The defendant has provided no evidence that the judge\u2019s comment constituted bias or misled the jury or, in fact, was anything other than ultimately accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u201c[H]as any juror or anyone you\u2019re close to, ever been the victim of a sexual assault, including such assault when they, or you, or anybody you know, were a child?

You can still get [in] line and we\u2019ll take care of the answers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The sidebar questioning of juror no. 13 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">The court: \u201cAnd, ma\u2019am, which question or questions did you answer yes to?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">Juror: \u201cNone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">The court: \u201cAlright.
