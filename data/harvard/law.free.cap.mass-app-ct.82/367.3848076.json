(Shriver), employs and places professional nurses in the homes of patients for the delivery of skilled care. From June of 2003 to March of 2009, Shriver employed Renne Milinazzo, a licensed practical nurse. It then terminated her. She applied to the Division of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) for benefits. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 24. Shriver opposed the application. At the conclusion of the DUA\u2019s adjudicatory process, its board of review (board) awarded her benefits. Shriver appealed to the District Court. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. A judge of that court entered judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>pleadings in favor of the DUA and Milinazzo. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). For the following reasons we reverse and order the entry of judgment in favor of Shriver.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Facts. </em>The material facts emerging from the adjudication by the DUA are undisputed. Throughout her employment with Shriver, Milinazzo worked full time as an overnight monitor for a boy with cerebral palsy. He breathed through a ventilator and required care twenty-four hours per day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2009, the boy was eleven years old. Milinazzo\u2019s shift at his family home extended from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. From a separate room in the house, she observed the patient by closed circuit television. If a problem arose with the ventilator equipment and the boy required assistance, such as suctioning or clearing out the breathing tube, an alarm would sound. Even before an alarm sounded, an observing nurse could detect changes in a patient\u2019s condition and the need for an intervention. Milinazzo\u2019s observation room contained a couch. To make her more comfortable during the shift, the boy\u2019s father provided her with a blanket and a pillow.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Shriver\u2019s employee manual contained a list of \u201cserious violations\u201d exposing a worker to \u201cimmediate termination.\u201d It included \u201csleeping on the job.\u201d Milinazzo had read the manual and signed an acknowledgment of her understanding of its provisions on various dates, most recently on March 4, 2008. She testified that she knew that sleeping on the job would not allow her \u201cto do [her] nursing duties and take care of the child to the best of [her] ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">On August 11, 2008, Milinazzo fell asleep during her shift. The boy\u2019s mother learned of the incident but did not report it to Shriver. Then, on February 27, 2009, Milinazzo again fell asleep on duty. The mother again did not report the incident to Shriver at the time of its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">On March 6, 2009, Milinazzo posted a comment on a social networking Web site, creating an inference that the patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>family was treating her shabbily. The mother saw the post and reported it to Shriver on March 9, 2009. At the same time she reported both sleeping incidents to Shriver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Milinazzo met with Shriver personnel to discuss the mother\u2019s complaints and admitted to the occurrences. Shriver offered her the choice of termination or resignation; she chose to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Milinazzo then applied for unemployment benefits from the DUA. It first disqualified her from eligibility on the ground that she had left employment voluntarily. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(1). She appealed. A review examiner conducted a hearing, made findings, and reversed the disqualification. The examiner found that Milinazzo had not left employment voluntarily within the meaning of \u00a7 25(e)(1), but rather that Shriver had coerced her resignation so as to make it involuntary, and so as to require for disqualification a fault-based ground under \u00a7 25(e)(2). In pertinent part, \u00a7 25(e)(2), as appearing in St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19, disqualifies an applicant from unemployment benefits if she left her employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cby discharge shown to the satisfaction of the [DUA] by substantial and credible evidence to be attributable to deliberate misconduct and wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, or to a knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The review examiner determined that Shriver had failed to establish \u201cdeliberate misconduct which would allow it to terminate [Milinazzo\u2019s] employment and disqualify her from benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Shriver next appealed to the board. After a remand to the review examiner for additional findings, the board affirmed the determination of eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In accordance with G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, Shriver sought judicial review in the District Court under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). A judge affirmed the DUA decision without opinion or explanation. Shriver has timely appealed to this court. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>Analysis. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The fundamental purpose of the statutory program of unemployment assistance is \u201cto afford benefits to persons who are out of work and unable to secure work through no fault of their own.\u201d <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>333 Mass. 244, 248 (1955). The statute calls for a liberal construction \u201cin aid of its purpose.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 74, as appearing in St. 1990, c. 177, \u00a7 340. If an employer disputes the eligibility for benefits of a discharged employee, the issue is not the validity of the grounds for discharge, but rather the qualification of the former employee for assistance in the entire circumstances of the discharge. <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 809 (1996). The grounds for disqualification prescribed in c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), constitute exceptions to eligibility; the burden of proof of either \u201cwilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, or [of] a knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer\u201d rests upon the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 807-808. The statute subjects the final eligibility decision of the DUA to judicial review under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. In this instance Shriver challenges the DUA determination as an error of law, a finding unsupported by substantial evidence, and a disposition arbitrary, capricious, and abusive of discretion within the meanings of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), <em>(e), </em>and <em>(g), </em>respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">2. <em>DUA reasoning. </em>Upon the facts undisputed by the parties, the board rejected Shriver\u2019s challenge to Milinazzo\u2019s eligibility with the following rationale.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cAlthough the claimant\u2019s sleeping on the job twice clearly violated the employer\u2019s policy and expectation, we conclude that the employer\u2019s client \u2014 the child\u2019s mother \u2014 had condoned the claimant\u2019s sleeping on the job. The mother waited seven months after the first incident and an entire week after the second incident to complain to the employer. However, because the mother did not complain until she read the claimant\u2019s Facebook posting, her complaints were seemingly not motivated by the claimant\u2019s sleeping on the job. After sleeping twice on duty, the claimant still had no reason to believe that the mother would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>report her misconduct, particularly when the clients had provided a pillow and blanket to accommodate the claimant. She thus lacked the requisite intent to violate the employer\u2019s policy or expectation, since her action had been condoned by the employer\u2019s client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201cWe, therefore, conclude as a matter of law that the claimant quit to avoid discharge, but that her discharge would not have been for deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest or for a knowing violation of the employer\u2019s reasonable and uniformly enforced policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On appeal the DUA defends this reasoning on the grounds (1) that we should defer to \u201cthe experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the [DUA] as well as the discretionary authority conferred upon it,\u201d citing G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7); and (2) that Milinazzo did not commit a \u201cknowing violation\u201d of a rule or policy because she had twice fallen asleep \u201cinadvertently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">First, no degree of deference for agency adjudication can salvage the board\u2019s condonation rationale. No provision of the statutory scheme and no decisional law supports such a notion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without the consent of the employer, the client, patient, or customer has no authority to define or to waive the standards of performance of the employment relationship. The vital interests in those standards belong exclusively here to Shriver. It never relaxed or abandoned them. If Milinazzo had slept through a clog in the ventilator breathing tube and if that malfunction had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>caused death or grave harm to the patient, Shriver would have suffered the consequences in both law (respondeat superior liability) and commerce (diminished reputation and good will). Condonation by the patient\u2019s family would not prevent the harm to those legal and economic interests. Shriver never knew of the mother\u2019s condonation, nor could it rationally have consented to it. As it points out, the mother\u2019s alleged tolerance of Milinazzo\u2019s lapses is immaterial to Shriver\u2019s interests and treatment of its employee. This ground of decision reduces to an error of law and a determination arbitrary, capricious, and abusive of discretion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">3. <em>Knowing violation of rule or policy. </em>The DUA argues that the board\u2019s decision rests also upon the implicit ground that Milinazzo\u2019s sleeping incidents could not constitute knowing violations of the prohibition against on-duty sleeping because they were inadvertent lapses. Shriver answers that such a broad exemption would violate statutory purpose and policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In 1951 the Legislature inserted the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d criterion into the disqualification provision of the unemployment assistance program. St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 9(e). In 1992 it expanded the basis for disqualification by addition of the \u201cknowing violation\u201d ground. St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19. <em>Still, </em>423 Mass. at 811. Decisions applying the earlier deliberate misconduct standard can provide guidance for application of the later supplemental knowing violation test. \u201cKnowing\u201d requires a conscious intent both (a) to commit some action or behavior, and thereby (b) to violate the employer\u2019s rule or policy. <em>Id. </em>at 813. An employee usually must be aware of both elements, the immediate and the consequential. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Allen of Mich., Inc. </em>v. <em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 370, 380 (2005) (assimilating into knowing violation inquiry antecedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>factors from deliberate misconduct cases such as [i] employee\u2019s knowledge of employer\u2019s expectation, [ii] reasonableness of expectation, and [iii] presence of \u201cany mitigating factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In this instance Milinazzo clearly knew of Shriver\u2019s rule and policy against sleeping on duty. She conceded its importance. She had read the manual and executed a written acknowledgment of its contents. The decisive question is whether she knew that she was falling asleep on the two occasions. The DUA\u2019s position is that the inherent inadvertence of falling asleep precludes its knowing character. Both precedent and policy militate against that categorical position. Instead, they require a circumstantial evaluation of a sleeping lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Our most pertinent precedent is <em>Wedgewood </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 30 (1987), a case arising under the wilful misconduct standard. In that instance, a college discharged a custodian for sleeping during his night shift after a prior similar episode had resulted in a warning. The agency denied eligibility for benefits under the wilful misconduct standard, and a trial court judge affirmed. <em>Wedgewood, supra </em>at 31. With citations to cases in other jurisdictions, this court adopted the following approach to termination resulting from on-the-job sleeping.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cAlthough the act of falling asleep, by its very nature, ordinarily has an unintentional aspect to it, we acknowledge that sleeping on the job may constitute such misconduct in wilful disregard of an employer\u2019s interest as to justify the denial of unemployment compensation benefits. However each such case must be examined individually in light of any mitigating circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 33. In that instance the custodian had accrued a fifteen-year history of satisfactory performance before the two sleeping incidents and was struggling with the multiple personal burdens of a pending divorce and child support payments, personal care of two seriously ill elderly parents, and inadequate time for daily sleep. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. He had fallen asleep as he sat at a desk in a visible area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>Those circumstances negated the agency\u2019s determination of disqualifying deliberate misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In the application of the knowing violation standard to the infraction of on-duty sleeping, we conclude similarly that the unintentional aspect of falling into sleep cannot categorically insulate an applicant from disqualification for benefits. For this class of cases, \u201cknowing violation\u201d means knowledge of an employer\u2019s rule or policy against on-duty sleeping, but not knowledge of the precise act of entering sleep. A more general and anticipatory knowledge of the duty to avoid sleeping on the job is the mentality contemplated by the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In this case our individualized assessment of the circumstances requires disqualification. The first, and dominant, circumstance is the importance of the employee\u2019s responsibility. Milinazzo\u2019s assignment was to monitor the operation of life-sustaining medical equipment. The quintessential duty of that mission was alertness. It brought with it the obligation to preempt or to combat fatigue or drowsiness by such cautionary measures as adequate rest, on-the-job physical and mental exercises, safe stimulants, or calls for coverage or replacement. The gravity and sensitivity of the work imposed a commensurate duty of care,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a knowing awareness of its required wakefulness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Second, Milinazzo had some warning of her susceptibility to drowsiness. The first unreported episode had occurred six months earlier. See <em>Wedgewood, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 30. The patient\u2019s mother had observed her asleep. Milinazzo had promised the mother that she would not repeat the infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Third, our case contains no mitigating personal circumstances of the nature presented in the <em>Wedgewood </em>case. Milinazzo did not report to the review examiner any personal difficulties or hardship causing her particular fatigue or stress. Shriver retained its burden of proof of ineligibility throughout the administrative process. In the course of its proof, it did not encounter any countervailing evidence of mitigating factors from Milinazzo.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In these circumstances, Milinazzo\u2019s instances of sleeping on duty constituted knowing violations of a rule or policy of Shriver within the meaning of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2). The mother\u2019s condonation of such violations was immaterial. The DUA\u2019s contrary conclusions are errors of law within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c). We therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court and direct the entry of judgment in favor of Shriver.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">As of 2009, Milinazzo had worked with the family and cared for the boy for approximately nine years. Before her term with Shriver, she had done so through two other nursing agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The DUA did not find that the father ever had authorized or condoned the use of the blanket and the pillow for sleeping on the job, only for her comfort in the performance of the work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The mother did not remember the specific date of the second incident. Another Shriver employee, training at the patient\u2019s home with Milinazzo at the time, provided the date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The observation of this court in <em>South Cent. Rehabilitative Resources, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 186 (2002), remains accurate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u201cWe do not know of any decision, and we have not been referred to any, that holds that an employer\u2019s actions had in some fashion condoned the employee\u2019s deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. It is the employee\u2019s state of mind that is considered, not necessarily that of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">No principled distinction appears to require different treatment for the knowing violation prong of disqualification of \u00a7 25(e)(2). If an employer\u2019s condonation were immaterial, all the more so would be that of the client, patient, or customer of the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The board\u2019s decision first framed the issue before it as whether Milinazzo \u201chad engaged in deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest,\u201d and then concluded that her conduct comprised neither deliberate misconduct nor a knowing violation. On appeal it characterizes the issue as a question of knowing violation only. Although similar, those two grounds cannot be identical because every substantive provision of a statute is effectual, not redundant. See, e.g., <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 205 (1977), and cases cited; <em>Sperounes </em>v. <em>Farese, </em>449 Mass. 800, 807 (2007). As explained <em>infra, </em>our analysis of on-duty sleeping in this case would bring the same result under either standard of the disqualification clause of \u00a7 25(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Neither the <em>Wedgewood </em>case nor this one presents the situation of the premeditating and furtive napper or catnapper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Our case contains no disputes of fact or issue of substantial evidence under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e). Milinazzo has not participated in the appeal. The DUA has rested its position upon two contentions of law: (1) that the mother\u2019s condonation of Milinazzo\u2019s conduct negated its character as a deliberate and wilful or knowing action contrary to Shriver\u2019s interest; and (2) that an inadvertent sleeping lapse cannot constitute a knowing violation of an employer\u2019s rule or policy. The parties presented no conflicting evidence or argument about (a) the seriousness of the ventilator monitoring function, (b) the earlier sleeping incident, or (c) any circumstances of personal hardship burdening Milinazzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The DUA\u2019s contention that the inherently inadvertent character of falling asleep never can constitute a disqualifying knowing violation proves too much. That rationale would qualify for benefits even habitual sleepers and individuals derelict in the performance of duties important to the safety of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">As Shriver points out in the course of its distinction of this case from the <em>Wedgewood </em>circumstances, sleepiness in that instance would cause an interruption in custodial chores while here it would expose a patient to catastrophic danger. Milinazzo\u2019s duty here was not unique or extraordinary amid the modem workforce. In numerous workplaces we rely upon the wakefulness or vigilance of employees for critical safety purposes, such as air traffic control, public transportation driving, and particular security functions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The gravity of the danger of a ventilator failure overrode any assumption of its improbability. However unlikely, a single undetected malfunction might prove devastating to a patient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">A remand for further fact finding (as proposed by the dissent) is not warranted. First, Milinazzo had the opportunity to present all information supporting excusai, extenuation, and mitigation at the hearing. She offered only the immaterial ground of the parents\u2019 condonation. Second, this case presents an inherently narrow range of material facts (notice of employer\u2019s important policy, employee\u2019s repeated acknowledgment of the policy, seriousness of the infraction, repetition of the infraction) so as to leave the discovery of any additional and overriding material facts by remand particularly implausible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b405-8\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbL\">(dissenting). I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusions that Milinazzo believed that Shriver\u2019s client condoned her sleeping on the job, and that falling asleep is not inherently inadvertent (so that doing so never can constitute a knowing violation of an employer\u2019s policy). However, because the review examiner applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating Milinazzo\u2019s eligibility for benefits, he did not reach the question whether her violation was wilful misconduct within the framework set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>out in <em>Wedgewood </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 33 (1987). As observed in <em>Wedgewood, supra, </em>\u201csleeping on the job <em>may </em>constitute such misconduct in wilful disregard of an employer\u2019s interest as to justify the denial of unemployment compensation benefits. However, each such case must be examined individually in light of any mitigating circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The majority undertakes that individualized assessment of the circumstances in the present case, based on the administrative record, concluding that Milinazzo\u2019s conduct warrants denial of benefits. However, as we observed in <em>Norfolk County Retirement Sys. </em>v. <em>Director of the Dept. of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 759, 763-764 (2006):</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u201cOur review of the board\u2019s decision must \u2018give due weight to the [agency\u2019s] experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge[,] ... as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u2019 <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 482, 486 (1984), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). We do not act as a fact finder in employment security cases, because it remains \u2018the agency\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence, find the facts, and decide the issues.\u2019 <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983). See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). Our limited function is to determine whether the board of review applied correct legal principles in reaching its decision, whether the decision contains sufficient findings to demonstrate that the correct legal principles were applied, and whether those findings were supported by substantial evidence within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e). See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 92-93; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>393 Mass, at 485.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that the present case contains no disputes of fact or issues of substantial evidence. See <em>ante </em>at 374 n.8. Though the board is incorrect in its assertion that falling asleep never can constitute a knowing violation, the <em>Wedgewood </em>framework explicitly envisions a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>particularized assessment of the facts of each case. In my view, settled principles of administrative law require that assessment to be performed by the agency in the first instance, and I accordingly would remand the case to furnish the review examiner and the board the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, see <em>ante </em>at 375 n.11, I do not envision any need for introduction of additional evidence following remand. Instead, I believe that the weighing and assessment of the evidence already in the record against the <em>Wedgewood </em>standard is the prerogative of the hearing examiner in the first instance, and is not the proper function of an appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
