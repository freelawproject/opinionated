He was sentenced to one year in jail. Defense counsel now seeks to be relieved of her assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues which would merit an appeal. We have reviewed the record and agree. The record reflects that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered and that he was appropriately sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement and the relevant statutory requirements. In view of the foregoing, we affirm the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of conviction and grant defense counsel\u2019s application to withdraw (see, <em>People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\">Cardona, P. J., Mikoll, Crew III, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
