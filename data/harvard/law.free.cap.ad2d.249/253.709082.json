No appeal as of right lies therefrom <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5701 [a] [2]; <em>Sherwood v Roper, </em>237 AD2d 275). No application has been made for permission to appeal, nor are we inclined to grant leave to appeal under the circumstances of this case, considering the sparseness of the record <em>(see, Matter of Bergmann v Berger, </em>218 AD2d 768; <em>Matter of Hartman v Smith, </em>207 AD2d 345). Rosenblatt, J. P., Ritter, Sullivan and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
