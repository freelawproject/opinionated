B, on the other hand, covenanted to purchase the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale, or cause it to bring a fair price if sold to some one else; and, further, that if she purchased the property herself, to re-sell it on time, and after all her claims were liquidated to place the remaining proceeds in the hands of some member of A.\u2019s family.

In the winter or spring of this year Strouss visited Mrs. Hunter, for the purpose of procuring an additional loan from her, but subsequently the following agreement was entered into between the said James Strouss, and Mrs. Hunter and Amos W.

After the sale Mrs. Hunter obtained, for cash and notes, assignments to herself of the several judgments, which were prior liens to her own against the premises, and in the sheriff\u2019s return the $4,550 was first appropriated to the payment of these liens, and then on account of her other judgments some of which were not reached. Strouss retained possession of the property for a time but was subsequently dispossessed at the instance of the defendants, by sheriff\u2019s jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">In 1880 other creditors who held judgments against Strouss subsequent to Mrs. Hunter\u2019s issued execution and had the property sold again by the sheriff, claiming that the sale in 1875 under the above agreement, was a fraud on the other creditors and void. At this sale, in 1880, E. L. Barton the plaintiff, acting as trustee for the other creditors, purchased the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">The plaintiff submitted inter alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">(1) \u201c That the article of agreement of May 31st 1875, in evidence, is prima facie fraudulent as to creditors.\u201d Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">(2) \u201cThat any title to the property of James Strouss acquired by the defendant under the terms and conditions and in pursuance of the terms of the agreement of May 31st 1875, in evidence, is absolutely null and void as against bona fide creditors of the said James Strouss.\u201d Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-12\">(14) That under the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tending to prove fraud on part of the defendant in this case, the jury will consider all the separate facts in evidence, whether each fact of itself would be sufficient or not to fasten fraud upon her in the premises, and they may consider separate facts, if they are connected by the evidence, and tend to prove that the defendant entered into and carried out a scheme or plan, to purchase the land in dispute at an undervalue, and for the benefit of herself and also the benefit of James Strouss or his family. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-13\">In the general charge the court instructed the jury inter alia as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-14\">\u201c A sheriff\u2019s sale should be free, open and untainted by fraud. Any trick or device of a purchaser which prevents a fair sale is a fraud upon creditors, and if by means of it he gets the property at less than it otherwise would have sold for he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>obtain a good title and it may be defeated by a subsequent sale of the property on the judgment of another creditor. To work this result, however, the purchaser must have been guilty of some falsehood or trick before or at the time of the sale which succeeded, and he must have obtained the property for less than it otherwise would have sold for. All of these are essential elements to defeat the title of the purchaser. A mere fraudulent intent or effort, if not successful, is not sufficient, nor is the mere fact that the property was purchased at less than its value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel have asked me to instruct you that the agreement of May 31st 1875, is fraudulent on its face. We decline to give you such instructions. We say to you that it is not necessarily fraudulent, and further that we see nothing in it indicating an intention to cheat creditors or prevent a fair sale of the property. It does not bind Mrs. Hunter and Enlow, or Strouss, to do anything illegal and improper. Evidently drawn by one not much accustomed to draw such papers, it is full on unimportant matters and indefinite on those more vital. Why Strouss agreed not to dispute the claims of Enlow and Mrs. Hunter, and for what purpose he gave up the receipts, is not .apparent, nor why they were to pay him $200. It is not to be simply inferred that these were fraudulent acts or for a fraudulent purpose. They seem rather to be in the nature of a compromise between the parties of some matter's in dispute. What receipts were to be given up? Against the judgments of Enlow and Mrs. Hunter or on former judgments ? And were they given up to enable Enlow and Mrs. Hunter to protect themselves from unjust claims of prior creditors, or to enable them to practice a fraud upon other creditors ? When an agreement may be construed for an honest purpose a jury should not guess that it was intended for a fraudulent one. What was the $200 to be paid for? To secure the co-operation of Strouss in any fraud, as a loan or gratuity to him, or to avoid a factious and exactions opposition to the collection of honest claims against him ? The inference should not be in favor of dishonesty but rather of honesty. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show an improper or fraudulent purpose in the agreement. It is only in the light of the surrounding circumstances that we can understand its real object, and for that reason we refuse to say it is prima facie fraudulent, but submit the question to you upon all the evidence in the case. The provision to re-sell the property, and after paying the defendants\u2019 claims, place the surplus, if any, in the hands of such member of the Strouss family as he might designate, if honestly made for the benefit of his family, and not for the purpose of hindering or delaying creditors or interfering with a fair sheriff\u2019s sale, was not fraud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ulent, and would not render the defendant\u2019s purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale void as to the other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-4\">Verdict and judgment for defendants, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ, assigning for error, the charge of the court; and also the answers to numerous points submitted, and the rejection of certain offers of evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-5\"><em>Barton &amp; Son </em>and <em>A. M. Watson, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW8\">The judicial sale was brought about by the mutual consent and co-operation of the debtor and the creditors mentioned in the agreement and was therefore nothing more than a voluntary conveyance made by Strouss to Mrs. Hunter and A. W. Enlow of his land in Allegheny county and Beaver county for the benefit of particular creditors, preferences which are void and prohib\u00ed ited by statute, and as the same was not recorded within the thirty days thereafter, void as to creditors. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">The suppression of the receipts was certainly an unlawful act which, taken with the others, might go far to satisfy the jury that the whole transaction was fraiidulent. The evidence clearly shows a combination to put Strouss\u2019s land through the process of a judicial sale for the benefit of Mrs. Hunter, Amos. Enlow and Strouss, to the exclusion of other creditors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-7\"><em>Thomas M. Marshall </em>and <em>A. M. Brown, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A69\">Mrs. Hunter was induced <em>to </em>enter into the agreement in evidence by the entreaties and threats of Strouss, who ivas a former parishioner of her husband and represented himself to be in want; and also threatened to set up the defence of usury against Mrs. Hunter\u2019s claims unless she advanced him more money. The agreement contained nothing illegal. It was simply an engagement on the part of Mrs. Hunter, to either purchase the property herself or see that it brought a fair value; and in the event of purchasing herself, to allow Strouss\u2019s family the profit of a resale. This could not defraud the other creditors but tended rather to secure a good price for the property. The charge that Mrs. Hunter desired to suppress the receipts for money paid on prior liens, is absurd, since it would have prejudiced her own later liens. She desired the receipts to ascertain just what was due each creditor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-8\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 20th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Both parties claim title to this land under sheriff\u2019s sale as the property of James Strouss.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The defendant purchased at a sale made in December 1815, the plaintiff at one made in March 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The plaintiff seeks to impeach the validity of the first sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>on the ground that it was made in fraud of the creditors of Strouss.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The law presumes that a public judicial sale is made in good faith. This presumption stands, unless overthrown by clear and satisfactory evidence of fraud or unfair means. The contention was one of fact. Much evidence Avas given bearing on the question, and some of it conflicting. The learned judge submitted the case to the jury in a clear and correct charge. He instructed them that if the sheriff\u2019s sale was made with the intention of hindering, delaying or defeating creditors, and the purchaser had knowledge of such, it was null and void, although the full value of the property may have been paid; that a sheriff\u2019s sale should be free, open and untainted by fraud ; that any trick or device of a purchaser which prevents a fair sale is a fraud on creditors, and if by means of it he gets the property at less than it otherwise would have sold for, he does not obtain a good title, and it may be defeated by a subsequent sale of the property on the judgment of another creditor. To work this result the purchaser must have been guilty of some falsehood or trick before or at the time of the sale which succeeded, and he must have obtained the property for less than it otherwise would have sold. All of these are essential elements to defeat the title of the purchaser. A mere fraudulent intent or effort if not successful is not sufficient, nor is the mere fact that the property was purchased at less than its value. We think the plaintiff has no reason to complain of this declaration of the law. No error is assigned thereto. Then, as to the application of the evidence tending to establish the fraud, the court affirmed a point of the plaintiff put in these words, <em>\u201c </em>under the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tending to prove fraud on the part of the defendant, the jury will consider all the separate facts in evidence, whether each fact of itself would be sufficient or not to fasten fraud on her in the premises; and they may consider separate facts, if they are connected by the evidence and tend to prove that the [defendant entered into and carried out a scheme or plan, to purchase the land in dispute at an under value, and for the benefit of herself, and also for the benefit of James Strouss or his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3x\">We do not deem it necessary to consider seriatim the twenty-five specifications of error. We do not think the article of agreement Avas prima facie fraudulent as to creditors; nor do we see any error in the rejection of evidence. A wide range was given to its admission. A careful reading of it has led us to the conclusion that the portions of the charge and answer <em>to </em>which we have referred, fairly presented the substantial features of the case to the jury. We discover nothing which calls for a reversal. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
