PIo never had actual possession of them. The First National Bank was a mere baillee for him as a pledgee, and the bailee for Beringer, the former pledgee. Hence .... his pledge being prior in point of time, he is entitled to hold $6,500 of those bonds, that amount being identified by their witnesses, as against the subsequent bailment, or, rather, as against the bailment or pledge, such as this plaintiff claims in this case, hence there is nothing to leave to you as a fact to be found.\u201d (5th assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">The jury under the binding instructions of the court found a verdict for the defendant for Shenango and Allegheny Railroad bonds No. 504, of one thousand dollars; No. 121, of one thousand dollars; No. 1083, of five hundred dollars; No. 1087 of five hundred dollars; No. 1086, of five hundred dollars; No. 1084, of five hundred dollars; No. 1082, of five hundred dollars ; No. 1081, of five hundred dollars ; No. 989, of five hundred dollars; No. 987, of five hundred dollars; No. 988, of five hundred dollars.

The bank in the present suit is estopped by its certificate of deposit from denying the plaintiff\u2019s title. Beringer is not. He may maintain his own title in another suit but the bank cannot shelter itself under his title: Wells on Replevin \u00a7\u00a7 693, 696; King <em>v. </em>Richards, 6 Wharton 427.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-6\"><em>John J. </em>Henderson, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQz\">In an action of replevin the plaintiff must show property either absolute or special in himself. Evidence that another owns the property or has a right superior to the plaintiff will defeat his action: Seibert <em>v. </em>McHenry, 6 W. 303; Quincy <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 Pick. 360. The plaintiff parted with his money before any deposit was made, upon the simple promise of Thorp that lie would deposit collateral security. A pledgee of negotiable instruments as collateral security for a pre-existing debt is not a bona fide holder for value: Depeau <em>v. </em>Waddington, 6 Wh. 232; Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Muirhead, 16 Pa. St. 123. The delivery to him of the identical bonds in controversy was in no way the inducement to him to. make the loan. The most that plaintiff can claim is that he expected some bonds to be deposited. Neither did Thorp intend to deposit these bonds, for they were at that time out of his possession and control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">The evidence of the declarations of the president of the bank were not considered by the court. Whether it was competent or not it did the plaintiff no harm.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-8\">Mr. Justice Sterrett</author>\n<p id=\"A2sE\">delivered the opinion of the court, December 30th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">It may be conceded that in 1877 the bonds in controversy were deposited in the First National Bank of Meadville, to secure the note of Thorp and Reynolds in favor of Beringer, and that the note was not .fully paid nor the collaterals voluntarily surrendered to the pledgor; but, it by no means follows that the same bonds may not have been subsequently pledged to the plaintiff as collateral security for the money loaned by him to Thorp in April 1878. Being negotiable securities, every transfer of the bonds to a new holder, for value and without notice, would give the latter a good title to them as against the former holder. That such is the status of coupon bonds, similar to those in question, is too well settled by recent decisions to admit of any doubt: County of Beaver <em>v. </em>Armstrong, 8 Wright 63, 69; Murray <em>V. </em>Lardner, 2 Wal. 110, and Commissioners <em>v. </em>Bolles, 4 Otto 109. Like a bank note, or promissory note indorsed in blank, they pass by delivery, and a good faith purchaser is unaffected by want of title in his vendor. The last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>taker is presumed to be a bona fide holder for value and may maintain his possession against everybody until the contrary is successfully established by those who undertake to assail his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">It is claimed by plaintiff that in making the loan to Thorp in April 1878, an essential provision of their agreement was that the latter should deposit in the First National Rank of Meadville $9,000, Shenango and Allegheny Railroad bonds, as collateral security for the loan, and furnish him with the bank\u2019s certificate of such deposit; that a few days thereafter he received from the cashier a certificate setting forth, in substance, that Thorp had deposited in the bank bonds corresponding in kind and amount with their agreement, \u201c to be held as security for the payment of his note for $6,674.40, dated April 25th 1878, due in one year from that date that, resting in the belief that Thorp had fully complied with the condition on which he obtained the loan, he awaited the maturity of the note ; and, immediately after the failure of Thorp he called at the bank and was informed by its president that his bonds were there, and his claim was secure ; that, afterwards, upon inquiring for the bonds, an envelope, indorsed, \u201c Dr. Gibson $9,000 bonds, Shenango and Allegheny Railroad Co.\u201d was handed him by an officer of the bank who informed him that on surrendering the certificate of deposit he could lift the bonds; but, having mislaid the certificate, the bonds were not taken out of bank. By an arrangement with its president, however, the past due coupons wore collected by the bank and the proceeds $315, marked \u201c The property of Dr. William Gibson,\u201d placed in the envelope with the bonds. After the failure of the bank, the money thus identified as his, was handed to plaintiff by the temporary receiver ; but, in the absence of the still missing certificate, he declined to surrender the bonds, and they remained in the vaults of the bank until taken by the sheriff on the writ of replevin and delivered to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">If the case had been submitted to the jury on the testimony before them, they would have been warranted in finding the facts substantially as claimed by plaintiff; and that the bonds in controversy are those referred to in the certificate of the cashier and afterwards exhibited to the plaintiff in the bank, where they had been deposited by Thorp in compliance with the condition on which he obtained the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In view of the testimony and the conclusions which might have been fairly and legitimately drawn therefrom, the learned judge erred in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s points and in withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the several questions of facts therein presented; and also, in charging as complained of in the fourth to seventh specifications inclusive. As already suggested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the questions of fact referred to were fairly raised by the evidence, and if they had been found, as they might and probably would have been, in favor of the plaintiff, he would have been entitled to a general verdict establishing his right to all the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It cannot be pretended that the bonds were pledged to the plaintiff as security for an independent and antecedently contracted debt. The cotemporaneous agreement to deposit them as collateral security entered into and formed an essential feature or condition of the contract of lending. It was doubtless the leading consideration, so far at least as the plaintiff was concerned, without which the loan would not liave been made. The contract was carried out in apparent good faith, and was so recognized by the bank, which now claims, in direct contradiction of its own certificate, to have beeii the custodian of the same bonds for a prior pledgee. If there was any bad faith in the transaction, it was not on the part of the plaintiff, nor is there a particle of testimony to show that he was aware of any, on the part of any one else. From the time the bank issued and delivered the certificate of deposit it became his agent for the custody and safe keeping of the bonds. Its possession was thenceforth his possession, as fully to all intents and purposes as if they had been actually delivered to him. While the pledge was not fully completed by actual delivery or deposit of the bonds on the day Thorp borrowed the money, the continuance of the loan depended on the full execution of the pledge; and, the subsequent forbearance, which doubtless resulted from receiving the certificate of deposit placed the plaintiff in no worse position than he would have occupied if the pledge and receipt of the money had been simultaneous. Upon the facts claimed by the plaintiff and suggested in the points submitted by him, all of which might have been found in his favor, he is entitled to the bonds, as against the bank, if not against Beringer, the former pledgee, also. But as to the latter we express no opinion, for the reason that he is not a party to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The testimony, complained of in the first assignment, should have been excluded on the ground of incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Judgment reversed and a venire facias de novo, awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
