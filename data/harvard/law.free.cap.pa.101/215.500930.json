We instruct the jury that if the Commonwealth has failed to show this good repute, or what is its equivalent, that there could be ho conviction. After reflecting upon the question presented in this point and obtaining all the light we can from the books furnished, we add this further instruction bearing upon the question presented in this point. To constitute the offence of seduction, under the Act of 19th of April 1843, there must be illicit connection, and the female must of drawn aside from the path of virtue which she was honestly pursuing at the time the defendant approached her. The law does not presume the previous chastity of the female, such a presumption being inconsistent with that of the prisoner\u2019s innocence; but such chastity must be proved by the government, it being essential to the offence charged. Taking the authorities therefore, and the reasons upon which they seem to proceed, we think ourselves justified in stating the law and leaving you to determine under the evidence whether the prosecution has come up to the point the law requires. We believe that if it is affirmatively proved that the prosecutrix has always maintained a consistent character for chastity \u2014 if the evidence showed that she had never been approached by any other man, that she never had kept company with any other man; and if the evidence showed, that the defendant, was the first person who had illicit intercourse with her, and had drawn her aside from the path of virtue; if this is proven, we believe that the requirements of the Act of Assembly would be met so far as the proof of good repute is concerned. And we add further, that it is always necessary to the prosecutor\u2019s cause to make out the fact that the prosecutrix was a person of good repute, or to make out that the prosecutrix had always maintained a good character for chastity. One or the other of these is necessary to maintain the prosecutrix\u2019s case. And their existence may be inferred from general evidence offered by the prosecution. We think in the statement we have thus made of the law upon this branch of the case, we will be fully sustained by the reason of the thing, and by the weight of the authorities. We thus answer the point put to us by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">Yerdict guilty, and the defendant was sentenced.

The girl was only eighteen years old, lived with her parents, and worked in the household, went to church, never before had any beau or gallant, no aspersion ever made as to her character for chastity before the defendant seduced her under promise of marriage. \u201cGood character being presumed, evidence to support it will not be received until it has been assailed.\u201d Wharton\u2019s Criminal Ev. (8th ed.) sec. 59; Snyder <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 85 Pa. St. Rep. 519. \u201c Chaste character is presumed and need not be proved.\u201d State <em>v. </em>Higdon, 32 Iowa 262; State <em>v. </em>Wells, 48 Iowa 671. In Pennsylvania it has been expressly decided that: \u201c The rule is well settled that witnesses on part of plaintiff cannot be examined as to general character of the seduced for chastity until evidence of general bad character has been adduced by defendant.\u201d Wilson <em>v. </em>Sproul, 3 P. &amp; W. 49-53. It is therefore not only unnecessary, but it would be improper to offer direct evidence of good repute until the presumption is rebutted by evidence offered by defendant'. Even then direct evidence is not essential, if circumstantial or presumptive evidence- is clear. \u201c Chaste character in the person seduced may be inferred from the general evidence offered by the prosecution, when not expressly, testified to as an independent ingredient of its case.\u201d Whart. Crim. Law. (Sth ed.) \u00a7 1757.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-7\">Mr. Justice Sterrett</author>\n<p id=\"AWH\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 20th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The statute under which the plaintiff in error was indicted, declares, \u201cthat the seduction of any female of good repute, under twenty-one years of age, with illicit connection under promise of marriage,\u201d shall be a misdemeanor: Purd. 326, pl. 56. The \u201c good repute \u201d of the female alleged to have been seduced is thus made an essential ingredient of the offence, and hence it was not only necessary that it should be specifically averred in the indictment, but it was incumbent on the Commonwealth to prove the fact affirmatively by such evidence as would justify the submission of that question to the jury. The ordinary presumption of her good reputation for chastity, without more, was insufficient for that purpose: West <em>v. </em>The State, 1 Wis. 209; 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Prac. 1106. This was conceded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>learned judge in his answer to defendant\u2019s point, requesting him to charge, \u201c that as the Commonwealth has offered no evidence that the prosecutrix was a woman of good repute there can be no conviction.\u201d It was also conceded, in the same connection, that there was no direct evidence on the subject of good reputation ; but, the point was refused and the jury were instructed, inter alia, that if the Commonwealth failed to show \u201c good repute or what is its equivalent,\u201d there could be no conviction. It must be shown \u201c that the prosecutrix was a person of good repute,\u201d or that she \u201chad always maintained a good character for chastity. One or the other of these is necessary; and their existence may be inferred from general evidence offered by the prosecution.\u201d In thus instructing the jury, and submitting the question to them on insufficient evidence, we think there was error. It is the \u201c good repute \u201d of the female seduced, and not something else that-may be regarded by the jury as \u201c equivalent,\u201d that is made an element of the offence. There is no doubt whatever as to the meaning of that expression as used in the statute, and neither court nor jury has a right to determine <em>\u201c </em>what is its equivalent.\u201d The testimony introduced by the Commonwealth tended to prove other ingredients of the offence; but it was not offered for the purpose of proving reputation, nor had it scarcely the slightest tendency in that direction. There is a well recognized mode of proving general reputation, and the Commonwealth should not be permitted to ignore it, without cause, especially in cases like the present, wherein \u201cgood repute\u201d is an essential element of the offence. If the general reputation of the prosecutrix, for chastity, in the neighborhood in which she lived, was good, \u2014 and there is nothing in the case to indicate any thing to the contrary, \u2014 it was the duty of the Commonwealth to call witnesses and prove the fact affirmatively, as every other ingredient of the offence was required to be proved, instead of asking the jury to infer the fact from casual expressions used by some of the witnesses in the course of their testimony on other branches of the case. Every person accused of crime is entitled to the benefit of the legal presumption in favor of innocence, which in doubtful cases is always to turn the scale in his favor. ETence, the rule of evidence in criminal cases is, that the guilt of the accused must be fully proved. Neither the mere preponderance of evidence, nor any weight of preponderant evidence is sufficient for the purpose unless it generate full belief of the fact to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt. The general evidence referred to by the learned judge was clearly insufficient for that purpose, and did not justify the submission to the jury of a material fact of which there was no direct evidence. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case, from which the general good reputation of the prosecutrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>could be fairly or legitimately inferred. The several assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Judgment reversed, and it is ordered that the record, with a certified copy of this opinion setting forth the causes of reversal, be remit ted to the court of Quarter Sessions of Jefferson county, for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
