J., the proof oh the part of the Commonwealth was that the defendant had sold liquor for drinking purposes in the village of Cokeville Derry township; and there was no. evidence of sales by him at any other place. The defendant claimed that under certain local acts (infra) the indictment should have stated the township and borough in which the alleged offence was committed; and he accordingly submitted no evidence but presented the following point: \u201c If you believe the sales of liquor took place in Derry township, Westmoreland county, then, under the Acts of Assembly of 27th March 1867 (P. L. 591), extending the provisions of the Act of 27th March 1866 (P. L. 339), the present indictment cannot be sustained, and the defendants must be acquitted .\u201d Refused.

Sentence, that the defendant pay a fine of $200 to the commonwealth and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence be complied with.

St. 495. The argument that the Act of 1875 repeals only the penalties of the Act of 1866 is \u201can attempt to engraft, by an unwarranted implication, part of a general Act upon one that is purely local.\u201d The local Acts being in force, it follows, that an indictment charging the violation of the liquor law in Derry township, should pursue them strictly: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Keenan, 10 Phila. 194; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Reiter, 78 Penna. St. 161; Updegraff v<em>. </em>Commonwealth, 6 S. &amp; R. 5; Respublica <em>v. </em>Tryer, 3 Yeates 451; Humphreys <em>v. </em>State, 17 Fla. 381; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 P. <em>&amp; </em>W. 142. The indictment must be sufficiently precise to protect the defendant from a second prosecution: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 1 Brew. 422; and if the Act applies to a particular time or place the indictment must conform thereto by direct allegation: Gaddy <em>v. </em>State, 8 Tex. App. 127; Kearney <em>v. </em>State, 48 Md. 16.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-12\"><em>W. H. Klingensmith </em>(with whom was <em>S.

It is well settled that a subsequent affirmative statute repeals, by implication, a former one made concerning the same matter, if it introduces a new rule on the subject and be evidently intended as a substitute for a former law, although it contains no express words repealing it: Johnston\u2019s estate, 9 Casey 511; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cromley, supra, and the cases there cited: German Society <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 4 W. N. C. 213; Barber\u2019s case, 5 W. N. C. 350; Naval <em>v. </em>Elliott, 5 W. N. C. 35; Keller <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 21 Sm. 413; Ledlie <em>v. </em>Monongahela Nav. Co., 6 Barr 392; Nusser v. Commonwealth, 1 Cas. 126.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-6\">Mr. Justice Trunkey</author>\n<p id=\"ANz\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 5th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Act of March 27th 1867, prohibits the issue of license to any person to sell spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquors, for drinking purposes, within the township of Derry, in the county of Westmoreland, and provides, that if any person shall, for the purposes aforesaid, sell any such liquors, within said township, he or she, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars, nor more than two hundred dollars ; and, upon a second conviction thereof, in addition to the fine, shall undergo an imprisonment of not more than three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">It is admitted on the part of the Commonwealth that the alleged unlawful sale by the defendant was made in the township of Derry, and that the special prohibitory statute, except its penal provision, is still in force; and it is claimed that said provision is repealed and supplied by the general statute of April 12th 1875. The punishment prescribed for violation of the general Act materially differs from that for violation of the special. In strictness, a sale contrary to the provisions of the one, is not the same offence as a sale contrary to the provisions of the other. In the township of Derry no person can be licensed to sell intoxicating liquor for use as a beverage, and all sales for such use are prohibited. It is hardly correct to say of the offender that he sold without license, as such phrase implies that persons might be licensed to sell. But the general statute provides that licenses may be issued, and \u201c that any sale made of vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, contrary to the provisions of this law, shall be taken to be a misdemeanor.\u201d The penalty is expressly denounced against those who violate this law, and the indictment may properly charge that the offender sold without license.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The Act of 1875 declares that none of its provisions shall authorize the sale of intoxicating liquors in any municipality having special prohibitory laws, and in the entire Act there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>no sign of intendment to repeal the vindicatory parts of such laws. Sometimes it has been held that a general affirmative statute will repeal a prior local one upon the same subject. This is not-the rule. To effect such result, the repugnancy must be strong, or the inconsistency irreconcilable. There is no repeal where the intendment of the general is not to supply the local. A general statute, without negative words, cannot repeal a previous statute which is particular, even though the provisions of one be different from the other. \u201c It is against reason to suppose that the legislature in framing a general system for the state, intended to repeal a special Act which the local circumstances of one. county had made necessary: \u201d Brown <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 21 Pa. St. 37; Bounty Accounts, 70 Pa. St. 92. Accordingly, it was decided that the 6th section of the Act of 1872, P. L. 843, relating to the sale of intoxicating liquors in the county of Allegheny, was not repealed by the 3d section of the general Act of 1875, although said sections widely differ as to the amounts to be paid for licenses for hotels, inns and taverns, and the uses of the moneys received therefor: Kilgore <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 94 Pa. St. 495. From the ruling in that case it follows that the special Act for the township of Derry is not repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">An indictment must be sufficiently precise to protect the defendant from a second prosecution for the same offence. Where the offence is statutory, and can bo committed only in a certain municipal division, Avliich is less than the county within the jurisdiction of the court, the name or description of such division, and the fact that the offence was committed therein, must be set forth in the indictment. This conviction would not be a bar to an indictment charging the defendant with having unlawfully sold spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquors, for drinking purposes, in the township of Derry, in the county of Westmoreland, contrary to the special statute: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Keenan, 10 Phil. 194; State <em>v. </em>Hanly, 25 Minn. 429; Botto <em>v. </em>State, 26 Miss. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant\u2019s point should have- been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Judgment reversed, and the record, with this opinion setting forth the causes of reversal, is remanded to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Westmoreland . county for further proceeding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
