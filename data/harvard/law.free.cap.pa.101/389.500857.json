Bryan from a decree of said court, sustaining the petition of an administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., for the sale of certain real estate to pay for the maintenance of one Frederick Bentz, whose support was made a charge on said real estate, by the will of Mary B. Garber, the former owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">By her will, which was proved May 22d 1867, the testatrix devised three lots of ground in the city of Pittsburgh, to her daughter Mary E. Bostwick, for life, with remainder to her children, and charged the land with the support and maintenance of Frederick Bentz, an imbecile son of testatrix; \u201c if by reason of sickness, bodily or mental infirmity, he shall at any time be unable to work.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">On March 22d 1875 the city of Pittsburgh filed a lien against this real estate, and Edmond Bostwick, the husband of the devisee, as owner, who with his wife resided on the premises, for $203.16, the amount assessed under the Act of January 6th 1864 (Pamph. L. 1135) for grading Bates alley, upon which the property abutted. The grading was finished September 29th 1874, and on July 11th 1875, more than six months after the completion of this work, the record was amended, under \u00a7 20 of said Act, by making \u201c unknown owners \u201d parties defendants; but no entry of the amendment and of the addition of unknown owners as parties defendant was made in the index, as required by the Act. Judgment was then taken against the unknown owners, and the premises sold, October 8th 1875, on a levari facias issuing thereon, to Jacob <em>W. </em>Zahniser for $1,100. On the twenty-fifth of the same month, Zahniser conveyed a portion of the property to Edmond Bostwick, who executed a mortgage, November 19th, on this portion, in which his wife Mary E. Bostwick, the devisee, joined, in favor of I. M. Pennock to secure the payment of $7,000. This mortgage was afterwards assigned, for valuable consideration, to George S. Bryan, who foreclosed it in September 1877 and bought in the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">It appeared from the testimony that Mary E. Bostwick and her husband had procured the sale of the property under the municipal lien, for the purpose of acquiring the title free from the charge thereof, and of borrowing money on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-11\">John Skillen, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Mary B. Garber, with whom Frederick Bentz had been living for a number of years, filed a petition in the Orphan\u2019s Court to December Term 1880, alleging that Bentz had been unable to support himself both by reason of mental and bodily infirmities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that there was due to the petitioner under the will for Bentz\u2019s support $1,650, and praying for an order for the sale of the property in question for the payment of said sum in order to provide for Bentz\u2019s future support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\">In answer to this petition Bryan claimed that the charge on the land, under the will, for Bentz\u2019s support, was divested by the sale on the municipal lien, and the court at first entered a decree dismissing the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">To this decree the petitioner excepted on the following grounds : (1) That more than six months had elapsed between the completion of the work on the alley and the time when the lien was filed as against the unknown owners. (2) That the service of the writ was irregular. (3) That the amendment of the record on July 17th 1875, by making <em>unknown owners </em>parties defendant, was unauthorized by \u00a7 20 of the Act of January 6th 1864. (4) That the lien was not indexed, as required by the Act. (5) That Bryan was not an innocent purchaser, without notice of Bostwick\u2019s fraud in procuring the sale; and finally, that the sale on the municipal lien did not divest the charge on the land under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">In an opinion filed on these exceptions, the court, while holding that the sale on the municipal lien did, <em>in law, </em>divest the charge on the land, held further, that from the record Bryant was affected with notice of the fraudulent character of the sale, and therefore took the land subject to the charge. The court therefore entered a final decree, vacating its former one, and in accordance with these rulings, whereupon Bryan took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-7\"><em>George Shiras, Jr. </em>(with him <em>C. C. Dickey), </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az1\">The court below ruled that there was a resulting trust in Bostwick, on the ground of an alleged fraud by him; and further, that the appellant had constructive notice of this fraud. But Bryan was not a party to the sale on the municipal lien nor had he notice of any fraud. The record simply showed: (1) The devise of the land to Mary E. Bostwick, the remainders and the charge. (2) The municipal lien, the judgment and execution, and the sheriff\u2019s deed to Zahniser. (3) The conveyance from Zahniser to Bostwick. It was not alleged that Bryan knew of the existence of Frederick Bentz, nor was there any allegation or proof that he knew Bostwick was the husband of the devisee under the will. The circumstances were not such as to make it incumbent upon Bryan to inquire into these facts: Barlow <em>v. </em>Beall, 8 Harris 178; Fillman <em>v. </em>Divers, 7 Casey 429; Kistler\u2019s Appeal, 23 Sm. 293. He took a title derived from a judicial sale. If the law be as determined by the court below, then no purchaser upon a municipal lien can be safe, nor can the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>searching examination of title assure a bona fide purchaser, who has paid a full price for his land, that a court may not take it from him to enforce a secret trust, nor can the city of Pittsburgh collect the cost of its improvements.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-4\"><em>Barton &amp; </em>Son, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5nd\">The judicial sale, even if regular, did not divest the charge on the land, because the charge was uncertain and contingent: Cadman <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 Sm. 295; Hiester <em>v. </em>Green, 12 Wr. 96; Helford v<em>. </em>Wilson, 12 Sm. 385. But the sale was not regular. The statutory time for filing the lien was within six months from the completion of the work, and the amendment making unknown owners parties defendant was not filed until ten months afterwards. Again, \u00a7 20 of the Act of January 6th 1864, refers only to the adding and striking out of known parties, such as are described in \u00a7 16 ; and under \u00a7 21 the omission to index the lien under the title \u201c unknown owners,\u201d was fatal. Bryan had notice of record, by the will, that the tenant for life was the wife of Edmond Bostwick. By going to the premises he could have ascertained that she and her husband were in possession, at the time the grading was done, and that her husband had made tire improvements to pay for which the money was borrowed from Bryan. The record also showed the irregularities in filing the lien. Bostwick had no title which he could hold against the charge under the will; and Bryan, having constructive notice of Bostwick\u2019s fraud, had no better title in this respect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-5\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AuF\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 20th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We are of opinion that the learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court was correct in holding that the charge upon the real estate in controversy for the support of Frederick Bentz was discharged by the judicial sale. It was in the nature of a fixed lion, and may be said to come within the exceptions pointed out in Hiester <em>v. </em>Green, 12 Wright 96, and as such binding between parties and privies. The property, however, was sold upon a municipal claim filed by the city of Pittsburgh for grading and paving a street abutting thereon. The Act of May 16th 1857, section 4, P. L. 542, provides that \u201c all taxes, rates and levies which may hereafter be lawfully imposed or assessed by authority of said city (Pittsburgh) on any real estate therein, shall be and they are hereby declared to be a lien thereon, . . . . , and that the said lien shall have priority to, and shall be fully paid and satisfied before any recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation or responsibility, which the said real estate may-become charged with, or liable to, from and after the passing of this Act.\u201d The proceeding under this Act is <em>in </em>rem, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>whole estate in the land is charged: Salter <em>v. </em>Peed, 3 Harris 260. The reason for it is that the improvements are for the benefit of the property. Section 16 of the Act of 6th January 1864, P. L. 1135, under which Bates alley was graded and paved, provides that the term \u201c owner\u201d as used in said Act shall be construed to mean all individuals having any title or interest in the properties assessed. It was held in Perry <em>v. </em>Brinton, 1 Harris 202, that a sale on a municipal lien did not divest the lien of a prior mortgage. That, however, was because mortgages in the city of Philadelphia were protected by an Act of Assembly. It has never been held that charges upon or estates in land created by the owner thereof can avail as against the taxing power of the Commonwealth. Municipal liens for grading and paving streets are a species of taxation and come within the rule.\u2019 Such liens bind the entire estate in the land, except where an Act of Assembly directs otherwise. If it were not so, the owner of real estate could wholly defeat the taxing power by charging it with the payment of a sum of money equal to its full value.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">That the sheriff\u2019s sale in this instance discharged the premises in question from the charge in Mrs. Garber\u2019s will in favor of Frederick Bentz is settled by Allegheny City\u2019s Appeal, 5 Wright 60, and Pittsburgh\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. S. 142. It is equally clear that under Delaney <em>v. </em>Gault, 6 Casey 63, and Emerich <em>v. </em>Dicken, the irregularities complained of were cured by the judgment and do not affect the purchaser at a judicial sale. Wistar <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 5 Norris 215, is not in conflict with this view, for the reason that there the defence was made by the owner prior to any sheriff\u2019s sale of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Tip to this point we are in harmony with the rulings of the court below. The learned judge held, however, that the appellant was affected with notice of the alleged fraud of Mary E. Bostwick, and her husband. It is found by the court, and for the purposes of this case we assume the fact to be, that they procured the sheriff\u2019s sale of the premises for the purpose of getting it back discharged from the provision in Mrs. Carter\u2019s will, in favor of Frederick Bentz. The appellant is a purchaserfor value, and before his title can be affected by the fraud of the Bostwicks, it must appear that he either was a party to the fraud or had knowledge of it. There is no pretence that he was a party or had actual knowledge of any fraud. But the learned judge held that he had constructive notice, as it appeared of record in his line of title. This was error. The appellant\u2019s title was acquired through a judicial sale, upon a valid lien. It is true the charge in favor of Frederick Bentz appeared in the line of title, but the fraud by which the Bostwicks procured the sale did not appear. The fact that they resided upon the premises had no especial significance. If sufficient to put appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>upon inquiry, he can only bo charged with what he would probably have ascertained if he had made such inquiry. It is too much to assume that either Bostwick or his wife would have informed him of the fraud. lie would only have learned what the record discloses, that the property had been sold at a judicial sale upon an adverse proceeding. Nothing appeared upon record to indicate that the Bostwicks were practically both vendors and vendees. The tendency of judicial decision is to protect good faith purchasers at judicial sales, and where participation in or knowledge of actual fraud Is not alleged, we are not disposed to extend the doctrine of constructive notice to unreasonable lengths. Where the record discloses such facts as fairly put a purchaser upon inquiry, the rule is to hold him to notice of what such inquiry would reasonably have developed. To extend it further is not warranted by the authorities, and might work serious wrong in many instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">The decree is reversed and the petition dismissed at the costs of the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
