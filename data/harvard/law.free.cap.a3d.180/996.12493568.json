Searl and Randy A. Searl, doing business as Subway store number 34648,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the judgment of the trial court, effectively dismissing their motion to vacate an arbitration award for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and granting the application of the plaintiff, Doctor's Associates, Inc., to confirm that award. On appeal, the defendants claim that the court should have applied federal law, or alternatively New York law, instead of Connecticut law, in determining whether they timely filed their motion to vacate. We conclude that the court should have applied federal law in determining the timeliness of the defendants' motion to vacate and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The defendants owned and operated three Subway restaurant franchises under separate franchise agreements. Only one of the defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   stores, store number 34648 (store), and the franchise agreement for that store (franchise agreement), are at issue in this case. In October, 2013, the plaintiff notified the defendants that they were noncompliant with certain requirements of the franchise agreement regarding their operation of the store. In February, 2014, the parties entered into a probationary agreement, which provided that if the defendants were compliant with the franchise agreement for three months, they would be reinstated as franchisees of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 3, 2014, the plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration with the American Dispute Resolution Center (center), claiming that the defendants had breached the franchise and probationary agreements. The defendants received notice of the plaintiff's initiation of the arbitration proceeding even though the mailing address on the notice was incorrect. On May 1, 2014, Susan Searl contacted the plaintiff to discuss the arbitration and spoke to Jill Fernandez, a case manager in the plaintiff's office. Fernandez explained that the defendants \"would be receiving further information regarding the arbitration process, the selection of an arbitrator, and the scheduling of a hearing date,\" and that they should \"expect to receive further documentation in June or July [2014].\" Fernandez also explained that the defendants \"did not need to make any further decisions or take any further actions until [they] received the information regarding the process for selecting an arbitrator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 20, 2014, the arbitrator found in favor of the plaintiff and issued an award in its favor. The defendants received notice of the award \"as early as June 26, 2014, and no later than July 1, 2014.\" Along with the notice of the award, the defendants received,\n   <em>\n    for the first time\n   </em>\n   , notice regarding the selection of an arbitrator and the deadline for the submission of evidence in the arbitration proceeding. A representative from the center informed Susan Searl that the reason the defendants had not received any communications from the center between April and June, 2014, was that \"the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   [had] provided the [center] with the wrong address.\" (Emphasis added.) On June 26, 2014, a representative of the plaintiff informed the defendants that, in light of the arbitrator's award, there was nothing they could do \"other than sell or close [the store].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff filed an application to confirm the arbitration award in the Superior Court on August 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 4, 2014, the defendants, representing themselves, filed a pleading entitled \"Objection to Confirmation Award.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This pleading explained that the defendants had never received notice of the arbitration hearing date and included numerous notes detailing arguments the defendants would have made had they been given the opportunity to present their case to the arbitrator. On October 3, 2014, the defendants, having retained counsel, filed an \"Answer and Affirmative Defenses\" in response to the plaintiff's application to confirm the arbitration award. In that pleading, which the parties treated as a motion to vacate the award, the defendants similarly alleged that they had not received notice of the arbitration proceeding, had not had an opportunity to present evidence, and did not learn that the arbitration hearing had taken place until after the arbitrator had issued the award in favor of the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 9, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the \"Objection to Confirmation\n   Award\" and the \"Answer and Affirmative Defenses,\" arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the filings had not been made within the thirty day time period for moving to vacate an arbitration award provided by General Statutes \u00a7 52-420(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants responded that the Federal Arbitration Act (act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., governed the enforcement of the arbitration award and that their objection to the arbitration award was sufficiently asserted within the three month time period following the issuance of the award prescribed by the act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the defendants argued that, if federal law did not apply, the court should apply New York law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the defendants maintained that they \"had meritorious defenses to the plaintiff's demand for arbitration, but they were not given notice or an opportunity to be heard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 15, 2015, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it (1) denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, (2) refused to consider the defendants' special defense seeking to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that it was untimely, and (3) granted the plaintiff's application to confirm the arbitration award. The court concluded that the act was not controlling in the present case because the general choice of law provision in the parties' franchise agreement established that Connecticut law governed. The court also rejected the defendants' alternative argument that New York law should apply. Instead, the court applied Connecticut law. Reasoning that the defendants did not move to vacate the arbitration award within thirty days of their receipt of the award, as Connecticut law requires; see footnote 4 of this opinion; the court concluded that the defendants' motion was untimely, and thus it granted the plaintiff's application to confirm the arbitration award. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants claim that the arbitration award in favor of the plaintiff is unenforceable because they did not receive adequate notice of the arbitration proceeding. The defendants assert that, without notice of the proceeding, the arbitration award is not enforceable against them. The defendants maintain that because the parties expressly agreed that the act \"preempts any state law restrictions ... on the enforcement of the arbitration clause in [the franchise agreement],\" the court should have applied federal law or, alternatively, New York law, when determining whether the defendants timely filed their motion to vacate. In response, the plaintiff argues that the franchise agreement's general choice of law clause clearly requires application of Connecticut law. We agree with the defendants and conclude that the court should have applied federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"We review a [trial] court's decision to confirm or vacate an arbitration award de novo on questions of law and for\n   clear error on findings of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    National Football League Management Council\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    National Football League Players Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255879\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/527/#p536\">\n    820 F.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (2d Cir. 2016) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Imbruce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492061\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1168/#p828\">\n    178 Conn.App. 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492061\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1168/#p828\">\n    177 A.3d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (same). \"Although ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties' intent, is a question of fact ...

In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \"The parties do not dispute the enforceability or scope of the arbitration clause. As a result, paragraph 10 (f) of the [f]ranchise\n   [a]greement is inapplicable to the present proceeding.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Paragraph 10 (f) of the franchise agreement provides in relevant part: \"Any disputes concerning the enforceability ... of the arbitration clause shall be resolved pursuant to the [act] ... and\n   <em>\n    the parties agree that the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    preempts any state law restrictions ... on the enforcement of the arbitration clause in this Agreement\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) By agreeing that the act preempts any state law restrictions on the enforcement of the arbitration clause, the parties have made clear that federal law governs the procedures by which the arbitration clause contained in the franchise agreement is to be enforced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It necessarily follows that the procedure for moving to vacate an arbitration award is governed by federal law. Application of Connecticut's statute of limitations for filing a motion to vacate, pursuant to \u00a7 52-420(b), would contradict the parties contractual intent to use federal law, as expressly agreed to in the franchise agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We acknowledge that the parties agreed that Connecticut law would govern the franchise agreement. Paragraph 13 of the franchise agreement states in relevant\n   part: \"The Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Connecticut, without reference to its conflicts of law,\n   <em>\n    except as may otherwise be provided in this Agreement.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The franchise agreement did, in fact, provide otherwise when it specified, in paragraph 10 (f), that the act preempted any state law restrictions on the enforcement of the arbitration clause. As our Supreme Court has instructed, we must give effect to each provision of the parties' agreement and not read the choice of law clause in isolation from the arbitration clause; see\n   <em>\n    Levine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Advest, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104241\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/732/#p753\">\n    244 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=714%20A.2d%20649\">\n    714 A.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and particular language in a contract must prevail over general.

The defendants' argument in the present case, however, is not that the act, in general, preempts Connecticut law. Rather, they argue that, pursuant to the language of the franchise agreement, the parties agreed that federal law governs, thereby rendering inapplicable any state law restrictions regarding the enforcement of the arbitration clause. In sum, we do not deviate from the established precedent that holds that the act does not preempt state law where the parties agreed to abide by state arbitration rules. In this case, the parties expressly intended and contracted that federal law would apply to any disputes regarding the enforcement of the arbitration clause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Although not binding on this court, the Superior Court decision in\n    <em>\n     Sultar\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-04-0527411-S (October 13, 2004) (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20108\">\n     38 Conn.
