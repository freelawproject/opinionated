Cashman and Patricia Cashman, appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Eric Knapp, the zoning enforcement officer for the town of Clinton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff brought the underlying action against the defendants to enforce orders to discontinue alleged zoning violations occurring at the defendants' property in Clinton. The defendants claim\n   that the court erred in (1) striking their special defenses related to nonconforming uses and (2) granting the plaintiff's motions in limine. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his original complaint dated September 6, 2012, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants, who are the owners of 66 River Road in Clinton, were in violation of several Clinton zoning regulations by virtue of their keeping and raising cows without a permit, constructing a metal corral within fifty feet of the street line and within thirty-five feet of the southeast property line, and utilizing the metal corral as a structure or enclosure in which to keep the cows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff alleged that, on January 26, 2012, he issued a warning of violation to the defendants with respect to their keeping of cows on the property without a permit and that, on March 13, 2012, he issued a warning of violation to the defendants with respect to their placement of the metal corral within the minimum setback requirements and the keeping of cows in the metal corral. The plaintiff further alleged that, on April 16, 2012, he issued to the defendants an order to discontinue their uses of the premises that violated the applicable zoning regulations, that the defendants did not file an appeal from the order within fifteen days of the issuance of the order, and that the defendants had failed to comply with the order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his prayer for relief, the plaintiff sought, inter alia, a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from keeping cows on the subject premises without a permit; a mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to remove the metal corral from the street line setback and to keep any permitted livestock in an appropriate building, stable, or enclosure; and civil penalties authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 for the defendants' failure to comply with the order to discontinue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their answer dated November 5, 2012, the defendants admitted their ownership of the subject premises and, with respect to the remainder of the allegations set forth in the original compliant, either denied the allegations or left the plaintiff to his proof. In a special defense dated November 5, 2012, the defendants alleged in relevant part that \"[t]he complained of activities were nonconforming uses that predate the zoning laws the plaintiff is trying to enforce.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, in a counterclaim\n   dated November 5, 2012, the defendants alleged that the plaintiff, by bringing \"these complaints\" against them, engaged in \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct that caused the defendants \"extreme emotional distress\"; the plaintiff, \"[b]y filing these groundless complaints,\" committed intrusions of a \"highly offensive\" nature against the defendants; and that the plaintiff had engaged in professional malpractice that caused the defendants to suffer damages. The defendants sought, inter alia, money damages and \"[a] court order requiring ... [the plaintiff] to cease harassing, selective enforcement of the zoning regulations against ... [the defendants].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff filed a \"motion to dismiss and/or strike\" with respect to the defendants' counterclaim and special defense. The plaintiff argued that the counterclaim and special defense \"merely seek to contest the validity of a zoning order issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-12, from which the [defendants] did not timely appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-7. Their failure to exhaust that administrative remedy leaves this court without subject matter jurisdiction over their special defense and counterclaim.\" Alternatively, the plaintiff argued that each counterclaim count \"[failed] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the facts alleged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the defendants' objection, and after hearing argument on the motion, the court,\n   <em>\n    Domnarski, J\n   </em>\n   ., by order dated May 10, 2013, granted the plaintiff's motion. In striking the special defense, the court reasoned that it was \"legally insufficient\" because the defendants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. In dismissing \"[a]ll counts of the counterclaim,\" the court likewise relied on the fact that the defendants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, noting that \"[i]n the counterclaim counts, the defendants seek a collateral attack on a zoning determination that they did not appeal from.\" On June 3, 2013, the defendants, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 6-15, filed a notice of intent to appeal from Judge Domnarski's May 10, 2013 dismissal of their entire counterclaim \"until a final judgment rendered in said matter disposes of the case for all purposes and as to all parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the absence of an objection, on July 3, 2013, the plaintiff filed a request for leave to file an amended complaint and an amended complaint for the purpose of incorporating allegations of additional zoning violations at the subject premises. The amended complaint added an additional count to the cause of action. In this second count, the plaintiff sought enforcement with respect to an order to discontinue dated November 15, 2012. In count two, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants engaged in multiple activities on the subject premises in violation of the Clinton zoning regulations. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants \"have sold, and continue to sell, firewood and mulch, or otherwise maintain a retail establishment on the premises\"; \"have brought, and continue to bring, wood, brush, logs, wood chips, branches, and/or leaves onto the site from outside sources to process into firewood and mulch, or otherwise manufacture or process goods, on the premises\"; \"have participated, and continue to participate, in the wholesale of mulch on the premises\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"have stored, and continue to store, heavy equipment, trucks, and small equipment and machinery associated with businesses being conducted at the site on the premises\"; \"have stockpiled, and continue to stockpile, wood materials, including wood, wood chips and compost, beyond what is required for personal use on the premises and in contact with vegetation\"; \"have parked, and continue to park, several commercial vehicles which exceed the maximum vehicle weight limit on the premises\"; \"have parked, and continue to park, more than one commercial vehicle within the vehicle weight limit on the premises\"; \"have stockpiled and stored, and continue to stockpile and store, materials and equipment outside on the premises, including mulch, logs, firewood, log splitters, wood chippers, grinders, vehicles, loaders, and light and heavy construction equipment\"; \"have stored, and continue to store, more than two unregistered vehicles on the premises, including a recreational vehicle, a tractor for a tractor trailer, a dump truck, and an SUV\"; \"have constructed and maintained, and continue to maintain, a shed on the premises without a permit\"; \"have kept, and continue to keep, chickens and ducks on the premises without a permit and in excess of a total of ten\"; \"have conducted, and continue to conduct, a farming operation of raising, keeping and caring for livestock, poultry and ducks on the premises without a permit or special exception\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and have\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"kept, and continue to keep, livestock on the premises without any covered watertight container or containment on site for manure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that all of these activities violated specific zoning regulations, all of which were cited in the complaint; that he issued the defendants a warning of violation on October 18, 2012; that he issued the defendants an order to discontinue on November 15, 2012; that the defendants failed to comply with the order to discontinue; and that the defendants did not file an appeal from the order to discontinue within fifteen days of the issuance of that order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the plaintiff alleged that on March 13, 2013, the defendants notified him \"that they intended to continue to regrind and sell wood chips from the premises,\" and that their conduct constituted a wilful failure to comply with the order to discontinue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his amended complaint seeking enforcement of both orders to discontinue, the plaintiff sought permanent and mandatory injunctive relief related to the defendants' activities on the premises, civil penalties for the defendants' wilful failure to comply with the orders to discontinue dated April 16, 2012, and November 15, 2012, and further just and equitable relief deemed appropriate by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint dated August 22, 2013. Therein, the defendants generally denied\n   the substantive allegations in the amended complaint, or left the plaintiff to his proof. Additionally, the defendants raised three special defenses. In the first special defense, the defendants alleged that, to the extent that the plaintiff alleged that they used the subject premises as a farm, such use was a legally permissible nonconforming use of the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the second special defense, the defendants alleged that, to the extent that the plaintiff alleged that they used the premises as a commercial nursery operation, such use was a legally permissible nonconforming use of the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the third special defense, the defendants, claiming that the plaintiff's conduct led them to believe that their activities at the subject premises were legally permissible, alleged a defense of municipal estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subsequently, on September 6, 2013, the plaintiff filed a request to revise in which he requested that the defendants delete the first and second special defenses in their entirety and, with respect to the third special defense, state the special defense more particularly. In his request to revise, the plaintiff asserted that the first two special defenses were legally improper because they previously had been stricken by Judge Domnarski. Thereafter, on November 22, 2013, the defendants deleted the first and second special defenses in their entirety and repleaded the third special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the revision, on December 24, 2013, the plaintiff moved to strike the repleaded third special defense in its entirety on the grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and was, in part, unresponsive to the request to revise inasmuch as it injected into the special defense a new claim that appeared to challenge the validity of the orders, specifically, that the defendants' use of the subject premises was lawful pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-341.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants filed an opposition to the motion to strike the third special defense. After the court,\n   <em>\n    Aurigemma, J\n   </em>\n   ., heard argument on the motion, on May 21, 2014, it granted the motion. In granting the motion, the court determined, first, that the defendants had failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim of municipal estoppel because they had failed to allege that the plaintiff had induced the defendants to engage in the activities at issue at the subject premises. The court determined, second, that, in their revised answer, the defendants improperly had included revisions that had not been requested by the plaintiff in his request to revise and which were unrelated to the special defense of municipal estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, with respect to the addition of paragraph 10 of the revised third special defense, which raised a claim that was based on \u00a7 19a-341, the court determined that it was improper because it \"alleges preexisting nonconforming use, which has previously been stricken by this court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, prior to the commencement of the trial, the plaintiff filed five motions in limine to preclude the defendants from presenting evidence for the purpose of (1) contesting the validity of the orders to discontinue dated April 16, 2012, and November 15, 2012; (2) proving a defense of municipal estoppel or laches; (3) demonstrating that relevant actions or decisions had been undertaken or made by any Clinton individuals or agencies other than the Clinton zoning authority; (4) demonstrating facts related to police reports and \"claims of false or illegal entries into the record (specifically the zoning office 'street' file) by the plaintiff as zoning enforcement officer\"; and (5) proving a defense of nonconforming farm use of the subject premises. The defendants objected to these motions. The court expressly granted the first, second, fourth, and fifth of these motions, but a ruling on the third motion, related to evidence concerning other agencies or individuals, does not appear in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to the hearing, the parties entered into a joint stipulation of facts, dated April 28, 2015, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(1) The defendants ... purchased the [subject premises] ... and are the current owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(2) The premises is located within a R-80 residential zoning district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"(3) The defendants have kept, and continue to keep, cows on the premises ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"(4) The defendants have constructed a metal corral within fifty feet from the street line and thirty-five feet from the southeast property line....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"(5) On April 16, 2012, the plaintiff issued to the defendants an order to discontinue the keeping of cows within a metal corral, which was constructed and located within the minimum front yard setback for the R-80 zoning district (50 feet) and the minimum side property line setback for the R-80 zoning district (35 feet).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"(6) The defendants did not file an appeal from the order to discontinue to contest its validity within fifteen (15) days after the issuance of said order to discontinue pursuant to ...

The court heard testimony from Lane, Knapp, and Jeffrey Cashman. Additionally, the parties presented several exhibits. On July 30, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision by which it rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, thereby enforcing the plaintiff's orders of April 16, 2012, and November 15, 2012. In its memorandum of decision, the court set forth the parties' stipulation of facts. Additionally, the court found that, after the plaintiff issued the April 16, 2012 order, which described the defendants' right to appeal, \"the parties had discussions, and the defendants agreed to move the cows into the areas that met the setback requirements. The defendants did relocate the cows, but only for a short period of time, [before they] moved them back so that they continued to violate the April 16, 2012 order to discontinue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"On February 1, 2012, the plaintiff issued a warning of violation of sections 7.5, 23.4, 24.1.57 and 4.1.74 of the [Clinton zoning] regulations to the defendants. The warning expressly advised the defendants to '[s]top the manufacturing of wood materials for sale and the stock-piling of wood and debris away from vegetative areas to prevent any possible ignition of the vegetation. Stabilize the site by properly installing erosion controls along all disturbed areas and stockpiles. Stop the import of materials such as logs, wood chips, branches, leaves and other land/tree clearing debris.' After inspection, on February 13,\n   2012, the plaintiff issued a second warning of violations that was identical to the February 1, 2012 warning. Thereafter, the defendants met with the plaintiff and agreed to reduce and eliminate the mulch piles, eliminate the use of outside mulch and provide a place for the animals outside of the setbacks. The defendants also advised the plaintiff in April, 2012, that they had stopped accepting outside wood and wood chips. Thereafter, the defendants violated their agreements and failed to comply with the February warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"After the plaintiff inspected the premises and found that the defendants had not remedied various violations of the zoning regulations, on October 18, 2012, he issued a notice of violations of numerous sections of the regulations. The notice reminded the defendants of their previous agreements to bring the premises into compliance and expressly advised the defendants that their failure to remedy the violations could lead to further legal action and the imposition of penalties under the Connecticut General Statutes. Thereafter, on November\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   15, 2012, the plaintiff issued an order to discontinue, listing the numerous violations of the regulations about which the defendants had previously received notice. This order, like the April order, expressly stated that it 'may be appealed to the [board] within fifteen days of its receipt.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"On March 13, 2013, the defendants' attorney ... sent a letter to ... [the attorney] who represented the plaintiff, advising her that since the Department of [Energy and] Environmental Protection did not require [Jeffrey Cashman] to obtain a permit to regrind and sell wood chips, [Jeffrey Cashman] intended to resume regrinding and selling wood chips on the premises. The letter did not explain how the position of the Department of [Energy and] Environmental Protection had any relevance whatsoever to the violation of the Clinton zoning regulations. On March 28, 2013 ... [another attorney who] also represented the plaintiff, sent a letter to the defendants' attorney ... advising that accepting wood chips for regrinding and sale would constitute a wilful failure to comply with the November 15, 2012 order to discontinue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"On November 13, 2013, the defendants petitioned to amend the Clinton zoning regulations to allow a number of the defendants' activities that are the subject of the orders to discontinue, including the mulching operation. The petition to amend was approved with modification on May 12, 2014. However, the defendants have never even attempted to take advantage of the amended regulations and, unbelievably, have not applied to obtain a special permit exception pursuant to the new regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[Lane] retired as zoning enforcement officer ... and ... [Knapp] became the Clinton [zoning enforcement officer] on May 1, 2014. He inspected the premises and found that almost all of the violations mentioned in the orders to discontinue still existed, including cows in the corral, smoking piles of mulch, and heavy machinery on the premises. [Knapp] testified that [Jeffrey Cashman] has made it clear that he has no intention of complying with the orders at issue. [Jeffrey Cashman's] own testimony made it clear that, essentially, he does not think the zoning regulations should apply to him because he's a farmer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The plaintiff has incurred $16,388.50 in attorney's fees and $412.20 in costs related to this action through May 1, 2015. Since the briefs in this case were filed on June 19, 2015, and July 7, 2015, the plaintiff has undoubtedly incurred additional legal expenses in connection therewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The defendants have stipulated to the majority of the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint. They don't deny that they are\n   in violation of the orders to discontinue and the regulations referenced therein. They just don't believe the orders are valid and/or that the orders should apply to them. However, the defendants may not contest the validity of the orders to discontinue in this zoning enforcement action because they failed to appeal those orders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court proceeded in its analysis to reject the defendants' argument that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiff was inequitable. The court, citing relevant case law, observed that the granting of such relief must be compatible with the equities of the case, and went on to determine that equitable considerations weighed in favor of granting the plaintiff relief. The court stated in relevant part: \"[T]he fact that a party will suffer irreparable harm as a result of a zoning enforcement injunction does not make the injunction inequitable.... In this case ... the court finds that the equities patently lie with the town. The defendants have blatantly and defiantly violated multiple zoning regulations, failing to even attempt to lessen or erase those violations by applying for special permits.\" The court granted the plaintiff injunctive relief with respect to the activities and conditions at the subject premises that were the subject of the plaintiff's orders to discontinue. Moreover, the court ordered the defendants to pay a fine and awarded the plaintiff attorney's fees and costs. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, the defendants claim that Judge Domnarski and Judge Aurigemma erred in striking one of their special defenses, thereby prohibiting them from demonstrating that they had a legally protected right to use the subject premises as a farm on the ground that such use of their property was a nonconforming use that existed prior to the town's amendment of the zoning regulations in 2012 with respect to farms and livestock. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We begin our analysis of this claim by reviewing some of the relevant procedural history set forth previously in this opinion. The record reflects that on May 10, 2013, Judge Domnarski struck the defendants' special defense that was included in their answer dated November 5, 2012, which they had filed in response to the plaintiff's original complaint. This special defense was that the subject property had been classified as farmland under Public Act 63-490 and that the activities described in the April 16, 2012 order to discontinue \"were nonconforming uses that predate the zoning laws the plaintiff is trying to enforce.\" In granting the motion to strike, Judge Domnarski agreed with the plaintiff's arguments and determined that the special defense was \"legally insufficient\" because the defendants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by exercising their right to challenge the validity of the order by appealing it to the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   After the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, the defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint. As we explained previously, the answer to the amended complaint originally contained three special defenses. The defendants deleted the first two of these special defenses in response to the plaintiff's request to revise. Thus, following its revision by the defendants, the answer set forth only one special defense that included a claim of municipal estoppel and a claim that the defendants' activities at the subject premises were protected pursuant to \u00a7 19a-341. In striking this special defense in its entirety, Judge Aurigemma determined that the defendants had failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the plaintiff had engaged in activities that induced\n   them to engage in the conduct at issue at the subject premises. Additionally, Judge Aurigemma concluded that, insofar as the defendants had revised the special defense to include a claim pursuant to \u00a7 19a-341, such revision was legally improper. See footnotes 9 and 10 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In their argument concerning the present claim, the defendants focus solely on whether the court properly precluded them from setting forth their special defense on the basis of farming as a nonconforming use. Specifically, the defendants argue: \"Throughout the record of the case, the defendant[s] [have] attempted to provide evidence that shows, unequivocally, that some, if not all, of the 'violations' existed prior to the revision of the zoning regulations on January 1, 2012, and were legal as of right uses on December 31, 2011. The defendants admittedly failed to appeal the [zoning enforcement officer's] orders to the [board]. The trial court should have [nonetheless] ... allowed the defendants to proceed with their special defenses. Because the defendants' uses were legal nonconforming uses, the defendants were entitled to constitutional protection of those nonconforming uses that were on the property at the time of the amendment to the zoning regulations.\" The defendants proceed to argue that they operated a farm on the subject premises prior to January 1, 2012, that the zoning regulations at issue were amended to prohibit some of the defendants' activities on the subject premises on January 1, 2012, and that the plaintiff began enforcement action against the defendants approximately four months later. Additionally, the defendants argue that \"[t]he facts are clear that once the town revised the regulations, the plaintiff began immediate enforcement against the defendants. Such behavior is a violation of the defendants' statutory and constitutional rights that are attached to property owners with nonconforming uses and, because of the egregious nature of the enforcement and the unconstitutional nature of the result, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies should not apply.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Additionally, in framing their claim, the defendants have referred to rulings made by Judge Domnarski\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Judge Aurigemma. They argue that these rulings \"prohibited [them] from raising the special defenses that they had a legal nonconforming right to use the property as a farm ....\" Turning to the defendants' claim of error as it relates to Judge Aurigemma's ruling, we observe, once again, that, in this appeal, the defendants do not claim that Judge Aurigemma erroneously struck their special defense as it pertained to their claim of municipal estoppel or their reliance on \u00a7 19a-341. Instead, the defendants claim is limited to their assertion of a legally protected right to the nonconforming use of the subject premises as a farm. Although the defendants refer to Judge Aurigemma's ruling in their statement of the claim, they do not identify how Judge Aurigemma's ruling on the motion to strike harmed them or why it was erroneous. As counsel for the defendants acknowledged at oral argument before this court,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Judge Aurigemma did not strike a special defense related to such a nonconforming use of the subject premises because, by the time that Judge Aurigemma ruled on the motion to strike, the defendants had deleted their first and second special defenses (related to nonconforming use) in their response to the plaintiff's request to revise. Thus, any claim of error by the defendants that Judge Aurigemma improperly struck their special defenses related to nonconforming use is belied by a simple review of the record. We are unable to review a ruling that was not made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, we turn to the defendants' claim of error as it relates to Judge Domnarski's ruling striking their special defense that they had a legally protected right to continue to conduct nonconforming farming activities at the subject premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before discussing the propriety of that ruling, we address the plaintiff's argument that the defendants voluntarily waived appellate review of Judge Domnarski's ruling because, following that ruling, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, the defendants filed an answer in response to the plaintiff's amended complaint, and, later, the defendants amended their answer and voluntarily deleted special defenses alleging nonconforming use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is well established in our law that \"[w]hen an amended pleading is filed, it operates as a waiver of the original pleading. The original pleading drops out of the case and although it remains in the file, it cannot serve as the basis for any future judgment, and previous rulings on the original pleading cannot be made the subject of an appeal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lund\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Milford Hospital, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490765\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/479/#p850\">\n    326 Conn. 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490765\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/479/#p850\">\n    168 A.3d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Rockstone Capital, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491278\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/77/#p788\">\n    175 Conn.

Rather, on August 22, 2013, after the plaintiff filed a motion for default for the defendants' failure to file a responsive pleading to the amended complaint, the defendants filed an answer to the plaintiff's July 3, 2013 amended complaint. In their answer to the amended complaint, the defendants included two special defenses of nonconforming use, thereby reasserting the special defense related to farming activities that had been stricken by Judge Domnarski.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his request to revise\n   the answer to the amended complaint, the plaintiff requested that the first and second special defenses be deleted in their entirety as having been \"previously alleged\" by the defendants in their response to his original complaint and having been \"already stricken by Judge Domnarski\" on the ground that the defendants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Although they had a right to object to any or all of the requested revisions; see Practice Book \u00a7 10-37 (b) ; the defendants did not do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, they deleted the special defenses, thereby removing those special defenses from the trial court's consideration in adjudicating the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To clarify the narrow waiver issue before us, we reiterate that, presently, the defendants only challenge Judge Domnarski's ruling in striking their special defense related to farming activities on the subject premises. They deleted their special defense related to commercial nursery activities at the subject premises; see footnote 11 of this opinion; and no ruling was made with respect to that special defense. Moreover, they have not appealed from Judge Aurigemma's ruling striking their special defense that was based on municipal estoppel. The plaintiff's waiver argument is somewhat persuasive, for it is based on the defendants' voluntary decision to delete both their special defenses that were based on nonconforming use in response to the plaintiff's request to revise. The defendants, although failing to address the plaintiff's waiver argument by means of a reply brief, nonetheless rely on Judge Domnarski's ruling as a rationale for their failure to object to the request to revise, an undoubtedly futile endeavor that only would have compelled the court to revisit the issue of the validity of their special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have not discovered any precedent that shares the unique procedural history presented in the present case and, thus, could be considered to be binding authority with respect to the issue. Lacking clearly applicable precedent, we turn to a review of the merits of the claim and conclude that Judge Domnarski's ruling was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is undisputed that the defendants did not exercise their right to appeal to the board from the plaintiff's April 16, 2012 order to discontinue within fifteen days of the receipt of that order. In moving to dismiss and/or strike the special defense at issue, the plaintiff argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the special defense because the defendants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by appealing to board within the time prescribed by the board. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In their written objection to the plaintiff's motion, submitted to the trial court, the defendants argued in relevant part that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply in this case because (1) the special defense was based on a determination that one or more zoning regulations were invalid, specifically, that by virtue of Public Act 63-490, the regulations on which the plaintiff\n   relied are invalid or illegal and did not apply to the subject property, and (2) their special defense was based on the interpretation of a statute, specifically, that it required the court to interpret Public Act 63-490, which, the defendants argued, \"exempts them from the zoning regulations of Clinton by making their property a valid nonconforming use that predates the zoning regulations of Clinton\" and that \"[a] land owner is not required to appeal to an administrative agency where the interpretation of a statute is required.\" During argument on the motion, the defendants' attorney reiterated that the defendants intended by their special defense to challenge the validity of the zoning regulations \"because Public Act 63-490 ... effectively trumps these zoning enforcement regulations\" and that their special defense required the court to interpret Public Act 63-490. The plaintiff reiterated the central premise advanced in his motion, namely, that the special defense at issue raised a garden variety claim of whether the defendants had a nonconforming use and that such issue should have been raised before the board because it was \"clearly within [its] purview.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Before this court, the defendants argue that they wanted to demonstrate that some, if not all, of the conditions and activities at issue on the subject property existed prior to the time that the Clinton zoning regulations were revised on January 1, 2012, such that they were legal on December 31, 2011. The defendants argue that farming uses were \"lightly regulated\" prior to the revisions, but beginning on January 1, 2012, farming uses required a permit. The defendants argue that, as part of proving their special defense, they intended to present evidence to show that they had been operating a farm on the subject premises since 1988 and had constructed the enclosure for cows prior to January 1, 2012, the date when newly enacted regulations prohibiting livestock from being kept within the setback area went into effect. They argue that it was obvious that their farming activities predated the newly enacted regulations and that the plaintiff's conduct, in immediately enforcing the newly enacted zoning regulations with respect to their property was \"egregious\" because their activities clearly were legally protected as nonconforming uses. They argue that \"[s]uch behavior is a violation of the defendants' statutory and constitutional rights that are attached to property owners with nonconforming uses ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendants argue that the present case falls into one of the narrow exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine.

Additionally, the defendants argue that the plaintiff's actions \"raised questions as to whether or not the newly enacted regulation[s] [were] invalid. The [board] was not in a position to make a determination as to whether or not the newly enacted regulation[s] [were] invalid, particularly, in [their] enforcement against the defendants.\" Without citing to any relevant authority,\n   the defendants posit that the issue of whether a nonconforming use existed was simply \"beyond the scope of the [board].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Additionally, relying on\n   <em>\n    Upjohn Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Board of Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549882\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/96/#p104\">\n    224 Conn. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104-105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20A.2d%20793\">\n    616 A.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), the defendants argue that they properly bypassed administrative relief because the plaintiff's \"zoning action [was] so far outside [a] valid exercise of zoning power that public policy dictates that the aggrieved party be allowed to challenge the zoning authority in court.\" In this regard, the defendants rely, in part, on the fact that the plaintiff began his enforcement action soon after the zoning regulations were revised and that the order to discontinue had the effect of \"eliminat[ing]\" their nonconforming right to use the subject property as a farm. At oral argument before this court, the defendants clarified that the timing of the plaintiff's enforcement activities in relation to the revisions to the zoning regulations was sufficient to reflect that the plaintiff's zoning enforcement activities fell so far outside of the lawful or legitimate exercise of zoning power that they should be permitted to challenge the zoning authority in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Thus, the arguments raised by the defendants before Judge Domnarski with respect to exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine differ from those, discussed previously, that the defendants currently advance before this court. Before the trial court, the defendants' exhaustion arguments were dominated by a reliance on Public Act 63-490, an enactment to which the defendants do not even refer in their appellate brief. It would be particularly unfair, both to the trial court and to the plaintiff, for this court to overturn the trial court's ruling on the basis of constitutional and public policy arguments that were neither raised before nor addressed by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even if we were to consider the merits of the arguments on which the defendants currently rely, we would readily conclude that they are not persuasive and, thus, do not afford them a right to bypass the administrative remedies available to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   A motion to strike is the procedural vehicle whereby a party may challenge the legal sufficiency of a special defense and, in ruling on a motion to strike, the court \"must accept as true the facts alleged in the special defenses and construe them in the manner most favorable to sustaining their legal sufficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Barasso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rear Still Hill Road, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"210549\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/64/9/#p13\">\n    64 Conn.

In the present case, the issue raised by the motion to strike concerned the exhaustion doctrine and, thus, the court's subject matter jurisdiction to consider the special defense rather than the legal sufficiency of the special defense. Accordingly, it is appropriate to view and review the ruling as one made in connection with a motion to dismiss. \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss ... is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo....

As the defendants acknowledge ultimately, their special defense was meant to challenge \"the unconstitutional\n   <em>\n    result\n   </em>\n   of the plaintiff's illegal enforcement,\" but not the constitutionality of the regulations that the plaintiff purported to enforce. (Emphasis added.) The defendants' constitutional challenge to the plaintiff's activities does not excuse their failure to avail themselves of the administrative appeal process that was available to them.

The statutory procedure reflects\n   the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board's judgment....

The defendants challenge Judge Domnarski's ruling in striking their special defense, yet the defendants rely on \"facts surrounding [their] decision not to appeal the orders\" that were presented at the time of the trial, well\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the time that Judge Domnarski considered and ruled on the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Having reviewed\n   <em>\n    Upjohn Co\n   </em>\n   . and its progeny, we are not persuaded that the facts of the present case are sufficient to meet the \"very high standard\";\n   <em>\n    Torrington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828546\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/759/#p769\">\n    261 Conn. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20A.2d%201020\">\n    806 A.2d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ; necessary to satisfy the narrow exception to the exhaustion doctrine on which they rely. Stripped of the defendants' rhetoric, their special defense was a means of demonstrating that a nonconforming use existed. The plaintiff, in issuing the order to discontinue,\n   plainly disagreed with the defendants' position in this regard. That a property owner disagreed with the determination of a zoning enforcement officer hardly presents an extraordinary circumstance. Moreover, the defendants have not presented this court with any authority to support their assertion that \"[t]he question of whether any constitutionally protected nonconforming uses [existed] is beyond the scope of the [board].\" The defendants, having been apprised of their right to appeal, chose not to appeal within the time period set by the board. If, as they argue, their farming activities obviously were nonconforming uses of the property following January 1, 2012, they had an ample opportunity to demonstrate that fact before the board. They do not present any compelling reasons why the issue was not the proper subject of an appeal before the board or why, despite any ongoing efforts to persuade the plaintiff to rescind his order, they were unable to bring an appeal. Nothing in the record suggests that the defendants could not have brought a timely appeal before the board while simultaneously continuing to negotiate with the plaintiff in an effort to resolve the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Judge Domnarski's ruling in striking the special defense was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, we consider the defendants' claim that the court improperly granted three of the plaintiff's motions in limine. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As explained previously in this opinion, the plaintiff brought five motions in limine in which he sought to preclude certain evidence. The defendants challenge the court's granting of three of those motions. The first motion pertained to evidence offered for the purpose of challenging the validity of the orders to discontinue dated April 16, 2012, and November 15, 2012. The second motion pertained to evidence offered for the purpose of proving a defense of municipal estoppel or laches. The third motion pertained to evidence offered for the purpose of proving a nonconforming farm use of the subject premises. In his written motions, the plaintiff argued in relevant part that any evidence by which the defendants sought to raise a collateral attack on the orders to discontinue, including any evidence offered to demonstrate that a nonconforming use existed, should be disallowed in light of Judge Domnarski's prior ruling that struck the defendants' special defense, the fact that the defendants had voluntarily withdrawn their special defenses related to nonconforming use in response to his request to revise, and the defendants' failure to appeal the orders to the board. Moreover, the plaintiff argued, in relevant part, that evidence related to the issues of municipal estoppel or laches should be disallowed in light of Judge Aurigemma's prior ruling that struck the defendants' special defense that was related to these issues. Previously in this opinion, we discussed the foregoing procedural history in greater detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The defendants filed a written objection to these motions, in which they argued in relevant part: \"The defendants intend to present evidence which will provide the court with the full history of the defendants' use of the property since they acquired the property in 1987. The defendants intend to present evidence concerning the steps that they have taken to improve their property and utilize it in a manner that they believed was consistent with the zoning regulations then in effect. The defendants intend to present evidence of their responses to the orders to discontinue and their obtaining and providing information concerning the nature of their use.... All of\n   the evidence that the defendants intend to introduce is relevant to the court's central determination as to whether or not the permanent injunction should be granted.\" The defendants argued that because the plaintiff has invoked the court's equitable powers by seeking a permanent injunction with respect to the defendants' farming activities on the subject property, the court was obligated to consider the equities of the case and to assess the gravity and wilfulness of the violation and the potential harm to the defendants. The defendants argued: \"Although the defendants failed to appeal the orders to discontinue, the court must look to the historic use of the property in ruling on whether the equities will be served in granting this injunction.... The evidence that the defendants seek to admit will provide the court with evidence that is necessary for the determination regarding the gravity and wilfulness of the violation as well as the potential harm [to the] defendants. The evidence will include the historic use of the property, the plaintiff's inspections of the property, town regulation of the property and the defendants' responses to the orders to discontinue.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Initially, during oral argument on the motions, the defendants' attorney argued in relevant part: \"I disagree that we cannot challenge the validity of the orders [to discontinue] because the court has the ultimate discretion as to whether or not those orders should be upheld and turned into permanent injunctions in favor of the town.\" The defendants' attorney argued that the evidence at issue, with respect to nonconforming use, was necessary so that the court would have \"a full picture\" of all of the facts surrounding the orders to discontinue and that such evidence was relevant to the equitable issues before the court in determining whether it should grant the plaintiff permanent injunctive relief. Later, the defendants' attorney appeared to have modified his argument slightly by stating that the defendants did not intend \"necessarily\" to challenge the validity of the orders to discontinue, but to present evidence that was relevant to a determination of what injunctive relief, if any, was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   During oral argument on the motions, the plaintiff's attorney argued in relevant part that, despite the equitable considerations that were before the court, the defendants' position, that they should be allowed to present evidence in an attempt to demonstrate a nonconforming farm use or to otherwise challenge the validity of the orders to discontinue, would permit them, effectively, to transform the case into the administrative appeal that the defendants chose not to pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   With respect to the motions in limine pertaining to evidence of nonconforming use or evidence that otherwise would effectively challenge the validity of the orders to discontinue, the court,\n   <em>\n    Aurigemma, J\n   </em>\n   ., agreed with the plaintiff's arguments and granted the motions in limine related to such evidence. The court stated that the defendants had not pursued an administrative appeal. With respect to the motion in limine pertaining to the special defense of estoppel or laches, the plaintiff's attorney observed that the court already had stricken the special defense of the defendants to which such evidence would have pertained. The defendants' attorney acknowledged that the parties already had presented relevant arguments in this regard in the context of the motion to strike that special defense. The court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Presently, the defendants argue that the court's rulings were erroneous because in so ruling the court prohibited them from presenting an equitable defense to the zoning\n   enforcement action. The defendants argue: \"In this case, although the defendants failed to appeal the orders to discontinue, the court must look to the historic use of the property in ruling on whether the equities will be served in granting this injunction.\" They argue: \"The evidence that the defendants attempted to admit would have provided the trial court with evidence that was necessary for the determination regarding the gravity and wilfulness of the violation as well as the potential harm to the [defendants].... [T]he evidence will include the historic use of the property, the plaintiff's inspections of the property, town regulation of the property and the defendants' responses to the orders to discontinue.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Additionally, the defendants argue: \"In the present matter, the defendants failed to appeal the cease and desist orders due to their belief that the matters would be amicably resolved. We do not believe that the mere failure to timely appeal the matter is sufficient to have the nonconforming uses extinguished. In reviewing the orders, it does not appear as though [the] plaintiff ever considered the property was a farm or understood that the farm use was permitted without a zoning permit until December 31, 2011.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Primarily, the plaintiff argues that the defendants have failed to claim, let alone demonstrate, that the court's rulings were harmful such that the disallowed evidence likely would have affected the result of the trial. Also, the plaintiff argues that the court's rulings reflected a proper exercise of its discretion because the equitable nature of the proceeding did not limit the court's discretion in the manner claimed by the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The defendants urge us to review the court's rulings de novo because the court based its evidentiary rulings on its resolution of a question of law, specifically, whether their failure to exhaust their administrative remedies precluded them from presenting \"any evidence concerning their historic use of the property or the regulations that had been in effect on December 31, 2011.\" Also, the defendants argue that the rulings require that we review questions of law, including \"whether the defendants were entitled to a constitutional review of the elimination of the nonconforming rights, whether the plaintiff's actions deprived the defendants of constitutionally protected rights and whether this constitutional question presents an exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule.\" The plaintiff urges us to apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review to the claimed errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here, it is apparent that the court determined that the evidence at issue was inadmissible because (1) the defendants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, (2) Judge Domnarski previously struck the special defense of nonconforming use, and (3) the court previously struck the special defense of equitable estoppel. The defendants urge us to reconsider whether the evidence at issue related to the historic use of the subject property, the zoning regulations in effect on December 31, 2011, and estoppel nonetheless was admissible in the present enforcement action. We note, however, that we already have determined in part I of this opinion that the court properly struck the special defense of farming as a nonconforming use, and the defendants do not challenge Judge Aurigemma's ruling that struck their special defense that was based on estoppel. At no time did the court strike the voluntarily deleted special defense of operating a commercial nursery as a nonconforming use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We recognize that the function performed by the court in issuing the challenged\n   evidentiary ruling dictates our scope of review. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730505\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/207/#p219\">\n    283 Conn. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20A.2d%20633\">\n    926 A.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Regardless of whether we review the rulings under a plenary standard of review or under an abuse of discretion standard of review, it remains the defendant's burden on appeal to demonstrate that the court's evidentiary rulings were harmful. \"[B]efore a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.... The harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result.... When judging the likely effect of such a trial court ruling, the reviewing court is constrained to make its determination on the basis of the printed record before it....
