On September 22, 2006, a jury convicted Appellant of the above-mentioned crimes. The trial court sentenced Appellant on November 15, 2006 to an aggregate term of imprisonment of ten to 20 years. Sentence Order, 11/15/06. A panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on July 16, 2008, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Appellant's petition for allowance of appeal on April 1, 2009.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Thus, as early as October 11, 2012, Appellant was advised by his second counsel that she did not have the documents requested and that, if Attorney O'Keefe did not have the documents (a fact which Appellant knew as he alleged that he repeatedly requested documents from Attorney O'Keefe starting in 2006 and received only one transcript), he should contact his co-defendant's lawyer to see if he had copies of the desired materials. Apparently, that is what Appellant ultimately did as he alleges in his PCRA petition that he received a copy of the relevant jury\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   transcript from his co-defendant, Lamont Childs, on December 31, 2013, more than one year after he was advised by Attorney Cherniack to contact his co-defendant's counsel to see if he had the requested materials.

Thus, Appellant's own petition indicates that he knew about juror # 2 and had been seeking a background report on the juror in question for over a year. Moreover, Appellant fails to explain why Anthony Murphy was the sole source of juror # 2's criminal history or why he did not pursue other avenues when there was a delay in obtaining the requested information from Mr. Murphy. Hence, the\n   record does not support the conclusion that Appellant acted with due diligence in obtaining the newly discovered facts upon which he now relies.
