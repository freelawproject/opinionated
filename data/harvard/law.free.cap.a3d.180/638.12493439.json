In his petition, the petitioner claimed that his trial counsel, John Paul Carroll, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him before trial of the state's offer that he resolve the charges against him by pleading guilty to felony murder in exchange for a recommended sentence of twenty-five years to serve. The habeas court rejected that claim on the ground that, although Carroll had indeed rendered constitutionally deficient performance by failing to advise the petitioner of the state's twenty-five year plea offer, the petitioner had not been prejudiced by that deficient performance. Specifically, the court concluded that he had not proved, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that he would have accepted the offer had Carroll conveyed it to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that he had not been prejudiced by Carroll's constitutionally deficient performance because there was no evidence in the record tending to show that he would not have accepted the offer, and, thus, the court's finding to that effect was entirely speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although we are troubled by the facts of this case concerning Carroll's deficient performance, we must keep in mind that, in assessing the habeas court's finding as to prejudice, \"[i]t is simply not the role of this court on appeal to second-guess credibility determinations made by the habeas court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Noze\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491483\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/525/#p887\">\n    177 Conn.

Moreover, in response to a question about whether the petitioner would have accepted responsibility in exchange for the plea offer of twenty-five years, the petitioner testified: \"If I was offered a-a small amount of time ...

The court concluded that, although the petitioner had proved that Carroll's performance was deficient, he had not proved that such deficient performance had caused him prejudice.

The petitioner argues that the court's credibility determination, rejecting his testimony that he would have accepted the plea had Carroll conveyed it to him, is closely intertwined with its affirmative finding that the petitioner would have rejected the plea offer. He further contends that the affirmative finding is based on pure speculation, as there is no evidence in the record to support it, and thus it is clearly erroneous. The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, asserts that, after rejecting the petitioner's testimony that he would have accepted the plea offer had Carroll conveyed it to him, the court properly concluded that the petitioner failed to prove the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree with the petitioner's argument that the court's affirmative finding is\n   inseparable from its credibility determination, which led it to reject his testimony that he would have accepted the plea offer.

Our reading of the memorandum of decision indicates that the court first rejected the petitioner's testimony that he would have accepted the offer for the following reasons: (1) it was self-serving; (2) it was the only evidence in the record that the petitioner would have accepted the offer; and (3) because what the petitioner would do at the time of the hearing, knowing the outcome of his trial, was different from what he would have done at the time of his sentencing. This was sufficient to support the court's determination that the petitioner had not established prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A review of the record shows no evidence independent of the petitioner's own testimony that he would have accepted the state's plea offer had Carroll conveyed it to him. In fact, his testimony on that issue was at most equivocal. For example, in response to the court's question on that subject, he testified that if Carroll had explained the maximum penalties he was facing, he thought that he would have \"ended up takin[g] the twenty-five [years] rather than ... go to trial.\" Because, to reiterate, \"[i]t is simply not the role of this\n   court on appeal to second-guess credibility determinations made by the habeas court\";\n   <em>\n    Noze\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491483\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/525/#p887\">\n    177 Conn.

In fact, [Davenport] stated at the petitioner's sentencing that until he saw the petitioner's [presentence investigation report] he thought the petitioner's involvement warranted a sentence close to the minimum of twenty-five years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \"Second, [Carroll] advised the petitioner that the case was winnable. Thus, the petitioner, as a seventeen year old, would have had to weigh a certain twenty-five year sentence against the possibility of an acquittal and a likely slightly longer sentence if convicted. The court concludes that under those circumstances the petitioner would have likely rejected the state's offer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \"Third, the petitioner was not new to the criminal justice system. In addition to the charges on which he was convicted, he had two other pending charges, which the state nolled after the petitioner was sentenced. He also had an extensive juvenile [criminal] history including twelve separate dispositions between 1997 and 1999. Given his experience, it is unfathomable that he did not understand that plea negotiations regularly take place in criminal matters. Consequently, his testimony that he did not know he could ask his attorney if the state was willing to make an offer was not credible. His admitted failure to ask [Carroll] about a plea offer only buttresses the court's conclusion that he was not interested in pleading guilty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \"Fourth, while incarcerated pending trial, the petitioner received a number of disciplinary tickets for fighting, giving false information, disorderly conduct, causing a disruption, and disobeying a direct order. Knowing that such conduct would reflect badly on him if convicted, the fact that the petitioner engaged in it nonetheless shows a lack of judgment that would have led him to reject an offer from the state, even if it was in his best interest to accept it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \"Finally, even when given an opportunity at sentencing to take some responsibility for his actions and thereby do himself some good with the court, the petitioner elected not to do so. The court all but pleaded with the petitioner to say something, but the petitioner chose to remain silent. Such a position is inconsistent with the petitioner's claim that he would have willingly pleaded guilty, accepted responsibility for his role in the crimes, and agreed to a sentence of twenty-five years to serve.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The respondent maintains that the court's affirmative finding is not clearly erroneous, but argues that it is distinct from the court's credibility determination. Therefore, we interpret the respondent's argument to be that on the basis of the court's credibility determination alone, we must affirm the judgment, regardless of what we conclude regarding the affirmative finding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Our conclusion is based on the court's credibility determination and the reasons provided to support it, specifically, that the petitioner's testimony is the only evidence in the record supporting his claim, the petitioner's testimony is self-serving, and what the petitioner would do now is different from what the petitioner would have done at the time of his sentencing. Because the court's rejection of the petitioner's testimony, and its rationale for doing so, are sufficient to resolve this appeal, we need not decide the viability of the court's affirmative finding and the five reasons detailed to support it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
