(temporarily assigned).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter presents the unresolved issue of whether the contingent attorney's fee limitation on minors' settlements imposed by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c)(6) applies to a minor plaintiff's settlement of claims under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -42, and the New Jersey Civil Rights Act (NJCRA), N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, if the plaintiff does not apply for a fee-shifting award of attorney's fees pursuant to\n   N.J.S.A. 10:5-27.1 or N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(f). The trial court held the contingent fee is subject to the limitation imposed by the rule. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record on appeal establishes that during the 2011-2012 school year, A.W. was a fifth grade student at Folwell Elementary School in Mount Holly Township. During that year, A.W. reported incidents of repeated bullying and intimidation by other students to the school's principal. The following school year, A.W. enrolled at F.W. Holbein Middle School, also located in Mount Holly Township. Her mother, B.W., informed the school's administrators of the abuse A.W. endured during the previous school year. Despite the alert, the bullying resumed once A.W. began attending F.W. Holbein. A.W. alleged she was subjected to ongoing harassment, intimidation, and bullying by other students, which continued on a near daily basis until, following a recommendation from her physician, she was placed on homebound instruction in October 2013. She ultimately transferred to a private school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.W. claimed the harassment she experienced was a manifestation of gender or perceived disability discrimination. Even after complaints to school officials, the harassment allegedly continued on a daily basis without investigation or appropriate action by school administrators. A.W. further claimed the bullying and intimidation, coupled with the school's failure to prevent or deter the harassment, caused her to suffer severe emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.W. retained appellant Costello &amp; Mains, LLC to represent her in her claims against defendant Mount Holly Township Board of Education (the Board). On January 2, 2014, B.W., as natural parent and guardian of A.W., entered into an eighteen-page retainer agreement with appellant. The agreement provides for a forty-five percent contingent fee or, in the alternative, a fee based on prescribed hourly rates, whichever would be greater. The fee provisions of the agreement state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   These are contingent matters, in that the fee arises only in the event of successful conclusion by way of settlement or verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   You have asked the firm to represent you in a matter which involves a\n   claim or claims made under either New Jersey State or Federal statutes which provide for \"fee shifting.\" These statutes provide that for a claim such as yours, you are entitled to \"shift\" your legal fees and most litigation costs to the wrong-acting defendant and make an application to the Court upon successful trial of your matter to have that fee added to your recovery. The foreknowledge on the part of defendant(s) that it/they might have to pay this fee in addition to any recovery by you is also a consideration in any negotiation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It is important that you understand that\n   <em>\n    the fact that this statutory provision exists does not relieve you of the obligation to pay fees to the firm, potentially from any recovery by you\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In such matters, it is customary for the firm to keep accurate, hourly billing records as the matter progresses toward trial. If at some point an offer to settle the matter is made and the offer is made as a \"lump sum\" by the defendant, you agree that the firm will be compensated in the following manner:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The firm will get\n   <em>\n    either 45% (forty five percent)\n   </em>\n   of the total settlement figure after costs are deducted\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   its hourly rate accumulated to that point after costs are deducted,\n   <em>\n    whichever is greater, but not both\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If the offer made to settle the case is made with one component for you and a separate component for the firm's fees, you agree that those components will be combined in order to determine what the total recovery is for purposes of determining the firm's\n   <em>\n    45%\n   </em>\n   fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If the matter proceeds to trial or arbitration and a fee award is made by a Court, arbitrator or other competent trier of fact and law, you agree that the fee awarded to the firm will be\n   <em>\n    added to\n   </em>\n   the totality of your recovery for purposes of determining what your\n   <em>\n    total recovery\n   </em>\n   is with respect to the calculation of the firm's\n   <em>\n    45%\n   </em>\n   . This is so because \"attorney[']s fees\" are part of the relief\n   <em>\n    due to you\n   </em>\n   at the close of such cases, and these fees thus form a part of\n   <em>\n    your relief and recovery\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The agreement further enumerates the hourly rates charged by the firm's attorneys and paralegals and also contains an additional provision permitting appellant to request a still higher fee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The firm retains the right under New Jersey Court Rules to request a fee that is higher than those provided for in this agreement, if in the firm's judgment, the firm has performed work that is in excess and thus disproportionate to the fee that it has earned. You have the right to oppose such an application or to consent to such an application if one is made. The firm will advise you if one is being made and will provide you with a copy of it at the appropriate time. The [c]ourt, arbitrator or other competent trier of fact or law retains the final decision as to whether or not a higher or additional fee is to be provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 24, 2014, plaintiff filed a three-count complaint against the Board, alleging violations of the LAD and NJCRA and demanding judgment for compensatory and punitive damages,\n   costs of suit, attorney's fees, enhanced attorney's fees, and equitable relief. Following the filing of defendant's answer, the parties engaged in discovery, which concluded on August 15, 2015. The Board then moved for summary judgment, which was denied on January 22, 2016. Shortly thereafter, the parties reached a tentative settlement, inclusive of attorney's fees and costs, in the amount of $100,000, subject to the Board's approval. The proposed settlement precluded plaintiff from applying for an award of attorney's\n   fees and costs from defendant under the fee-shifting provisions of the LAD or NJCRA. On March 9, 2016, the Board approved the settlement. The parties then agreed on the terms of a general release, which was to be executed along with a stipulation of dismissal upon approval of the settlement by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because A.W. was still a minor, appellant requested the trial court conduct a \"friendly hearing\" pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:44. Although\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c)(6) imposes a twenty-five percent limit on contingent fees in cases involving minor plaintiffs, appellant sought approval of the forty-five percent contingent fee provided for in the retainer agreement without moving for approval of the fee pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(f). Plaintiff did not oppose the fee sought by appellant. During the hearing, appellant elicited testimony from A.W. substantiating the merits of the complaint and testimony from B.W. regarding her understanding of the settlement. B.W. testified she understood the overall settlement amount was $100,000, the amount of costs incurred was $4692.33, and appellant's fee would be $42,888.45 pursuant to the contingent fee arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.W. further testified she understood she was under no obligation to enter into the settlement and had the right to refuse to settle and proceed to trial, which could potentially have resulted in a greater recovery. She also testified the amount of the settlement was fair and she was satisfied with the services performed by appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.W. did not testify she understood a prevailing plaintiff could apply to the court for an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs to be paid by defendant under the fee-shifting provisions of\n   the LAD and NJCRA. She also did not testify regarding the decision not to seek attorney's fees and costs from defendant in order to expedite a settlement. Nor was there testimony confirming she understood A.W.'s right to seek fee-shifting was being forfeited under the terms of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In an exchange with the trial court, appellant confirmed it interpreted\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c) to mean it could charge any percentage contingent fee, even fifty-five percent, assuming the client agreed to that rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court approved the settlement amount, finding it to be reasonable, but declined to award the forty-five percent contingent fee sought by appellant. At appellant's request, the judge refrained from entering a ruling as to the contingent fee and allowed appellant to make an application to enforce the contingent fee retainer agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellant then moved for an order approving its forty-five percent contingent fee but did not apply for, or submit materials in support of, an enhanced fee under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(f). Plaintiff did not oppose the motion. Appellant renewed its argument that the language of the rule excludes fee-shifting cases, like those brought under the LAD and NJCRA, from the fee limitations imposed by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c). Appellant contended there is no limit on the contingent fee percentage in LAD and NJCRA actions so long as the client agrees. In support of its argument, appellant relied on\n   <em>\n    Szczepanski v. Newcomb Medical Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306047\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/346/\">\n    141 N.J. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306047\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/346/\">\n    661 A.2d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) and\n   <em>\n    Venegas v.

The judge engaged in the following analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Factually, the record shows that counsel settled this case in consultation with the minor's parents who were aware of the forty-five percent contingent fee provision\n   in their fee agreement with counsel's firm. Furthermore, they were also\n   in full agreement with counsel that they were under no obligation to enter into the settlement and could proceed to trial if they chose not to settle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   According to counsel, in the course of the settlement with the defendant, there was an apparent determination not to seek counsel fee-shifting against the defendant in order to expedite a settlement. The reasoning however, was not discussed with the minor's mother on the record at the \"friendly\" hearing, and no proof showing that the minor's parents were aware that fee-shifting was effectively being forfeited has been provided to the court....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   However, there is a hidden benefit to counsel by waiving the right to fee-shifting in certain circumstances. Under counsel's strict and literal interpretation of the contingent fee rule exclusions, an attorney applying for an excessive contingent fee percentage seemingly protected by the [\n   <em>\n    Rule]\n   </em>\n   1:21-7(c) exclusion language is in a position to receive a significantly larger fee without having to demonstrate the Lodestar analysis\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as required under [\n   <em>\n    Rendine v. Pantzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    141 N.J. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    661 A.2d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ] and without having to apply for and justify an enhanced fee under [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7(f). An award under such an analysis may be well below the unlimited contingent fee percentage. The downside is that the significant fee, rather than being justified and approved by the court and shifted on to the defendant, is instead contractually shifted back onto the client-in this case, a fifteen year-old whom counsel represents. Such a circumstance could reasonably pose a conflict as to what is in the best interest of the client against what is in the best financial interest for the lawyer-a conflict where the latter should not prevail. This potential abuse could not have been intended by the drafters of the exclusionary language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The forty-five percent contingent fee application by counsel, even if counsel's argument is appropriate under the rule, and even with the consent of his clients, does not strip the obligation of a court to scrutinize a settlement and fees for a minor or mentally incapacitated person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [ (citations and footnotes omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The judge awarded appellant a fee of twenty-five percent of the net recovery, reasoning it was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   a fair and reasonable outcome for a settled case after a motion for summary judgment was denied and the plaintiff chose not to go to trial. As previously mentioned, had counsel limited his fee to twenty-five percent he would have still been able to apply for an enhancement to the fee in accordance to [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7(f), which would have necessarily been scrutinized by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, in circumstances where the causes of action are discrimination based within the context of the fee limitation exclusion language under [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7(c)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   where there is no pursuit by counsel of fee-shifting under those respective statutes, and counsel alternatively pursues a contingent fee percentage, such\n   percentage should be limited in compliance with the maximum fee limitations within the rule. In other words, where fee-shifting occurs, the [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7(c) fee imitations do not apply as per the exclusion language. However, if counsel chooses to obtain fees alternatively through a percentage\n   contingent fee agreement, then such limitations should apply, absent an enhanced fee application as provided for ... under the court rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, under the circumstances of this case, the court finds that the fee itself is an unreasonable overreaching. The minor's settlement following the failed summary judgment motion without a trial, after the forty-five percent fee reduction and costs, is only slightly above fifty percent of the total $100,000 settlement. This is an unconscionable result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   While counsel contends that the limitations of [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7 do not apply in this case, even if true, the twenty-five percent limitation for minors contained in the rule provides guidance as to the reasonableness determination of such an agreement. Here, nothing has been provided to the court to show the reasonableness of the forty-five percent fee other than the assertions made by counsel that the fee limitations mechanically do not apply and the minor's parents were aware of the fee percentage. Nothing, however, was discussed with the minor's parent at the \"friendly\" hearing regarding the possibility of fee-shifting or that it was being forfeited as a result of the settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The court is well within its rights to award a different fee percentage when the fee agreement is determined to be unreasonable. In light of the absence of proof submitted to the court as to whether the parents of the minor were fully aware that they were forfeiting fee-shifting and the lack of any other proof regarding the reasonableness of the fee agreement, the court concludes the agreement to be an unreasonable overreaching.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [ (citation omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This appeal followed. Appellant argues \"the trial court erroneously applied [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:21-7(c)\" by \"rewriting the contract entered into between plaintiff and her counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ordinarily, our review of a trial court's decision concerning a fee is limited. Such fee determinations by trial courts should be disturbed \"only on the rarest occasions, and then only because of a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Rendine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    141 N.J. at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    661 A.2d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Packard-Bamberger &amp; Co. v.
