A portion of the road's present location is on or within land owned in fee simple by the Trust. The history of the road dates back to the nineteenth century. In 1825, the Town accepted the road, which then was 770 rods long and three rods wide. Sixty years later, in 1885, the Town issued a notice that the municipal officers intended to extend the road, and in 1887, the road was extended by approximately 262 rods for the \"use of said town\" and ended \"at the Island.\" As with the original part of the road, the extension was three rods wide. In 1944, a portion of the road was washed out, prompting the Town, the following year, to lay out a new section of the road, in order to bypass the damaged portion, from \"a point in the center of the old road ... to the bar that goes to [the] Island,\" a distance of \"800 feet long and 20 feet wide.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In 2013, the Town commissioned a survey of the road's boundaries. The survey revealed that \"a small portion of the existing traveled way for Rogers Point Road stray[ed] outside the bounds of the right of way as laid out by the Town in 1825, 1887 and 1944[.]\" In 2015, the Trust filed a declaratory judgment action against the Town to establish the legal status, including title, to the portion of the road laid out on its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In April of 2016, while the declaratory judgment action was pending, the Town issued a warrant for a special town meeting that presented, in relevant part, two alternative articles for the Town's residents' consideration. One article would authorize the Town to settle the declaratory judgment action by discontinuing the road in exchange for $150,000 to be paid by the Trust. The second article would authorize a taking of an interest in the road by eminent domain, pursuant to 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3023,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"in order to confirm that the boundaries of the Town's right-of-way for that town way are coincident with the existing traveled way,\" which terminates at\n   the end of a point of land that is surrounded by a saltwater bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] At the resulting town meeting held in May of 2016, voters rejected the settlement option and instead authorized the Town to take, by eminent domain, the traveled part of the road. Having been given the voters' approval, in August of 2016 the Town Selectmen issued a notice of an intent to take an interest in the road by eminent domain. That same month, the Town also commissioned a second boundary survey to depict the \"right of way layout\" of the road. After a second public hearing, held on August 31, 2016, the Selectmen signed an Order of Condemnation, ordering the taking of an interest in approximately 4,000 square feet of private property to \"confirm\" the road's boundaries, based on public exigency or, alternatively, defective title to the road. Of the total area taken by the Town, 2,470 square feet are located on the Trust's land, and the remainder is located on an abutting parcel owned by the Sherwoods,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.1. The Selectmen also directed that $1,020.60 would be paid to the Trust as just compensation for the taking. The Certificate of Taking, Affidavit of Title, and Order of Condemnation were timely filed and recorded with the Washington County Registry of Deeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3024 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80B, the Trust filed a complaint, subsequently amended, in the Superior Court, alleging that the Town's taking of an interest in the road was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the Town's decision, and the Trust timely appealed to us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3029 (2017) ; M.R. Civ.

Public Exigency\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 9] In addressing a challenge to a public taking, we review directly the municipality's decision for a rational basis to support the finding of public exigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portland Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299563\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/979/1279/\">\n    2009 ME 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299563\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/979/1279/\">\n    979 A.2d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three subsidiary findings are necessary to support a finding of a public exigency: \"the taking was necessary; the property interest was taken only to the extent necessary; and the property is suitable for the particular public use for which it was taken.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299563\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/979/1279/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Regarding the first of these elements that bear on the existence of a public exigency, we engage in only a limited review of a municipality's determination that a taking is necessary; we look to whether the taking \" 'was made in bad faith or through an abuse of power.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dyer v.

Additionally, the road's physical location had changed from the boundaries as laid out in 1825 because of the 1887 extension and the 1944 wash-out. The resulting deviation between the record boundaries and a small portion of the physical location of the traveled area of the road was revealed by the 2013 survey. These circumstances reasonably prompted the Town to lay out new boundaries for a relatively small portion of the road. As a result of the historical changes affecting the road, and consistent with a municipality's authorization to take property for \"highway purposes,\" which includes the \"alignment\" of town ways,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3021(1) (2017), the Town decided to align the road's record boundaries with its actual location on the face of the earth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Also, prior to the taking, the Town issued a public notice of a town meeting to address two articles related to the road. At the public meeting, residents overwhelmingly approved the proposed article that authorized Town officials to take an interest in the land consisting of the traveled part of the road that was outside of the road's record description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Therefore, the reasons for the taking and the governmental process that led to it demonstrate that the Town neither acted in bad faith nor abused its power in making the necessity determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Second, the Trust has not made any argument that the taking exceeded what was necessary to align the record description of the road with the road's physical location, as is shown by the record description of the taking being confined to the traveled area of the road. As stated in the Order of Condemnation, the existing road \"strays outside the bounds of the right of way as laid out by the Town in 1825, 1887 and 1944[.]\" This assertion is supported by the historical documents from 1825, 1887, and 1945, and by the boundary surveys conducted in 2013 and 2016. Therefore, the taking satisfied the second element of the public exigency analysis because the Town took an interest in only that portion of the Trust's property-approximately 2,470 square feet-that\n   was needed to accomplish the purpose of the taking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3021(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Third and finally, the record demonstrates that the property at issue is suitable for current use as a public way, as shown by evidence demonstrating that the road was established as a public town way and remains a town way used by the public today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Because the record supports each element of the public exigency framework, there is a rational basis in the record to support the Town's finding of a public exigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portland Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299563\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/979/1279/\">\n    2009 ME 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299563\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/979/1279/\">\n    979 A.2d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We now turn to the second question, namely, whether the taking is also supported by the Town's determination that the taking is for a public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B. Public Use\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Appellate review of a taking of private property for public use presents a mixed question of law and fact.

Indeed, the Trust itself acknowledges that \"the alleged public way laid out by the Town of Steuben is a public road, only in the sense that it was laid out by a municipality and the public has the legal right to access it.\" The purpose of the taking was to establish that the road over which the public has the right to travel is within the record boundaries of what the\n   Trust itself describes as the public's \"legal right of access.\" In this way, the evidence in the record, confirmed by the Trust's characterization of the public's right to use the road, definitively establishes that the interest in the road was taken for a public use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 21] The Trust also asserts that the road is not public because it is functionally a \"private driveway\" servicing the Sherwood property.

Further, some of the documents and notices-including some quoted in this opinion-that were issued by the Town and resulted in the taking specified that the Town intended to take only an easement interest. Despite having had the opportunity to do so, the Trust has not disputed or otherwise challenged this assertion.

Because the parties have not argued this aspect of the taking, we need not and do not address it here but rather refer to the nature of the taken interest only in generic terms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Section 3023 provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] municipality may take property ... for highway purposes if the municipal officers determine that public exigency requires the immediate taking of such property interests, or if the municipality is unable to purchase it at what the municipal officers deem reasonable valuation, or if title is defective.\" 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3023.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The judgment before us, which affirms the taking, is a final judgment even though it does not encompass the question of the amount of damages to be paid to the Trust. The procedure governing a taking by eminent domain itself is prescribed in 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3023, which permits judicial review of a taking in a proceeding that is separate from and independent of any challenge to damages occasioned by the taking. In contrast, proceedings relating to damages, including any appeal of a determination of damages, are governed by 23 M.R.S. \u00a7 3029 (2017), which provides, \"Any person aggrieved\n    <em>\n     by the determination of the damages awarded\n    </em>\n    to owners of property or interests therein under this chapter may, within 60 days after the day of taking, appeal to the Superior Court in the county where the property lies.\" (Emphasis added.) On an appeal to the Superior Court from a damages award, a jury or, with the parties' consent, the court then determines damages.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12023264\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/697/1280/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because the Legislature has created two distinct procedural mechanisms triggered by a taking-one that concerns the taking itself, and the other limited to resulting damages-the former is justiciable on its own.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Frustaci v.

App. P. 1 (restyled Rules).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Trust contends-despite its recognition that the public has an existing right of access over the road-that the road is not public because it does not lead to a destination where the members of the public are entitled to go. The terminus of the road, however, is a bar at the end of a point of land owned by the Sherwoods. As the Town's Order of Condemnation recites, the general public uses the road to get to the intertidal area located on the Sherwoods' land. The nature and extent of the public's use of the road for this particular purpose does not determine the outcome of this appeal because the public nature of the way itself, which is acknowledged by the Trust, allows members of the public to travel-for its own sake-over the road, irrespective of what those people are entitled to do beyond the end of the road.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
