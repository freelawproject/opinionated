On appeal, he claims that\n   the court erred in: (1) rejecting his claim that his due process right to a fair trial under the state and federal constitutions was violated by the introduction of testimony from an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at his underlying criminal trial, which was later determined to be scientifically invalid; and (2) concluding that his habeas counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's appeal. In 2000, following a jury trial during which the petitioner was represented by Attorney Robert Field, the petitioner was convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), and five counts of tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151. The petitioner was sentenced to a total effective sentence of ninety years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The petitioner appealed from the judgment of conviction, and this court set forth the facts underlying his conviction. \"At 6 a.m., on January 18, 1999, the [petitioner] called Nicole Harris and asked her to drive from Bridgeport to Danbury to pick up his cousin, Tommie L. Martin. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Harris and the [petitioner] picked up Tommie Martin in Danbury. Harris then drove Tommie Martin and the [petitioner] to a gasoline station located next to Gallo's Hi-Way Package Store (Gallo's) in Danbury. After filling Harris' brown Chevrolet Chevette with gas, Harris drove along the street, passing Gallo's, and turned onto the street next to Gallo's, where she parked. The [petitioner] and Tommie Martin left Harris' vehicle and went toward Gallo's. After five minutes, the [petitioner] and Tommie Martin returned to the vehicle and Tommie Martin told Harris to drive around the block. When the vehicle was in front of Gallo's, Tommie Martin told Harris to drive by slowly. As Tommie Martin peered into Gallo's, he said, '[h]e's by himself,' and the [petitioner] responded, 'I have my heat on me, we'll go back in.' Tommie Martin told Harris to turn her vehicle around and park next to Gallo's. The [petitioner] and Tommie Martin left the vehicle and returned ten minutes later with bottles of E &amp; J brandy. When they reentered the vehicle, Tommie Martin told Harris to drive onto the highway. While driving toward Bridgeport, the [petitioner] and Tommie Martin talked excitedly and were asking each other, '[W]as it worth it?' Shortly thereafter, police were called to the liquor store, where they found the victim, Robert Gallo, lying motionless, having been shot multiple times. The cash register had been disturbed, and two bottles of E &amp; J brandy were missing. Gallo died as a result of his injuries. The [petitioner] subsequently told Harris that he and Tommie Martin were involved in the robbery and shooting at Gallo's.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366834\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/77/778/#p781\">\n    77 Conn.

In his amended petition, dated August 31, 2009, the petitioner alleged that (1) he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, (2) his conviction should be vacated because of newly discovered evidence disclosed by the FBI to the State's Attorney, and (3) he was prejudiced by the late disclosure of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material. The first habeas petition was tried before the court,\n   <em>\n    T. Santos, J.\n   </em>\n   , which issued a memorandum of decision on November 16, 2011, denying the petition. With respect to the claim of newly discovered evidence, the habeas court found such claim \"indistinguishable, especially in light of the petitioner's assertion that this evidence is clear and convincing and would have proven that he is not guilty, from an actual innocence claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. CV-06-4001122-T,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206117914\">\n    2011 WL 6117914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (November 16, 2011). The court found that the evidence produced in support of the claim, consisting of two letters from the FBI regarding the comparative bullet lead analysis used in the petitioner's case, fell short of the actual innocence standard. Following the granting of certification to appeal, the petitioner appealed, and this court affirmed the judgment of the habeas\n   court by memorandum decision issued March 5, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769322,6769348,6769295\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/141/903/\">\n    141 Conn.

In his second amended petition, he alleged: (1) a violation of his constitutional rights to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution on the basis that his conviction was obtained using evidence of comparative bullet lead analysis that was subsequently discredited by the FBI and that there existed a \"reasonable probability that but for [such] evidence ... the petitioner would not have been convicted\"; and (2) ineffective assistance of Attorney DeSantis, who represented the petitioner with respect to his first habeas petition. Specifically, the petitioner claimed that Attorney DeSantis was ineffective in failing to (1) challenge the testimony concerning comparative bullet lead analysis from FBI Agent Kathleen Lundy, (2) consult with a metallurgist to challenge the testimony of Lundy, (3) present forensic evidence with respect to the petitioner's seized clothing, and (4) present testimony of a crime reconstruction expert. The petitioner also claimed that Attorney DeSantis was ineffective in failing to consult with and present the testimony of an expert regarding comparative bullet lead analysis evidence. The second habeas petition was tried before the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , which heard testimony from the petitioner, Attorney DeSantis, and William Tobin, a forensic metallurgist material scientist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court described Lundy's testimony during the petitioner's criminal trial. Lundy testified as to her examination of bullets recovered from the victim's body and the crime scene, and bullets from cartridges in the ammunition box seized from the petitioner's bedroom closet using a technique known as comparative bullet lead analysis (CBLA). Lundy's testimony purportedly showed that the bullets retrieved from the victim's body and the crime scene came from the same box of ammunition seized from the petitioner's bedroom closet. The FBI previously had used CBLA to deduce whether a lead bullet came from a particular cartridge box from 1996 until it discontinued such examinations on September 1, 2005, after an independent research committee of experts concluded that chemical comparison of trace elements found within bullets through CBLA did not produce sufficiently distinct outcomes to enable an analyst to conclude that bullets with the same chemical profiles come from the same box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The habeas court rejected the petitioner's claim that the admission of CBLA evidence violated his due process rights, concluding that no violation occurred on the basis that the petitioner had presented no evidence that the state actors were aware of defects in CBLA evidence at the time of the petitioner's criminal trial. The court further concluded that the petitioner had failed to show that the CBLA evidence prejudiced his case, explaining that the more salient forensic evidence was the showing that the pistol the petitioner had given to Harris, which Harris had turned over to the police, was the pistol used to shoot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the petitioner's ineffective assistance of habeas counsel claim, the habeas court found that because the petitioner's trial counsel, Attorney Fields, could not have been deficient in failing to challenge the then-uncontroverted CBLA evidence, Attorney DeSantis could not be faulted for failing to claim ineffective assistance by Attorney Fields in the petitioner's\n   first habeas trial. The court denied the petition and granted certification to appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Initially, we set forth the appropriate standard of review for a challenge to the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus when certification to appeal is granted. The conclusions reached by the trial court in its decision to dismiss [a] habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review.... [When] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [the reviewing court] must determine whether they are legally and logically correct ... and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record.... To the extent that factual findings are challenged, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734589\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/126/453/#p456\">\n    126 Conn.

Evidence was presented that an individual named Eugene Laurel, or \"Banana,\" sold a stolen, .25 caliber Titan pistol to the petitioner and his cousin. The petitioner was identified as having participated in the purchase of the gun and as having had access to the gun after they bought it. Together with the pistol, Banana gave the men an ammunition box partially filled with .25 caliber Winchester cartridges. Police later searched the apartment where the petitioner lived and seized an ammunition box with .25 caliber Winchester cartridges from the petitioner's bedroom closet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury also heard the testimony of Nicole Harris, the owner and driver of the vehicle used during the robbery, who testified that the petitioner made statements showing his intent to rob the store and indicated that he had a gun. She testified that after the robbery, the petitioner admitted to shooting the victim. Harris further testified that a few days after the shooting, the petitioner gave her a shoe box containing the .25 caliber pistol and asked her to conceal it for him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harris later turned the pistol over to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   James Stephenson, a criminalist with the Connecticut State Department of Public Safety's Division of Forensic Services Forensic Science Laboratory, testified during the petitioner's criminal trial that the cartridges in the ammunition box seized from the petitioner's bedroom closet matched those used to commit the murder with respect to the caliber, type, manufacturer, and coating. Stephenson further testified that the cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene were fired from the .25 caliber pistol turned over by Harris. The petitioner admitted calling his girlfriend from prison and, referring to the .25 caliber Titan as \"dirty dishes,\" asking her to tell Harris to get rid of the gun.

The petitioner also engaged in multiple acts of witness tampering, which the habeas court found to show a strong consciousness of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lundy, then an FBI agent specializing in CBLA, testified as to her opinion based on her examination of the bullets. She testified that the bullets recovered from the crime scene and the victim's body came from the same manufacturing lot as those bullets found in the ammunition box in the petitioner's bedroom closet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lundy's testimony, the habeas court concluded, was \"minimally corroborative of the testimony of Banana, the petitioner's cousin, and Harris as to the petitioner's possession of the weapon and ammunition used in the shooting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We agree with the habeas court's conclusion that the more significant forensic evidence was the testimony of Stephenson, who opined that the pistol the petitioner\n   had given to Harris, which Harris turned over to police, was the same one used to shoot the victim. Stephenson further testified that the ammunition seized from the petitioner's bedroom closet was of the same type and had the same coating as the bullets recovered from the crime scene. This evidence was unaffected by and unrelated to Lundy's testimony, and we agree with the habeas court that it is very unlikely that the jury's determination of guilt would have been different had Lundy's testimony regarding CBLA not been presented to the jury. Accordingly, under the\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   standard, we are not left with a firm belief that but for Lundy's testimony, the petitioner would most likely not have been convicted, and, therefore, the petitioner was not deprived of his constitutional due process right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Ortega\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109075\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/102/#p108\">\n    333 F.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that his habeas counsel, Attorney DeSantis, did not render ineffective assistance of counsel. The petitioner claims that Attorney DeSantis improperly handled the petitioner's claim that the CBLA evidence lacked scientific validity. Specifically, the petitioner claims that Attorney DeSantis failed to present the testimony of an expert with whom he had consulted, and \"merely introduced a report from the FBI stating that it no longer used\" CBLA evidence. Moreover, the petitioner claims that Attorney DeSantis incorrectly presented the CBLA evidence claim as a claim of actual innocence, then \"failed to introduce any evidence sufficient to establish affirmatively that the petitioner was actually innocent of that crime.\" We disagree that Attorney DeSantis rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"The use of a habeas petition to raise an ineffective assistance of habeas counsel claim ... was approved by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Lozada\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527677\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/834/\">\n    223 Conn. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20818\">\n    613 A.2d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).

We agree, and accordingly, we reject the petitioner's request that this court engage in harmless error review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The petitioner claims that the jury \"had before it the difficult task of determining who was telling the truth,\" given that Harris drove the getaway car and received immunity in exchange for her testimony. He claims that Lundy's testimony was especially harmful because it was the sole evidence tying the murder weapon to the petitioner, other than the remaining witnesses' self-serving testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The jury was well aware of the fact that Harris had entered into an agreement pursuant to which she would not be prosecuted if she testified truthfully. She testified regarding the agreement on direct and cross-examination, and the written agreement was entered into evidence as a full exhibit and read to the jury during cross-examination. Whether a witness' testimony is believable is \"a question solely for the jury. It is ... the absolute right and responsibility of the jury to weigh conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

And, basically, what that means is, if I were to hand you those seven bullets and the nine bullets from the cartridges, and ask you to sample them again, and then give me the samples blindly so that I didn't know which were from the fired bullets and which were the bullets from the cartridges, after I conducted the analysis, I still couldn't tell you. All the specimens were chemically the same.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \"[The Prosecutor]: And what does that indicate to you about their time of manufacture and their place of manufacture?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \"[The Witness]: Based on the results and my experience, the conclusion that I came to was that all those bullets were manufactured from the same source, or melt of lead. And because the live ammunition was a Winchester manufacture, that would have occurred at the Winchester manufacturing plant in East Alton, Illinois.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    \"[The Prosecutor]: And were those seven bullets and bullet fragments, and the nine bullets from the box, would they have been manufactured on or near the same time?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    \"[The Witness]: Yes, they would have.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    \"[The Prosecutor]: And would you expect other bullets manufactured on or about that same day from that same batch of lead to have the same analytically indistinguishable lead component?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    \"[The Witness]: Yes, I would. Based on experience, I would expect that other boxes of this same type-this .25 auto Winchester ammunition, it was loaded with the copper coated expanding point bullets.

Likewise, we need not address the respondent's arguments that the flaws in CBLA evidence are \"not beyond the ken of the adversary process,\" that \"parts of Lundy's testimony ... were not entirely 'false,' and [that] not all courts have fully rejected CBLA testimony.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In fact, as the habeas court found, Attorney DeSantis had consulted with a metallurgist, but declined to call him as a witness and elected to rely on the FBI report containing similar information.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    We note that Lundy's testimony did not go entirely unchallenged. On cross-examination, the petitioner's counsel elicited from Lundy recognition that if a local gun store ordered twenty-five boxes of the same product manufactured at the same time, the \"boxes could have the same compositions in them.\" Lundy also acknowledged that she could not give a figure as to how many bullets produced from one melt of lead would have different compositions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
