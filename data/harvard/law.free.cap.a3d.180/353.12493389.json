We reject defendant's arguments regarding his convictions, but we remand for resentencing because the judge appears to have applied a presumption in favor of consecutive terms in such circumstances, and because the aggregate thirty-two year sentence, all subject to an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility, shocks the judicial conscience, particularly when imposed on an offender who was fifty-eight at the time of the incident and sixty-two at the time of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On an early Sunday afternoon in April 2011, defendant William T. Liepe was driving southbound on Cologne Avenue in Hamilton Township. Although intoxicated, defendant was driving within the fifty mile per hour speed limit and within the proper lane of travel. Defendant, however, averted\n   his eyes from the roadway to observe a ballgame on the opposite side of the road. That inattention caused defendant's vehicle to slam into the back of a Honda Accord, which had stopped in the same travel lane to make a left turn. And that collision forced the Honda into oncoming traffic,\n   causing a collision with a northbound Cadillac Escalade. A nine-year old passenger in the Honda was killed, and the driver as well as another Honda passenger sustained serious permanent injuries; occupants of the Escalade were treated for minor injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant's vehicle struck a tree, and he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Police secured defendant's consent to draw blood and determined he had a .192 blood alcohol content (BAC) at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant was indicted and charged with: first-degree aggravated manslaughter, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-4(a) ; second-degree vehicular homicide, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5 ; two counts of second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b)(1) ; two counts of third-degree assault by auto, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(2) ; and one count of fourth-degree assault by auto, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(2). Defendant moved to dismiss for various reasons; the judge dismissed only the aggravated manslaughter charge. We denied but the Supreme Court granted the State's motion for leave to appeal and remanded to us to review the interlocutory order. By way of an unpublished opinion, we reversed and ordered reinstatement of the aggravated manslaughter count.\n   <em>\n    State v. Liepe\n   </em>\n   , No. A-5363-12 (App. Div. Apr. 10, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant moved to suppress BAC evidence, arguing the State required but lacked a search warrant for drawing defendant's blood at the hospital. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing, the judge denied the motion for reasons contained in a written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Trial commenced in September 2014 but defendant failed to appear for the second day of jury selection; it was learned he attempted suicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A six-day jury trial occurred in March 2015, at\n   the conclusion of which defendant was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to a twenty-year prison term on the aggravated manslaughter conviction, consecutive five-year and seven-year prison terms on the aggravated assault convictions, and a concurrent one-year term on the assault-by-auto conviction-an aggregate prison sentence of thirty-two years. And the terms imposed on the manslaughter and aggravated assault convictions were subject to an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. An amended judgment of conviction directed that the periods of mandatory parole supervision for the three consecutive terms should also run consecutively, for an aggregate period of mandatory parole supervision of eleven years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant appeals, arguing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I. IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THE UNBLEMISHED RECORD OF DEFENDANT, THE COURT'S SENTENCE WAS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS AND \"SHOCKS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE COURT.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   II. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT AND MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   III. THE EXTRACTION OF [DEFENDANT'S] BLOOD FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING HIS [BAC] VIOLATED ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   IV.

PLAIN ERROR AND CUMULATIVE ERROR REQUIRE REVERSAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With the exception of Point I, we find insufficient merit in defendant's arguments to warrant further discussion except for the following brief comments.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our rejection of defendant's Point II-in which he argues the evidence could not support a conviction of first-degree aggravated manslaughter-is based on our earlier interlocutory decision in reversing the pretrial dismissal of that count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lombardi v. Masso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4150729\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/207/517/#p538\">\n    207 N.J. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4150729\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/207/517/#p538\">\n    25 A.3d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Our rejection of defendant's Point III is based on the fact the judge found, at the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing, that defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to the drawing of blood; those findings are deserving of our deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322008\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/154/#p166\">\n    222 N.J. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322008\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/222/154/#p166\">\n    117 A.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). As for Point IV-in which defendant argues prejudice from a prosecution expert's testimony about the effect of alcohol on an individual's behavior-we note that defendant did not object at trial, and we are not persuaded that any error, if any occurred, was capable of producing an unjust result.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:10-2. In Point V, defendant argues the judge allowed emotion to seep into the trial through admission of what defendant refers to as \"highly prejudicial photographs\" and through testimony that elicited information about the victims' injuries. Defendant, however, has not provided us with the photographs he believes were prejudicial. And we do not view the few examples offered by defendant about information concerning his victims' injuries to support his argument that the prosecutor's summation exceeded the bounds of proper advocacy or had the effect of unnecessarily evoking the jury's emotions. In his Point VI, defendant contends the judge erred by failing to dismiss a juror who, upon admission of photographs of one of the victims engaged in physical therapy, realized the victim's therapist was a friend. The juror brought this to the judge's attention, and the judge questioned the juror and cautioned her not to discuss the case with the therapist. During the brief but thorough proceeding about the juror, defense counsel said he \"didn't have a problem with it\" and that the situation \"seem[ed] minor\" to him. These circumstances did not warrant the juror's removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant lastly argues in his Point VII that\n   cumulative error requires reversal; our rejection of that argument warrants no further discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As for defendant's arguments in Point I, we agree the sentence imposed is shocking to the judicial conscience and was based on the judge's misunderstanding of applicable legal principles about when consecutive terms are warranted. Consequently, we remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To summarize his sentencing findings, which were thoroughly set forth not only in open court at the time of sentencing but also in the judgment of conviction, the judge applied aggravating factors three and nine-the risk defendant would reoffend, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3), and the need to deter defendant and others, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(9) -to the aggravated manslaughter conviction. He correctly recognized aggravating factor two-the seriousness of the harm caused, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(2) -was subsumed in the manslaughter conviction itself and its application would therefore constitute \"double counting.\" The judge gave aggravating factor three \"slight weight.\" While defendant had no prior criminal convictions, the judge considered defendant's driving record\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and alcoholism, citing, in the latter regard,\n   <em>\n    State v. Casele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719414\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/198/462/#p473\">\n    198 N.J. Super. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=487%20A.2d%20765\">\n    487 A.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 1985), as grounds for concern that defendant could reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In applying aggravating factor nine-the need to deter-the judge noted that the \"horrific consequences\" of defendants' conduct \"garnered county wide notoriety about this case and, therefore, the sentence imposed will receive substantial attention by the populace.\" The judge rejected mitigating factor two-applicable when a defendant did not contemplate his conduct would \"cause or threaten serious harm,\" N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(2) -because \"given this day and age and the public dialogue concerning the ills of drinking and driving that the defendant could consume the amount of alcohol he did and not understand that he could inflict serious harm on others\" was not to be taken seriously. The judge also rejected mitigating factor ten-when a defendant would be \"particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment,\" N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(10) -because probationary supervision \"cannot be reasonably undertaken, given the sentences that must be imposed\" and because, \"with alcoholism as the underlying pathology for the defendant[']s conduct, it would be difficult to say that he is particularly likely to respond to probationary supervision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   From these findings and observations, the judge concluded the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors. In responding to defendant's argument that, in light of his age, he should not impose a sentence \"which would amount to one of death while in prison,\" the judge acknowledged\n   his obligation to consider the \"real-time\" effect of NERA and the overall sentence in light of this particular defendant, but he concluded his \"goal [was] to impose the appropriate sentence for the crimes committed and not one designed to assure [defendant's] release prior to the end of his life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judge recognized that the vehicular homicide conviction merged with the aggravated manslaughter conviction, and that two of the assault-by-auto convictions merged into the aggravated assault convictions. Consequently, defendant received prison terms for: the aggravated manslaughter conviction arising from the death of the nine-year old Honda passenger; the aggravated\n   assault conviction regarding the Honda driver, whose injuries were permanent and quite serious; the aggravated assault conviction regarding the Escalade passenger, who also sustained permanent and serious injuries; and an assault-by-auto conviction regarding the less-seriously-injured Escalade passenger. In considering the aggravating and mitigating factors outlined earlier-and also in applying aggravating factor two-\"the gravity and seriousness of the harm inflicted,\" N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(2) -to the aggravated assault convictions, the judge imposed, respectively, terms of twenty years (for aggravated manslaughter), seven and five years (for the aggravated assault convictions), and one year (for the assault-by-auto conviction). The three lengthier terms were subjected to eighty-five percent periods of parole ineligibility and were also ordered to run consecutively; the fourth one-year term was ordered to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As a result of the imposition of consecutive terms, defendant received an aggregate prison term of thirty-two years. With the impact of NERA, this sentence would prelude defendant's eligibility for parole until he was eighty-nine years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The consecutive terms imposed were the product of the trial judge's determination that\n   <em>\n    State v.

But\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , in our view, did not obligate the imposition of consecutive terms here, let alone\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   consecutive terms and particularly when one of those terms was a sentence imposed for a first-degree offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To be sure, the\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority observed that \"in vehicular homicide cases, the multiple-victims factor is entitled to great weight and should\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   result in the imposition of at least two consecutive terms when multiple deaths or serious bodily\n   injuries have been inflicted upon multiple victims by the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Sentencing courts, however, should not assume from this statement that there exists a presumption in favor of consecutive terms. Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority emphasized-apparently in response to concerns expressed by two dissenting justices-that it had not established a presumption or a per se rule and that the imposition of consecutive terms always lies in the sentencing judge's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, \"[a]lthough we do not adopt a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule, we conclude that it was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion to impose consecutive sentences\"). Because we discern from the judge's decision to impose consecutive terms that he believed\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   required consecutive terms-a conclusion the Court expressly rejected,\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   -we remand for resentencing and for\n   the judge's exercise of his discretion, without an assumption of a per se obligation to impose consecutive terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To further explain, we note, as the\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority recognized, that the Criminal Code provides little guidance about when a judge may impose consecutive terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Code declares only that \"multiple sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines at the time of sentence.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:44-5(a). To fill the void created by the Code's silence, the Supreme Court directed sentencing courts to consider the following six factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) there can be no free crimes in a system for which the punishment shall fit the crime;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) the reasons for imposing either a consecutive or concurrent sentence should be separately stated in the sentencing decision;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (3) some reasons to be considered by the sentencing court should include facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (a) the crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (b) the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (c) the crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (d) any of the crimes involved multiple victims;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (e) the convictions for which the sentences are to be imposed are numerous;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (4) there should be no double counting of aggravating factors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (5) successive terms for the same offense should not ordinarily be equal to the punishment for the first offense; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (6) there should be an overall limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest terms (including an extended term, if eligible) that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority, in reversing our judgment, started by emphasizing \"the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   guidelines are just that-guidelines.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285075\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/413/\">\n    168 N.J. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant was not speeding; instead, the accident was caused by defendant's failure to make proper observations.

How can it be said-if, as the\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority held, the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factors were intended to promote uniformity in sentencing,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 422,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -that uniformity in sentencing has been achieved here? Both Carey and defendant victimized four individuals, but Carey received only two consecutive terms, and defendant received three. And defendant received an aggregate term more than twice as long as Carey's and significantly more than most, in fact nearly all, the sentences imposed in similar or far more tragic circumstances than here, as revealed in our\n   reported and unreported\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   appellate decisions since\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   although defendant's conviction of first-degree aggravated manslaughter was cause for a lengthier prison term on the most serious offense than received by\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   -whose most serious offenses were the two counts of second-degree vehicular homicide for which he was convicted-we do not view that as a persuasive basis for imposing three consecutive terms, when Carey only received two, despite the fact that both caused death or injuries to a total of four innocent victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   did not fix how\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   must apply in all vehicular homicide cases. Every case requires its own\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   analysis. Here, there is no question but that three of the five of\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   's facts-relating-to-the-crime third factor favor the imposition of concurrent terms: the crimes were not predominantly independent of each other; the crimes involved a single act; and the crimes involved a single act of aberrant behavior.\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285075\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/413/\">\n    168 N.J. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There can be no dispute that at least one factor-multiple victims-favored consecutive terms. The fifth-the convictions for which the sentences are to be imposed are numerous-was found in similar circumstances by the\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   majority to also favor consecutive terms,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 423,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , even though it may fairly be argued that the multiple convictions arise from the fact that there were multiple victims; in many instances-and this\n   is one-this fifth factor is simply another way of recognizing there were multiple victims. In short, those two factors are often double-counted, as they were here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We also observe that this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   in another significant way. Here, the State pursued and was able to convince a jury to convict defendant of first-degree aggravated manslaughter in causing the death of the nine-year-old Honda passenger. Consequently, in imposing sentence, the term imposed for that conviction was necessarily significantly higher than what Carey faced when he was sentenced on two second-degree vehicular homicide convictions. The\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   Court recognized that the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   determination, and the Court's direction that \"ordinarily\" consecutive terms should be imposed when there are multiple victims, may be impacted by such a circumstance, emphasizing in the same context of its \"ordinarily\" imposed language that, \"in multiple-victim cases,\" nothing \"prevent[s] the sentencing court from setting the base term of each sentence below the maximum provided by the Code,\" which was \"precisely what occurred\" in the trial court there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, the Court intended that sentencing judges would take fully into consideration the real-time consequences of an accumulation of consecutive terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Abdullah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579133\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/184/497/#p515\">\n    184 N.J. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"579133\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/184/497/#p515\">\n    878 A.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"remind[ing]\" trial courts that \"when imposing either consecutive or concurrent sentences, '[t]he focus should be on the fairness of the overall sentence,\" quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Considering that defendant was an otherwise law-abiding citizen, and fifty-eight years old at the time of the offenses (sixty-two at the time of sentencing), the judge's imposition of three consecutive terms, one of which was a twenty-year term-and all subject to NERA-demonstrates the real-time consequence of the aggregate sentence was not given fair consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   And there is yet another reason for the judge to have avoided an unexplored, lock-step adoption of\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   . Carey caused two deaths and it was in that context that the Court gave\n   expression to what it believed should ordinarily be imposed. Indeed, we view that particular fact-not present here, since defendant caused a single death-as the predominant ground\n   upon which consecutive terms were justified by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285074\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/436/#p441\">\n    168 N.J. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285074\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/436/#p441\">\n    775 A.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, as is now argued, a consecutive term should be imposed for each victim of an accident caused by an intoxicated defendant, including those sustaining nonfatal injuries, then the argument that a consecutive term should be imposed for each victim would have led to Carey receiving four consecutive terms, instead of two. But if, as it seems to us, the Court intended that the convictions on the offenses related to\n   <em>\n    the deaths caused\n   </em>\n   are to \"ordinarily\" result in consecutive terms, then, in this case,\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   's holding about consecutive terms did not require consecutive terms because defendant's actions caused one death, not two. In short, a reasonable reading of\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   's\"ordinarily-imposed\" language might very well have been intended as ensuring that the defendant not get a free \"vehicular homicide\" without militating or even suggesting that \"ordinarily\" consecutive terms should be imposed for each victim, regardless of whether each victim was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For these reasons, we remand for resentencing and for the judge's reconsideration of the imposition of consecutive terms without an assumption that\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   requires at least two consecutive terms, as the judge previously presupposed. We also remand for resentencing because, in this context, the judge appears not to\n   have fairly considered the real-time consequences of the aggregate term imposed, nor did he appear to consider the fact that the sentence imposed here far exceeded what was imposed in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   and has not been shown to be in accord with any other sentence imposed in similar circumstances, thus impairing the overarching\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   goal that there be uniformity in sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The judgment of convictions are affirmed but, for the reasons expressed, we remand for resentencing and do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    APPENDIX\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   -29 years:\n   <em>\n    State v.
