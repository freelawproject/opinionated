Prior to commencing the present action, the plaintiff commenced his first action,\n   <em>\n    Estela\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bristol Hospital, Inc\n   </em>\n   ., Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-11-6013260-S (\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   ), on November 3, 2011, alleging that the defendant improperly had restricted his hospital privileges and engaged in anticompetitive behavior by stealing his patients. The complaint set forth causes of action for tortious interference with business expectancies, breach of contract,\n   breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contractual relations, and defamation. As the court in the present action,\n   <em>\n    Young, J\n   </em>\n   ., noted,\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   \"was heavily litigated, with well over 100 filings before it was ultimately terminated by the court,\n   <em>\n    Swienton, J\n   </em>\n   ., [on October 28, 2013] for the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's deadlines [set forth in two court orders].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 1, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for reargument or reconsideration of the entry of nonsuit, which the court in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   denied on November 18, 2013. The plaintiff then filed a motion to open the nonsuit on November 27, 2013, which the court denied on\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   December 16, 2013. On January 7, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration or reargument of the denial of the motion to open, which the court denied on January 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 10, 2014, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment denying his motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to open. This court dismissed the appeal as moot because the plaintiff did not \"challenge the court's finding that he failed to show that he was prevented from prosecuting his action because of mistake, accident, or other reasonable cause\";\n   <em>\n    Estela\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bristol Hospital, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484823\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1042/#p107\">\n    165 Conn.

In its memorandum of law in support of the motion for summary judgment, the defendant argued, in relevant part, that the applicable statutes of limitations barred the plaintiff's claims and assumed that the plaintiff was relying on the savings provisions of \u00a7 52-592(a), though the defendant did not explicitly challenge the applicability of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 26, 2015, prior to the plaintiff's filing an objection to the motion for summary judgment or action by the court, the defendant filed a motion for an order to bifurcate the trial, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-205\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Practice Book \u00a7 15-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to try the plaintiff's claim that his\n   action was not time barred due to \u00a7 52-592(a) separately from the merits of the underlying tort and breach of contract claims. On March 12, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion for an order to bifurcate on the grounds that on multiple occasions the defendant had waived its right to challenge the applicability of \u00a7 52-592(a) and was estopped from doing so by way of a motion to bifurcate. No immediate action was taken on the defendant's motion to bifurcate or the plaintiff's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 23, 2015, the court overruled the plaintiff's objection to the defendant's motion for an order to bifurcate and scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether \u00a7 52-592(a) applies to the plaintiff's case. The evidentiary hearing took place on August 3, 2015. At the court's request, the parties filed posthearing briefs on August 10, 2015. On August 17, 2015, the court determined that, under the applicable analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ruddock\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burrowes\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"205352\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/243/569/\">\n    243 Conn. at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20A.2d%20967\">\n    706 A.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 52-592(a) did not apply to the plaintiff's case because \"\n   <em>\n    Estela\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   was not dismissed as a matter of form ....\" The court found that \"[because\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   ] was terminated for serious disciplinary reasons and not because of mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect ... the viability of this action cannot be based upon ...

In response, the defendant asserts that the court employed the correct standard and that the plaintiff \"improperly conflates [the court's] discussion of the nonsuit in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Citations omitted.) The defendant further argues that the court's memorandum of decision belies any argument that the court applied the wrong standard. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To the extent that the plaintiff's argument rests on the standard quoted by the court during the August 3, 2015 evidentiary hearing, we note that our review of the hearing transcript reveals that the plaintiff did not object to the court's recitation of the \u00a7 52-212 standard, but instead, the plaintiff actually agreed\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the court that it was reciting the correct standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, although the court quoted the standard for \u00a7 52-212 at the evidentiary hearing, we cannot conclude that it did so in error.

The plaintiff argues that the court overlooked that disciplinary dismissals are not categorically excluded from the relief afforded by \u00a7 52-592(a), and that the court did not consider his justifications for the alleged discovery noncompliance. The plaintiff further argues that the court's findings as to his conduct that led to the judgment of nonsuit are in clear error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. As summarized in the court's memorandum of decision: \"On August 3, 2015, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing solely on the applicability of \u00a7 52-592 [and] the circumstances which led to the court's granting of the motion for judgment of nonsuit and denial of the motion to open nonsuit in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   . Based upon the nature and conduct of the plaintiff that led to the granting of the motion for judgment of nonsuit, the court determines that\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   was not dismissed as a matter of form, but rather for serious disciplinary reasons. Therefore, the present action ... cannot be maintained under \u00a7 52-592. The court sets forth its factual basis below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   , the defendant served a disclosure request upon the plaintiff on May 30, 2012. On September 12, 2012, the plaintiff provided some responses and asserted untimely objections. On September 18, 2012, the defendant filed a motion to compel complete responses. The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion to compel, essentially asserting that he was a 'busy\n   practicing physician'; that the defendant provided no guidance as to how to comply; that some of the information requested was privileged or unavailable; and that he had provided substantial compliance. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"On January 28, 2013, after [a] hearing, [the court] ordered the plaintiff to provide revised disclosure responses [by February 8, 2013]. The court further ordered the parties to return on February 25, 2013 'in order to advise the court whether the defendant is seeking further discovery.' On that date, again after [a] hearing, the court gave the plaintiff until March 29, 2013, to provide additional compliance with the discovery request. The primary compliance was to consist of tax returns and the report of the plaintiff's expert witness. As the plaintiff failed to comply with the court's order, the court entered a judgment of dismissal on October 28, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"At the evidentiary hearing in [the present case], the sole witness was the plaintiff's counsel, Mary Alice Moore Leonhardt, [who] testified at length about discussions between the plaintiff's counsel and [the defendant's] counsel in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   concerning outstanding discovery issues. Much of these discussions centered on information which the plaintiff requested from the defendant in order to finalize a report of the plaintiff's expert. Attorney Leonhardt essentially claimed that the defendant's attorney led her down the primrose path by promising information which was never actually produced. Attorney Leonhardt assert[ed] that her reliance on the representations of [the defendant's] counsel caused her to be dilatory in complying with the court's order. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"As to the tax returns, Attorney Leonhardt testified that the plaintiff did not possess copies of the returns and was at the mercy of the Internal Revenue Service in order to comply with the court's order. She did not explain why the plaintiff failed to comply with the court's order to timely provide tax returns. At the very least, [the] plaintiff could have provided [the defendant's] counsel an authorization to obtain the returns directly from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Attorney Leonhardt's assertions do not address the fact that the [court in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   ] had serially ordered the plaintiff's compliance by February 29, 2013, and March 29, 2013. As of September 27, 2013, the plaintiff still had not complied, nor had he complied a month later when [the court in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   ] granted the motion for nonsuit and entered judgment.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On the basis of these facts, the court in the present case determined that \"[t]he testimony of Attorney Leonhardt and the evidence presented fail[ed] to establish that the judgment was entered as a matter of form. Rather, it is clear that the judgment entered in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   was a disciplinary judgment. ... The court in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   conducted several hearings and issued several orders commanding the plaintiff's compliance with discovery. Despite this, the plaintiff repeatedly ignored the court's orders, thereafter never filed anything to inform the court [that he] could not comply and never filed any motion for extension of time. After almost six months of noncompliance, the court entered a disciplinary dismissal of the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court cannot\n   find that the plaintiff's counsel's failure to comply with the orders of Judge Swienton in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   was excused, excusable or accidental. ...\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   was terminated for serious disciplinary reasons and not because of mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.

We also reject the plaintiff's argument that \"[t]he court overlooked in its decision that disciplinary dismissals are not excluded categorically from the relief afforded by \u00a7 52-592(a).\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court analyzed the case under the \"matter of form\" analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ruddock\n   </em>\n   precisely because it recognized that disciplinary dismissals are not categorically excluded from relief under \u00a7 52-592(a). Applying that standard, which is applicable to disciplinary dismissals, the court found that \"[b]ased upon the nature and conduct of the plaintiff that led to the granting of the motion for judgment of nonsuit ...\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   was not dismissed as a matter of form, but rather for serious disciplinary reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court's factual findings in the present case are in \"clear error.\" In response, the defendant argues that \"[e]ach of these challenged factual findings is amply supported in the record and, thus, there is no basis to conclude that the ... factual findings were clearly erroneous.\" We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The record readily supports the court's factual findings underlying its determination that the dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   did not occur in circumstances such as \"mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.\" In\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff engaged in a pattern of delayed conduct by responding late to discovery requests, filing untimely objections, and filing notices of compliance after the filing of the defendant's motion for a judgment of nonsuit. The plaintiff failed to comply with two court orders, which ordered him to comply with outstanding discovery requests for his 2002-2004 tax returns and his expert report, by February 29, 2013, and March 29, 2013, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As justification for his noncompliance, the plaintiff represented to the court that he could not comply with the defendant's request to provide the expert report absent information from the defendant that had not yet been provided. As the court noted, however, the plaintiff failed to explain why he did not file a motion for extension of time in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   while waiting for this purportedly essential information from the defendant. The plaintiff also asserted that he could not comply with the discovery request for his 2002-2004 tax returns because he did not have copies, and he was waiting on copies to be provided by the Internal Revenue Service. The request for the tax returns, however, was not sent to the Internal\n   Revenue Service until November 5, 2013-several days after the court in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   rendered the judgment of nonsuit on October 28, 2013, and months after the court-ordered deadlines to comply. Further, as the court noted, the plaintiff could have provided the defendant with an authorization to contact the Internal Revenue Service itself, but failed to do so. Moreover, the plaintiff even admitted in his motion to open the judgment of nonsuit in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   that he \"\n   <em>\n    purposefully\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    held off\n   </em>\n   on continuing his review and analysis of his own documents to cull out relevant information because he expected that the request[ed] patient information would be produced by the defendant\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted);-further undercutting any argument that the nonsuit resulted from \"mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Also as justification for his conduct in\n   <em>\n    Estela I\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that he complied with the \"reasonable meaning\" of the court's orders.
