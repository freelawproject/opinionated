Upon review, we conclude that common pleas erred in granting the Petition and instead should have dismissed it as it is barred by the six-year time limitation contained in Section 5527(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5527(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we reverse the Order and dismiss the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On December 2, 2016, Mr. Ryan and Mrs. Ryan (collectively, the Ryans),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who are married, filed with common pleas a Petition for Return of Personal Property (Petition). The Ryans alleged that on August 22, 2003, when they were living at the home of Mr. Ryan's mother, the Township Police Department responded to the residence in response to a report that there was an attempted suicide in progress. The Township Police entered the bedroom Mr. Ryan was occupying and found him passed out with a loaded .45 caliber pistol in his hand. The Township Police disarmed Mr. Ryan and transported him to the hospital without incident. At the hospital, a physician found that Mr. Ryan was \"severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment[, and that h]e should be admitted to a facility designated by the County Administrator for a period of treatment not to exceed 120 hours.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Application for Involuntary\n   Emergency Examination, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 30a.) Mr. Ryan was discharged from the hospital five hours after his arrival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   About the same time, police seized from Mr. Ryan's bedroom \"for safety\" the following items:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. A Fury combat knife with a black handle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. A combat knife with a broken handle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3.

Mrs. Ryan is the alleged owner of item 9. Mr. Ryan is the alleged owner of the remaining items. The Township Police provided Mr. Ryan with a property receipt for the above items. The Ryans requested that the Township Police and the Sheriff of Delaware County return the above items.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Township answered and asserted that the Petition should be denied as untimely. The Township asserted that there is no specific limitations period for a petition to return personal property and, therefore, the residual, six-year statute of limitations under Section 5527(b) applies. The Township claimed that since it seized the property identified in the Petition 13 years before the Petition was filed, the Petition was time-barred.

In addition, the Township alleged that it had destroyed some of the items identified in the Petition and that it no longer has any of the items identified in the Petition in its possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At a hearing on February 13, 2017, the parties stipulated that Mr. Ryan is the lawful owner of the items identified in the Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Township entered into evidence\n   several documents, which the parties agreed were authentic and showed that the items identified in the Petition had been destroyed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Common pleas asked Mr. Ryan's Counsel if she wanted to prepare a letter brief explaining why common pleas has the authority to order the return of the items identified in the Petition even though \"the items are gone.\" (Hr'g Tr. at 10, R.R. at 61a.) Counsel responded that she needed 10 days to prepare a letter brief. There is no such letter brief in the record, and the Township indicates in its appellate brief that Mr. Ryan's Counsel did not file a letter brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By Order dated March 16, 2017, common pleas, finding \"no legal basis upon which to deny the ... request for a return of the property[,]\" ordered the Sheriff of Delaware County to return the items identified in the Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Order, Mar. 16, 2017.) The Township filed a notice of appeal and a concise statement of errors complained of pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Petition was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the issue of timeliness, common pleas explained in its opinion issued pursuant to Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), that\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barren\n   </em>\n   , the cases the Township cited to support the dismissal of the Petition as untimely, are distinguishable because the seizures of property there related to criminal prosecutions. Since the items identified in the Petition were not seized as the result of a criminal prosecution, common pleas concluded that\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barren\n   </em>\n   are inapplicable and there is\n   <strong>\n    no\n   </strong>\n   statute of limitations prohibiting the Petition from being filed 13 years after the items were seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Township argues that the Petition was time-barred. The Township argues that the residual six-year statute of limitations under Section 5527(b), applies. While noting that items identified in the Petition were not seized in connection with a criminal proceeding, thereby making\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   distinguishable, the Township argues that this Court's analysis of Section 5527(b) in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   is persuasive and should be followed. In\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the Township continues, this Court, looking at both criminal and civil law statutes, concluded that no specific limitations period governed, and then applied Section 5527(b). Under common pleas' analysis, the Township argues, \"any person aggrieved by a seizure of property by law enforcement is free to file a petition for return of property at any time, even ... 50 years from the date of the seizure, so long as there was no underlying criminal proceeding.\" (Township's Br. at 14.) Such an interpretation is at odds with the rulings of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and this Court in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the Township contends. Moreover, the Township continues, there\n   are good reasons for having a statute of limitations where, as here, memories have faded and documentation is sparse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , the appellant was arrested on January 10, 2002, following a traffic stop, which resulted in him being charged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , with possession of a controlled substance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    59 A.3d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time of the appellant's arrest, police seized $1,061 in cash from him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The prosecution withdrew the charges against the appellant on November 8, 2002. Nearly eight years later, the appellant filed a motion pursuant to Rule 588(A) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, Pa.R.Crim.P. 588(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking return of the $1,061. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the appellant had waived his right to seek the return of the cash \"because he filed his Rule 588 motion more than seven years after the final disposition of his criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Unlike the trial court, this Court declined to follow\n   <em>\n    Setzer\n   </em>\n   , reasoning that \"forfeiture proceedings and proceedings for the return of property are not criminal proceedings[,]\" \"[a] return of property motion is often raised in a civil forfeiture proceeding\" and \"the progress of an ancillary criminal proceeding, if any, may not be relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    59 A.3d at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). After rejecting the application of a 30-day limitations period, we proceeded to review potentially applicable statutes of limitations, such as Section 5524(3) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5524(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   but found that none of them applied.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    59 A.3d at 680-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since there was \"no specific limitation period established by rule or law for the filing of a motion for return of property,\" this Court concluded that \"the residual six-year statute of limitations in 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5527(b) is the one to apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court then concluded that the appellant's motion was properly dismissed as untimely because it was filed more than six years after his criminal case concluded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed but on different grounds. The Supreme Court concluded that Rule 588(A) did apply and that a criminal defendant must file a motion for the return of property while the trial court retains jurisdiction, which is up to 30 days after disposition.\n   <em>\n    Allen II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276270,6893386,4277132,6893470\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/709/\">\n    107 A.3d at 716-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since the appellant did not file his motion within that time period, his claim was not time-barred, but waived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276270,6893386,4277132,6893470\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/709/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276270,6893386,4277132,6893470\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/709/\">\n    at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court emphasized, however, that its holding was \"limited to the factual circumstances presented\" and that it had \"not attempted to define the timing pertaining to other circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276270,6893386,4277132,6893470\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/709/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 717 n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, as the Township notes, criminal charges were never filed against Mr. Ryan, and, thus, there would have been no jurisdictional basis upon which he could have moved for the return of his property pursuant to Rule 588(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, our Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Allen II\n   </em>\n   does not control here. Nevertheless, while\n   <em>\n    Allen II\n   </em>\n   does not control, this does not mean, as common pleas concluded, that no statute of limitations applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackwood, Inc. v.

Super. 2016) (stating that \"the fact that the legislative provision itself does not contain a statute of limitations for a cause of action ... does not mean there is no applicable statute of limitations[,]\" for such a \"result would be contrary to logic and fairness\"). In fact, as previously discussed, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Allen II\n   </em>\n   did not purport to address the timing for seeking the return of property in other circumstances, including in civil proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Allen II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276270,6893386,4277132,6893470\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/107/709/\">\n    107 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   717 n.10. Thus, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , we look here to other potentially applicable statutes of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    59 A.3d at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 5524(3) of the Judicial Code, which has a two-year time limitation, does not apply because such a tort claim cannot be filed \"against the Commonwealth or a local government.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n    59 A.3d at 680-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Aware of no other period of limitations that might apply, we turn to the residual catchall statute of limitations, that is, Section 5527(b) of the Judicial Code. Section 5527(b) provides, \"[a]ny civil action or proceeding which is neither subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter nor excluded from the application of a period of limitation by section 5531\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   (relating to no limitation) must be commenced within six years.\" 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5527(b). As we have outlined, this proceeding is not \"subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nor is it \"excluded from the application of a period of limitation by section 5531,\" as none of the actions identified in Section 5531 are at issue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310398\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/59/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, under the plain language of Section 5527(b), it applies to this proceeding. The proceeding here was commenced more than 13 years after the Township seized the items identified in the Petition, which is beyond the period of limitations identified in Section 5527(b), making this proceeding untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The case at bar is an apt example of the logistical difficulties that arise from a delayed challenge\"-memories fade, witnesses disappear, and evidence is lost or\n   destroyed.\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer v.

Cmwlth. 2015). At the hearing, Mr. Ryan represented through Counsel that there was a prior order not to destroy the weapons; however, there was no such order and, in fact, the items identified in the Petition have now been destroyed. (Hr'g Tr. at 5-8, R.R. at 56a-59a.) These circumstances, as is often the case with \"stale claims,\" would greatly hamper the Township in its defense against Mr. Ryan's claim.\n   <em>\n    Ins.
