The circuit court imposed sentence and Mr. Johnson was incarcerated. He appealed, then asked the trial court to release him on bond pending appeal, which was granted on condition that he submit to home detention monitoring from a private, court-approved company. He was released from prison and spent nearly sixteen months in home detention before he was released again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal does not deal with the merits of his convictions, which have now been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 6, Sept. Term 2017 (Md. App. Feb. 21, 2018). This opinion deals instead with the question of whether Mr. Johnson should get credit against his sentences for the time he spent in home detention. The circuit court denied his motion for credit on the ground that his home detention didn't qualify as \"time spent in the custody of a correctional facility,\" as \u00a7 6-218(b)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\") requires. We hold that it did qualify, and we reverse and remand with directions that the court enter an order giving Mr. Johnson credit for time spent in home detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following his conviction for two counts of second-degree assault and misconduct in office, the circuit court sentenced\n   Mr. Johnson to two concurrent terms of ten years in prison for the former charge and a concurrent five years for the latter, with all but eighteen months suspended. He\n   was incarcerated on August 11, 2015, and appealed his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 16, 2015, Mr. Johnson filed a petition asking the court to release him on an appeal bond. The circuit court granted his request but added conditions, among them the requirement that he \"obtain[ ] a court-approved private home detention monitoring company to monitor him.\" The relevant ordering paragraphs spelled out the conditions more precisely:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It is hereby ORDERED this 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of December, 2015 by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that Martaz Johnson be placed on Home Detention as a condition of: Pre-Trial Release After bail in the amount of $25,000 or real property\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   To be supervised by Advantage Sentencing Alternative Programs (ASAP Home Detention)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the following conditions: Standard Conditions (Allowed to attend work, counseling, medical appointments, legal/probation/home detention, weekly religious service, school, and seek employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 14, 2015, Mr. Johnson was released on an appeal bond of $25,000 and placed in home detention, subject to the court's conditions. Mr. Johnson signed a home detention agreement (the \"Agreement\") with a company called Advantage Sentencing Alternative Programs Inc. (\"ASAP\"), in which he agreed to be \"confined\" to his home and subject to twenty-four hour monitoring through a transmitter device. He agreed as well to permit ASAP to install a \"home monitoring unit\" in his home and to permit members of ASAP's staff to enter his home at any time to install or inspect the equipment and to ensure his compliance with the rules, regulations, and conditions of the program; to submit to random drug urinalysis and breath alcohol testing; and to refrain from using alcoholic beverages and controlled or uncontrolled substances unless prescribed by a physician. The Agreement also put Mr. Johnson\n   on notice that violation of the listed conditions could be considered an escape for which he could be prosecuted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I understand that my participation in the [ASAP] Home Detention Monitoring Program is Court Ordered and any violation with [ASAP] will be reported to the Court. I additionally understand that a violation of the home detention order or agreement may be considered an escape and subject to prosecution and imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after this Court affirmed his convictions, Mr. Johnson filed a motion to amend the trial court's appeal bond order. He asked the court to release him from home detention and credit him for the time he served in home detention. After a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion on the ground that a violation of the bond conditions exposed him only to forfeiture of the bond, not to criminal liability for escape:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   As stated earlier, this judge and this judge's law clerk have done extensive research on this issue of-on the issue of whether a defendant on appeal with an appeal bond with a condition of home detention could get credit for the time served on home detention. And it is the opinion of this Court that this is a case of first impression never having been decided by a Maryland court or by any other court in the nation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court is ... very well aware of the decision in\n   <em>\n    Dedo v. State\n   </em>\n   , and one thing I'd like to point out about Dedo, Dedo was actually committed to the custody of the warden of the WCDC, and throughout the period of his home detention was still in that warden's custody. The appeal bond effectively took this Defendant out of the custody of the Division of\n   Corrections. He was in their custody for a period of time for which he certainly should get credit for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant relies on Dedo, also relies on the statute and statutes involving escape. Defendant also relies on\n   <em>\n    Spriggs v. State\n   </em>\n   and Kang v. State... In my view, these cases are inapposite. I recognize that the defendant in each of those cases was on a period of home detention. However, those cases do not involve a situation where the defendant is\n   actually free from incarceration. Yes, there is language in Dedo and in Spriggs considering the home to be a place of incarceration or detention whereby the person, the defendant, in that situation could be charged with escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It is my view that the consequence of failure to adhere to the conditions of the appeal bond would result only in the potential forfeiture of the security for the appeal bond, but would not and could not result in any legally effective charge of escape. This case is just different from those other cases functionally, and I use the word \"functionally\" somewhat advisably. The sentence was suspended in a sense, it's out in limbo somewhere until the Court of Appeals acts on the writ of certiorari and either grants it or denies it. But even if it grants it, the Defendant's still on appeal bond until the Court is-Court of Appeals renders a decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Defendant's posture legally does just-does not fit within the logic or rationale of Dedo, Spriggs or Kang in my opinion. For the reasons cited, I deny the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Johnson filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This appeal turns on whether Mr. Johnson's time on home detention qualified as \"time spent in the custody of a correctional facility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claims that it did, and therefore that\n   the trial court erred in denying him credit against his sentences for the time he served on home detention pending appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State counters that he wasn't in \"custody\" because he wouldn't have been subject to prosecution for escape, and therefore wasn't entitled to credit. We review the trial court's decision\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilmer v.

Mr. Johnson Was Entitled To Credit For His Time Served In Home Detention.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Johnson's argument relies on a synthesis of two statutes: CP \u00a7 6-218\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which defines his right to sentence credits, and \u00a7 9-405 of the Criminal Law Article (\"CR\"), which defines the offense of escape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , CP \u00a7 6-218 (b)(1) entitles convicted defendants to credit for time spent in the custody of a correctional facility on the charge at issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against and a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all\n   <em>\n    time spent in the custody of a correctional facility\n   </em>\n   , hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Md.

The key feature of custody, though, is the defendant's exposure to criminal prosecution for escape if he were to leave the site of his detention. In\n   <em>\n    Maus v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071751\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/85/\">\n    311 Md. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071751\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/85/\">\n    532 A.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), the Court of Appeals considered the meaning of the phrase \"in the custody of any state, county or city jail, correctional institutions, hospital, mental hospital or other agency\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the context of a defendant who spent time, as a condition of probation, in a residential drug treatment program. The Court held that the defendant was not \"in custody\" for purposes of the statute because the program merely provided supervision, and that credit should be awarded for time in drug treatment facilities when the defendant \"is civilly committed to the treatment facility\n   <em>\n    and when, in cases of unauthorized departure, he or she is guilty of the crime of escape\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Maus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071751\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/85/\">\n    311 Md. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071751\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/85/\">\n    532 A.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

In 1991, shortly after the\n   <em>\n    Maus\n   </em>\n   decision, the Attorney General observed that a person on home detention is incarcerated in a local detention center in the sense that the prisoner's home can be said to be an extension of the local detention center, thus making the home a \"public institution\" for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    Corrections: Reimbursement for Inmates in Home Detention Programs\n   </em>\n   , 76 Md.

Section 9-405(a)(3)(ii) prohibits a person from escaping from \"a place identified in a home detention order or agreement.\" Indeed, \u00a7 9-405(b)(1)(iii) specifically \"applies to a person who is committed to home detention by the court.\" And \u00a7 9-405(b)(2) extends liability to violations of conditions in home detention agreements as well:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A person may not knowingly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (i) violate any restriction on movement imposed under the terms of a ... home detention order or agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (ii) fail to return to a place of confinement under the terms of ... home detention order or agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CR \u00a7 9-405(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This case may be the first to address home detention as \"custody\" for a convicted defendant awaiting appeal, but the notion\n   that home detention can be custody is nothing new. We held in\n   <em>\n    Toney v. State\n   </em>\n   , for example, that a defendant was entitled to credit against time served in home detention because he was (i) \"confined to his home with electronic monitoring,\" (ii) \"unable to leave his home at any time without obtaining permission of an official obligated to report to the court,\" and (iii) could have been prosecuted for escape if he were to violate his home detention.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670636\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/690/#p695\">\n    140 Md.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Spriggs v. State\n   </em>\n   , citing the same statutory language, we held that a defendant detained at home is \"in custody\" for the purpose of \u00a7 6-218 and is entitled to credit for time served in custody because he can be prosecuted with escape:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A court may order home detention, monitored by a licensed private home detention monitoring agency, as a condition of pre-trial release. A place identified in such an order is a place of confinement, and a defendant who violates a restriction on movement or fails to return under a home detention order or agreement may be found guilty of [second] degree escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"225634\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/152/62/#p69\">\n    152 Md.

And \"[a]lthough the Court of Appeals found that particular form of commitment [in\n   <em>\n    Dedo\n   </em>\n   ] incarcerative, it did not rule out that other forms of\n   supervision might also be incarcerative.\"\n   <em>\n    Toney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670636\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/690/#p695\">\n    140 Md.

And even if it didn't include that language,\n   <em>\n    Toney\n   </em>\n   disengaged the possibility of liability for escape from the terms of the home detention agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670636\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/690/#p695\">\n    140 Md.

And in\n   <em>\n    Spriggs\n   </em>\n   , we didn't consider the agreement at all. What matters is whether a defendant can be prosecuted for escape, and Mr. Johnson could have been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The State also contends that we can't rely on the terms of the ASAP Agreement because it was not \"submitted to the lower court,\" as required by Md. Rule 8-414(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It's not obvious from the circuit court record that this is true, but assuming that it wasn't and that we couldn't consider it in our decision, the outcome is the same. The State did not dispute the terms of the agreement at the motions hearing. Mr. Johnson's counsel proffered that his client's activities were monitored electronically, that he was confined to his home unless he had permission, that he was granted permission from the court only to attend work and church services and meet with his attorney, and that all of these activities required additional permission from ASAP. The State did not object to that proffer, and the court accepted it. Mr. Johnson was confined to his home with twenty-four hour electronic monitoring. He, as in\n   <em>\n    Dedo\n   </em>\n   , was allowed to leave his home only for the activities approved in the court order. And unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Maus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Balderston\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Johnson did not request to\n   be placed in home detention-the court, in exercise of its discretion, ordered him to home detention with ASAP as a condition of his appeal bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The State draws the same distinction between pre-trial release and post-trial release as the trial court, arguing that because\n   Mr. Johnson was released on appeal bond, his case is factually different from\n   <em>\n    Dedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spriggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Toney\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kang v.

But the difference is purely a matter of posture, not confinement. It's the nature and extent of confinement that drives a defendant's right to credit under CP \u00a7 6-218, not the stage of the proceedings, and the conditions of Mr. Johnson's confinement qualified as \"custody\" for these purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED, CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
