On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) violated his constitutional right to due process by denying his motion to suppress an eyewitness' in-court identification of him, and (2) abused its discretion by denying his request for a special credibility instruction with respect to the testimony of that eyewitness. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. This case is the end result of a dispute over \"drug turf\" in the east end of Bridgeport. The victim, Kiaunte \"Stretch\" Ware, lived on Sixth Street in Bridgeport and sold drugs in that neighborhood. The defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   had recently returned to live in the east end and started selling drugs on Sixth Street. The defendant was not a Sixth Street regular, but he \"[w]as ... out there enough\" to be noticed by the victim and his friend, Richard Jackson. On July 15, 2013, the victim and the defendant had a physical altercation on Sixth Street. Later that day, the defendant sent a text message to a friend stating that he had been jumped by the victim and another male, who told him that he could not come on Sixth Street. The defendant further stated that he \"wasn't hearing [that]\" and that he was looking for a gun. On July 16, 2013, the victim pulled a gun on the defendant while the defendant was with his children at a nearby park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unlike the victim, Jackson had no issue with the defendant, and the two interacted on four or five occasions in the two weeks prior to the victim's murder. On one occasion, Jackson and the defendant shared a marijuana cigarette and talked for approximately twenty minutes. On another occasion, the two sat together on the porch steps of a property on Sixth Street. Jackson and the defendant also exchanged remarks as they passed by each other on the street. Jackson did not witness the July 15, 2013 altercation, but the next day he was shown a cell phone video recording of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of July 17, 2013, at approximately 7:20 a.m., the victim and Jackson were sitting in a car outside the victim's apartment on Sixth Street. The victim sat in the driver's seat with his window rolled down, and Jackson sat next to him in the front passenger seat. The two friends talked about the July 15, 2013 altercation and Jackson cautioned the victim that his dispute with the defendant was unnecessary. The defendant walked up Sixth Street wielding a small black handgun and approached within three feet of the driver's side of the victim's car. The defendant was wearing a black shirt and his face was covered up to the top of his nose, leaving only his eyes and the top of his head exposed. The defendant fired at the victim and then uttered the words \"bitch ass n*****.\" Jackson told the defendant to \"chill\" and that he had \"proven his point.\" The defendant, however, fired more bullets, hitting the victim in the left upper neck, left upper shoulder, back and chest. The defendant then fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jackson also fled because there were outstanding warrants for his arrest and he\n   feared becoming involved with the police. As Jackson ran east toward Bunnell Street through the backyards of houses on Sixth Street, he said aloud, \"I'm going to jail.\" He then heard a voice reply, \"[m]y bad my n*****,\" and realized that the defendant, whose face was no longer covered, was running close behind him. The defendant continued running in the direction of Stratford Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A juvenile standing in the backyard of a house on Bunnell Street, which abutted the backyards of houses on Sixth Street, heard the gunshots and called 911. Shortly thereafter, police and emergency response personnel found the unconscious victim, who was later pronounced dead at Bridgeport Hospital. The police recovered four spent bullets from the victim's car, four spent casings in the roadway and a white tank top in the grass near the victim's car. A firearm never was recovered. As part of his investigation, Detective Robert Winkler obtained surveillance footage from cameras posted by the Bridgeport Police Department at three intersections along Stratford Avenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 25, 2013, Jackson was arrested on unrelated charges and interviewed by Detectives Winkler and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dennis Martinez about the victim's murder. Initially, Jackson was reluctant to provide the detectives with the assailant's identity. Jackson stated that he had been sitting in the victim's car for approximately four to seven minutes before the assailant ran up to the car and started shooting at the victim. He described the victim's assailant as a black male at least six feet, three inches tall, wearing a black shirt and a scarf or shirt covering most of his face, and wielding a black small caliber gun. Jackson stated that as he was running to his girlfriend's apartment on Bunnell Street, the assailant, whose face was still covered, ran by him and continued in the direction of Stratford Avenue. Later in the interview, Martinez inadvertently used the defendant's street name, \"Sleep,\" instead of the victim's street name, \"Stretch.\" Jackson was shown portions of the Stratford Avenue surveillance video and he confirmed that the man in the video was the person he recognized as the assailant. He claimed, however, that he did not know the assailant's name. Jackson stated that he had seen the assailant on Sixth Street previously and would recognize him if he saw him again. He also stated that he knew the assailant's voice because he had heard it before and that he could match that voice to a face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The detectives conducted a blind sequential photo array of eight photographs. When he was shown the seventh photograph, that of the defendant, Jackson became quiet and asked to return to his cell multiple times. The detectives urged Jackson to tell them what he knew and whether the seventh photograph was the assailant. Jackson asked to speak alone with\n   Winkler and attempted to negotiate a release on a promise to appear on his unrelated charges. Winkler stated multiple times that he could try to help but could not promise anything. Jackson admitted that he knew the defendant was the assailant all along, identified him in the seventh photograph in the array and stated that Martinez already had used his street name, \"Sleep.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 30, 2013, the defendant was arrested and charged with murder and criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress Jackson's out-of-court identification and any subsequent in-court identification of the defendant, claiming, inter alia, that the procedures used by the detectives during the out-of-court identification were unnecessarily suggestive, and that, as a result, any in-court identification would be tainted by the improper out-of-court identification. In response, the state contended that it did not seek to offer Jackson's out-of-court identification of the defendant at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A seven day jury trial commenced on September 24, 2014. During trial, outside the presence of the jury, the court conducted a two part evidentiary hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress. After reviewing Jackson's videotaped interview and hearing testimony from Winkler,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court determined that the police identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive and suppressed the out-of-court identification. The court reasoned that Martinez's inadvertent use of the defendant's street name and \"showing [Jackson] the surveillance video that only contained [the defendant was] tantamount to making a suggestion as to who should be picked out of the [photographic] array.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court then addressed the reliability of any subsequent in-court identification. The court heard testimony from Jackson, who stated that he knew that the defendant was the shooter prior to the interview, but did not want to provide that information to the detectives. Jackson testified that there weren't \"too many different people ... on Sixth Street\" and that he \"[paid] attention to who was out there.\" It was important for Jackson, who was involved in the sale of narcotics, to know who the regular people were, \"because other people could be snitches.\" Jackson further testified that he had seen the defendant on Sixth Street four or five times in the two weeks prior to the shooting, and had become familiar with both the defendant's appearance and voice. Jackson indicated that he would have known that the defendant was the shooter even if he had not seen him a second time as he was running away. The court then asked Jackson the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Court: Sir, you were shown some video by the detectives that was taken from a street pole camera that day. Is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Jackson]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: Did that video influence or plant the idea in your mind that [the defendant] was the shooter?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[Jackson]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Court: How sure are you of that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Jackson]: A hundred percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Court: And did Detective Martinez, using the name Sleep while he was interviewing you, did that influence your identification\n   of the defendant here in court as the shooter of [the victim]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[Jackson]: No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the basis of Jackson's testimony, the court ruled that \"the state [had] established by clear and convincing evidence that under the totality of the circumstances\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ... [Jackson's] in-court identification ... [was] based upon his independent recollection and [was] untainted by any faulty pretrial identification process.\" The court made the following findings of fact in support of its determination: \"[T]his case did not involve a one-time encounter between an eyewitness and a shooter who was a total stranger\"; \"[t]he defendant and Jackson had been together in each other's company in close proximity in social settings [on Sixth Street] in the days leading up to [the victim's] murder\"; \"Jackson ... was already personally familiar with [the defendant] before [the victim] was murdered\"; \"[Jackson] was also privy to the bad blood that existed between [the defendant] and the victim at the time of the shooting\"; \"Jackson had a chance to view the [defendant] that morning, both during and after the murder\"; \"Jackson also interacted and spoke with the defendant immediately after [the defendant] shot [the victim]\"; and \"Jackson demonstrated an obvious reluctance to cooperate [during his interview] with [the] detectives.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jackson then testified before the jury and identified the defendant as the man who shot the victim. Jackson testified that the main factor in being able to identify the defendant as the shooter was seeing him unmasked as they ran away from the crime scene. On October 6, 2014, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a(a) and the court found him guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1). Thereafter, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of fifty years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant's principal claim on appeal is that the trial court violated his federal constitutional right to due process by denying his motion to suppress Jackson's in-court identification of him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's arguments in support of that claim are twofold. First, he argues that, although the court determined that the out-of-court identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court improperly concluded that the state had proven the reliability of Jackson's in-court identification by clear and convincing evidence. Second, he argues that the court\n   improperly permitted the jury to consider Jackson's out-of-court identification as evidence of guilt. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the court improperly concluded that the state had proven the reliability of Jackson's in-court identification by clear and convincing evidence. Specifically, the defendant argues that Jackson's \"brief prior acquaintance\" with the defendant and Jackson's \"denial that the identification procedure affected him\" does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of reliability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the state contends that, although the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proving the reliability of Jackson's in-court identification onto the state, Jackson was sufficiently familiar with the defendant to minimize the risk of misidentification, and that this familiarity, considered under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the crime and subsequent identification, demonstrates that the trial court's ruling was not an abuse of its discretion. Without determining whether the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proof onto the state, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Jackson to make an in-court identification of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and the legal principles that guide our analysis of a defendant's constitutional challenge to an eyewitness identification procedure. \"Our standard of review of a trial court's findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... We undertake a more probing factual review when a constitutional question hangs in the balance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aviles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%20470\">\n    154 Conn.

We begin our analysis by addressing the court's factual finding that Jackson was \"personally familiar\" with the defendant. The defendant disagrees with this finding and, instead, contends that he and Jackson were \"near strangers.\" Specifically, the defendant argues that \"the state did not cite to any case in which a twenty minute conversation and three to four brief encounters over two weeks creates\" sufficient familiarity \"to identify him from a brief glimpse ... or from seven spoken words.\" In response, the state argues that the court's factual findings were supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the outset, we note that our Supreme Court has declined to \"articulate a specific rule regarding the degree of familiarity that an eyewitness must have with a suspect ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20691\">\n    317 Conn. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%201194\">\n    119 A.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \"Rather, the typical approach is to consider the nature and extent of the eyewitness' prior knowledge of the suspect, along with all of the other facts and circumstances of the crime and the subsequent identification of a perpetrator, to determine whether a trial court has abused its discretion .... [A]ffording flexibility to trial courts is desirable due to the myriad and unpredictable ways in which crimes occur and are witnessed and in which individuals may have had previous contact with each other.... [I]n a case in which an eyewitness has a limited, stressful encounter with a criminal actor whose features are largely concealed, a high level of prior familiarity likely would be necessary .... On the other hand, if a witness has ample opportunity to view a perpetrator under conditions conducive to an accurate identification and identifies him or her shortly thereafter, a lesser degree of familiarity may suffice.\" (Citation omitted; footnote omitted.)

Jackson had interacted with the defendant at least four times in the two weeks prior to the victim's murder. On the basis of these interactions, Jackson stated that he was able to recognize the defendant by both his appearance and his voice. Jackson also was aware of the ongoing dispute between the defendant and the victim at the time of the shooting. We therefore conclude that the trial court's finding that Jackson was personally familiar with the defendant was supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We next address Jackson's opportunity to view the defendant at the time of murder. \"This consideration implicates factors that relate to the [witness'] condition at the time as well as the external environment.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Artis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780129\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/568/#p595\">\n    136 Conn.

Jackson was an eyewitness to the crime. As the trial court explained, Jackson \"had a front row seat to [the victim's] murder.\" Jackson even referred to himself as the \"star witness\" because he \"[was] the one closest to the person that got killed.\" Jackson had two opportunities to view the defendant in broad daylight on the morning of the murder; once from the front passenger seat of the vehicle, and again as he fled from the crime scene and saw the unmasked defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Jackson's description of the perpetrator's appearance, which was given prior to the unduly suggestive police identification procedure and his identification of the defendant from a photographic array, was generally consistent with the defendant's appearance as captured by the surveillance\n   video, as described by the 911 caller\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as testified to by Jackson at trial. The defendant contends that Jackson's differing descriptions as to what type of pants the assailant was wearing suggests that he altered his original description after viewing the surveillance video. We disagree that this claimed discrepancy is significant, as Jackson himself acknowledged that he was not staring at the assailant's pants and was not sure what he was wearing. We note that Jackson, when testifying before the jury, stated for the first time that the defendant's face was uncovered and visible as they ran away from Sixth Street. Although Jackson's withholding of this fact until trial was proper fodder for the jury to consider when assessing his credibility, it does not significantly impact our analysis of the defendant's claim on appeal.

The jury viewed the timestamped video surveillance of the defendant walking toward Sixth Street and then fleeing after the shooting, which the trial court described as \"very incriminating.\" See footnote 2 of this opinion. At trial, the defendant conceded that he was the person on the surveillance footage. The jury also heard a recording of a phone call the defendant made to his girlfriend from his holding cell, in which he asked her if the police had \"[found] anything in [her] house.\" Additionally, the defendant elicited evidence of Jackson's out-of-court identification of the defendant.

During the cross-examination of Winkler, defense counsel introduced portions of Jackson's out-of-court identification \"in order to show that Jackson mistakenly identified [the defendant] because of the unnecessarily suggestive procedure.\" The state objected to its admission. The court sustained the state's objection, but noted that the defendant \"[had opened] the door to the state possibly using other portions [of the out-of-court identification]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   to rehabilitate the identification that [Jackson] made of the defendant because the [out-of-court identification] that the court had previously ordered stricken because it was suggestive has been introduced into this case by the defense.... [T]he\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    free to inquire to show that\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    did in fact make that identification.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel then requested a limiting instruction that the comments of the interviewing detectives should not be taken for their truth; however, defense counsel did not request a limiting instruction as to Jackson's statement. The court then instructed the jury as follows: \"The ... evidence is being offered for the statements of [Jackson].... [Y]ou'll hear certain expressions of opinion by the police officers and those are not being offered for the truth of their opinions ... but to show their effect on [Jackson] or his responses to those statements.\" Jackson's videotaped interview was then admitted into evidence as a full exhibit and viewed by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On September 29, 2014, the defendant submitted a draft request to charge that stated in relevant part: \"In this case, the identification of the defendant by the witness, [Jackson], was the result of suggestive identification procedures.\" On October 3, 2014, the court provided defense counsel and the state with a draft of its proposed jury instructions. That same morning, the court, defense counsel and the prosecutor then reviewed the proposed jury instructions page by page. The court indicated that it had incorporated language from the Connecticut criminal jury instructions into the section regarding \"identification of the defendant.\" Defense counsel objected, and referred the court to the defendant's September 29, 2014 request to charge the jury with the following language: \"In this case, the identification of the defendant by the witness, [Jackson], was the result of suggestive identification procedures.\" The court denied that request, stating: \"The court's problem with the [defendant's] request is the jury may well make that determination.... I'm not preventing you from arguing it. I anticipate you arguing it .... But I can't make that leap and make a finding of suggestiveness. I found that while there was a taint to the out-of-court identification, I was satisfied based upon [Jackson's] statements and his prior familiarity with the defendant before the homicide, that his in-court identification was not the result of any suggestive out-of-court identification procedure.... I'm not going to charge this jury that the identification was suggestive. That may be something that [the jurors] make a [determination] as to which might create reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But I can't tell [the jury] that as a matter of law in this instruction because I believe it is marshaling the evidence in a way that's not appropriate in a charge which is supposed to be ... right down the middle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is well settled that \"[a]n appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is delivered.

The defendant contends that a special credibility instruction was required because Jackson was either an accomplice or a jailhouse informant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of this claim. On September 29, 2014, the defendant submitted a request to charge, stating in relevant part: \"A witness who testified in this case, [Jackson], is currently incarcerated and is awaiting trial for some crimes other than the crime involved in this case. At the time this witness first provided information to the police, he was also incarcerated and awaiting trial for some crimes other than the crime involved in this case. You should look with particular care at the testimony of this witness and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it. You should consider the credibility of this witness in the light of any motive for testifying falsely and inculpating the accused.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On October 3, 2014, the court denied the defendant's request to provide a special credibility instruction to the jury regarding Jackson, stating: \"I ... think that this is a case that's so completely removed from informant ... if you believe this witness, he's sitting right next to someone who's shot dead multiple times at very close range. He is as close an eyewitness as I've ever seen in any murder. Whether he's reliable and whether his identification is solid, that's a question for [the jury]. But this man had a front row seat to this whole thing, if you believe him. And so I don't find him to be an informant in that sense. He's an eyewitness with baggage, [which] is perhaps a better characterization of him, and whether that baggage is sufficient to sink his credibility [is] a question for the jury.... I'm not going to give the [requested] informant instruction for those reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We turn to the legal principles that guide our review of the defendant's claim. \"It is a well established principle that a defendant is entitled to have the jury correctly and adequately instructed on the pertinent principles of substantive law....

The jury could have reasonably found the following additional facts. Jackson and the victim had known each other for eight or nine years. Jackson was very close friends with the victim and described him as a \"big brother.\" On the morning of the murder, they talked about \"getting out of the hood\" and had planned on driving to New Haven to fill out applications at Gateway Community College. Jackson pleaded with the defendant to stop shooting at the victim. The evidence adduced at trial simply did not warrant an accomplice instruction.
