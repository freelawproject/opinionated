At first, she lived with both her parents in Santa Ana. In 2003, Sanchez left Martinez and moved away to live with another man. Jenniffer remained with Martinez. Since then, with the exception of one conversation, Sanchez has had no contact with Jenniffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2006, Martinez moved to the United States to find work and escape gang activity. He arranged for Jenniffer to live with his mother in El Salvador. Martinez settled in Silver Spring, Maryland, with his brother, Ronald Reagan Martinez. He obtained steady employment. Throughout his time in the United States he maintained regular contact with Jenniffer by telephone and sent money to El Salvador for\n   her support. Martinez remarried and now lives with his wife, who also is from El Salvador, in an apartment in Hyattsville, Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 28, 2015, when she was 14 years old, Jenniffer left El Salvador, traveling north into Mexico with Martinez's stepson, Cesar. They crossed the border into Texas on April 17, 2015, and were apprehended by the United States Border Patrol. They were released into Martinez's custody. Jenniffer has lived in Hyattsville with Martinez, Cesar, and her stepmother since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 12, 2016, in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Martinez filed a complaint for custody of Jenniffer and a motion for findings that would make her eligible for SIJ status under 8 U.S.C. section 1101(a)(27)(J). In addition to the facts recited above, he alleged that before Jenniffer left El Salvador, a girl she knew tried to recruit her on behalf of a gang. Jenniffer refused but was likely to be recruited again. He further alleged that Jenniffer's mother had abandoned her and that his own mother was \"getting old\" and was \"dealing with some medical issues\" that made it difficult for her to continue to care for Jenniffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sanchez was served with the complaint in El Salvador but did not file an answer. On January 17, 2017, the court entered an order of default against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 6, 2017, the court held a hearing on Martinez's complaint. Jenniffer, then age 16, testified that she was in the tenth grade and was attending a local public school. She planned to go to college to study industrial engineering. Her father and stepmother were supporting her, and she was happy living with them. She had left El Salvador because she \"wanted to do better in [her] life\" and to be with her father. She had no relationship with her mother. Her only contact with her mother, which happened when she was 14, was a telephone conversation in which her mother asked forgiveness for abandoning her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Jenniffer, in El Salvador she had a \"problem with a girl [who] belonged to a gang and she told [Jenniffer] that she was always going to be waiting for [Jenniffer] after ... school.\" Shortly before Jenniffer left El Salvador, she saw this girl outside her school staring at her from a distance. Jenniffer testified that there were a \"lot of problems with gangs in El Salvador[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Martinez testified that Sanchez left him in 2003 for another man and \"abandoned\" Jenniffer at that time. He stated that he and his wife were willing and able to support Jenniffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ruled from the bench as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All right. Through the testimony and evidence [in this] case, the Court's had an opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses, review the testimony and the evidence. The Court finds that [Martinez] is the biological father of the minor child; that this Court sits as a juvenile court and has authority to render decisions regarding a juvenile's custody; that the child is under the age of 21 years old and unmarried and in school; that the Court finds as a result of the abuse, abandonment and neglect that reunification with [Sanchez] in [El Salvador] is not in her best interests. The Court will grant ... sole legal and physical custody to [Martinez] and grant [SIJ] status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 28, 2017, the court entered an \"Order Regarding Minor's Eligibility For [SIJ] Status.\" It used a proposed order submitted by counsel for Martinez, but modified it by crossing out many of the proposed factual findings. The court found that Jenniffer was born in El Salvador, was under age 21, and was unmarried; and that the court had jurisdiction to make determinations about her care and custody. Including the stricken portions, the order reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court has placed Jenniffer ... in the Custody of ...

For example, the approval of a petition to the USCIS seeking SIJ status may be\n   revoked, with notice, upon \"good and sufficient cause,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. section 1155, which the\n   <em>\n    USCIS Policy Manual\n   </em>\n   warns can be \"if the record contains evidence or information that directly and substantively conflicts with the evidence or information that was the basis for the petitioner's eligibility for SIJ classification.\"\n   <em>\n    USCIS Policy Manual\n   </em>\n   , Vol. 7, Part F, Ch. 7 (C)(2) available at\n   <em>\n    https://perma.cc/KD8D-CKR6\n   </em>\n   (last visited Feb. 12, 2018). The state court's order is part of the \"evidence or information\" on which the USCIS makes its SIJ status decision, including eligibility. The fact that a revocation decision could be made based on a finding that information in the state's order conflicts with other information before the USCIS implies that the information in the order must be specific, not general, to begin with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We return to the case at bar. The circuit court's general conclusions in its order that Jenniffer was abandoned and that it is not in her best interest to return to El Salvador make it clear that the court credited her and Martinez's testimony. The order does not include any first-level factual findings, however. It concludes that Sanchez abandoned Jenniffer but does not specify when and in what circumstances Jenniffer was abandoned and whether the abandonment has been ongoing so that no mother-daughter relationship was formed or exists. Likewise, the order concludes that it is not in Jenniffer's best interest to return to El Salvador but does not provide any first-level factual findings in support. The proposed order submitted to the court included particular supporting factual findings, but the court crossed most of them out, leaving only conclusions. As signed and entered by the court, the order is effectively a \"template order\" that, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Dany G.\n   </em>\n   , USCIS guidance indicates is not sufficient for its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We doubt the trial court crossed out the proposed factual findings because it was rejecting them. It seems much more likely that it was operating under the misconception that specific factual findings were not necessary. They are necessary, and therefore we shall vacate the court's order and remand the matter for the court to enter a new order that sets\n   forth first-level factual findings. The revised order should be entered\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to the date of the original order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY VACATED.
