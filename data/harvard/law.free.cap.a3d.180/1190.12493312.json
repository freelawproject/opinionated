The Legislature's choice to refrain from specifically providing authority for the State Board to approve an ESC's name change after initial approval does not persuade us that it intended to deny the State Board that power. First, it is illogical to extend power to approve the establishment of an ESC, and its initial name, and to approve any change in an ESC's purpose, but not to vest authority in the Board to change the original name. Furthermore, the relatively minor action of a name change is one that can reasonably be viewed as so mundane, and so obviously within the purview of the State Board's authority, that the Legislature chose not to detail that authority in the statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheeran v.

N.J.S.A. 18A:6-51(a) (emphasis added). \"[F]ive or more boards of education\n   <em>\n    in any county or in any two or more counties\n   </em>\n   ... may petition\" the State Board for permission to establish an ESC.

We discern from those provisions that the Legislature placed no geographical limits on boards that wish to band together to form an ESC, or on the operation of ESCs throughout the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Act's express provisions manifest the legislative intent that ESCs may provide services to districts over a wide geographical range. The Legislature did not intend to limit ESCs to a single county or region-or to establish operational fiefdoms for local ESCs.

In fact, any increase in competition among ESCs would logically benefit districts in search of services and programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Furthermore, Council's contention that the name change provided a competitive advantage to ESC-New Jersey is unsupported by any evidence in the record. Council makes only bare assertions that\n   the State Board's approval of the name change created the\n   impression that ESC-New Jersey is \"[s]tate-sanctioned and superior to the 'county' ESCs.\" As the Commissioner of Education recognized just prior to the Board's approval of the name change, the Board had granted ESC-New Jersey\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   the right to expand its mission statewide.

ESC-New Jersey, in addition to transportation services-which account for less than thirty-six percent of ESC-New Jersey's budget-provided a score of educational programs to seventy-five districts in eleven counties; ESC-New Jersey also had, by far, the largest total revenues based on 2015 reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the State Board considered\n   ESC-New Jersey's answers to a questionnaire it sent ESC-New Jersey that addressed some of the concerns raised by Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The June 3, 2015 resolution adopted by the State Board when it approved ESC-New Jersey's enlargement of purpose recognized that, in addition \"to provid[ing] educational and administrative services and programs to member school district boards of education,\" it was \"approved to provide services to nonpublic schools, cooperative transportation to out-of-district schools, cooperative purchasing, adult education, summer school, computer services, specialized consultants, printing and duplicating services, equipment maintenance services and other specialized services.\" Its scope of purpose was enlarged in or about December 1991 to allow provision of nursing services to nonpublic schools. A prior name-change application from Middlesex County Educational Services Commission to Middlesex Regional Educational Services Commission was approved in or about June 2005.
