The Government Records Council (GRC or Council) denied the Libertarians For Transparent Government's OPRA request for unapproved minutes. The trial judge held the draft minutes were \"deliberative material,\" and therefore exempt from OPRA's disclosure requirements. Because draft minutes are a preliminary document subject to revision, they remain \"deliberative material\" and exempt from the disclosure requirements of OPRA until approved by the public body. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 4, 2016, plaintiff submitted a request to the GRC for a copy of its February 23, 2016 public meeting minutes. In its response on April 13, 2016, the GRC advised that its March 29, 2016 meeting was cancelled for lack of a quorum. Therefore, the Council had not reviewed and voted on the minutes, and they remained in draft form. Relying on N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, the GRC stated that it considered records in draft form to be \"exempt from disclosure as 'inter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative' ... material.\" The Council continued, advising that\n   \"[o]nce the minutes are approved they become government records and must be disclosed. However, while they are still in draft form, they are considered exempt from public access under OPRA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several days later, plaintiff presented an Order to Show Cause (OTSC) and Verified Complaint asserting a violation of OPRA and the common law and requesting the production of the draft minutes. The trial judge signed the order on April 18, 2016, and ordered the GRC to appear on June 23 and show cause why an order should not be entered compelling it to comply with OPRA, provide the draft minutes, and pay plaintiff counsel fees. In early May, the GRC advised that it had approved the draft meeting minutes at its April 26, 2016 meeting and posted them on its website that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After oral argument, the judge rendered an oral decision on July 12, 2016. She found the draft minutes were pre-decisional because they were prepared for editing and approval. She also determined the draft minutes were advisory and deliberative, and, therefore, they were not a government record subject to disclosure under\n   OPRA. The following day, the judge issued a second oral decision, rejecting plaintiff's argument under common law for disclosure of the draft minutes. An order was entered on July 14, 2016, denying plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues that the draft minutes are not pre-decisional or deliberative solely because they are unapproved, and, even if portions of the minutes are exempt as privileged, the minutes should be produced with redactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asserts that the GRC's failure to produce the draft minutes violated the mandate under the Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA), N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 to -21, that minutes must be made \"promptly available.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Our review of the trial judge's decision is plenary.

Draft minutes carry no import.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We are mindful that under OPRA \"any limitations on the right of access ... shall be construed in favor of the public's right of access.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilleran v. Twp. of Bloomfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304249\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/227/159/#p185\">\n    227 N.J. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304249,12304227\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/800/\">\n    149 A.3d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (quoting N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 ). However, the inherent nature of a draft document as both advisory and requiring deliberation prior to approval, compels the conclusion that draft minutes are \"advisory, consultative, deliberative material,\" and are not subject to disclosure under OPRA as a government record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since draft minutes are not government records subject to disclosure under OPRA, there can be no requirement for their production in a redacted form. Plaintiff relies on N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g) in support of its argument that the draft minutes can be produced with redactions. That provision permits a custodian of a government record to delete a portion of a record it deems to be exempt from public access and produce the remainder of the record. N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5(g). In keeping with our reasoning set\n   forth above, that section of the statute cannot apply to draft minutes. We have deemed the drafts to be advisory, deliberative, and a recommendation subject to revision. Therefore, the entire document is privileged and exempt until approved by the public body. To produce an entire document redacted would be illogical and serve no purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although plaintiff did not assert a violation of OPMA in its Verified Complaint, and agreed with the trial judge it was not raising a contravention of that Act, it now argues before us that the GRC did not make its minutes \"promptly available\" as required under N.J.S.A. 10:4-14. Because plaintiff received the approved minutes shortly after filing its OTSC, compliance with OPMA was not at issue; the trial court was only asked to address whether the\n   <em>\n    draft\n   </em>\n   minutes were subject to\n   <em>\n    OPRA\n   </em>\n   disclosure. We therefore have also only considered the applicability of OPRA to these unapproved minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We note, however, the consistency of our determination today with our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Kean Federation of Teachers v. Morell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n    448 N.J.

In\n   <em>\n    Morell\n   </em>\n   , we held that public bodies must \"approve and make their meeting minutes available to the public in a manner that fulfills the\n   Legislature's commitment to transparency in public affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In considering the Legislature's intent behind a public agency's OPMA obligation to make their meeting minutes \"promptly available,\" we were discussing the timeliness of releasing\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   minutes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n    at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n    154 A.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted the Legislature's \"fact-sensitive standard\" in its use of the wording \"promptly available\" rather than setting a definitive timeframe, and recognized the need to balance respect for the \"prerogatives of independent public bodies\" with \"the public policy codified in OPMA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n    at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301997\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/520/#p531\">\n    154 A.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   We have respected those same principles in our decision today. The public entity retains its privilege of reviewing, editing, and approving its draft minutes prior to their release. It must perform this function, however, in a timely manner to satisfy OPMA's \"promptly available\" requirement. As a result, the public entity remains consistent with fundamental principles of municipal law and compliant with OPRA and OPMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiff does not renew its argument made before the trial court that the minutes are subject to disclosure under common law principles.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiff did not claim a violation of OPMA in its Verified Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The GRC did not dispute that the draft minutes were government records; it asserts only that the minutes are exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process privilege.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    A petition for certification, filed by defendants the Board of Trustees of Kean University and Kean University, is currently pending.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
