Harrell, Jr. (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Leahy, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The victim, Mr. Ellis Lee, was waiting at a bus stop in Baltimore City at approximately 2:00 a.m. on June 17, 2015. A man, who was covering part of his face with his T-shirt, pointed a gun at Mr. Lee and told him to hand over his money. Once it became clear that Mr. Lee did not have any money, the man told Mr. Lee to run and then opened fire, striking Mr. Lee once in his right lower calf muscle as he was fleeing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Shortly thereafter at the hospital, Mr. Lee gave a description of his assailant, noting that the man had a neck tattoo with a block-cursive \"M\" in it, and that he believed that he had seen him before and recognized his voice. Later that same morning, after Mr. Lee was released from the hospital, he was transported to the police station where he viewed two photo arrays. In the first photo array, Malik Small (\"Appellant\") was the only person featured with a neck tattoo. Mr. Lee indicated that Appellant's photo may depict the man who shot him, but said that he was not sure. Then the officers presented Mr. Lee with a second photo array, and, although this time all photos featured persons with neck tattoos of various content, Appellant's photo was only one of two that had lettering in the tattoo. More significantly, Appellant's photo was the only one repeated from the first photo array and the only one with a block cursive \"M.\" Mr. Lee selected Appellant, stating, \"This is the same tattoo and face I remember robbing me and the man I remember shooting me. I also remember him from coming into my job on two different occasions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to his jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Appellant moved to suppress anything arising from both of the photo arrays prepared by the Baltimore City Police Department for Mr. Lee. The suppression court, although troubled by the suggestiveness of repeating Appellant's photo in the second photo array, found by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Lee's identification was reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant's first challenge-and the primary focus of this appeal-is whether the suppression court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We hold that the inclusion of Appellant's photo in the first photo array showing the distinctive \"M\" tattooed in cursive on his neck-where no other person had a visible neck tattoo-coupled with the fact that Appellant was the only person whose photo was repeated in the second array, rendered the identification procedure impermissibly suggestive. We conclude, however, that the totality of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Lee's identification of Appellant-including recalling the unique features of his tattoo-made it sufficiently reliable to overcome the suggestive nature of the identification procedure and forfend violation of Appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the conclusion of his trial, the jury convicted Appellant of attempted robbery, second degree assault, and reckless endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant assigns error on several additional rulings by the trial court as reflected in the following issues, which we quote from Appellant's brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Did the trial court err in allowing the State to impermissibly argue its opinion regarding the credibility of the Defense's sole alibi witness?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it sustained the State's objection to entry of Appellant's relevant phone records into evidence?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Did the trial court err by refusing to grant Appellant's motion for judgement of acquittal on the grounds that the State failed to present evidence sufficient to sustain Appellant's\n   convictions for attempted robbery, second degree assault, and reckless endangerment?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Discerning no error or abuse of discretion, we affirm the trial court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Hearing on the Motion to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 18, 2016, Appellant moved to suppress the fruit of the two photo arrays prepared and administered by the Baltimore City Police. At the outset, the court suppressed the State's use of the first photo array because Det. Stanley Ottey, the detective who administered the first photo array, was unavailable at the time of the hearing. The hearing continued then on the question of whether the second photo array should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Lee testified to the course of events on June 17, 2015. He stated that at about 2:00 a.m. in the morning\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [I w]as sitting on the bus stop, the 36 bus stop on Northern Parkway and Alameda, had my phone in my right hand, checking my phone, and in the corner of my ear, I hear \"Let me get your money.\" I looked to my immediate right. There's a male looking at me with a gun aimed towards me. I told him I don't have anything.... There was no wallet on me. He said, \"Run, bitch.\" So he has a gun, so I ran.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   He then \"heard some shots go off and [he] felt the pluck at the back of [his] leg and [ ] kept running.\" He stopped briefly to call his family, and eventually he made his way to Gittings Avenue, where he sought help at the fire department located there. Mr. Lee was transported by ambulance to The Johns Hopkins Hospital emergency room. Baltimore City police officer Kenneth Howard, who was later joined by detectives Joel Hawk and Matthew DiSimone, met with Mr. Lee at the hospital and interviewed him about what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Det. DiSimone testified that Mr. Lee described his attacker as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [a] black male, light skin, believed he had seen him before, a light [T]-shirt, tattoo on the right side of his neck, 5'8?, regular sized, a short haircut. He held the bottom of his shirt up over his face, blue jeans, block letter tattoo on neck, had a letter M in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Lee told the detectives that he believed he had seen his assailant at his job at Staples on approximately two prior occasions, but could not specify the time frame. According to Det. DiSimone, Mr. Lee recognized his assailant because of \"the tattoo and his voice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Some hours later, after Mr. Lee's gunshot wound was treated and he was released from the hospital, the detectives drove Mr. Lee to the bus stop on Northern Parkway so that he could show them exactly where the incident occurred. Afterward they drove Mr. Lee to the police station where they continued interviewing him about the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The First Photo Array\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Det. DiSimone was permitted to testify as to how he compiled the first photo array in order to give context for his testimony concerning how he generated the second photo array. He recounted that when they returned to the station on the morning of the 17th, Mr. Lee provided another description of the assailant and his tattoo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consulting his notes from that morning, Det. DiSimone said Mr. Lee described the assailant as \"[a] light brown, black male, 5'8?, regular sized, with a scraggly beard, [and] a tattoo on his neck.\" And Mr. Lee described the tattoo as \"[b]lock styled cursive script, bold, not dull, containing multiple letters and at least one of them was an M[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Det. DiSimone then used a Baltimore City Police Department database to compile a group of mugshots to create a photo array based on the description Mr. Lee provided. He searched for males between 5'6? and 5'8? with light brown complexions and beards, but he did not include neck tattoos in the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Det. DiSimone confirmed that the first photo array was administered at roughly 8:30 a.m., and featured six African-American males, appearing to be around the same age, directly facing the camera. Each man had a beard and short, cropped hair. Despite Det. DiSimone's intention to leave tattoos out of the photos,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's photo was the only photo in the array with a tattoo visible on the side of his neck. The tattoo, shown from the front, displayed a cursive \"M\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Lee testified that the detectives brought him \"a collection of pictures on the first sheet.\" He recalled that, \"I picked out one who kind of looked like him, but I wasn't too sure. I was, like, okay, I see the tattoo. I remember there being a LYM tattoo.\" The court asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: You mean you saw the tattoo on the picture or you saw the tattoo-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. LEE: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: -on the person?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   MR. LEE: The tattoo on the neck, I just related the two. I was like, oh, it looks pretty much like the same tat I saw. I identified the person, but I told them, I was like, \"He was covering his face with the shirt.\" I'm not going to give you 100 percent of somebody's life in my control. He said, \"Okay. I understand.\" I gave him in terms of 80 percent sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Det. Ottey, who administered the photo array, noted Mr. Lee's statement on the Photograph Array Action form: \"# 2 looks like him, doesn't think it's him.\" Det. DiSimone testified\n   that the first photo array was a \"negative array,\" meaning that a positive identification had not been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Second Photo Array\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After the conclusion of the first photo array, Mr. Lee gave another taped statement at 11:16 a.m. Det. DiSimone testified that he conducted the interview, and that he relied on Mr. Lee's description of the tattoo in creating the second photo array. Using the same database, he inserted the parameters: \"[b]lack male, light brown skin, and [ ] tattoo on neck.\" When asked whether the search parameters included tattoos with letters, Det. DiSimone testified that some of the tattoos may have had letters, while others did not. When pressed by the court on this point, Det. DiSimone testified that he did not include tattoos with letters as part of his search parameters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   He explained that this was because the number of people who had tattoos and met other parameters, such as light brown skin, was very small. From the limited number of \"hits\" that matched those parameters, Det. DiSimone selected five male suspect profiles to include with Appellant's, making six persons featured in the second array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The second photo array, introduced at the suppression hearing as Defendant's Exhibit 4, contained two photographs on one page for each person; the photo on the left showed the person facing the camera and the photo on the right showed the person looking to his left, displaying the right side of his face and neck in profile. Appellant was the only individual that appeared in both the first and second photo arrays. Each person shown in the second array had some sort of tattoo on the right side of his neck, and one other person besides Appellant had a tattoo featuring cursive letters. Appellant's suspect profile, however, was the only one to contain a cursive script tattoo\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a block letter \"M\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his skin tone\n   appears markedly lighter than that of the other men featured in the second photo array.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The court asked Det. DiSimone:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [THE COURT]: Were any of the photographs used in the first photographic array used again in the second photographic array?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [DET. DISIMONE]: No, ma'am, just the suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [THE COURT]: And why not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [DET. DISIMONE]: Because they didn't have tattoos on their neck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Once Det. DiSimone finished compiling the array, Sergeant Det. Ethan Newberg, who was not involved with the investigation, administered the second photo array, roughly three hours after the first, at approximately 11:45 a.m. When Mr. Lee saw the third photo in the second array, which\n   showed a frontal and side picture of Appellant, Mr. Lee said, \"That's him. That's who shot me.\" Sgt. Newberg recorded this statement electronically in his notes. Mr. Lee also wrote beneath the photo: \"This is the same tattoo and face I remember robbing me and the man I remember shooting me. I also remember him from coming into my job on two different occasions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Mr. Lee testified that at the time he made the second identification he was \"100 percent [sure] that that was the person[ ]\" who had shot him. Mr. Lee testified that he had previously encountered the individual he selected from the photo array because the individual had come into the Staples, where Mr. Lee worked, about two times, and he recognized the voice of the man who shot him to be the same as the person whom he encountered on his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Approximately two weeks after making this identification, Mr. Lee called Det. DiSimone to report seeing a man that he believed was the assailant from the night of the shooting. Mr. Lee testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   MR. LEE: I saw a gentleman on a dirt bike, looks very similar to him right here. So I called [Det. DiSimone]. I said, \"Could this be the guy here,\" because when he looked at me-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: So the record should reflect that the witness gestured towards [Appellant]. Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. LEE: When we-when I had seen him, when I looked at him, his eyes got huge and he sped off through a red light. So I just called [Det. DiSimone] to be sure. I said, \"Hey, you know, just to be sure, I remember you saying the guy was arrested already.\" He said, \"Well, that can't be true. We already have the guy and he's\"-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: Turn to me now. I can't hear you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   MR. LEE: I'm sorry. He said, \"that can't be true. We already have the guy. You know, he's already confessed to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   You're fine. You should be fine. Is everything okay?\" And I told him what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Lee testified that \"way after\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   identifying Appellant in the second photo array as the man who attacked him, he indicated that he was only 70 percent sure that he was correct. The court asked him, \"[s]o what changed between the day of the incident when you're 100 percent sure and way after when you're 70 percent sure?\" to which Mr. Lee responded, \"I don't even know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During closing arguments, defense counsel urged the court to find that the identification process was unduly suggestive because \"they had already shown [Mr. Lee] a picture of [Appellant]\" and because after the first negative photo array, the detectives showed Mr. Lee a second array in which \"[t]he one constant was [Appellant], the same individual that Mr. Lee had said [he] wasn't sure and didn't think that was him[.]\" Counsel pressed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   When you look at that photo array, the second photo array, when they were supposed to be-compile [sic] a photo array that contained M, tattoos with an M, none of those individuals in those\n   photographs contain a tattoo with an M at all, and in fact, the only person with the M is [Appellant]. So when Mr. Lee looks at this, the only person-if he said, \"I told you all that the person had [was] an M, show me photographs of people with M's so I can attempt to identify,\" and they show him six photographs and of the six photographs, only one of those photographs contain a person\n   with an M, and if that isn't unduly suggestive that the only person that I'm looking for an the only distinguishing characteristic of the person that I'm trying to identify because I've told them about this M is [Appellant], then obviously that would be the person that he would pick out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Ultimately, the suppression court denied Appellant's motion to suppress the second photo array, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   All right. Well, as I said, I have no problem with the tattoo. I mean, you can't-I don't think it's reasonable to expect the police to find tattoos that are similar in addition to Defendant's that are similar. So I have no problem with the fact that everybody in the [second] photo array doesn't have the identical tattoo or even letters in their tattoo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   My problem is with the timing, with the fact that they showed a picture of the Defendant at 8:30 in the morning. In one photo array, he says, \"I'm not sure that's the guy,\" and then they show him another photo array three hours later, approximately three hours later, and the only person that's repeated in the second photo array is the Defendant. That's troubling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Otherwise, I think the [second] photographic array, Defense 4, on its face is not suggestive. The procedure used during that small time that this photograph was shown to Mr. Lee does not appear suggestive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   So the question becomes for this Court by the preponderance of the evidence do I believe that the [second] photographic array was suggestive. The problem is that I find that it's reliable by clear and convincing evidence because the Defendant-the victim-the alleged victim knew who the Defendant was. He had already seen him twice before. He recognized the voice. It had nothing to do with the photograph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   So for those reasons, I'm going to deny the Defense's motion and allow the [second] photographic array be entered into evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At trial, Mr. Lee recounted the events that transpired on the night of the shooting. He testified that he described the assailant's physical appearance, including his neck tattoo, when he was at the hospital. Additionally, Mr. Lee noted that while he did not know his attacker personally, he believed that he had seen him and heard him speak \"around two times\" at his job within the three months prior to the incident. Mr. Lee then identified Appellant in court as the \"person that attempted to rob\" him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Lee was asked if he remembered being shown a set of photographs, and was asked to relay the instructions that he was given before viewing the first photo array. The State asked Mr. Lee to recount how he selected a picture that he recognized in the first array, and he answered \"[t]he tattoo. The skin color helped.\" When asked specifically about why the tattoo stood out to him, he answered that \"[i]t was the M that stood out the most, almost as if I was there at that very moment looking at him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Lee was then shown the second photo array, labeled as State's Exhibit # 2A, and he indicated that he identified \"Number 3\" as his assailant. The State\n   then offered into evidence the second photo array and the instructions given prior to the second array. The trial court admitted both documents over the defense's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Testimony established that early in the morning on June 17, Detectives DiSimone and Hawk returned to the scene of the crime to canvass the area, but were unable to find any blood trails, shell casings, or \"any other signs ... that that was the crime scene[.]\" Det. DiSimone admitted on cross-examination that he did not go to the Staples store where Mr. Lee claimed that he had seen Appellant \"to do any investigation\" or \"pull any video ... to try to determine if [Appellant] had ever been\" to that store. He also admitted that after receiving a phone call from Mr. Lee detailing his belief that he may have encountered the man who robbed him, riding on a dirt bike, he did not \"do any further investigation as to the information that\n   [Mr. Lee] provided[.]\" Apart from Mr. Lee's identification, the State introduced no other evidence that linked Appellant to the crime. At the close of the State's case, Appellant moved for an acquittal on all charges. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ms. Tiana Thomas, Appellant's girlfriend and sole defense witness, then testified as an alibi witness. Ms. Thomas testified that she called Appellant on the night in question after her work shift and that the two went to bed together before midnight. She said that Appellant did not leave the house during the night, that he left the house the next morning after 8:00 a.m., and that she called his phone to inform him that he forgot something at the house. Appellant attempted to enter phone records showing Ms. Thomas's phone calls to Appellant on June 16 and June 17. The State objected to the entrance of records \"that she's already testified to.\" The trial court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Appellant then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal on all charges. He argued that there was testimony that could lead a reasonable jury to doubt Mr. Lee's credibility because \"he says he's only 70 percent\" sure that his identification was correct. The trial court denied the motion, stating that \"[i]f the jury believes Mr. Lee, then I'm satisfied that a reasonable jury could find [Appellant] guilty[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The jury found Appellant guilty of attempted robbery, second-degree assault, and reckless endangerment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced Appellant to eight years of incarceration. Appellant noted this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We include additional facts as they pertain to the issues in the following discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    The Motion to Suppress the Second Photo Array\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Our review of the circuit court's denial of the motion to suppress is limited \" 'to the record of the suppression hearing[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    James v.

Appellant also challenges the detectives' failure to show photos of \"filler suspects\" who more closely resembled him-including the presence of neck tattoos-as required by Maryland Code (2003, 2011 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), Public Safety Article (\"PS\"), \u00a7 3-506.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The State counters that Mr. Lee's description of his assailant's tattoo at the hospital provided the police with an initial reason to select Appellant as a potential suspect. The State maintains that Mr. Lee did not totally exclude Appellant after the first photo array but only equivocated, indicating that the man in the photograph did look like the assailant. This, according to the State, gave the detectives administering the array a tangible reason to place Appellant in the second photo array.

Rather, we reasoned that any perception of suggestiveness was remedied by the reliability of the identification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   That mark was indeed an identifying characteristic. Observation of identifying characteristics is the core of any identification process. Differences among individuals are the very means by which one may be distinguished from all others. Similarities can lead to confusion, and even to mistake. The not unheard-of-trick of planting a look-alike in the courtroom surely is not employed to aid in the search for truth, but to thwart that search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [Sallie] argues that his mark is unique. Every individual is unique. The mouth, the lips, the teeth, the chin, the cheeks,\n   the nose, the eyes, the forehead, the ears, the hair, or any combination of two or more of those and other features, make every individual unique. They make him different from all others. They are the basis upon which any person is visually distinguished from other persons. The more subtle the distinctions, the more difficult the identification, and the greater the potential for error. If the burglar in this case had not had such a distinctive mark, then Sallie's mark would have cleared him forthwith as a suspect. The fact that the burglar had the mark, and that Sallie had it, and that the mark is unique, made his identification inevitable indeed, but also made it more rather than less reliable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 472,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=332%20A.2d%20316\">\n    332 A.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , this Court considered a photographic identification procedure that involved the repetitive use of a person's picture over the course of two photo arrays.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244062\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/219/1/#p14\">\n    219 Md.

We recognize that the distinctive features of a particular tattoo-like the unique features of a person's eyes or nose-may be the very characteristic that sets someone apart. But this case illustrates the dangers of highlighting one person in a photo array who has a feature that other people can share (i.e., having a tattoo), without including any other person in the array with a similar feature. Filler photos should include photos of persons who \"resemble\" the description of the suspect, including \"any unique or unusual features.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   When an assailant is described as\n   someone with a tattoo, then the filler photos should include persons with tattoos-not necessarily\n   the same tattoos-in the same general location, if possible, as that described by the witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Mr. Lee's identification of Appellant in the first photo array was entirely dependent on the presence of the tattoo in the picture. Mr. Lee testified to the following at the suppression hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The first time, it was a collection of pictures on the first sheet. I picked out one who kind of looked like him, but I wasn't too sure. I was, like, okay,\n   <em>\n    I see the tattoo.\n   </em>\n   I remember there being a LYM tattoo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Emphasis added). Yet, Mr. Lee was unable to positively identify his attacker, and estimated that he was roughly \"80 percent sure\" of his choice. The resultant negative photo array left the police in a quandary. Clearly, if the first array had included other persons with neck tattoos (as in the second photo array in this case), then the police would have been able to repeat at least one of those photos along with Appellant in a subsequent array. What ultimately rendered the identification procedure in this case impermissibly suggestive was, only hours later, including only Appellant from the first photo array-with his distinctive \"M\" tattooed in cursive on his neck-in the second photo array. When pressed, Det. DiSimone admitted that he did not include tattoos that had letters in his search parameters for the other \"fillers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even though the investigating officers did not tell Mr. Lee which picture to select, the repetition of Appellant's picture, which featured a virtually identical shot of the tattoo, essentially pointed out to Mr. Lee that the repeated picture was the \"correct\" choice.\n   <em>\n    Conyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"193868\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/115/114/#p120\">\n    115 Md.

This sequence of events is distinguishable from the identification procedures in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , where the arrays were shown a day apart and the photographs of the defendant were not only unremarkable, they were also different because the police used an updated photograph in the second array.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244062\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/219/1/#p14\">\n    219 Md.

In the instant case, Mr. Lee had several compelling reasons to notice the repetition of Appellant's photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The suppression court correctly identified the problematic timing of the photo arrays, along with the fact that Appellant was the only person repeated in the second array, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   My problem is with the timing, with the fact that they showed a picture of the [Appellant] at 8:30 in the morning. In\n   one photo array, he says, \"I'm not sure that's the guy,\" and then they show him another photo array three hours later, approximately three hours later, and the only person that's repeated in the second photo array is the [Appellant].

Appellant highlights several aspects of Mr. Lee's identification that he contends make it unreliable: 1) Mr. Lee encountered the assailant late at night in a location with little lighting; 2) the assailant's face was partially covered by a T-shirt; 3) Mr. Lee reported seeing someone on the street who he believed was the perpetrator, weeks after Appellant was already in custody; and 4) Mr. Lee testified that his confidence in the correctness of his identification waivered throughout the process, dropping to \"only 70 percent sure of his identification\" shortly before the trial. Appellant also asserts that two momentary interactions at Mr. Lee's workplace do not rise to the \"high[ ] degree of familiarity ... to overcome an otherwise suggestive array.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   To the contrary, the State offers several indicia of reliability, including: 1) Mr. Lee's opportunity to see and speak with Appellant on at least two prior occasions; 2) the physical proximity of Mr. Lee to his assailant during the alleged attempted robbery; 3) the accuracy of the description of Appellant's tattoo; and 4) the fact that the event was still fresh in Mr. Lee's mind when he made the identification. The State places great emphasis on Mr. Lee's testimony that he recognized the person who attacked him from two prior interactions at Staples and recognized his voice. The State contends, therefore, that Mr. Lee did not rely solely on the photograph for making his identification. The State also avers that Mr. Lee's equivocation during his pre-trial identification of Appellant goes to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility, and does not justify exclusion of the second array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Supreme Court has instructed that \"reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/#p107\">\n    432 U.S. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/#p107\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Opportunity to view\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Mr. Lee observed his attacker on a \"pitch black[ ]\" street \"after midnight[,]\" but there was \"light [ ] on him, so it was kind of easier to see him because of where he was standing.\" At the time of the crime, Mr. Lee was \"maybe a foot[ ]\" away from his assailant and estimated that he was able to view his assailant for approximately two minutes.

Accuracy of the description\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Within hours of the attack, when Mr. Lee was at the hospital, he described his attacker as \"[a] black male, light skin[ ] ... a light [T]-shirt, tattoo on the right side of his neck, 5'8?, regular sized, a short haircut.\" Mr. Lee noted that his attacker \"held the bottom of his shirt up over his face[,]\" was wearing blue jeans, and that the \"block letter tattoo\" had the \"letter M in it.\" Although Mr. Lee \"made it very clear there was a shirt that was covering the face[,]\" he described, in detail, a portion of the neck tattoo, which allowed him to make an identification. He told Det. DiSimone that he recognized his assailant because of \"the tattoo and his voice.\" These facts weigh in favor of reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    4. Level of certainty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Mr. Lee's level of certainty constantly varied throughout the course of the investigation and up to the date of trial. During the first photo array, Mr. Lee identified Appellant as the man who could have shot him, but told the detective conducting the\n   array that the assailant was concealing part of his face with his shirt. The State conceded that the first array, which Det. DiSimone categorized as \"negative,\" should have included a tattoo in each picture. Despite Appellant being the only individual to appear with a tattoo, Mr. Lee indicated that he was only \"80 percent sure.\" Subsequently, Mr. Lee gave another taped statement where he described the tattoo that he had just viewed. After the second photo array, Mr. Lee was \"100 percent\" sure that Appellant was the person who shot him because of \"[t]he tattoo specifically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Roughly two weeks after completing the second photo array, Mr. Lee doubted his identification when, while walking down a street in Baltimore, he encountered a different man who he believed may have been the assailant. At the suppression hearing Mr. Lee indicated that he remained only 70 percent sure of his identification, but could not articulate why he was less sure. Overall, we conclude these facts weigh somewhat against reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    5. Length of time before identification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Mr. Lee was able to describe his assailant to police while the memory was \"fresh\" in his mind. The alleged robbery occurred at roughly 2 a.m., and Mr. Lee identified Appellant in the second photo array less than ten hours later. These facts also weigh in favor of reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mr. Lee's Prior Familiarity with Appellant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Mr. Lee testified that he had seen a man with the same tattoo as Appellant's at his workplace on two different occasions. Specifically, Mr. Lee recalled that he was \"100 percent [sure] that that was the person\" after the second array because when he saw Appellant's tattoo, \"[i]t was almost like a rush of memory from both Staples [sic] and what I remembered seeing that night.\" Additionally, Mr. Lee also mentioned that he was familiar with the assailant's voice because he had heard it before at Staples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The suppression court, in its decision not to suppress the second photo array, found that the second array was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   reliable by clear and convincing evidence because[ ] the victim-the alleged victim knew who the Defendant was. He had already seen him twice before. He recognized his voice. It had nothing to do with the photograph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Appellant insists that Mr. Lee's prior interactions with him failed to establish an \"acquaintanceship\" between the two that could bolster the reliability of an already suggestive identification procedure. Appellant relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Clopten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995578\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/223/1103/#p1116\">\n    223 P.3d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116-17 (Utah 2009), which holds that a single sighting of a person from a distance by two different witnesses prior to an extrajudicial identification-absent any other independent corroboration of the reliability of the identification-made both witnesses \"essentially strangers to [the defendant].\" Appellant avers that the \"legal standard for what constitutes an 'acquaintance' requires a high degree of familiarity,\" such as that between the victim and the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Green v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7380593\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/580/1325/\">\n    580 A.2d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 1990). There, the court held that a shooting victim's description of the defendant was sufficiently reliable to overcome an impermissibly suggestive single-photo lineup because the defendant and the victim had lived together for approximately six months prior to the shooting, and the victim had told police before seeing the photo that the defendant was the shooter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7380593\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/580/1325/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7380593\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/580/1325/\">\n    at 1326-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   We do not adopt the view that consideration of prior familiarity is limited to the high degree of \"acquaintanceship\" that Appellant advocates. The degree of prior familiarity between the witness or victim and the perpetrator is but one factor in the totality of circumstances involved in an identification. Although a lesser showing of prior familiarity may require stronger independent indicia of reliability, we will not deem irrelevant a victim's prior contact with his or her assailant simply because they met only a few times before, as in the instant case. The reliability of Mr. Lee's identification here hinges not only on his prior interactions with Appellant, but also his opportunity to observe his attacker on the night in question and his ability to identify the tattoo in such detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Therefore, while we recognize that Mr. Lee's prior familiarity with Appellant, standing alone, may not be sufficient to overcome the suggestive procedure in this case, it nonetheless bolsters the reliability of the identification when considered in the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Presence of Appellant's Unique Neck Tattoo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Finally, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Sallie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2308419\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/24/468/#p472\">\n    24 Md.

Moreover, as the State points out, the trial court had already instructed the jury that exercising common sense was appropriate for purposes of evaluating the evidence and determining witness credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we hold that, even if Appellant preserved this argument for appeal, the State's closing argument was not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   <strong>\n    The Exclusion of the Phone Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Defense counsel sought to establish that Appellant spoke to Ms. Thomas on the phone on the night in question around 10:30 p.m. and that she spoke to him again on the phone the next morning around 8:00 a.m. Appellant contends that the court's exclusion of phone records showing that those calls were made was an abuse of discretion. Appellant proffers that the admission of the records would have altered the course of the trial if the jury was permitted to view the records, and the failure to admit the records corroborating Ms. Thomas' testimony effectively denied Appellant the right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The State asserts that the records were cumulative evidence, and defense counsel failed to establish why any of the phone calls would be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   On direct examination, Ms. Thomas testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   [MS. THOMAS]: I worked that evening at 5:00. I got off around 10:30 or so and I dropped my friend off first on Cold Spring Lane and then I kept calling [Appellant]. He was already at the house waiting for me. So [I] c[a]me home and then I went home with [Appellant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Let me stop you there.

Meet (indiscernible) our house because (indiscernible) cooked, and then when I got to the house I called him to let him know I was outside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Ms. Thomas testified further that the two went to sleep together and awoke around 8:00 the next morning. Her testimony continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And when you got up the next morning do you recall what you and [Appellant] did?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   [MS. THOMAS]: He left out, and then I called his phone a little bit right after he left out to let him know he forgot [something].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Defense counsel then asked to approach, where the following ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have certified phone records of [Appellant]. I've provided them to the State already.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   THE COURT: No, did you provide her with a certificate that they were authenticated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   [THE STATE]: He did, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   [THE COURT]: Are you objecting?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   [THE STATE]: The State would object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   [THE COURT]: (Indiscernible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   [THE STATE]: He provided the information. The State would object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   [THE COURT]: What's the basis of your objection?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   [THE STATE]: She testified that they made the phone call and that she called him. (Indiscernible) these records to say that she's already testified to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   [THE COURT]: I'll sustain it. Objection's sustained.... Any other questions, [defense counsel]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Court's indulgence. No, no further questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   After the trial judge read the jury instructions, the court summoned counsel to the bench to discuss exceptions to the court's instructions. It was at the conclusion of exceptions to the instructions that defense counsel noted an objection to the court's prior ruling on the phone records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And before we go any further, Judge, I'm going to just note my objection to the Court not allowing the (indiscernible) phone records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   [THE COURT]: Oh, you're way past that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   [THE COURT]: You should have made that (indiscernible), okay.

Preservation of the Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   The State asserts that the exclusion of the records was not properly preserved as defense counsel failed to object to the exclusion of the records or make an offer of proof at the time the admission of the records was being considered. Appellant maintains that there was no need for an objection following the exclusion of the phone records, as defense counsel made an offer of proof as to the phone calls that \"was absolutely clear ... that the telephone records the Defense sought to admit immediately following Ms. Thomas's testimony would have corroborated her testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   Appellant's counsel's failure to make a proffer at trial when the court sustained the State's objection controls this issue on appeal-both because it precludes our review and because it illustrates why the trial court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.

Newberg told him \"to make sure this was the same person, just to be careful for it.\" We agree that it is improper for a police officer to verbally imply that the suspected defendant is featured in the photo array.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PS \u00a7 3-506.1(b)(3) ;\n    <em>\n     State v. Nicoletti\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7966362\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/471/613/#p616\">\n     471 A.2d 613\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 615 (R.I. 1984) (stating that when the police suggest to a witness that the perpetrator is in the photo array, the witness is incentivized to select a person featured in the array rather than select a picture that reflects the witness's memory) (citation omitted). In this case, however, Sgt. Newberg's instruction is subject to more than one interpretation. It is just as likely that Sgt. Newberg was instructing Mr. Lee to carefully select the person who most resembled the \"same person\" that shot him, rather than instructing him that the person in the first photo array that he had already highlighted was also in the second array.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-337\">\n    We note that PS \u00a7 3-506.1(c) requires that law enforcement agents ensure that each \"filler\"-a photograph of a person not suspected of committing the crime in question-resembles the description of the suspected perpetrator \"in significant physical features, including any unique or unusual features[.]\" PS \u00a7 3-506.1(c)(1). Here, the officers should have included other persons with tattoos visible on their necks.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v. Flores\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711297\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/102/707/\">\n     102 A.D.3d 707\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711297\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/102/707/\">\n     961 N.Y.S.2d 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 178 (2013) (\"each [participant in the photo array] had a small tattoo on the right side of his neck that was only partially visible in the photographs.\"). In some states, the police will alter the photographs shown so that each person has a similar tattoo.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-338\">\n    While PS \u00a7 3-506.1(c)(1) requires photo arrays to include fillers that \"resemble\" the suspected perpetrator, we do not interpret this to mean that law enforcement officers are required to \"touch up\" the photos so that every person has virtually the same tattoo. Rather, we hold that when the presence of a tattoo is at the center of the witness's description, law enforcement officers shall include pictures of people with tattoos in generally the same area as the suspected perpetrator to avoid creating a suggestive array. Artificially rendering the identical tattoo on each person in a photo array will more than likely create a dangerous likelihood of an unreliable identification of an innocent person.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    The trial court instructed the jury instruction in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n    You may draw any reasonable inferences or conclusions from the evidence that you believe to be justified by common sense and your own experiences.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n    [Y]ou are the sole judges of whether a witness should be believed.

As we explained above, the trial court has broad discretion to control the flow of evidence, and, at the point when the State objected, the trial court exercised its discretion to adjudge the records to be cumulative. The importance Appellant placed on those records was not readily apparent at the time because defense counsel failed to explain it at the time of the State's objection. Accordingly, we cannot find the trial court's ruling to be an abuse of discretion now. Had this occurred as part of the defense's re-direct of Ms. Thomas, perhaps Appellant's argument would carry more weight.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
