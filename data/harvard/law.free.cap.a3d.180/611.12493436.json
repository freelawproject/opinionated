Christophersen\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of\n   strict foreclosure, rendered in favor of the plaintiff, US Bank National Association, as Trustee of Maiden Lane Asset-Backed Securities I Trust 2008-1. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action, (2) the court improperly failed to consider the defendant's concerns regarding the amount of debt, (3) the court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a continuance, and (4) the court abused its discretion in ordering a judgment of strict foreclosure rather than a foreclosure by sale. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On July, 11 2003, the defendant secured a promissory note in the amount of $460,000 by a mortgage on premises known as 2 Woodcock Lane in Westport. As of September, 2008, the defendant had failed to pay the installments of principal and interest. In May, 2011, the plaintiff commenced this action, seeking to foreclose the mortgage on the defendant's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, to which the defendant objected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 21, 2014, the defendant, who then was represented by counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an answer and special defenses. The parties later negotiated an agreement that the defendant would accept a judgment of strict foreclosure in exchange for an eight month law day. On April 14, 2014, the defendant informed the court of that agreement and withdrew both her answer and her objection to the plaintiff's motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure. The court accepted the agreement and, accordingly, granted the plaintiff's motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, setting a law day of January 6, 2015. On December 24, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment and extend the law day. The court denied the motion to open but sua sponte set a new law day of March 31, 2015. Just prior to the expiration of the new law day, on March 27, 2015, the defendant filed a bankruptcy petition, which resulted in an automatic stay of the foreclosure proceeding. On August 7, 2015, however, acting on a motion filed by the plaintiff, the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the termination of the bankruptcy stay, the plaintiff, on October 1, 2015, filed a motion to open and modify the judgment of strict foreclosure. In its motion, the plaintiff requested that the court make a new finding of debt, award the plaintiff additional costs and attorney's fees, and set a new law day. The defendant filed four successive motions for a continuance of the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to open and modify the judgment. The court,\n   <em>\n    Povodator, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the plaintiff's first three motions for a continuance, and the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. David R. Tobin,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, denied the fourth motion for a continuance. On January 19, 2016, following a hearing, Judge Tobin granted the plaintiff's motion to open and rendered a modified judgment of strict foreclosure with the law days to commence on March 1, 2016. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant first claims that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action.

The note was endorsed in blank and delivered to the plaintiff on or before July 7, 2010.

The defendant had notice and ample time to prepare for the hearing. After the automatic stay was lifted, the defendant filed three motions for a continuance-on November 25 and December 10, 2015, and January 6, 2016-all of which the court granted. After granting the three separate continuances, the court gave the defendant a full opportunity to be heard at the January 19, 2016 hearing where she raised numerous concerns and objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We are also mindful of the principle that \"[w]ithout some evidence to the contrary, we will not presume that the trial court improperly applied the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Farrell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Farrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731379\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/36/305/#p313\">\n    36 Conn.

Tellingly, the defendant failed to present\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence at the hearing on her motion-notwithstanding the passage of five months following the lift of the automatic stay-that called into question the amount stated in the plaintiff's affidavit of debt, and the court expressly gave her an opportunity to do so. That is, during the hearing, the court asked the defendant, \"Do you have a calculation of what you believe the debt to be?\" The defendant responded that she was not prepared to answer that question. Finally, our review confirms that there is no evidence in the record, and the defendant directs us to none, to establish that the court failed to consider the defendant's concerns regarding the amount of debt when the court opened the judgment and rendered a modified judgment of strict foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in denying her fourth motion for a continuance to allow her more time to complete discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The trial court has a responsibility to avoid unnecessary interruptions, to maintain the orderly procedure of the court docket, and to prevent any interference with the fair administration of justice....

Accordingly, [a] trial court holds broad discretion in granting or denying a motion for a continuance. Appellate review of a trial court's denial of a motion for a continuance is governed by an abuse of discretion standard that, although not unreviewable, affords the trial court broad discretion in matters of continuances.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Peatie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060994\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/8/#p12\">\n    112 Conn.

First, as the court observed when it rendered its oral decision denying the continuance during the January 19, 2016 hearing, it already had decided the issues on which the\n   defendant sought discovery. Second, as we have noted in this opinion, the court already had granted the defendant's first three motions for a continuance, even though the case had been pending for more than four years. In denying the continuance, the court properly considered the age of the case, the accommodations it already had made for the defendant and the basis on which the defendant sought the fourth continuance. We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion.

Following oral argument, this court sua sponte ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the related issue of whether the trial court's refusal to entertain the defendant's \"request for the entry of a foreclosure by sale violated the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 49-15 or was based on an erroneous application of ... \u00a7 49-15.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that, under the facts of the present case, the trial court incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 49-15 to deprive the court of the authority to order a foreclosure by sale. Because the court's incorrect application of \u00a7 49-15 prevented the court from exercising its authority, we remand the case to the trial court with direction to rule on the defendant's motion for a judgment of foreclosure by sale. See footnote 9 of this opinion. The question of whether the court's factual finding regarding the equity in the property required it to order a judgment of foreclosure by sale may arise on remand. We therefore address that issue. We conclude that in circumstances where a court finds that the value of the property substantially exceeds the mortgage being foreclosed, a judgment of strict foreclosure would give the plaintiff an improper windfall. See\n   <em>\n    Brann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Savides\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063623\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/48/807/#p812\">\n    48 Conn.

At the January 19, 2016 hearing on the plaintiff's motion to open and modify the 2014 judgment of strict foreclosure, the court began by observing that the judgment, which had been predicated on an eight month law day, had been rendered irrelevant due to the passage of four months during the automatic bankruptcy stay. Therefore, the court reasoned, it was proper to grant the motion to open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff contended that under \u00a7 49-15 (b) everything with respect to that judgment remained in place and the court could only reset the law days. The court reminded the plaintiff that its motion requested greater relief than simply the reentry of the original judgment of strict foreclosure and the resetting of the law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court next turned to the question of determining the amount of the debt. The plaintiff urged the court to rely on its most recent affidavit of debt, dated January 13, 2016. Prior to rendering a modified judgment, the court questioned its authority to modify the judgment by awarding additional fees and costs. In its remarks to counsel, the court indicated that it believed that the scope of its authority to act on the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure was governed by \u00a7 49-15(b). The court further questioned whether that statutory provision granted the court the authority to take any action other than opening the judgment and setting new law days. The plaintiff suggested that the court\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have such authority, pursuant to paragraph F of the Uniform Foreclosure Standing Orders issued by the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court expressed skepticism that a standing order of the Superior Court could grant the court greater authority than contemplated by the General Statutes. Nonetheless, the court accepted the plaintiff's argument and its affidavit of debt. The court then rendered a modified judgment of strict foreclosure with new findings as to additional debt and a revised fair market value of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the court already had taken action on the motion to open that went beyond merely setting a new law day, it determined that \u00a7 49-15(b) barred it from ordering a judgment of foreclosure by sale. Specifically, when the defendant asked whether the court would order a foreclosure by sale, the court stated: \"No, this is a law day, a law day.\n   <em>\n    I cannot grant a motion for foreclosure by sale at this point because the statute precludes me from entertaining that. I can only deal with the motion-the matter that the statute allows me to which is to reset the law day\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) At the close of the\n   hearing, the court set a law day of March 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We first address the question of whether the trial court properly concluded that it lacked authority pursuant to \u00a7 49-15(b) to order a judgment of foreclosure by sale. In general, the court enjoys broad discretion in determining whether to order a judgment of foreclosure by sale or a judgment of strict foreclosure. Our Supreme Court has explained: \"In a foreclosure proceeding the authority of the trial court to order either a strict foreclosure or a foreclosure by sale is clear. General Statutes \u00a7 49-24 provides: All liens and mortgages affecting real property may, on the written motion of any party to any suit relating thereto, be foreclosed by a decree of sale instead of a strict foreclosure at the discretion of the court before which the foreclosure proceedings are pending. In interpreting this statute, we have stated that [i]n Connecticut, the law is well settled that whether a mortgage is to be foreclosed by sale or by strict foreclosure is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.... The foreclosure of a mortgage by sale is not a matter of right, but rests in the discretion of the court before which the foreclosure proceedings are pending.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Irick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502762\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/206/484/#p488\">\n    206 Conn. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20A.2d%201027\">\n    538 A.2d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court was correct that \u00a7 49-15(b) does not grant the court authority to modify a judgment of strict foreclosure. Specifically, \u00a7 49-15(b) provides that when a mortgagor files a bankruptcy petition under title 11 of the United States Code, any existing judgment of strict foreclosure \"shall be opened automatically without action by any party or the court, provided, the provisions of such judgment, other than the establishment of law days, shall not be set aside under this subsection ....\" See footnote 7 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court incorrectly concluded, however, that merely because \u00a7 49-15(b) does not grant the court authority to modify the judgment, no statutory authority existed to allow the court to do so. This court has explained that, \"[b]y its express terms, subsection (b) of \u00a7 49-15 governs what occurs\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   following the filing of a bankruptcy petition: the judgment is opened, but only with respect to the law day. It does not refer to how a plaintiff may request the court [not only to] reset the law day [but also] reenter [a modified] judgment of strict foreclosure following the dismissal or discharge of the bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"In order to have the court reset the law day and reenter [a modified] judgment of strict foreclosure, a plaintiff must comply with subsection (a)(1) of \u00a7 49-15.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank, N.A., Trustee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morawska\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485140\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/747/#p426\">\n    165 Conn.

Because the plaintiff filed a motion to open and modify the judgment of strict foreclosure, \u00a7 49-15(a)(1) conferred authority on the trial court to modify the judgment. In fact, the plaintiff's motion contained, among the relief sought, a request to enter either a judgment of strict foreclosure or foreclosure by sale, whichever the court deemed appropriate. The plaintiff's motion recognized the court's authority to modify the judgment and, within its discretion, to order a foreclosure by sale. Accordingly, the court had authority to order a judgment of foreclosure by sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court's failure to entertain the request for a judgment of foreclosure by sale constituted error. \"[I]n a case in which the court has discretion to act, but fails to exercise its discretion, that failure alone is error.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488753\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/404/#p534\">\n    169 Conn.
