The Comptroller petitioned the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for review of the Tax Court's decision, and the circuit court upheld the Tax Court. The issue before us is whether there was substantial evidence in the record before the tax court to support its conclusion that the taxpayer's error in paying the tax was \"attributable to the State,\" and therefore, that the Comptroller was required to pay interest on the refund claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"JPI\") is a Maryland corporation, with its headquarters in Owings Mills, in Baltimore County. It is a subsidiary of Medifast, which is a weight-loss and weight-management program. JPI sells and distributes weight-management and other health-related products, and it prints paper materials and sells them to customers at Medifast's weight-loss centers. JPI operates a printing shop on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where it leases four large printing machines from Xerox Corporation (\"Xerox\"). JPI paid sales\n   tax with each lease payment to Xerox from November 2007 through January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2011, JPI and Medifast hired Gabriel Massuda (\"Massuda\") as its Tax Director. Massuda observed the printers at the Eastern Shore printing facility soon after, and he began looking into whether the printers could meet the criteria for a sales tax exemption on personal property used in manufacturing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 10, 2012, after Massuda determined that JPI's printing activities might meet the exemption, he filed a refund claim with the Comptroller's Office, seeking a refund of $332,365 in sales tax overpayments for the preceding four years-from 2008 to April 10, 2012. Even after JPI filed its first refund claim, however, it continued to pay sales tax to Xerox, because Massuda had not been able to confirm whether JPI's production activities met the threshold set by the statute to qualify for an exemption. Thereafter, on September 4, 2012, JPI filed another refund claim seeking $22,863 for the period of March 10, 2012 through August 1, 2012. Again, JPI continued paying sales tax to Xerox after filing its claim while Massuda continued to evaluate JPI's records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An auditor in the Comptroller's Business Tax Audits Section was assigned both refund claims. Between July 2012 and May 2013, the auditor reviewed JPI's tax returns, general ledger, invoices, and samples of materials printed on the printers, and visited the Eastern Shore printing facility. In January 2013, after Massuda became confident that JPI had the records to back up its claim that the printing machines met the criteria for the exemption, but prior to the auditor concluding his field audit, JPI finally stopped paying sales tax to Xerox on the printers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The auditor concluded his audit and the Refund Supervisor at the Comptroller's Office issued a denial letter for both refund claims on May 15, 2013. The letter stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The ... application for a refund of sales and use tax has been denied due to the fact that the use of the ... equipment\n   and materials does not satisfy the State's determination\n   of \"used directly and predominantly in a production activity\" because most of the materials being produced are not for resale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The letter further informed JPI of its right to request an informal hearing with the Comptroller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 23, 2013, JPI requested an informal hearing with the Comptroller, which was held before a hearing officer. The hearing officer reversed the auditor's decision on both refund claims, finding that JPI's use of the printers met the criteria for the exemption and that JPI was entitled to a refund of the sales tax. On September 17, 2013 JPI received a check for the first refund claim in the amount of $314,655.83 for the first four years of sales tax, and on October 11, 2013, a check for the second claim in the amount of $22,863 for the period of March 2012 to August 2012. No interest was paid on the sales tax refunds. Later, the hearing officer issued two Notices of Final Determination which concluded that, although the Comptroller had approved the refund claims, JPI was not entitled to recover interest from the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon after, JPI appealed the Comptroller's final determination on the issue of interest to the Maryland Tax Court (\"Tax Court\"), and on August 19, 2015 the court held a hearing. The Tax Court issued its final determination and memorandum opinion on February 18, 2016, requiring the Comptroller to pay interest on the refunds, which we review in detail below. The Comptroller filed a petition for judicial review with the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Following arguments from both parties on November 14, 2016, the circuit court affirmed the Tax Court's decision. The Comptroller appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issue before us on appeal is whether there was substantial evidence in the record before the Tax Court to support its conclusion that JPI is entitled to interest on its refund of sales tax. Whether JPI's use of the printers met the criteria for exemption involved measuring what proportion of\n   its printed materials were for sale or resale\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on sample materials and JPI's own records. There is no dispute that JPI's use of the printers met the exemption and that it was entitled to a refund of the sales tax it paid during the relevant time periods. The paramount question at stake is whether JPI's error in paying the tax was \"attributable to the State.\" For the reasons discussed below, we hold that no substantial evidence in the record before the Tax Court supported its conclusion that JPI's error in paying the tax was attributable to the State, and therefore, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review decisions of administrative agencies directly, looking \"through\" the circuit court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Kor-Ko Ltd. v.

However, [JPI] knew or should have known whether the machines were used directly and predominantly in the manufacturing of the brochures.

Apparently, after reviewing the same documentation and information, the Hearing Officer decided that the printing equipment did qualify as a production activity within the meaning of COMAR 03.06.01-32-2C, and was therefore, not subject to sales tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In issuing its final determination, the Tax Court's rationale was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The auditor determined, after numerous material and papers were reviewed, that\n   the leased equipment was not used directly or indirectly in a production activity. This determination by the field auditor supports [JPI's] position that its error or mistake in paying the tax was reasonable. Moreover, it is important to note that the Hearing Officer who granted the refund also reviewed the same material considered by the field auditor. The Court agrees with [JPI] that based on its understanding of the law, the Petitioner properly paid the tax in order to avoid penalty and not run afoul of the [State's] regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The fact that the field auditor and his supervisor agreed with [JPI], that the tax was due, supports [JPI's] view that the mistake of [JPI] in paying the tax was attributable to the State. [JPI] exercised reasonable judgment and should not be penalized when the auditors of the State wrongly concluded that the tax was due.

Nor did JPI express any uncertainty about how the exemption would apply to the printers it leased from Xerox. The plain language of the statute and its pertinent regulations were clear. JPI never argued that, when it paid the sales tax, it believed the Comptroller would apply the requirement that the property be \"used directly and predominantly in a production activity\" in an erroneous way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(1). Once it was aware of the exemption, JPI clearly understood that the law provided a quantifiable measure for making that determination-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the printers must have been \"used more than 50 percent of the time directly in production activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 03.06.01.32-2(B)(2). JPI knew-at least, after hiring Massuda-the criteria it needed to satisfy to show that the printers were exempt from sales tax. In fact, JPI apparently convinced the hearing examiner\n   that more than fifty percent of the materials it printed on the printers were \"for sale or resale.\" There is no indication in the record that any law, regulation, or policy of the State led JPI to conclude that the Comptroller would apply the law any differently at the time it paid the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   More specifically, unlike in\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   , the letter that notified JPI that its refund was being denied provided no support for the conclusion that the Comptroller's Office's policy for applying TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(2)(i) was inconsistent with the law when JPI paid the tax. In\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   , the significance of\n   the Comptroller's final determination letter was that the letter provided substantial evidence of the Comptroller's policy, which was an erroneous application of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    405 Md. at 205-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    950 A.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Tax Court in\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   concluded the Comptroller had maintained and applied the same position stated in the letter at the time SAIC paid the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this case, the letter at issue was sent by the Refund Supervisor, prior to the informal hearing and subsequent final determination, and indicated that it had applied a policy that was consistent with TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(2)(i). The letter stated that JPI's use of the printers \"[did] not satisfy the state's determination of 'used directly and predominately in a production activity'\n   <em>\n    because most of the materials being produced are not for resale\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). Indeed, the policy provided in the letter to JPI relied on exactly the same criteria that JPI continues to acknowledge that it was required to satisfy. In other words, the dispute that was later settled at the informal hearing, prior to the Comptroller's final determination, related only to the underlying facts and not how the Comptroller's Office applied the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   After requesting an informal hearing, JPI had the opportunity to show the Comptroller's Office that more of the printed materials were \"for sale or resale\" than the auditor initially counted during his field audit and that its use of the printers met the fifty-percent threshold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 03.06.01.32-2(B)(1)(a)(i). The hearing examiner apparently agreed that more materials were \"for sale\" than the auditor previously determined, that the proportion of printed materials exceeded fifty percent of JPI's use of the printers, and, therefore, that the printers were \"used directly and predominantly in a production activity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(1). Pursuant to TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(1), the hearing examiner concluded that the printers were exempt from sales tax. Accordingly, the Comptroller issued a final determination approving the refund, sent refund checks totaling $332,365.00, and did not appeal the hearing examiner's determination before the Tax Court. Particularly where the review of the application included samples representing 31,000,000 pages of printed materials over the course of more than four years of using the printers, it is unsurprising that an informal hearing may have been necessary for JPI to clarify to the Comptroller what materials were for sale and should have been counted towards the fifty percent threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On the issue of interest, the Tax Court's decision that JPI's error in paying the tax was attributable to the State was based primarily on the fact that the hearing examiner was not given any documentation that the auditor had not already had the opportunity to review, and yet, the hearing examiner reached a different conclusion. Additionally, the circuit court upheld the Tax Court's decision, finding the fact that the auditor and hearing examiner reached different conclusions from the same documents to be substantial evidence that the\n   error was \"attributable to the State.\" The auditor's and the hearing examiner's differing calculations of the proportion of\n   printed materials that were for sale, however, bore no relationship to any expressed policy maintained by the Comptroller in applying the exemption in TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(2)(i). That fact certainly did not identify what law, regulation or policy could have reasonably led JPI to the mistaken belief that sales tax was owed at the time JPI paid the sales tax to Xerox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   JPI's error cannot be \"attributable to the State\" on the sole basis that the hearing examiner, after an informal hearing, counted more materials as \"for sale or resale\" than the auditor did. This is particularly so where JPI's payment of the sales tax to Xerox occurred prior to the initial decision to deny the refund claim and the Office's stated position for doing so reiterated a proper application of the exemption in TGA \u00a7 11-210(b)(1). Both the auditor and the hearing examiner applied the law the same way-some evidence that more than fifty percent of the materials printed were for sale. That they both reviewed the same documents and information provided no evidence that the Comptroller had expressed, maintained, or applied a policy inconsistent with the law during the period when JPI paid the sales tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, it is important to clarify the element of \"using reasonable judgment under the circumstances\" included in the\n   <em>\n    DeBois\n   </em>\n   standard for attributing the taxpayer's error to the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    405 Md. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    950 A.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tax Court relied on the auditor's initial determination that JPI's use of the printers did not meet the exemption as evidence and provided that \"[t]his determination by the field auditor supports [JPI's] position that its error or mistake in paying the tax was reasonable.\" Further, the Tax Court explained, \"[JPI] exercised reasonable judgment and should not be penalized when the auditors of the State wrongly concluded that the tax was due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The phrase \"using reasonable judgment under the circumstances\" in the\n   <em>\n    DeBois\n   </em>\n   standard refers to the taxpayer's mistaken conclusion based on a law, regulation, or policy. In reaching its conclusion that the taxpayer's error was attributable to the State, the Tax Court in\n   <em>\n    DeBois\n   </em>\n   explained, \"[the\n   taxpayer's] false impression was\n   <em>\n    a reasonable interpretation of the State law and policy\n   </em>\n   because the issue of whether or not DISCs could apportion part of their income outside the State had not been decided by the courts at the time Petitioner filed its returns and paid the tax. The Tax Court in\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   determined that SAIC used reasonable judgment in erroneously paying the tax, despite knowing that the capital gain had no connection to Maryland, because \"the Tax Court inferred from the Comptroller's letter and subsequent denial of SAIC's appeal that the State's laws and policies at the time SAIC filed the original return required that SAIC pay tax on the sale of NSI shares.\"\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    405 Md. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    950 A.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that could support the conclusion that JPI, using reasonable judgment, misinterpreted, misunderstood, or was uncertain about the law or how it applied. Even if JPI had claimed that it was initially uncertain about what proportion of the materials printed had to be for sale to meet the exemption's criteria, it could not be said to have used reasonable judgment under the circumstances in reaching a mistaken understanding of the law. The statute and the regulations regarding the exemption from sales tax were clear, and JPI never claimed to misunderstand the law, or more importantly, that the Comptroller maintained a policy in applying the law that\n   was inconsistent with the exemption statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Clearly, it is reasonable to pay any tax the taxpayer believes is owed to the State. The risk of penalties and other consequences make that decision especially prudent when the taxpayer is not confident from its review of its own information whether it meets the criteria for an exemption. The reasonableness of paying a tax, however, is present in every case in which the taxpayer believed it was owed at the time it was paid and later learns its belief was mistaken. The statute, itself, makes clear that the taxpayer's mistaken conclusion must be \"attributable to the State.\" TGA \u00a7 13-603(b)(2)(i). Requiring interest to be paid every time a taxpayer unreasonably misinterprets the law or fails to evaluate its own circumstances relevant to an exemption would render this second\n   prong of the statute meaningless. As the Court in\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   explained, \"[t]he commonsense understanding of the phrase 'attributable to the State' as used in \u00a7 13-603(b) means that the mistake or error can be said to be caused by the State.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    405 Md. at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    950 A.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be entitled to interest, therefore, it is not enough to show that the taxpayer misunderstood the law when the tax was paid. The State must, in some way, be at fault for the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In this case, JPI's Tax Director understood the statutory exemption, discovered JPI's error soon after being hired, applied for a refund on behalf of JPI, and after clarifying the total proportion of materials for sale at an informal hearing, recovered more than $337,000 in sales tax that the company had erroneously paid. Where the error of paying the tax was completely within the knowledge and control of the taxpayer, however, and no law, regulation, or policy of the State caused the taxpayer's error, the Comptroller may not pay interest in addition to the refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Upon our review of the record before the Tax Court, we cannot conclude that any substantial evidence supported the Tax Court's determination that JPI was \"led by the laws, regulations, or policies expressed by the State to the mistaken conclusion that tax [was] owed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    405 Md. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740082\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/185/#p192\">\n    950 A.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regarding items that are \"used for both taxable and exempt purposes,\" the publication explained that \"the exemption may apply if it is used at least 50 percent of the time,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    predominantly, in a production activity.\" In defining \"directly and predominantly,\" it provided that \"[t]he 'predominantly' test is met if the property is used more than 50 percent of the time directly in production activities.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
