We now consider the defendant's claim that the trial court committed plain error by incorrectly instructing the jury on the requisite intent to find him guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. We conclude that the record does not support the claim that the pertinent instruction constituted plain error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the killing of the victim, Kevin Soler, on Bretton Street in Bridgeport, the defendant was arrested and charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-134 (a) (2), felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (2). As we stated in our prior opinion: \"[F]our people ... together with the defendant, were charged with, inter alia, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"All four of the defendant's coconspirators, [Jihad] Clemons, Craig Waddell, Hank Palmer, and Mike Lomax, who had known each other for several years but had only recently been introduced to the defendant, testified for the state at the defendant's trial. The crux of their testimony, as it related to the charge of conspiracy, was that they and the defendant had entered into an agreement to rob Robert Taylor, a drug dealer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Clemons was the first of the conspirators to testify. He testified that on September 6, 2009, he and Waddell visited their friend, Braxton Gardner, and decided to buy some marijuana. To that end, Gardner made a phone call to Taylor, a drug dealer with whom he was familiar. Gardner met Taylor a block or two from his house and completed the purchase. Clemons, Waddell, and Gardner smoked the marijuana that they had purchased, and then Gardner left to attend his younger brother's football game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Shortly thereafter, Clemons and Waddell decided that they wanted more marijuana, so they called Gardner to get Taylor's telephone number. Clemons then called Taylor, who met them near Gardner's house and sold them more marijuana. While Clemons and Waddell were smoking the newly purchased marijuana, they walked to Palmer's house and discussed robbing Taylor. Lomax arrived at Palmer's house, and the four men discussed their plan to rob Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Clemons, Waddell, and Lomax left Palmer's house-leaving Palmer behind-and drove Lomax' car, a white Honda, to [DeAndre] Harper's house to ask Harper if he would like to be involved in their planned robbery of Taylor. They found Harper outside on his porch with his cousin, the defendant. Harper and the defendant approached Lomax' vehicle, where they discussed the robbery. Clemons, Waddell, and Lomax first asked Harper if he wanted to participate in the robbery, but Harper declined. They then asked the\n   defendant if he wanted to participate, and he agreed to do so. The defendant got into Lomax' vehicle, and the four men returned to Palmer's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"When they arrived at Palmer's house, the five men spent forty-five minutes further discussing their plan to rob Taylor. They agreed that Clemons would call Taylor to set up a meeting and that the defendant would rob him using a nine millimeter handgun, while Waddell stood nearby. Lomax would drive the car to the place of the meeting, and Palmer would stay in the car with Lomax. They agreed that they would steal Taylor's drugs, car, and cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"At some point after dark, the men went to meet Taylor. Taylor had told Clemons that he was running late because he had a flat tire. Clemons parted company with the others to go home because he was late for his curfew. Meanwhile ... Taylor got a ride to the rendezvous with his friend, Soler, and Soler's girlfriend, [Priscilla] LaBoy. Soler parked at the agreed upon location, and a person appeared; Soler and the person conversed because Soler had agreed to conclude the sale on Taylor's behalf. The other person then shot Soler.\" (Footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blaine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487765\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1044/\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487765\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1044/\">\n    168 Conn.

The court addressed the elements of the substantive crime of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). The court instructed that robbery was a larceny committed by the use or threatened use of force. Larceny, in turn, required an intent to deprive another of property. The court then charged that the \"third element\" was that in \"the course of the commission of the robbery or immediate flight from the crime the defendant or another participant in the crime was armed with a deadly weapon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Later in the charge the court instructed on the elements of the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree: \"One, there was an agreement between the defendant and one or more persons to engage in conduct constituting the crime of robbery in the first degree; two, there was an overt act in furtherance of the agreement by any one of the persons; and, three,\n   <em>\n    the defendant specifically intended to commit the crime of robbery in the first degree.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court defined \"agreement\" and \"overt act,\" and then instructed: \"Element three, criminal intent. The third element is that the defendant had the intent to commit robbery in the first degree. The defendant must have had specific intent. The defendant may not be found guilty unless the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he specifically intended to commit robbery in the first degree when he entered into the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After defining specific intent, the court summarized its charge regarding conspiracy: \"[One] the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had an agreement with\n   one or more persons to commit robbery in the first degree. Two, at least one of the coconspirators did an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy and, three, the defendant specifically intended to commit robbery in the first degree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant claims that because the court did not expressly and specifically instruct the jury that, in order to find him guilty, it had to find that he specifically agreed that a participant in the crime would be armed with a deadly weapon, the court committed plain error.

It is now well established that a conviction of conspiracy to commit a crime requires proof of specific intent to commit all elements of the underlying crime, even if only general intent or, conceivably, no intent at all is required as to one or more elements necessary for conviction of the underlying substantive crime.

In\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   , however, the trial court not only failed to instruct the jury that specific intent was required as to the display or threatened use of a weapon, it also expressly stated that the specific intent required to convict was that the defendant intended, at the time of agreement, to commit larceny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, because the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   prevailed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , application of the plain error doctrine was not necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the present case, the court did not expressly limit the requirement of specific intent to fewer than all the elements of the substantive crime. The court, instead, charged that in order to find the defendant guilty, the jury had to find that he specifically intended to commit the crime of robbery in the first degree; the court previously had included in the definition of that substantive crime the element that one or more participants be armed with a deadly weapon. Because the \"armed with a deadly weapon\" element had been included in the definition of the underlying crime and the conspiracy charge required for conviction a finding that the defendant intended to commit the substantive crime, it is at least arguable that the instruction logically required the jury to find that the defendant had agreed that a participant would be armed with a deadly weapon. If it is fairly debatable whether an action of the trial court is erroneous, the error, if any, is not plain error, and the judgment should be affirmed.

Every witness who testified that the agreement existed also testified that use of a weapon was contemplated. Although the defendant denied involvement altogether, there was ample evidence that he had agreed to the robbery and that someone would use a weapon. A similar situation in\n   <em>\n    Padua\n   </em>\n   led to a conclusion of harmless error; here, we cannot find that a less egregious error, if indeed there was an error, amounted to manifest injustice.
