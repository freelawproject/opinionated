Washington with two counts of attempted murder, and he is awaiting trial. In Docket No. A-1780-17, the State appeals the trial court's orders on November 28 and 29, 2017, and its denial of reconsideration on December 6, 2017. Those orders excluded the State's DNA evidence, denied its motion for a postponement of trial, and rejected its request for excludable time under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22, the speedy trial statute in the Criminal Justice Reform Act (CJRA), N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 to -26. In Docket No. A-2051-17, defendant appeals the trial court's orders dated December 12 and 22, 2017, granting excludable time. We consolidate these back-to-back appeals for purposes of our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold the State Police Lab's draft DNA report was not \"within the possession, custody or control of the prosecutor\" until the lab sent it to the county prosecutor, and in any event was not\n   discoverable until the report was reviewed and approved by the lab.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(b)(1)(C). Regardless of the speedy trial provisions, the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the DNA evidence rather than granting a continuance of trial under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(b)(1)(I) and -3(f), given the evidence's importance and the absence of surprise, prejudice, or a design to mislead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We also hold that under the speedy trial rule and statute, a case may be \"complex\" if it has \"complicated evidence,\" but time is excludable only if the complexity makes it unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for trial in the speedy trial period.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:5-4(i)(7);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(g). Moreover, the provision addressing failures to produce discovery is a limit on excludable time. N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(2). The court properly excluded time sua\n   sponte under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c), and retained jurisdiction to do so after the State sought and obtained leave to appeal. That provision excludes the time while an emergent relief request, or interlocutory appeal, is pending in this court. Time while the trial is stayed is excludable under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and vacate in part in A-1780-17. We affirm as modified in A-2051-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State alleges that, on February 16, 2017, defendant shot two men in the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Hall in Willingboro. The State asserts that after defendant fled, a pair of eyeglasses was found at the VFW Hall in the area where he struggled with one of the men. The State claims defendant was seen wearing similar eyeglasses both in a video taken minutes before the shooting, and in photographs on Facebook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office (BCPO) obtained DNA swabs from defendant and the two victims. On March 2, the BCPO took the swabs and the eyeglasses to the Central Regional Laboratory (State Police Lab) of the New Jersey State Police (NJSP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, the State arrested defendant and successfully moved for pretrial detention. On May 25, a grand jury indicted defendant with two counts of attempted murder in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:5-1(a)(3) and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1). The court scheduled defendant's trial to begin November 28, and set defendant's release date as December 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 16, the BCPO received an email from the State Police Lab attaching the one-page DNA lab report signed by \"Christine Bless, Forensic Scientist I.\" The lab report stated that \"[a] mixture of DNA profiles consistent with at least two contributors was identified\" on the eyeglasses, and that defendant was \"the source of the major DNA profile obtained.\" The BCPO emailed the lab report to defendant's counsel that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 17, the State filed a motion to declare that this was a complex case and that the sixty days from November 17, 2017 to January 17, 2018, were excludable time under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(g). The State also asked for a sixty-day adjournment of trial. Defendant orally moved to exclude the DNA results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the November 28 hearing on the motions, the trial court found this was not a complex case, and denied the State's request for sixty days of excludable time. The court granted excludable time from the November 17 filing of the State's motion to its disposition on November 28, extending defendant's release date to December 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a November 29 letter-opinion, the trial court granted defendant's motion to prohibit the State from introducing the DNA evidence and denied the State's motion for an adjournment of trial. The court later issued corresponding orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 30, the State filed a motion for reconsideration. It attached a certification from the prosecutor stating what he had learned concerning the timing in the State Police Lab. Defense counsel argued the prosecutor's certification was not based on personal knowledge as required under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:6-6. The court gave\n   the State until December 5 to provide a certification from someone at the State Police Lab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 1, the State provided a certification based on personal knowledge from Bless of the State Police Lab. Her certification stated as follows. The eyeglasses and swabs were submitted by the BCPO to the State Police Lab on March 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The eyeglasses were processed on March 3, and a swab from the eyeglasses was submitted for analysis on March 10. On July 20, Bless was assigned to analyze this evidence for DNA as a Forensic Scientist I. On July 25, Bless generated a lab report containing the result of her analysis, namely that there was a mixture of DNA profiles in which defendant was the major contributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bless's certification then described the review process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6. On or about August 8, 2017 the required technical (peer) review of this case file was initiated. Shortly thereafter, the case file was forwarded to the NJSP DNA Technical Leader for approval of the DNA profile interpretation of [the swab from the eyeglasses]. This approval was required due to recent changes to the interpretation guidelines in the NJSP DNA Laboratory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   7. Due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the current work load of the NJSP DNA Technical Leader, her supervisory responsibilities, NJSP DNA Laboratory management requirements including Bail Reform and expedited cases which affect the prioritization of case file review, the approval of the DNA profile interpretation of [the swab from the eyeglasses] was completed on November 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   8. On November 3, 2017, the case file was returned to the technical (peer) reviewer in order to complete this review. The technical (peer) review was completed November 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   9. Shortly thereafter, the DNA case file was submitted to a Forensic Scientist 3 to conduct the required administrative review. This administrative review was completed on November 8, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   10. Due to clerical staff shortages, the finalized and approved DNA report was digitized and emailed from the NJSP DNA Laboratory to the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office on or about November 16, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The prosecutor gave further explanation in his own certification and oral argument. He argued that during this period the State Police Lab \"went from analyzing 15 allele sites to 26 allele sites which results in more accurate testing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He certified this \"recent\n   change in the science and method by which interpretation of mixtures of DNA are conducted made the NJSP Lab Technical Leader the only employee qualified to interpret DNA mixtures in the absence of approved scientific procedures for this manner of analysis,\" resulting in a \"large number of cases which had to be analyzed by the NJSP DNA Lab Technical Leader.\" The prosecutor argued this temporary problem was subsequently resolved because protocols for such analysis were approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the December 6 hearing, defense counsel objected to the form of the certifications,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to the failure to produce the\n   full DNA packet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court expressed concern at these shortfalls but, \"assuming for the sake of argument\" the certifications were proper, the court denied reconsideration. The court granted the State's motion for a stay through December 7 to allow the State to file an emergent interlocutory appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 7, we granted the State's application for permission to file an emergent motion. We stayed trial pending resolution of the emergent motion, and ordered briefing on the motion to be completed by December 14. On December 12, the trial court ruled the period between December 6 and December 14 was excludable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 14, we granted the State's emergent motions for leave to appeal and for a stay of trial pending appeal. We expedited the appeal. We did not stay defendant's release from detention if authorized by law. On December 22, the trial court ruled the period between December 14, 2017, and February 28, 2018, was excludable time, and denied defendant's motion for a stay pending appeal of its December 12 and 22 orders. On December 23, we granted defendant's application to file an emergent motion. On January 9, 2018, we granted defendant's emergent motion for leave to appeal the December 12 and 22 orders, but denied his motion for a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its appeal, the State raises the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   POINT I-THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING THE STATE'S MOTION FOR 60 DAYS OF EXCLUDABLE TIME PURSUANT TO\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2A:162-22b(1)(d) and (g).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   POINT II-EVEN IF THIS HONORABLE COURT CONCLUDES THAT THE STATE VIOLATED\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:13-3b(1)(i), EXCLUSION OF THE DNA EVIDENCE IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   POINT III-IF THIS HONORABLE COURT DETERMINES THAT THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED THE STATE'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE TRIAL COURT'S DENIAL OF ITS MOTION FOR EXCLUDABLE TIME, THE COURT MUST REMAND THE MATTER TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE STATE'S ARGUMENT THAT DEFENDANT MUST BE DETAINED PURSUANT TO\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2A:162-22B(2) AND\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:25-4c(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's appeal raises the following substantive point:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THIS COURT SHOULD ORDER DEFENDANT'S IMMEDIATE RELEASE BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT LACKED JURISDICTION TO ENTER ITS DECEMBER 12, 2017 AND DECEMBER 22, 2017 ORDERS PRECLUDING HIS RELEASE. IN ADDITION, THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDERS PRECLUDING DEFENDANT'S RELEASE PENDING APPEAL ARE CONTRARY TO THIS COURT'S DECEMBER 14, 2017 ORDER STATING THAT DEFENDANT'S RELEASE IS NOT STAYED PENDING APPEAL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We first consider the State's appeal of the exclusion of its DNA evidence\n   as a discovery sanction.

Indeed, the prosecutor at the initial hearing conceded he did not know why the report supplied by the State Police Lab on November 16 was dated July 25. In excluding the DNA evidence, the court repeatedly stressed that there was no \"adequate explanation from the State\" for the delay in producing the July 25 report, and that \"the State has failed to provide an adequate explanation for its failure to timely provide defendant with the DNA report 30 days in advance of trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, on reconsideration, the prosecutor supplied his own and Bless's certifications, which explained that the July 25 draft report still had to be reviewed and approved, and that it was finalized on November 8 and produced a week later. Nonetheless, the court ruled that the certifications from Bless and the prosecutor did \"not really inform the Court of anything new or anything that would justify the delay,\" and that there was still \"no good explanation for the delay.\" Those rulings were erroneous because the certifications of Bless and the prosecutor provided a new and adequate explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Reconsideration should be granted if \"the [trial court] has expressed its decision based upon a palpably incorrect or irrational basis.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In her certification, Bless stated the State Police Lab had \"case management requirements including Bail Reform and expedited cases which affect the prioritization of case file review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The trial court inferred from the delay that defendant's case did not receive prioritized treatment. Defendant similarly argues that, had the BCPO made inquiry of the State Police Lab, his case might have been prioritized. Even if such inferences could be drawn, prioritizing defendant's case over other cases would delay the other cases, hardly a costless \"remedy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In any event, courts should consider discovery issues separately from speedy trial issues. In\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held that \"discovery sanctions must be distinguished\" from the sanctions for violating the speedy trial statute, and that it is improper to impose the speedy trial statute's remedy of release to punish a discovery violation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492179\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/788/12492179/#p21\">\n    232 N.J. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492179,12492180\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/788/\">\n    177 A.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is similarly improper to impose a discovery sanction based on a perceived failure to comply with the speedy trial statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, as the trial court acknowledged, \"the processing of forensic evidence, such as DNA, can by its nature be complex and time-consuming.\" Indeed, the Joint Committee Report which led to the CJRA recognized that \"DNA and other forensic evidence\n   can delay a case for six to nine months while results from testing are pending.\"\n   <em>\n    Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court's Joint Committee on Criminal Justice\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Joint Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ] 77 (Mar. 10, 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The delay here was within that span.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Most of the steps in processing the DNA evidence were not excessively long. The BCPO provided the eyeglasses and DNA swabs to the State Police Lab only two weeks after the shootings, and the lab processed them the next day and took a swab from the eyeglasses a week later. About three months passed before the eyeglasses were assigned to Bless for analysis, but neither defendant nor the trial court relied on that delay. Bless prepared her draft report five days after being assigned, and the technical peer review was initiated two weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court based its ruling on the delay after July 25. However, the certifications explained that was primarily due to the need for approval by the State Police Lab's DNA technical leader that took\n   three months because of her supervisory responsibilities and her heavy workload as the only lab employee qualified to interpret DNA results involving a mixture of contributors until approved scientific procedures were developed for the lab's new method of analysis. Once the DNA technical leader's approval was received, the technical peer review was completed that day, and the final administrative review was completed in five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The time needed for approval by the State Police Lab's DNA technical leader, and for the entire technical, peer, and administrative review process, was not short. However, the certifications made clear the time was necessary to ensure that the proper steps were taken to prepare a final, accurate DNA report. Moreover, the prosecutor represented that the State Police Lab had since obtained approved protocols, that processing has gotten \"back to normal now,\" and that such a delay \"will not happen again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Regardless, the certifications adequately explained why the delay was necessary to ensure the accuracy of the DNA report and results. When that was completed on November 8, the State Police Lab emailed the report on November 16, and the BCPO provided it to defendant that day under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant argues it should not have taken from November 8 to 16 to digitize and email the final report to the BCPO. However, Bless explained that was due to clerical staff shortages. In any event, that eight-day delay could not justify the court's drastic sanction of exclusion of the DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The BCPO's production of the DNA report was not the end of the story, because the BCPO sought to use it as a basis for expert testimony. Under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(b)(1)(I), the State must provide discovery of the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   names and addresses of each person whom the prosecutor expects to call to trial as an expert witness, the expert's qualifications, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, a copy of the report, if any, of such expert witness, or if no report is prepared, a statement of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. Except as otherwise provided in\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:10-3, if this information is not furnished 30 days in advance of trial, the expert witness may, upon application by the defendant, be barred from testifying at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The BCPO provided the final DNA report twelve days before the scheduled trial date. Moreover, the BCPO did not have the full DNA packet from the State Police Lab, and had not yet produced the other expert information required by\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(b)(1)(I). The BCPO produced that information and the DNA packet to defendant by December 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The BCPO asked for a postponement of trial to allow it to produce that information sufficiently in advance of the new trial date to give defendant the opportunity to analyze the DNA information and to respond with his own DNA expert.\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(f) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, it may order such party to permit the discovery of materials not previously disclosed, grant a continuance or delay during trial, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material\n   not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"An adjournment or continuance is a preferred remedy where circumstances permit.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the circumstances permitted a continuance of the trial date. Defendant does not claim trial had previously been extended, and the trial date was around the CJRA's 180-day period. The BCPO produced the DNA report to defendant almost two weeks before the trial date, offered to provide the expert information and full DNA packet as soon as the BCPO received it, and provided them to defendant within five days of our order. The BCPO's requested sixty-day continuance would have provided defendant with more than thirty days to analyze and respond to the DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nonetheless, the trial court refused to grant a continuance of trial, and instead prohibited the State from introducing any DNA evidence.

The federal courts did not find either the case or the DNA evidence was complex. Instead, they relied solely on subparagraph (A) to grant ends-of-justice continuances.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, that subsection is not in the list of the \"periods [that] shall be excluded in computing the time in which a case shall be indicted or tried.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1). Rather, it is a separate limit on those periods of excludable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   This limit recognizes that if the prosecutor has the complete discovery materials available during the period set for discovery, but fails to produce them during that period, that failure should not result in excludable time. However, if some of the discovery at\n   issue was not available during the discovery period, but only became available thereafter, it may be appropriate to grant excludable time under one of the listed exclusions. For example, if the prosecutor is unable to provide timely and complete discovery of evidence because of\n   its temporary but unavoidable unavailability, whether that results in excludable time may depend on whether the evidence only became available after the time established for discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(f), (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The DNA expert evidence did not become available until after the time established for discovery of expert evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:13-3(b)(1)(I). Thus, N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(2) did not preclude the granting of excludable time if authorized by a listed exclusion provision. However, it is not itself a basis for exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendant's appeal contends the trial court erred in granting excludable time in its December 12 and 22 orders. We are aided in our review by the court's statement of reasons requested in our December 23 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On December 12, the trial court on its own motion issued an order ruling the period between December 6 and December 14 was excludable time. The order mistakenly stated that \"the Court finds this a complex case,\" citing N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its subsequent statement of reasons, the court explained this language was included in error. The court vacated that order and replaced it with a revised order stating the period between its December 6 grant of a stay and the December 14 completion of briefing on the State's emergent motion was excludable time\n   under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c)\"[t]o allow time for the disposition of a motion for Leave to Appeal and Emergent Relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   On December 22, the trial court on its own motion ruled that the period between December 14, 2017, and February 28, 2018, was excludable time under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c) to allow disposition of the pending appeal. In its subsequent statement of reasons, the court explained it treated the period between our December 14 grant of the State's emergent motion for leave to appeal and the approximately thirty days after the conclusion of briefing on the State's appeal as excludable time \"to allow time for a decision from the Appellate Division.\" The court revised its order to exclude the period from December 14 to February 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   We agree that the various periods between December 6 and the receipt of our disposition of the interlocutory appeal were excludable time, under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c), N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l), or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Courts must exclude \"[t]he time from the filing to the final disposition of a motion made before trial by the prosecutor or the eligible defendant.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:25-4(i)(3). \"[T]he necessity of, and the merits of, the motions are not relevant ... absent some abuse, which has not been argued or demonstrated here.\"\n   <em>\n    Forchion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301066,12490754\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/451/474/\">\n    451 N.J.Super. at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490754,12301066\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/1222/\">\n    168 A.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Courts must also exclude \"[t]he time for other periods of delay not specifically enumerated if the court finds good cause for the delay.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l). \"[T]his provision shall be narrowly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:25-4(i)(12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   First, the period from December 6 to 7 was excludable time. On December 6, the State orally moved for a stay of trial and submitted a form of order, which the court\n   signed, granting a stay of trial through December 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c) refers to \"the filing\" of the motion.\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:25-4(h)(3)(A) refers to \"the filing of the notice of motion.\" The filing of written motions aids in the calculation of the excludable\n   time. Nonetheless, the rules of court permit oral motions if they are \"made during a trial or hearing,\" or if \"the court permits it to be made orally.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1:6-2(a). Where a proper oral motion is made and the court does not resolve it on the same day, granting excludable time might fall within the spirit if perhaps not the letter of those speedy trial provisions. However, we need not resolve that issue, because the trial court ruled on the State's December 6 oral motion immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Regardless, there was good cause for the delay of trial under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l). Trial could not occur on December 6 or 7 because the trial court had stayed the trial. Moreover, the stay was appropriate to allow the State to seek appellate review of the court's orders, particularly the exclusion of its DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Second, the period from December 7 to 14 was excludable time. On December 7, the State filed an emergent application with this court, which we granted that day, ordering the State to file an emergent motion by December 11 and staying the trial pending disposition of that motion. On December 11, the State filed an emergent motion for leave to appeal and for a stay, which we resolved on December 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   We hold requests for emergent relief in this court constitute a \"motion\" under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c). Because the emergent application begins the motion process, the excludable time includes the period from the filing of the emergent application until its denial or, if we grant the right to file an emergent motion, until the disposition of the emergent motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pressler &amp; Verniero,\n   <em>\n    Current N.J.

Trial could not occur between December 7 and 14 because we had stayed the trial to allow the State to seek appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Third, the period from December 14 to our disposition of the interlocutory appeal is excludable time. On December 14, we\n   granted leave to appeal and stayed trial pending disposition of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   We hold an interlocutory appeal constitutes \"a motion\" under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c). The\n   <em>\n    Joint Committee Report\n   </em>\n   's recommendation 14 proposed that excludable time include the period from \"[t]he filing, until final disposition, of pretrial motions by the State, such as evidentiary motions and interlocutory appeals, if granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87. Recommendation 14 also recommended excluding the period from \"[t]he filing, until final disposition, of pretrial motions by a defendant, such as motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the indictment, motions for severance, motions for change of venue ... evidentiary motions, and interlocutory appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Based on recommendation 14, the Senate and the General Assembly adopted N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c)'s language excluding \"[t]he time from the filing to the final disposition of a motion made before trial by the prosecutor or the [defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Senate Budget And Appropriations Committee Statement To S. 946\n   </em>\n   at 1-2 (June 5, 2014);\n   <em>\n    Assembly Judiciary Committee Statement To A. 1910\n   </em>\n   at 1-2 (June 12, 2014). The examples given by the\n   <em>\n    Joint Committee Report\n   </em>\n   presumably guided the Legislature, though it did not include them in the statute. Excluding the \"delay resulting from any interlocutory appeal\" also accords with the federal Speedy Trial Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In any event, there was good cause for the delay of trial under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l).

Although the trial court gave N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c) as the basis of its ruling, we may also affirm under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(l). \"It is a longstanding principle underlying appellate review that 'appeals are taken from orders and judgments and not from opinions ... or reasons given for the\n   ultimate conclusion.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Court Rules\n   </em>\n   , comment 1 on\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:9-1 (2018). Although our December 7 order stayed the commencement of trial, it did not prevent the trial court from exercising its jurisdiction to perform other functions. Thus, the court had jurisdiction to enter its December 12 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Once we granted the State's motion for leave to appeal on December 14, an appeal was taken.\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt. of N.J., Inc. v.

Nonetheless, a trial court can continue to exercise jurisdiction to determine whether to release a defendant.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:9-1(a) (citing\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:9-4 (\"Pending appeal to the Appellate Division, bail may be allowed by the trial court[.]\") ). Under the speedy trial provisions, a defendant who has been \"detained in jail for more than 180 days on that charge following the return or unsealing of the indictment, whichever is later, not counting excludable time,\" generally \"shall be released from jail.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(a)(2)(a). Thus, the calculation of excludable time is part of the determination of whether a defendant should be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Therefore, after a motion for leave to appeal is granted, a trial court retains jurisdiction to issue an order excluding the time from the grant of leave to appeal until the disposition of the appeal. To rule otherwise would necessitate either pre-grant hypothetical rulings by trial courts, or post-grant remand motions to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Regardless, our December 14 order granting leave to appeal provided that issues concerning defendant's detention or release would continue to be handled by the trial court: \"The State has not asked us to stay defendant's release, and we do not stay his release at the time and in the manner provided by law.\" Our December 14 order was broad enough to permit the trial court to determine whether the time after our December 14 order was excludable time in order to decide whether the law required defendant to be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's December 12 and 22 orders, modified to find excludable time under\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(b)(1)(c) or (l) or both from December 6 to the date our opinion resolving this appeal is received by the trial court. Together with the court's unchallenged November 28 order granting ten days of excludable time, these rulings provided sufficient excludable time that defendant has no general right to release under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(a)(2)(a) until approximately a week after receipt of our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Therefore, we need not address whether the trial court erred by not ruling on the State's argument that defendant should not be released and that the time to commence trial should be extended under N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22(a)(2)(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   3:25-4(c)(2)(4).
