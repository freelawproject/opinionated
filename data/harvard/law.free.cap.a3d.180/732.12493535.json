K.K. worked in the United States for at least forty qualified quarters (ten years), and received a modest social security benefit of $226 per month in 2015. K.K. gave up his LPR card in 2007 upon leaving the United States. Seven years later, in 2014, K.K. returned to the United States and obtained a new LPR card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 16, 2015, he applied for Medicaid benefits through the Somerset County Board of Social Services (SCBSS). His application was denied two months later on the basis that he had not\n   been an LPR of the United States for five years or more. K.K. appealed and the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Law. N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -15; N.J.S.A. 52:14F-1 to -13. The supervisor of Adult Medicaid for the SCBSS testified that when K.K. applied for Medicaid, both his new LPR card and the agency computer system noted an entry date of July 2014, with no indication that he had previously resided in the country. His application stating his 1991 entry was not considered. K.K. was thus rejected because the computer records reviewed reflected he had not been an LPR for five years, as required of someone who entered the United States after August 22, 1996. At the hearing, K.K. proved he had entered the United States in 1991 and received an LPR card in 1996, which he surrendered upon leaving the country in 2007. His LPR card was at that time set to expire in 2015, after he applied for Medicaid. The card he obtained upon reentry in 2014 is valid until 2024. Both cards have the same identification number. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision affirming\n   the Medicaid denial on the basis that K.K. surrendered his card and obtained a new one. The ALJ determined that K.K. had thus fully abandoned his original LPR status. DMAHS adopted the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Appellate review of an agency's determination is limited in scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Circus Liquors, Inc. v.
