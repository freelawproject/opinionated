Specifically, they disagree whether the lease must expressly state that a landlord's insurer has a right of subrogation against the tenant, or whether it is sufficient for the lease to notify the tenant explicitly that he is responsible for any damage to the leased property and to allocate to the tenant the responsibility to provide liability and property damage insurance. The trial court and the Appellate Court both concluded that it was sufficient for the lease to allocate to the tenant responsibility for damage caused by the tenant and to require the tenant to obtain insurance, even without a specific agreement authorizing subrogation. We agree with those courts, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts as found by the attorney trial referee, and accepted by the trial court, are as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants, Andrew Muldowney and Kalynn Tupa, entered into a lease with John H. Mihalec (landlord) for use of a single-family dwelling at 7 Hervey Street in Greenwich. During the term of the lease, the defendants left the leased\n   property for an extended winter vacation lasting about two weeks. The defendants were responsible for ordering and paying for fuel for the dwelling's oil fueled heating system but had not ensured that the heating system had enough oil to operate for the duration of their absence. While they were away, the oil level dropped too low for the furnace to draw oil, and the heating system stopped working. As a result, the temperature in the dwelling fell, and pipes inside the dwelling froze and burst, causing damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants had agreed in the lease to \"pay for heating fuel,\" to \"use all ... heating ... systems in the [d]welling in a prudent manner,\" and to not \"[wilfully] or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair or remove any part of the [d]welling.\" The defendants also agreed they would \"not allow the [d]welling to remain vacant for more than fourteen ... consecutive days without notifying [the landlord] in advance of the planned vacancy.\" The lease required that, \"[d]uring any such vacancy, [the defendants] agree to maintain the temperature in the [d]welling at not less than [sixty] degrees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As for liability for any damage, the defendants agreed to pay the landlord \"all lost rent and other damages or costs\" incurred by the landlord if the defendants breached any of their promises in the lease. The lease also required the defendants to \"hold [the landlord] harmless from any loss or claim arising out of or in connection with [the defendants'] use and occupancy of the [leased] property, including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\" Lastly, the defendants agreed \"to provide and pay for personal liability insurance for [the defendants'] and [landlord's] mutual benefit in an amount of not less than $1 [million] for bodily injury and property damage in or about the [d]welling\" and to \"provide [the landlord] with proof of such insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The repairs for the damage to the dwelling caused by the burst pipes cost $50,960.02. The landlord also claimed $10,342.68 in lost rent. Notwithstanding the defendants' obligation under the lease to secure insurance, the landlord also had secured an insurance policy for the dwelling from the plaintiff, Amica Mutual Insurance Company, covering certain occurrences, including losses for water damage. The landlord filed a claim under the policy with the plaintiff, which paid the landlord for the damage. The terms of the insurance policy between the plaintiff and the landlord obligated the landlord to assign to the plaintiff any rights of recovery the landlord may have against any person for any covered loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the policy, the plaintiff brought this subrogation action against the defendants to recover sums the plaintiff had paid the landlord due to the defendants' actions or omissions. The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence by the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants moved to strike the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the plaintiff had no right of subrogation to the landlord's claims against them. The defendants relied in part on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360185\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/847/#p851\">\n    259 Conn. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They contended that\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   adopted a default rule that a landlord's insurer has no right of subrogation against a tenant for damage to leased property unless the landlord and tenant had reached a \"specific agreement\" otherwise.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id., at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the defendants, the default rule could be bypassed only if the landlord and tenant had agreed expressly to allow subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied the motion. The court agreed that\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   adopted a default rule against allowing subrogation, in\n   the absence of a \"specific agreement\" otherwise, but it disagreed with the defendants about the nature of the agreement required to overcome\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   's presumption against subrogation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id., at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the trial court, the\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   rule applied only when the lease agreement between the landlord and tenant was silent on whether the tenant would be held liable for damage to the leased premises. Because the lease in the present case expressly made the defendants liable for any damage they caused and, also, specifically instructed them to purchase insurance for the property for this purpose, the court determined that the\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   rule did not apply and did not bar the plaintiff from bringing a subrogation action. The defendants later filed an answer, again raising the lack of a specific agreement concerning subrogation as a special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court thereafter referred the matter to an attorney trial referee for fact finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The referee found, on the basis of the evidence, that the defendants had breached their obligations under the lease. The referee also determined that the lease established a duty of care owed by the defendants to the landlord. The referee found that they had negligently breached this duty when they failed to ensure that the oil tank had sufficient oil to operate the heating system during their extended absence from the leased property. The referee lastly determined that the defendants' breach of the lease and negligence were the cause of the plaintiff's damages, which were $50,960.02 for repairs to the dwelling and $10,342.68 for lost rent. The referee therefore recommended that the trial court render judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $61,302.70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court accepted the referee's report and rendered judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with the report. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court rejected the defendants' special defense concerning the specific agreement requirement of\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. They did not contest the referee's findings or the trial court's acceptance of them but, instead, renewed their argument that the plaintiff could not bring a subrogation action against them.\n   <em>\n    Amica Mutual Ins.

The focus of this court's inquiry indicates that leases that expressly allocate responsibility for damage and insurance coverage would fall outside of the \"typical default situation\" that we considered in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   and, thus, would satisfy the \"specific agreement\" requirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, a specific agreement between a landlord and tenant allocating the risk of damage and insurance coverage responsibilities resolves the two concerns that led this court in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   to adopt the presumption against subrogation. We adopted the default rule principally for two reasons: \"[1] [o]ur strong public policy against economic waste, and [2] the likely lack of expectations regarding a tenant's obligation to subrogate his landlord's insurer\" for any damage the tenant might cause to the leased property or to other properties in a multiunit building.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id., at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As for the policy against economic waste, we reasoned that a default rule\n   <em>\n    favoring\n   </em>\n   subrogation when the lease was otherwise silent about insurance responsibilities \"would create a strong incentive for every tenant to carry liability insurance\" for the leased property in an amount the landlord might have already insured under its own policy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    Id., at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although we disagreed that an expectation of coinsured status was justified under either insurance or contract law, we nevertheless acknowledged that the parties' expectations impacted notions of fairness, which underlie the doctrine of equitable subrogation.\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360185\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/847/#p851\">\n    259 Conn. at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the tenant specifically agrees in the lease to be responsible for his own negligence and to purchase insurance for this purpose, however, it can hardly come as a surprise that the landlord's insurer might hold the tenant responsible for any claims the insurer pays out to the landlord for the tenant's negligence.

According to this court, the lease did \"not remotely inform the [tenant and guarantor] that they would be liable to their landlord's insurer for any casualty fire damages to the landlord's building.\n   <em>\n    It informs them neither of the need to insure only their apartment, nor of the need to obtain insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the value of the entire multiunit apartment building\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)

We therefore concluded that the\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   default rule precluded the subrogation action in that case.

As the decision in\n   <em>\n    Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co.\n   </em>\n   implicitly recognized, such an agreement by the tenant accomplishes the same ends as an express agreement concerning subrogation by the landlord's insurer.

The primary purpose of notifying a tenant of the potential for subrogation is to put the tenant on notice that (1) the tenant will not benefit from the landlord's insurance, if any, for harm caused by the tenant's own negligence, (2) the tenant will be held responsible for this harm, and (3) the tenant thus should obtain insurance.

An agreement shifting liability for damages and responsibility for insurance coverage to the tenant in fact more clearly and specifically informs the tenant of his responsibilities than a plain statement authorizing subrogation by the landlord's insurer. A statement simply authorizing subrogation merely specifies\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   is likely to bring the action against the tenant, but that information would be of minor significance when the tenant has otherwise expressly agreed to be responsible to the landlord for damages and to obtain insurance for the landlord's benefit. The tenant has no convincing basis to claim unfair surprise merely because the landlord's insurer, who covered the claim, rather than the landlord, has sought to hold the tenant responsible for the tenant's negligence.

Under these circumstances, the defendants had no expectation that the landlord or his insurer would ultimately bear responsibility for the defendants' own negligence.

The defendants had the contractual obligation to secure insurance for the dwelling for the benefit of both themselves and the landlord. Quite unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   , in which we concluded that \"a tenant is not a coinsured on his landlord's fire insurance policy simply because he has an insurable interest in the premises and pays rent\";\n   <em>\n    DiLullo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360185\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/847/#p851\">\n    259 Conn. at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20A.2d%20819\">\n    792 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the parties here agreed by contract that the\n   <em>\n    tenants\n   </em>\n   would secure a policy for the\n   <em>\n    landlord's\n   </em>\n   benefit. There could therefore be no expectation on the defendants' part that their own liability would be covered by the landlord's insurance policy, or that some part of their rent payment was intended to pay for the landlord's insurance. For reasons the record does not reveal, the defendants either did not purchase insurance or their insurance policy failed to cover either them or their landlord. The defendants should not have been surprised that the landlord, or his insurance company, would seek recovery from them given their negligence and breach of the contractual duties to maintain the dwelling generally, to heat the dwelling specifically (including during vacancies), and to secure insurance. In fact, all that arguably might have exceeded the defendants' expectations is that the landlord had separate insurance covering his liability, notwithstanding the defendants' own promise to obtain it.
