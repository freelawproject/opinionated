Stat. \u00a7 760.50. As a matter of first impression, we hold that individuals are not amenable to private suit for violating the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203, where the act or practice opposed by the plaintiff is made unlawful by the ADA provisions concerning employment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111-12117. We also hold that individuals are not amenable to private suit for violating \u00a7 760.50(3)(b) of the FOAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">On July 3, 2006, Albra filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against his employer, Advan, Inc., and Advan officers Wayne Abbott, Troy Abbott, and Myriam Abbott (collectively, the \u201cAbbotts\u201d). In the complaint, Albra alleged discrimination and retaliation based on his HIV status in violation of the ADA and the FOAA. On August 8, 2006, Albra executed service to Advan\u2019s registered agent, Wayne Abbott, by sending a copy of the summons (but not the complaint) via U.S. mail. The Return of Service showed that Albra listed himself as the process server. On August 17th, My-riam was served by a non-party to the lawsuit. Albra filed a notice of Advan\u2019s failure to answer the complaint on August 28th. In that notice, Albra stated that he had \u201cfollowed Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and mailed the summons to the Registered Agent of the Corporation, Wayne Abbott.\u201d On August 31st, service was executed to Wayne in his personal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">On September 19th, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5), Advan filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency of service. On that same date, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Myriam and Wayne filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted on the ground that claims against individual defendants are not cognizable under either the ADA or the FOAA. Finally, service was executed to Troy on October 4th, and shortly thereafter, he notified the district court that he joined in Myriam and Wayne\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">In a written order, the district court granted Advan\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Albra had failed to effectuate service upon Advan in accordance with Rule 4(c) because he had personally served Advan through the mail. In that same order, the court granted the Abbotts\u2019 motion to dismiss, holding that neither the ADA nor the FOAA countenance individual liability. In so holding, the court dismissed Albra\u2019s complaint against Advan without prejudice and dismissed the complaint with prejudice as to the Abbotts. Albra now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">On appeal, Albra argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because (1) Advan was properly served, and (2) individual defendants may be liable under the ADA and the FOAA. Advan has moved for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 on the ground that Albra\u2019s appeal is frivolous. We address each argument in turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">\n<em>A. Service of Advan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Albra argues that service to Advan was proper because he mailed a copy of the summons to Advan\u2019s registered agent, Wayne Abbott, who was also named as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>defendant in the action. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process under [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 12(b)(5) by applying a <em>de novo </em>standard to the law and a clear error standard to any findings of fact.\u201d <em>Prewitt Enters., Inc. v. Org. of Petroleum, Exporting Countries, </em>353 F.3d 916, 920 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c) provides that service of process shall be effected by serving a summons <em>\u201ctogether with a copy of the complaint. ... </em>within the time allowed under [Rule 4(m)] .... by any person <em>who is not a party </em>and who is at least 18 years of age.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c) (emphasis added). A defendant\u2019s actual notice is not sufficient to cure defectively executed service. <em>See Schnabel v. Wells, </em>922 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1991) (interpreting former Rule 4(j)), <em>superseded in part by rule as stated in Horenkamp v. Van Winkle And Co., Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1129, 1132 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). And although we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, \u201cwe nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Here, the record demonstrates that Al-bra, the plaintiff in the suit, served Advan by mailing a copy of the summons without attaching a copy of the complaint. Accordingly, Albra failed to properly effect service upon Advan in accordance with Rule 4(c), and the district court\u2019s grant of Advan\u2019s motion to dismiss was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">\n<em>B. Dismissal of Albra\u2019s Complaint Against the Abbotts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Albra also argues that the Abbots, as owners, officers, and managers of Advan, constitute \u201cemployers\u201d under the ADA and the FOAA, and the district court thus erred in dismissing his complaint against them. A district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed <em>de novo. Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). Questions of law, such as the construction of a statute, are also reviewed <em>de novo. Konikov v. Orange County, Fla., </em>410 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">\n<em>1. ADA Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">The ADA prohibits disability discrimination in three areas: employment, public services, and public accommodations. <em>Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla., </em>344 F.3d 1161, 1166 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003). Subchap-ter I of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on account of disability in employment, covers the same employers and provides the same remedies contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111-12117. Subchapter II bars discrimination by any state or local government entity (that is, discrimination in public services) and affords the remedies outlined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12165. Subchap-ter III prohibits discrimination by public accommodations and incorporates the remedies of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a-3(a). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12181-12189. And Subchap-ter IV sets forth various miscellaneous provisions, including the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12201-12213.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">\n<em>a. Discrimination Under the ADA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Albra argues that the Abbotts are personally liable under the ADA for discriminating against him on account of his HIV status. The anti-discrimination provision of Subchapter I of the ADA provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). The term \u201ccovered entity\u201d means \u201can employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12111(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The ADA\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is similar to that under Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b), and this court has held that neither of those Acts countenance individual liability. <em>Mason v. Stallings, </em>82 F.3d 1007, 1009 (11th Cir.1996). In light of our construction of Title VII and the ADEA, we also have held that individual defendants are not amenable to private suit for violating the anti-discrimination provision of Subchapter I of the ADA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Here, Albra\u2019s ADA discrimination claim names the Abbotts as defendants in their individual capacities. Because individual liability is precluded for violations of the ADA\u2019s employment discrimination provision, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Albra\u2019s discrimination claim against the Abbotts.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\n<em>b. Retaliation Under the ABA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The ADA\u2019s general anti-retaliation provision provides that \u201c[n]o <em>person </em>shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter .... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a) (emphasis added). In the instant case, Albra argues that the Abbotts are personally liable under the ADA for retaliating against him after he filed formal charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Thus, the issue before this court is whether individual defendants may be personally liable for violating the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision when the \u201cact or practice\u201d opposed by the plaintiff is made unlawful by the ADA provisions concerning employment (Subchapter I).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">In <em>Shotz, </em>a panel of this court held that individual liability is not precluded for violations of the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a), where the act or practice opposed by the plaintiff is made unlawful by the ADA provisions concerning <em>public services, </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12165 (Subchapter II). <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1179-80. In so holding, the <em>Shotz </em>panel first examined the plain language of \u00a7 12203 and noted that this provision \u201cis the only anti-discrimination provision in the ADA that uses the unqualified term \u2018person\u2019 to define the regulated entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1168. The panel also observed that in Subchapter I of the ADA (the provisions regarding employment), the term \u201cperson\u201d is defined to include \u201cindividuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Stating that it \u201cmay consider Congress\u2019s use of a particular term elsewhere in the statute to determine its proper meaning within the context of the statutory scheme[,]\u201d the <em>Shotz </em>panel concluded that \u201cthe anti-retaliation provision not only unequivocally confers on those whom it protects a federal right to be free from retaliation, but also imposes a correlative duty on all individuals to refrain from such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But according to the panel, \u201c[t]hat a statutory provision imposes such a duty on a class of actors ... does not compel the further conclusion that individual members of that class are amenable to private suit or otherwise liable for a breach of that duty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">The <em>Shotz </em>panel then examined the remedies created by the ADA, noting that the remedies for persons injured by retaliation in the public services context incorporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the remedies set forth in Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d <em>et seq., </em>and courts generally have concluded that Title VI precludes individual liability. <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1169-75. But the panel went on to state that \u201c[e]ven were we to ignore the plain meaning [of \u00a7 12203(a)] and look only to the available Title VI remedies in determining the scope of liability, we still could not conclusively establish that Congress intended to preclude individual liability under \u00a7 12203.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173. According to the panel, such an \u201capproach might make sense for a violation of \u00a7 12203 in the employment context[,]\u201d as in that context, \u201cthe aggrieved person is ultimately referred to the remedies provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by the same entities as prohibited by Subchapter I of the ADA regulating employment, and ... those remedies do not include suit against individuals.\u201d <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1173 (citations omitted). But the <em>Shotz </em>panel determined that in the public services context, \u201callowing the remedial provisions to govern the scope of liability would deviate considerably from the intent and purpose of the statute\u201d because \u201c[t]he ADA makes <em>any </em>public entity liable for prohibited acts of discrimination, regardless of funding source!,]\u201d while \u201cTitle VI remedies are available only against federal funds recipients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The panel therefore concluded that the scope of liability of \u00a7 12203 in the public services context could not be confined to that of TitleVI. Mat 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Finding the plain language and statutory structure unhelpful in ascertaining Congress\u2019s intent, the <em>Shotz </em>panel turned to the legislative history and purpose of the ADA and found both to be \u201cequally unhelpful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1176-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The panel then examined the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regulations construing the ADA. <em>Id. </em>at 1177. The relevant DOJ regulation provides that \u201c[n]o private or public entity shall discriminate against any individual because that individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this part....\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.134. The DOJ defines a \u201cprivate entity\u201d as \u201ca <em>person </em>or entity other than a public entity.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.104 (emphasis added). And the appendix to the regulations provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">Section 35.134 implements section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her rights under the Act.... [T]he section applies not only to public entities subject to this part, but also to persons acting in an individual capacity or to private entities. For example, it would be a violation of the Act and this part for a private individual to harass or intimidate an individual with a disability in an effort to prevent that individual from attending a concert in a State-owned park.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A at 532, 56 Fed. Reg. 35,696, 35,707 (July 26, 1991) (\u201cPreamble to Regulation on Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services,\u201d \u201cSection-by-Section Analysis\u201d). From this language, the <em>Shotz </em>panel concluded that the DOJ \u201chas interpreted \u00a7 12203 as rendering those individuals acting in their individual capacities amenable to private suit.\u201d <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">After stating that \u201cCongress expressly authorized the Attorney General to make rules with the force of law interpreting and implementing the ADA provisions generally applicable to public services!,]\u201d the <em>Shotz </em>panel concluded that the DOJ\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12203 was reasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>accorded Chevron<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deference to the DOJ regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. The panel thus held that \u201can individual may be sued privately in his or her personal capacity for violating \u00a7 12203 in the public services context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In reaching its holding, the <em>Shotz </em>panel expressly declined to decide whether individual liability is also precluded for violation of the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision in the employment context. <em>Id. </em>at 1173. Thus, as stated above, the question before us in the instant case is whether individual defendants may be personally liable for violating \u00a7 12203 when the act or practice opposed by the plaintiff is made unlawful by the ADA provisions concerning employment \u2014 that is, Subchapter I.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">We first look to the plain language of \u00a7 12203(a), which, again, provides that \u201c[n]o <em>person </em>shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter_\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a) (emphasis added). As the <em>Shotz </em>panel noted, \u00a7 12203(a) \u201cis the only anti-discrimination provision in the ADA that uses the unqualified term \u2018person\u2019 to define the regulated entity[,]\u201d and Sub-chapter I of the ADA defines the word \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201cindividuals.\u201d <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1168 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(7)). But Subchapter I\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d explicitly incorporates the definition of \u201cperson\u201d articulated in Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(7) (\u201cThe term[ ] \u2018person\u2019 ... shall have the same meaning given such term[] in section 2000e of this title[,]\u201d which defines \u201cperson\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cincluding] one or more individuals,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a)). And although Title VII defines the term \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cpersons,\u201d and the term \u201cpersons\u201d is defined to include \u201cindividuals,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a)-(b), this court has long held that individuals are not amenable to private suit under Title VII. <em>Mason, </em>82 F.3d at 1009; <em>Smith v. Lomax, </em>45 F.3d 402, 403 n. 4 (11th Cir.1995); <em>Busby v. City of Orlando, </em>931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991). Thus, \u00a7 12203\u2019s use of the word \u201cperson\u201d rather than the term \u201centity\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d is not dispositive in determining whether an individual may be personally liable for violating this provision. <em>See Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1168. We therefore turn to the remedies created by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">The remedies for violation of the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision in the employment context are set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 12117, in turn, explicitly incorporates the remedies available under Title VII. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 12117(a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Baird v. Rose, </em>192 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>462, 471-72 (4th Cir.1999). Title VII \u201cprohibits discrimination <em>by the same entities as prohibited by Subchapter I </em>of the ADA regulating employment....\u201d <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1173 (emphasis added). And, as stated above, this court has held that there is no individual liability for violations of Title VII. <em>Mason, </em>82 F.3d at 1009; <em>Smith, </em>45 F.3d at 403 n. 4; <em>Busby, </em>931 F.2d at 772. Thus, in <em>Mason, </em>this court construed the ADA\u2019s employment discrimination provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), in light of Title VII and concluded that \u201cthere is no sound reason to read the [ADA] any differently from this Court\u2019s reading of Title VII....\u201d <em>Mason, </em>82 F.3d at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">In <em>Shotz, </em>this court determined that limiting the scope of remedies for violations of \u00a7 12203 in the public services context (Subehapter II) to that available under Title VI \u201cwould deviate considerably from the intent and purpose of the [ADA,]\u201d because Subchapter II of \u201cthe ADA makes <em>any </em>public entity liable for prohibited acts of discrimination, regardless of funding source[,]\u201d while \u201cTitle VI remedies are available only against federal funds recipients.\u201d <em>Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1174 (emphasis in original). But in the employment context, \u201cthe aggrieved person is ultimately referred to the remedies provided by Title VII[,] ... which prohibits discrimination <em>by the same entities as prohibited by Sub-chapter I </em>of the ADA regulating employment, and ... those remedies <em>do not include suit against individuals.\u201d Shotz, </em>344 F.3d at 1173 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, unlike the public services context at issue in <em>Shotz, </em>limiting the scope of remedies available for violations of \u00a7 12203 in the employment context to those remedies available under Title VII would not deviate considerably from the intent and purpose of the ADA. And unlike the DOJ regulations interpreting the ADA (at issue in <em>Shotz), </em>neither the EEOC regulations interpreting the ADA nor the EEOC\u2019s interpretive guidance accompanying those regulations state that individuals acting in their individual capacities are amenable to private suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2; 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App., 56 Fed.Reg. 35,726, 35,739-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>35,753 (July 26, 1991) (\u201cInterpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that individual liability is precluded under \u00a7 12203 where the act or practice opposed by the plaintiff is made unlawful by Sub-chapter I of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\n<em>2. FOAA Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Finally, Albra argues that the Ab-botts are personally liable for discriminating against him in violation of the FOAA, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.50. In relevant part, the FOAA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">No person may fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, segregate or classify any individual of employment opportunities or adversely affect his status as an employee, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on the basis of knowledge or belief that the individual has taken a human immunodeficiency virus test or the results or perceived results of such test unless the absence of human immunodeficiency virus infection is a bona fide occupational qualification of the job in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.50(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Although this court has yet to address the issue of individual liability under the FOAA, in <em>Huck v. Mega Nursing Services, Inc., </em>the District Court for the Southern District of Florida found \u201cthe spirit of the [FOAA]\u201d to be similar to that of Title VII and the ADA \u201cin the area of employer/employee liability.\u201d 989 F.Supp. 1462, 1464 (S.D.Fla.1997). The <em>Huck </em>court thus concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">In light of the language of the [FOAA] and upon reviewing the case law of similar statutes, this Court is convinced that the Florida Legislature did not intend to provide a cause of action against individual employees. Rather, the [FOAA] creates a cause of action for employees who have been discriminated against by their employing entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1464-65. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">Section 760.50(2) of the FOAA provides that \u201c[a]ny person with or perceived as having [AIDS, AIDS-related complex, or HIV] shall have <em>every 'protection </em>made available to <em>handicapped persons.\u201d </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.50(2) (emphasis added). The Florida Civil Rights Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.01-760.10, provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an individual on the basis of, <em>inter alia, </em>an individual\u2019s <em>\u201chandicap.\u201d </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a) (emphasis added). \u201cThe FCRA is modeled after Title VII, so that federal case law regarding Title VII is applicable to construe the Act.\u201d <em>Byrd v. BT Foods, Inc., </em>948 So.2d 921, 925 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007). \u201cAs applied to discrimination based on a <em>handicap, </em>the FCRA is construed in conformity with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>McCaw Cellular Commc\u2019ns of Fla. v. Kwiatek, </em>763 So.2d 1063, 1065 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Because the FOAA provides that persons with HIV or AIDS \u201cshall have every protection made available to <em>handicapped </em>persons,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.50(2) (emphasis added), the FCRA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of an individual\u2019s <em>handicap, </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(l)(a), and the FCRA is to be \u201cconstrued in conformity with the\u201d ADA, <em>Byrd, </em>948 So.2d at 925, we conclude that the FOAA\u2019s employment discrimination provisions shall also be construed in conformity with the ADA. And because we have held that individual liability is precluded for violations of the ADA\u2019s anti-discrimination provision in the employment context, <em>Mason, </em>82 F.3d at 1009, we thus conclude that an individual may <em>not </em>be sued privately in his or her personal capacity for violating the FOAA\u2019s employment discrimination provisions. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Albra\u2019s FOAA claim against the Abbots was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">\n<em>C. Advan\u2019s Motion for Rule 38 Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Advan argues that this court should impose sanctions against Albra under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 because Albra\u2019s claims on appeal are \u201cfrivolous\u201d in light of the \u201cwell-settled law.\u201d Rule 38 provides that \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Here, Albra\u2019s appeal was not \u201cfrivolous,\u201d as this court\u2019s resolution of the appeal required us to decide <em>two </em>issues of first impression in this circuit. We therefore deny Advan\u2019s motion for Rule 38 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Albra\u2019s complaint against Advan and the Abbotts, and we DENY Advan\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">.

Although Congress delegated authority to the EEOC to implement Subchapter I of the ADA, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12116, the ADA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 12203, is outside of Subchapter I, and the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[n]o agency ... has been given authority to issue regulations implementing the generally applicable provisions of the ADA.\u201d <em>Sutton v.

As such, the degree of deference, if any, courts owe the EEOC regulations implementing the ADA's generally applicable provisions is an open question. <em>See id. </em>at 480, 119 S.Ct. at 2146; <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 194, 122 S.Ct. 681, 689, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002); <em>Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>380 F.3d 751, 762 n. 7 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Waldrip v.

Nonetheless, the Supreme Court's pronouncements in <em>Sutton </em>and <em>Toyota </em>strongly suggest that these regulations are <em>not </em>entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference to the extent they interpret ADA provisions outside of Subchap-ter I. <em>See Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 479-80, 119 S.Ct. at 2145-46; <em>Toyota, </em>534 U.S. at 194, 122 S.Ct. at 689; <em>see also Waldrip, </em>325 F.3d at 655 n. 1. Here, however, we need not determine what deference is due because, as stated above, the relevant regulations and interpretive guidelines do not state that individuals acting in their individual capacities are amenable to private suit. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2; 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App., 56 Fed.

Notably, the District Courts of the Middle, Northern, and Southern Districts of Florida have held that individual employees may not be sued under the FCRA\u2019s employment discrimination provisions.
