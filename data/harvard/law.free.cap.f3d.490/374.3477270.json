Allied contests part of the order and raises no challenge to the remainder. For the following reasons, we GRANT the Board\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">The following facts are not disputed by the parties. Allied provides jet fuel for commercial airlines at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. At all relevant times, Allied and the Transport Workers Union of America, Air Transport Local 513 (\u201cthe Union\u201d) were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d). Article 28(f) of the CBA requires employees to submit grievances within seven days of any alleged violation of the agreement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>time limit was understood by the parties to be strictly construed, and failure to file a grievance within the time period was grounds for Allied to reject the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Patrick Sanford worked for Allied for 22 years, most recently serving as a facilities mechanic. Sanford also served as Maintenance Section Chairman of the Union, making him responsible for representing 45 employees. Sanford\u2019s Union responsibilities included ensuring that grievances were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In February 2005, Sanford spoke with Allied\u2019s maintenance manager, Jerry Kee-ney, to complain about Allied\u2019s practice of outsourcing some of its maintenance work. Keeney promised that the practice would cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">On March 2, 2005, Sanford learned that Allied had outsourced maintenance on one of its vehicles despite Keeney\u2019s assurance to the contrary. Sanford informed his Union superiors about the incident, and they directed him to file grievances on behalf of the two employees \u2014 Larry Rottham and David Thompson \u2014 who would have been entitled to overtime if the work had not been outsourced.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Sanford prepared the grievances for Rottman and Thompson to sign. He got Rottman\u2019s signature, but was unable to obtain Thompson\u2019s signature despite assigning a union steward to the task. On March 9, with the CBA\u2019s deadline approaching, Sanford signed Thompson\u2019s name to the form and filed it, in order to preserve Thompson\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">When Thompson found out that a grievance had been filed on his behalf, he was upset with Sanford for doing so. On March 16, Sanford arrived at work early to explain his actions to Thompson and offer to withdraw the grievance. Sanford spoke to Keeney the same day and confessed to having signed Thompson\u2019s grievance. Sanford then told Keeney that the Union would withdraw the grievance, and Keeney assured Sanford that Thompson would not suffer any retaliation due to the filing of the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">On April 8, Keeney told Sanford that he was suspended pending an investigation into his having signed Thompson\u2019s grievance. On April 15, Keeney and Allied\u2019s Operations Manager, Joe Correa, informed Sanford that he was being discharged for signing Thompson\u2019s name to the grievance. In a letter dated April 20, Keeney explained that Sanford was discharged for \u201cdishonesty, falsifying company documents, and fraud against Allied Aviation,\u201d all allegedly in violation of Article 28(b) of the CBA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">The Board found that Allied violated Chapter 7 of the NLRA by suspending and discharging Sanford for signing Thompson\u2019s name to the grievance. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), (3) (prohibiting employers from interfering with the exercise of rights guaranteed under the NLRA). The NLRB also found that Allied violated the NLRA by unilaterally changing its drug testing policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We review the Board\u2019s findings of fact for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201cThe findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.\u201d). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Valmont Indus., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>244 F.3d 454, 463 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)). In determining whether the Board\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record, we do not make credibility determinations or reweigh the evidence. <em>NLRB v. Cal-Maine Farms, Inc., </em>998 F.2d 1336, 1339-40 (5th Cir.1993). The Board\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>NLRB v. Thermon Heat Tracing Servs., Inc., </em>143 F.3d 181, 185 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Allied asserts that the Board\u2019s factual findings were not supported by substantial evidence and that the Board made an error of law. In particular, Allied asserts that (1) the Board failed to give sufficient weight to the allegation that Sanford forged Thompson\u2019s name for his own benefit; (2) the Board failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that Sanford\u2019s behavior was not a common practice; (3) the Board failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that Sanford\u2019s discharge was consistent with company practice; and (4) the Board applied the incorrect legal standard to its analysis of the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>A. Allied\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s fact-finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Allied asserts that Sanford forged the grievance for his own personal benefit, not for the protection of Thompson\u2019s rights. Allied points to an exchange at the hearing, in which its general counsel asked Sanford, \u201c[d]id you benefit from that grievance in any way?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Sanford replied. When asked how he had benefited, Sanford stated that \u201c[t]he outsourcing of the work slowed down.\u201d Allied asserts this proves that Sanford received a <em>personal </em>benefit from the grievance, as opposed to a benefit accruing to Thompson or the union in general. However, Allied points to no evidence indicating that Sanford stood to gain financially or otherwise from a reduction in outsourced work.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Allied also asserts that Sanford\u2019s actions were not common practice, contrary to testimony presented at the hearing. Allied, however, does not indicate how this fact influenced the Board\u2019s decision, or how a different finding by this court would yield a more favorable outcome for Allied. The Board\u2019s findings did not rely on this fact, so Allied\u2019s argument is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Similarly, Allied asserts that the Board did not sufficiently weigh evidence that its discharge of Sanford was consistent with previous personnel decisions. Allied presented evidence to the Board about two employees fired for falsifying time records, in one case for the direct personal gain of the employee. Allied attempts to lump these acts into a general category of \u201cemployee dishonesty,\u201d without regard for the special protections afforded union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The Board concluded that Sanford acted to protect Thompson\u2019s interest, not his own, that he believed that his actions were necessary for that purpose, and that his actions did not interfere with the work of others or the operations of the company. It rested this finding on Sanford\u2019s testimony and the other facts presented, which certainly support the Board\u2019s conclusion. Sanford acted only when he believed Thompson would lose his right to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>grievance. He also admitted his actions to Keeney and withdrew the grievance once he learned that Thompson did not want it to be filed. We do not overturn the Board\u2019s findings of fact on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>B. The correct legal standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Allied asserts that the Board should have applied the burden-shifting framework first established in <em>NLRB v. Wright Line, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), and approved by the Supreme Court in <em>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 400-01, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983), <em>overruled on other grounds by Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 277-78, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994), to determine whether Sanford\u2019s termination was legal. However, that framework applies in mixed-motive cases, when an employee is allegedly discharged for both protected and unprotected activity. <em>See, e.g., Poly-America, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>260 F.3d 465, 488-89 (5th Cir.2001) (applying the framework when the employer claimed that it discharged the employee for poor performance). Here, the parties agree that Sanford was discharged for signing Thompson\u2019s name to the grievance form. If this was protected union activity under the NLRA, it violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 to fire him. <em>NLRB v. ADCO Elec. Inc., </em>6 F.3d 1110, 1116 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cIt is elementary that an employer violates section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discharging employees because of their union activity.\u201d). If it was not protected activity, there is no question that Allied would have been within its rights under the CBA to fire Sanford. Consequently, the only relevant question of law is whether Sanford\u2019s act constituted protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Allied concedes, as it must, that filing a grievance is usually protected activity. It asserts, however, that by signing Thompson\u2019s name for him, Sanford lost the protections of the NLRA and could be discharged. We have held that \u201cflagrant conduct of an employee, even though occurring in the course of [protected] activity, may justify disciplinary action by the employer.\u201d <em>Boaz Spinning Co. v. NLRB, </em>395 F.2d 512, 514 (5th Cir.1968) (internal quotation omitted). However, \u201cnot every impropriety committed during such activity places the employee beyond the protective shield of the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe employee\u2019s right to engage in concerted activity may permit some leeway for impulsive behavior, which must be balanced against the employer\u2019s right to maintain order and respect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Further, \u201c \u2018the responsibility to draw the line between these conflicting rights rests with the Board, and its determination, unless illogical or arbitrary, ought not be disturbed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. NLRB, </em>430 F.2d 724, 730 (5th Cir.1970) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., </em>351 F.2d 584, 587 (7th Cir.1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Here, the Board concluded that Sanford acted in the good-faith belief that his actions were necessary to preserve Thompson\u2019s claim. It also determined that he derived no personal gain from filing the grievance, voluntarily acknowledged his actions, and promptly withdrew the grievance when he learned that Thompson opposed the filing. Allied challenges these factual findings, as discussed above, but it also asserts that Sanford\u2019s activity was not protected as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The Board relied on two cases from our sister circuits in reaching its conclusion. In <em>Roadmaster Corp. v. NLRB, </em>874 F.2d 448, 451-54 (7th Cir.1989), the Seventh Circuit held that a union official who signed an employee\u2019s name to a grievance without the employee\u2019s permission was entitled to the protection of the NLRA. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>recently, in <em>OPW Fueling Components v. NLRB, </em>443 F.3d 490, 493-97 (6th Cir.2006), the Sixth Circuit held that a union official who signed the names of two involuntarily transferred employees to a grievance without their permission was entitled to the protection of the NLRA. In both cases, the employer asserted that it fired the employee for falsifying company documents, the same charge Allied makes against Sanford. <em>Id. </em>at 498; <em>Roadmaster, </em>874 F.2d at 454. Both courts found that the employer\u2019s stated reason for firing the employee was improper, with the <em>Road-master </em>court noting that the employer \u201chas consistently articulated only one reason for discharging [the employee].... Because we have upheld the Board\u2019s determination that this was protected concerted activity, Roadmaster discharged [the employee] solely for engaging in union activities.\u201d 874 F.2d at 454. The <em>OPW Fueling </em>court agreed with the district judge\u2019s determination that the employer\u2019s proffered reason for firing the employee was merely a pretext for anti-union animus. 443 F.3d at 498. Both courts found, in concurrence with the Board\u2019s determination, that the employee in question acted in good faith to preserve the employee\u2019s rights and without any intent to deceive the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 496-98 (discussing and applying <em>Roadmas-ter).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">As discussed above, Sanford acted to preserve Thompson\u2019s rights to overtime pay. Nothing in the record indicates any other motive behind his actions or bad faith on his part in pursuing this grievance. The record indicates that Sanford had previously taken steps to prevent the outsourcing of work (and received an assurance that the company would cease outsourcing), so his actions were entirely consistent with this concern. The simple act of signing a grievance to preserve a fellow employee\u2019s rights does not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of \u201cflagrant conduct\u201d that would strip the employee of the NLRA\u2019s protection. Consequently, we find that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Sanford was discharged for engaging in protected activity is not illogical or arbitrary, and we thus refuse to disturb its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the Board\u2019s application for enforcement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. Article 28(b) allows Allied to \"discharge or discipline any employee for incompetency, disobedience, dishonesty, disorderly conduct, negligence, absenteeism, or any just and proper cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\">. On April 7, 2005, Allied changed its drug testing policy unilaterally over the Union\u2019s objections, expanding the reasons for which an employee could be tested, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of employees subjected to testing. Allied implemented these changes without any notice to or bargaining with the Union. Allied does not challenge the propriety of the Board\u2019s order with respect to the change in the company\u2019s drug-testing policy. Consequently, this portion of the order is summarily affirmed. <em>NLRB v. Brookshire Grocery Co., 919 </em>F.2d 359, <em>363 </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
