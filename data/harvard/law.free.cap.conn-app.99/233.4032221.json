The defendant claims that the court (1) improperly instructed the jury on the causation element of \u00a7 53a-56b (a) and the elements of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle under \u00a7 14-224 (a), and (2) improperly precluded him from presenting evidence that the victim had a trace amount of methadone in his blood at the time of the fatal accident at issue. We disagree with the defendant and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The state presented the following evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial. On the evening of July 16, 2001, the defendant met a coworker for dinner at a restaurant after work and consumed about six beers over the course of approximately three and one-half hours before and during dinner. The defendant left the restaurant driving his pickup truck and, at approximately 10:15 p.m., approached the intersection of Boston Avenue and Mill Hill Avenue in Bridgeport at the same time that Christopher Tanych, the victim, also approached the intersection on a motorcycle from the opposite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>direction. As the victim\u2019s motorcycle reached the intersection, the defendant\u2019s truck turned left into its path. According to a witness, Jackie Wilson, the defendant\u2019s truck displayed no turn signals. The victim applied his brakes and swerved, leaving a fifty-six foot skid mark, but was unable to avoid colliding with the back portion of the defendant\u2019s truck. The front part of the defendant\u2019s truck was in the victim\u2019s lane at the time. The victim was thrown from the motorcycle and died as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Wilson, who had been driving behind the victim, testified that the truck then stopped, the defendant stepped out of the truck, looked, got back into the truck and \u201ctook off.\u201d Wilson followed the defendant, \u201ccut him off\u2019 with Wilson\u2019s car and, when the defendant stopped his truck, confronted him about the accident. The defendant denied having hit anyone and drove away from Wilson. Wilson then saw the police driving toward him, flagged them down and pointed them toward the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Upon speaking to Wilson, James Kennedy, an officer of the Bridgeport police department, began to pursue the defendant with his police cruiser\u2019s lights and siren activated. The defendant stopped only after a second cruiser arrived and forced his truck to the side of the roadway. Once the police stopped the defendant, they observed that his eyes were red and glassy, his speech was slurred and that he emitted the odor of alcohol. On the basis of these observations and the results of field sobriety tests, the defendant was placed under arrest. At the state police barracks, the defendant underwent Breathalyzer tests at 12:06 a.m. and 12:39 a.m. that showed his blood alcohol content was 0.172 and 0.167, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>At trial, the defendant testified that as he approached the intersection, the traffic light was green and he saw only an opposite approaching automobile about 100 yards away. While he was turning left, after giving a signal, he felt an impact toward the rear of his truck, saw nothing and thought someone had hit his vehicle and driven off.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant also offered the testimony of Michael Cei, an accident reconstruction expert, who said that the victim had been traveling westerly and uphill into the intersection at a 7 percent grade and at thirty-eight to forty-eight miles per hour. Cei also testified that at the intersection, an easterly bound driver can see down the hill. In Cei\u2019s opinion, no road defects, deficiencies or anything about the intersection contributed in any way to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The defendant was charged in count one with evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-224 (a), in count two with manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 53a-56b (a) and in count three with manslaughter in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1). The jury found the defendant guilty of counts one and two and not guilty of the third count. The court sentenced the defendant to an effective term of ten years incarceration, execution suspended after seven years, and five years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the causation element of \u00a7 53a-56b (a) and the elements of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle under \u00a7 14-224 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The defendant concedes that his claims of instructional impropriety were not properly preserved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>argues that he is entitled to review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because of the constitutional magnitude of his claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or under the doctrine of plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We will review these claims because the record is adequate for review, and the defendant has raised claims that the jury was not instructed on essential elements of the offenses, which is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubose, </em>75 Conn. App. 163, 174, 815 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 909, 819 A.2d 841 (2003). The state does not, in arguing the issue of reviewability, raise either the failure of the defendant to file a request to charge as to intervening cause or his failure to take exception to the charge. It also does not raise the effect of the defendant\u2019s having been given a written copy of the charge prior to the delivery of the charge to the jury and his failure to request the trial judge to augment the instruction as he now argues on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the causation element of \u00a7 53a-56b (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He maintains that the court failed to give a sufficient charge on proximate cause by not explaining the doctrine of intervening cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argues that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>this case, the evidence warranted an intervening cause instruction because certain acts or omissions of the victim constituted an intervening cause to relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cwhether a jury instruction is improper is gauged by considering the instruction in its entirety, and with reference to the facts and evidence in the case, so as to determine whether it fairly presented the case to the jury so that no injustice was done under established legal rules.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 120, 659 A.2d 683 (1995). In so doing, the evidence must be viewed favorably to the defendant. Id., 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The defendant, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>21 Conn. App. 138, 572 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 811, 576 A.2d 540 (1990), argues that the causation element \u201crequires that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt, first that the death of a person would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the defendant\u2019s intoxication, and second, that the defendant\u2019s intoxication substantially and materially contributed to the death of a person in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient, intervening cause. In order to determine that the state has not met its burden of proof on this element, the jury must find either that the defendant\u2019s intoxication was not the actual \u2018but for\u2019 cause of the victim\u2019s death or that there was an \u2018independent and efficient cause\u2019 ... or an intervening and efficient cause.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Our Supreme Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 121, discussed jury instructions with respect to proximate cause and the inclusion of intervening cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>language. The court stated: \u201c[W]hen several factors contribute, in a chain of events, to cause a victim\u2019s injury, in order to be the proximate cause of that injury, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been a cause that necessarily set in operation the factors that accomplish the injury. In short, a jury instruction with respect to proximate cause must contain, at a minimum, the following elements: (1) an indication that the defendant\u2019s conduct must contribute substantially and materially, in a direct manner, to the victim\u2019s injuries; and (2) an indication that the defendant\u2019s conduct cannot have been superseded by an efficient, intervening cause that produced the injuries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Our Supreme Court emphasized that <em>\u201cthe requirement of language in the jury instructions regarding an efficient, intervening cause is not ironclad. </em>It arises in those cases in which the evidence could support a finding by the jury that the defendant\u2019s conduct was overcome by an efficient, intervening cause, or in which the evidence regarding proximate causation was such that, based on the doctrine of efficient, intervening cause, the jury could have a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 121 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of intervening cause . . . refers to a situation in which the defendant\u2019s conduct is a but for cause, or cause in fact, of the victim\u2019s injury, but nonetheless some other circumstance subsequently occurs\u2014the source of which may be an act of the victim, the act of some other person, or some nonhuman force\u2014that does more than supply a concurring or contributing cause of the injury, but is unforeseeable and sufficiently powerful in its effect that it serves to relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility for his conduct. . . . Thus, the doctrine serves as a dividing line between two closely related factual situations: (1) where two or more acts or forces, one of which was set in motion by the defendant, combine to cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>victim\u2019s injuries, in which case the doctrine will not relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility; and (2) where an act or force intervenes in such a way as to relieve a defendant, whose conduct contributed in fact to the victim\u2019s injuries, from responsibility, in which case the doctrine will apply.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 124-25; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>81 Conn. App. 518, 522-23, 840 A.2d 1192, cert. granted on other grounds, 268 Conn. 922, 846 A. 2d 881 (2004) (appeal withdrawn, judgment vacated April 21, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">A review of the jury instruction reveals that with regard to that part of the instruction on intervening cause, there was at least an indication that the defendant\u2019s conduct cannot have been superseded by an efficient, intervening cause that produced the injuries, thus satisfying the minimum requirement for a jury instruction on proximate cause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>supra, 81 Conn. App. 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Even if we were to conclude, however, that an instruction on the doctrine of intervening cause was not sufficiently detailed, the instruction would not be improper considering the evidence in this case, viewed favorably to the defendant. The evidence was that the victim\u2019s motorcycle skidded at the intersection and collided with the defendant\u2019s vehicle, which was turning left into, and remained in, the path of the victim\u2019s oncoming motorcycle. The defendant argues that the actions or omissions of the victim were an efficient, intervening cause of the collision. He cites the evidence that the victim was operating the motorcycle without a license, was speeding and skidded. That conduct reasonably could only be considered concurrent causes rather than unforeseen events that occurred subsequent to the defendant\u2019s negligent act of turning left into the victim\u2019s line of travel at the intersection. See id., 524. We conclude that the evidence, viewed in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>defendant, did not warrant an instruction on the doctrine of intervening cause. Finally, the court\u2019s charge expressly stated that the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the victim\u2019s death had to be \u201cdirect\u201d and that the victim\u2019s death had to have been \u201ccaused\u201d by the defendant\u2019s conduct as a \u201cforeseeable and natural result\u201d of that conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that the jury was not misled by the instruction as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the elements of evasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle under \u00a7 14-224 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He first argues that the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cprevent\u201d instead of the word \u201cunable\u201d misled the jury. The defendant argues that the court improperly instructed the jury that it needed to find that some outside force caused the defendant to be unable to report the information, as opposed to the defendant\u2019s being unable to report for any cause or reason. He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>argues that the court\u2019s charge failed to instruct and guide the jury properly on the alternative elements of \u00a7 14-224 (a) because it \u201cshould have charged the jury that if the defendant was arrested by police while trying to render such assistance as the defendant deemed reasonably necessary . . . then compliance with the remaining duties of the statute are legally excused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As to the first contention, viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court\u2019s use of the word \u201cprevent\u201d was harmless. We are not persuaded that there was any prejudice in the court\u2019s substitution of the phrase \u201cif he was prevented [by] any cause\u201d for \u201cif . . . [he] was unable, for any reason or cause.\u201d The defendant fails to draw a satisfactory distinction between the two phrases. Moreover, it is unlikely that he was prejudiced if the jury believed that it needed to find that some outside force caused the defendant to be unable to report the accident. The defendant presented his theory of defense to the jury that he could not comply with the reporting requirement because he was stopped and prevented from doing so by the police, an outside force.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Turning to the defendant\u2019s second argument, we can find no authority, and the defendant cites none, that requires the court to charge the jury that compliance with the remaining duties of \u00a7 14-224 (a) are legally excused if the defendant was arrested by police while trying to render such assistance as the defendant deemed reasonably necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The defendant argues that he left the scene in order to find an ambulance or police vehicle at a nearby hospital to assist the victim. That he was stopped in this very pursuit by the police, he maintains, should excuse any remaining compliance with the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>81 Conn. App. 621, 629-31, 841 A.2d 254, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 923, 848 A.2d 473 (2004), a decision that was released after this case was tried, that \u00a7 14-224 \u201cdoes not leave an operator an excuse for failing to stop for any reason as it does for failing to give the required information at the scene. . . . [T]he legislative history establishes that the failure to stop immediately cannot be cured at some later time by an operator reporting the incident to the police. . . . The essence of the offense of evading responsibility is the failure of the driver to stop and render aid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The jury reasonably could have found that the defendant failed to stop immediately and render assistance, and that leaving the scene of the accident and driving away was not in compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Finally, \u201c[a]n accurate jury instruction cannot be the basis for a showing that the defendant was clearly deprived . . . of a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanko, </em>62 Conn. App. 34, 40-41, 771 A.2d 149, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 905, 772 A.2d 599 (2001), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. We find no <em>Golding </em>violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The defendant claims that the court improperly precluded him from presenting evidence that the victim had a trace amount of methadone in his blood at the time of the accident. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. Evidence indicated that the victim was pronounced dead moments after his arrival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>at a hospital, less than thirty minutes after the crash. Prior to the commencement of trial, the court held a hearing on the state\u2019s motion in limine to preclude evidence that a trace amount of methadone was detected in the victim\u2019s blood at the autopsy. In support of its motion, the state presented the testimony of Sherwood Lewis, the director of toxicology for the office of the chief medical examiner, who holds advanced degrees in microbiology and molecular biology. He testified that a trace amount of methadone represents an extremely small amount, \u201c[s]o low in fact that we do not attempt to quantify.\u201d Lewis testified that methadone is used to replace the need for the opiate heroin pharma-cologically and that unlike heroin, methadone does not cause a high.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He arrived at no conclusion as an analytical toxicologist as to the effect methadone might have had on the reflexes or impairment of the victim. This was not his area of expertise. Lewis could offer no opinion as to what effect a trace amount of methadone would have in the operation of a motor vehicle or motorcycle in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The court found that Lewis claimed to have no expertise as to the impairment effect of a trace of methadone. As to the reference in the autopsy report to a trace amount of methadone, the court required that the effects of a trace amount of methadone on motor skills or judgment must be shown by testimony from a qualified expert. The court granted the motion to preclude that evidence but stated that it would consider any evidence that the defendant could present to show the effect of the trace amount of methadone on a driver\u2019s impairment. At this, defense counsel stated that \u201c[ tjhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>is no percentage whatsoever that anybody could testify to as to whether [it] did or did not impair the ability of this particular driver.\u201d Defense counsel also stated he did not \u201cknow that anybody could testify to that.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the first day of trial, the court asked the defendant if he had a witness \u201cwith respect to the issue of . . . methadone.\u201d The defendant responded that he did not. The matter never again was revisited.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that the court should have allowed the jury to consider the victim\u2019s having had a trace of methadone in his blood upon autopsy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>without testimony as to the effect of the drug on the victim\u2019s ability to operate the motorcycle. He cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 146, 869 A.2d 192 (2005), in support of this claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In <em>Padua, </em>our Supreme Court held that the effects of marijuana were sufficiently well known to support a finding of risk of injury to a child from exposure of the drug to young children who might consume the drug in the absence of expert evidence as to the effect of consuming marijuana. Id., 157. In the present case, the effect of a trace amount of methadone on the victim would be relevant only if that trace amount affected the victim\u2019s ability to operate a motorcycle. Defense counsel's concession that impairment from an unknown amount of methadone could not be determined by a witness supports the court\u2019s ruling. Also, unlike the effects of marijuana, the effects of a trace amount of methadone on driving impairment is not a matter of common knowledge, experience and common sense; therefore, expert evidence would be required.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>v. <em>Scruggs, </em>279 Conn. 698, 715-16, 905 A.2d 24 (2006). Last, we conclude that the exclusion of the methadone evidence did not prejudice the defendant because there was no evidence that any impairment could constitute an independent and intervening cause of the collision. See parts I A and B of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> Joel Milzoff, a toxicology expert with the department of public safety, testified that in his opinion, a person with the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content typically experienced an impairment of visual acuity or perception, balance, reflexes, responsiveness and judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. <em>\u201cGolding\u2019s </em>first two prongs relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>95 Conn.

We conclude that plain error review is not warranted in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> We note that the trial transcript reveals that the court, after a charging conference, prepared a written draft of the charge. The parties were given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>a copy of the draft the next morning, and a meeting then was held with the court in which the parties agreed on a change in the written draft not pertaining to any issue in this appeal. The remaining charge was found to be acceptable to both the state and the defendant. When the court inquired on the record, the defendant, along with the state, stated that he accepted the charge as drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>279 Conn. 39, 55, 901 A.2d 1 (2006), our Supreme Court observed that parties should be encouraged to raise claims in a timely manner when it is not too late for the trial court to address the claim. In this case, the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the draft instructions under the circumstances has attributes similar to claims that the court has rejected under the doctrine of induced error, that is, \u201c[a]n error that a party cannot complain of on appeal because the party, through conduct, encouraged or prompted the trial court to make the erroneous ruling. . . . This principle bars appellate review of induced nonconstitutional error and induced constitutional error.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

First, that the defendant caused the death of Christopher Tanych while operating a motor vehicle. . . . The state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of Christopher Tanych was caused by the accused while operating a motor vehicle. . . . The state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the death of Christopher Tanych. Proximate cause does not necessarily mean the last act or cause or . . . the act in point of time nearest to the death of Christopher Tanych. The concept of proximate cause incorporates the notion that an accused may be charged with a criminal offense, even though his acts were not the immediate cause of the death of Christopher Tanych. . . . [A]n act or an omission to act is a proximate cause of the death of Christopher Tanych if it substantially and materially contributes in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken by an efficient intervening cause to the death of Christopher Tanych. It is a cause without which the death of Christopher Tanych would not have occurred. And a predominating cause. A substantial factor from which the death of Christopher Tanych follows as a natural, direct and immediate consequence. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>does not matter whether this particular kind of harm that results from the defendant\u2019s act was intended by the defendant. When the death of Christopher Tanych was caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct, a foreseeable and natural result of that conduct, the law considers the chain of legal causation unbroken and holds the defendant criminally responsible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> The jury instruction on the crime of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle was as follows: \u201cThe defendant is charged with the crime of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-224 (a) . . . which provides as follows. Each person operating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes serious physical injury or results in the death of any other person shall at once stop and render such assistance as may be needed and shall give his name, address and . . . operator license number and registration number to the person injured or to any officer or witness to the death or serious physical injury. Or if any such operator of the motor vehicle causing the death or serious injury of any person is unable to give his name, address and operator\u2019s license number and registration number to the person injured or to any witness or officer for any reason or cause, such operator shall immediately report such death or serious physical injury of any such person to a police officer, a constable, a state police officer or an inspector of motor vehicles or at the nearest police precinct or station, and shall state in such report the location and circumstance of the accident causing the death or serious physical injury of any person and his name, address, operator\u2019s license number and registration number.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

The defendant failed to stop at once and rendered such assistance as may be needed and, or, failed to give his name, address or operator\u2019s number and registration number to the person injured or to any officer or witness to the death or physical injury, or if he was prevented [by] any cause from doing so, that he immediately reported such death or serious physical injury to any person or police officer, constable, state police officer or inspector of motor vehicles or at the nearest police precinct or station, and that in such report stated the location, circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>accident causing the death or serious physical injury of any such person and his name, address, operator\u2019s license number and registration number.</p>\n<p id=\"AE4P\">\u201cThe state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was operating a motor vehicle which was involved in the accident and that the accused knew he was involved in an accident. With regard to the second element, the state must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the accident resulted in the death of a person or serious physical injury. With respect to the final element, the state must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused failed to stop and render such assistance as may be needed or to provide the injured party or an officer or witness to the accident with information concerning his identity or if he was unable to do so, that he immediately reported such death or serious physical injury to a police officer, constable, state police officer or inspector of motor vehicles or at the nearest police precinct or station.</p>\n<p id=\"ApM\">\u201cIf you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of these elements of the crimes of evasion of responsibilities, then you shall find the defendant guilty.

It\u2019s a question as to whether the probative value of it outweighs\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">\u201cThe Court: No, this ... is a question of relevancy. . . .

There is no percentage whatsoever that anybody could testily as to whether he did or did not impair the ability of this particular driver. I don\u2019t know that anybody could testify to that. I do know that to the extent of what the general effect\u2014one does not know whether it is coming up from something, coming down from something and how it affects that individual because we don\u2019t know the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [T]he effects of alcohol upon the operator of a motor vehicle is within the common knowledge of, I think, a jury. I think that that is something that they can take. I don\u2019t know myself, and I don\u2019t think the average juror has any notion as to whether methadone affects motor skills or judgment or anything of that nature. I surely don\u2019t know that.</p>\n<p id=\"Azg\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, to the extent that our legislature has created a separate crime for driving under the influence of drugs without specifying, going into specificity that alcohol has\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">\u201cThe Court: I agree. But is methadone a drug that can influence somebody?</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: Well, if heroin can, and it\u2019s an opiate, then methadone can as well. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"aoh-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: ... I don\u2019t follow that logic at all. And I think you\u2019re going to have to show that. Maybe a physician can\u2014a pharmacologist or someone of that nature perhaps can supply that information. But I think the reasoning that because in certain instances methadone replaces heroin, it must necessarily mimic it in all respects I think is a leap that I think you\u2019re going to be inviting the court, to take and the jury to take that\u2019s inappropriate. I think you\u2019re going to have to tie it in with some evidence if you want to get it before the jury. Otherwise it\u2019s irrelevant. . . . It\u2019s out until you connect it to something.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> The differing conclusions among various medical and governmental resources further support the court\u2019s conclusion that driver impairment from a trace amount of methadone is beyond the ken of the average juror.
