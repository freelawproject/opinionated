The victim, a fourteen year old high school freshman, resided across the street from the defendant\u2019s family and knew the defendant as her boyfriend\u2019s father. On the evening of November 29, 2000, the victim encountered the defendant standing outside his apartment building. He called her over, ostensibly for the purpose of talking to her about his son. The victim followed the defendant into an apartment rented by the defendant\u2019s sister, which was vacant but for a mattress in the middle of the living room. The defendant positioned himself between the victim and the front door and asked her what she would do if he kissed her, to which the victim replied, \u201cstop playing, Mike.\u201d The defendant then proceeded to kiss the victim and to remove her jacket, her pants and her underpants. The victim testified that she did not want this to happen but that she did not fight the defendant or try to stop him because she was very frightened. The defendant laid the victim on the mattress and had sexual intercourse with her. The victim said no, told the defendant that it hurt her and told him to stop, but he did not stop. She could not move because the defendant overpowered her with his weight. After the defendant was finished, he walked the victim to the door and said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cyou aren\u2019t going to tell anybody, right?\u201d The victim returned home and called the defendant\u2019s son. She also told her best friend, T, other friends at school and, eventually, the school authorities, including the police officer at her school. Thereafter, the state charged the defendant with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). On May 26, 2004, the state filed a substitute part B information charging the defendant with being a persistent serious felony offender as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In June, 2004, the jury found the defendant not guilty of sexual assault in the first degree but guilty of sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child. Following the jury verdict, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the part B information, which was conditioned on his right to challenge the underlying conviction. On August 23, 2004, the court, <em>Cremins, J., </em>rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of twenty-four years imprisonment followed by ten years special probation and lifetime registration as a sex offender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant raises two instructional claims. \u201cWhen reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety . . . and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>269 Conn. 481, 488, 849 A.2d 760 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of sexual assault in the second degree as a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The defendant was charged by substitute long form information with one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2). With respect to the first count, the information charged that the defendant had \u201cengaged in sexual intercourse, to wit: vaginal intercourse, with another person, by the use or threat of use of force against such other person which reasonably caused such person to fear physical injury to such person . . . .\u201d With respect to the second count, the information charged that the defendant \u201chad contact with the intimate parts of a child under the age of sixteen years, or subjected a child under sixteen years of age to contact with his intimate parts, in a sexual or indecent manner likely to impair the health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>or morals of such child . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the close of evidence, the state filed a request to charge on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the second degree, which the court granted. During its final argument, the state presented the lesser included offense as an alternative to sexual assault in the first degree, to which defense counsel did not object. The court then instructed the jury on sexual assault in the second degree, to which defense counsel did not take an exception. The jury ultimately found the defendant not guilty of sexual assault in the first degree but found him guilty of sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Although the defendant concedes that his claim is unpreserved, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree that the claim is reviewable because the record is adequate, and if the defendant was convicted of a crime for which he was not given proper notice, he was deprived of due process of law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>266 Conn. 608, 616, 835 A.2d 12 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The question of whether sexual assault in the second degree is a lesser offense included within the crime of sexual assault in the first degree is a question of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and therefore subject to de novo review. Id., 615-16. We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by reviewing the law regarding lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cA criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>76 Conn. App. 779, 787, 821 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 826 A.2d 1160 (2003); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>82 Conn. App. 691, 695, 846 A.2d 926, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 902, 853 A.2d 521 (2004). This notice is accomplished through the state\u2019s charging documents and, particularly, the information. \u201cThe information serves the very important function of informing the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation as required by our federal and state constitutions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 787. A court, however, may instruct the jury to consider lesser included offenses of crimes alleged in the charging document because it is assumed that \u201cwhe[n] one or more offenses are lesser than and included within the crime charged, notice of the crime charged includes notice of all lesser included offenses. . . . This notice permits each party to prepare a case properly, each cognizant of its burden of proof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>supra, 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The test governing lesser included offenses is well settled. For one offense to be included within another, it must not be \u201cpossible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>274 Conn. 134, 158, 874 A.2d 750 (2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926, 126 S. Ct. 2981, 165 L. Ed. 2d 988 (2006). This inquiry is governed by the cognate pleadings approach. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>supra, 266 Conn. 618. \u201cThe cognate-pleadings approach . . . does not insist that the elements of the lesser offense be a subset of the higher offense. It is sufficient, that the lesser offense have certain elements in common with the higher offense, which thereby makes it a cognate or allied offense even though it also has other elements not essential to the greater crime. [In addition], the relationship between the offenses is determined not by a comparison of statutory elements in the abstract, but by reference to the pleadings in the case. The key ordinarily is whether the allegations in the pleading charging the higher offense . . . include all of the elements of the lesser offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant argues that sexual assault in the second degree is not a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree because each crime requires proof of an element that the other does not. Sexual assault in the first degree requires that sexual intercourse be accomplished by force or threat of force but has no age requirement for the victim. Sexual assault in the second degree does not require force or threat of force but does require that the victim be between the ages of thirteen and sixteen years at the time of the offense and further requires that the accused be more than two years older than the victim. The state responds that this court should consider the second count of the information, charging the defendant with risk of injuiy to a child. According to the state, because this count requires the victim to be younger than sixteen years of age, the defendant was on notice as to the additional element of sexual assault in the second degree. We agree with the defendant that in this case, sexual assault in the second degree was not a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cThe crime of sexual assault in the second degree is an offense separate and distinct from sexual assault in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the first degree.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 495, 508 A.2d 22 (1986). Consequently, we turn to the information and bill of particulars to determine whether it would be possible to commit sexual assault in the first degree <em>in the manner described </em>in those documents, without necessarily committing sexual assault in the second degree. The state\u2019s first count on the long form information simply charged the defendant with accomplishing sexual intercourse by use or threat of force. It neither identified the victim nor referenced her age. Because age is an element of sexual assault in the second degree but not of sexual assault in the first degree, the defendant clearly could have accomplished the latter without committing the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The state asks us to overrule our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>39 Conn. App. 224, 665 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 924, 666 A.2d 1187 (1995), and look to the other counts alleged in the information to determine whether the defendant had adequate notice of the charges against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We decline the state\u2019s invitation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In <em>Guess, </em>the defendant was charged with, inter alia, murder and carrying a pistol without a permit. The court instructed the jury that it could consider the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. Id., 226. On appeal, we raised the question, sua sponte, whether that instruction constituted a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to notice of the charges against him. Id., 236. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>argued that the defendant had sufficient notice to be convicted of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm because of the other counts in the information, which referred to the firing of gunshots from a handgun. Id., 237. We held that although the defendant may have been alerted to the possible presentation of evidence at trial regarding the use of a firearm, the mention of a firearm in a different count of the information was insufficient notice that he could have been convicted of manslaughter with a firearm. Id., 238. Our decision that sexual assault in the second degree cannot be a lesser offense included within sexual assault in the first degree in this case is consistent with Connecticut case law, which reveals a reluctance to find different degrees of sexual assault to be lesser included offenses of one another. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ciotti, </em>174 Conn. 336, 338, 387 A.2d 546 (1978), our Supreme Court held in a per curiam decision that sexual assault in the second degree is not a lesser included offense of sexual assault in the first degree when the information does not allege the age of the victim or the defendant because each crime contains elements that the other does not. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 494 (holding that sexual assault in second degree not lesser offense included within sexual assault in first degree because it is possible to commit one without necessarily committing other); <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>76 Conn. App. 515, 551, 820 A.2d 1076 (holding that sexual assault in third and fourth degrees not lesser included offenses of sexual assault in first degree because they contain additional elements), cert. denied, 264 Conn. 908, 826 A.2d 178 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim is also consistent with our case law regarding lesser offenses included within other crimes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>26 Conn. App. 259, 266, 600 A.2d 1364 (1991) (manslaughter in first degree with firearm cannot be lesser offense included within murder when no reference to firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>or shooting in charging documents), cert. denied, 221 Conn. 911, 602 A.2d 10 (1992); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomlin, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 614 (conviction of manslaughter in first degree with firearm appropriate lesser offense included within murder when information alleged defendant \u201cdid shoot and cause the death of [the victim]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Finally, strong considerations of due process undeipin our decision. Only when the state\u2019s pleadings have \u201cinformed the defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and [are] definite enough to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense\u201d has the state performed its duty under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 381, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). A conviction of sexual assault in the second degree as a lesser offense included within the count of sexual assault in the first degree, without the age of the victim being alleged in that count of the charging documents, deprived the defendant of the opportunity to mount a defense to the very crime for which he was ultimately convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We are mindful of the fact that defense counsel neither objected nor took an exception to the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the second degree. Nevertheless, we conclude that the instructional error was not harmless. Because the elements of the crimes are markedly different, we cannot say that had the defendant been afforded proper notice of his exposure to the charge of sexual assault in the second degree, the defense would have employed the same strategy as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>did and the conviction would have ensued. Consequently, the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s instruction on sexual assault in the second degree was a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial and that the defendant was clearly harmed by this violation. Consequently, the defendant has satisfied the <em>Golding </em>standard and is entitled to relief. We therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of sexual assault in the second degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the charge of risk of injury to a child. The defendant contends that the court improperly defined the word \u201clikely\u201d in the term \u201clikely to impair the health or morals of a minor child, \u201d as \u201cin all probability or possibility.\u201d The state concedes that the term \u201cpossibly\u201d is an incorrect definition of \u201clikely.\u201d It asserts, however, that the jury was not misled by the instruction on risk of injury to a child. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Defense counsel did not object or take an exception to the court\u2019s instruction. We therefore review his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, because the record is adequate for review, and the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the jury as to an element of a charged offense is of constitutional dimension. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">This court, as well as our Supreme Court, has concluded that such a jury instruction is incorrect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 489-92; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>85 Conn. App. 575, 605, 858 A.2d 296 (2004), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 280 Conn. 36, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006). The state concedes that the jury instruction in this case was similarly incorrect. Thus, our only inquiry is whether, under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong, it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 488. \u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury ... is to be considered . . . as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorabella, </em>277 Conn. 155, 891 A.2d 897, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 821, 127 S. Ct. 131, 166 L. Ed. 2d 36 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Considering the charge as a whole, we first note that the court\u2019s improper definition of the term \u201clikely\u201d as \u201cpossible\u201d was also accompanied by the proper definition of the term as \u201cprobable.\u201d As our Supreme Court has concluded, such \u201caccurate instructions [minimize] the potential harm flowing from the trial court\u2019s improper instructions on the meaning of the term \u2018likely.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Moreover, in finding the defendant guilty of risk of injury to a child, the jury necessarily found that the defendant had had contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts in a sexual and indecent manner or that the defendant subjected the victim to contact with his intimate parts. In its instruction to the jury, the court broke down the risk of injury charge to three elements: (1) the victim was younger than the age of sixteen at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>time of the criminal acts; (2) the defendant had contact with the victim\u2019s intimate parts or subjected the victim to contact with the defendant\u2019s intimate parts; and (3) such contact with intimate parts took place in a sexual and indecent manner that was likely to impair the victim\u2019s health or morals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court also thoroughly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>explained the concept of reasonable doubt and the state\u2019s burden of proving each element of each charge beyond all reasonable doubt. The defendant challenges only the second half of the third element of the charge, in which the term \u201clikely\u201d was defined. The defendant does not challenge the remainder of the risk of injury charge, including that the contact with the intimate parts of the victim or defendant must have occurred in a sexual and indecent manner. Given the unchallenged propriety of these instructions, we may rely on the jury\u2019s duly reached conclusion that sexual or indecent contact between the defendant and the victim took place. See <em>State </em>v. Romero, supra, 269 Conn. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s indecent sexual conduct in relation to the victim, conduct the jury found to have occurred, must be conduct that is \u201clikely to impair\u201d the health or morals of a child. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 493 (\u201c[o]nce the jury determined that . . . intercourse and mutual sexual touching took place, as described by [the victim], it is difficult to imagine a finding that this conduct could <em>not </em>be deemed likely \u2014 in the context of probably \u2014 to impair [the victim\u2019s] morals\u201d [emphasis in original]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 605 (\u201cbecause the jury . . . found the defendant guilty of having sexually assaulted the victim, we find no basis for any argument that the jury could have been uncertain that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>an assault did, in fact, impair the child, as alleged in the risk of injury charge\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the jury could not reasonably have been misled and, accordingly, the defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The defendant next raises two evidentiary claims. Our standard of review of evidentiary claims is well settled. \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 811, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The defendant\u2019s first evidentiary claim is that the court improperly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct that was not substantially similar to the offense charged and was therefore unduly prejudicial. Although we agree with the defendant that the challenged testimony was admitted improperly, we conclude that its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine notifying the court of its intention to call T, a close friend of the victim. T was expected to testify that on the night of the assault, the defendant had made overtures to her similar to those he had made to the victim and that on a prior occasion, he had placed his hands up the back of her blouse. The court allowed the testimony, over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s objection, to prove intent, motive and a pattern of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">At trial, T testified that she had encountered the defendant on the night of the assault and that he had asked her for a hug, so she hugged him. She stated that she had also done so in the past. She added, after the court allowed the state to refresh her recollection, that the defendant had rubbed her back in the past. The court did not allow her to testify about \u201chow he rubbed her back.\u201d The court gave a limiting instruction to the jury on the proper use of prior misconduct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. . . . On the other hand, evidence of crimes so connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime, is admissible. . . . We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence. First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. . . . Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Evidence offered to prove a common plan or scheme constitutes an exception to the general rule against admitting prior misconduct evidence. See id. To be admissible under the common scheme exception, \u201cthe marks which the . . . charged [and uncharged] offenses have in common must be such that it may be logically inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>he must be guilty of the other. ... In order to assess the defendant\u2019s claim, we must examine the [prior uncharged misconduct] evidence and compare it to the charged offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 661-62, 835 A.2d 895 (2003). Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]o guide this analysis . . . [e]vidence of <em>prior sex offenses </em>committed with persons other than the prosecuting witness is admissible to show a common design or plan whe[n] the prior offenses (1) are not too remote in time; (2) are similar to the offense charged; and (3) are committed upon persons similar to the prosecuting witness. . . . We are more liberal in admitting evidence of other criminal acts to show a common scheme or pattern in [trials of] sex related crimes than [in trials of] other crimes.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The defendant concedes that T was approximately the same age as the victim and that the act of hugging her occurred on the same day as the alleged sexual assault. The defendant argues, however, that the act of hugging a young girl or rubbing her back is not similar conduct to the alleged sexual assault. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Although the state would have us find T\u2019s testimony admissible because it revealed that the defendant had made overtures to T that were similar to those made to the victim, we are not persuaded. We have previously held that evidence of prior misconduct that is not sexual misconduct is not sufficiently similar to the offense of sexual assault to be admissible. See State v. <em>Jacobson, </em>87 Conn. App. 440, 454, 866 A.2d 678, cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 928, 873 A.2d 999 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In <em>Jacobson, </em>a sexual abuse case, the court allowed a witness to testify that the defendant had maintained a relationship with her son very similar to the one alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>between the defendant and the victims. Id., 452-53. On appeal, this court found that the admission of that testimony was improper because of the \u201ccrucial difference\u201d that the witness did not claim that the defendant had actually sexually abused her son. Id., 454. \u201cThat said, it cannot be inferred logically that if the defendant was guilty of the uncharged misconduct, he also must have been guilty of the charged offenses involving [the victims].\u201d Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the court improperly admitted T\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Our inquiry does not end with a finding of an improper evidentiary ruling. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 352, 904 A.2d 101 (2006). Our Supreme Court recently clarified the standard for harmless error review of erroneous evidentiary rulings in the context of criminal cases. \u201c[A] nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201c[W]hether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... [In a case that] involves the improper admission of uncharged misconduct evidence, the most relevant factors to be considered are the strength of the state\u2019s case and the impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>improperly admitted evidence on the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 358. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>supra, 87 Conn. App. 454-55, we held that the improper admission of prior misconduct was harmless because it was not voluminous and did not contain any allegation of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">T\u2019s testimony was not the mainstay of the prosecution\u2019s case. It played a minor role in the state\u2019s evidence, was mentioned only once during rebuttal and was referenced in the state\u2019s closing argument only for constancy of accusation. Moreover, there was no allegation that the defendant actually assaulted T or committed any other act upon her so extreme that the jury might be prejudiced. Furthermore, to the extent that T\u2019s testimony was admitted to show the defendant\u2019s common scheme to force teenage girls to have intercourse with him, its admission was harmless, as the defendant was acquitted of sexual assault in the first degree. Therefore, we have a fair assurance that the testimony did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence hospital records containing statements that might have misled the jury into believing that the examining physician had concluded, as an expert medical opinion, that the victim was sexually assaulted. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to the testimony of Susan Dibs, the attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital on the day of the victim\u2019s medical examination, defense counsel objected to the admission of portions of the hospital report. The defendant argued that under the entry, \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d the reference to \u201csexual assault\u201d amounted to an expert conclusion. He further argued that under the heading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cassessment,\u201d the report stated, \u201csexual assault,\u201d and that this, too, was conclusive as an expert opinion. The state responded that the report was admissible as an ordinary medical record containing the statement of someone seeking treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The court reviewed the report and redacted any references to the identity of the perpetrator. The victim\u2019s statements that she was assaulted, however, were left in the report. The redacted report was admitted during Dibs\u2019 testimony. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dibs about the reference to sexual assault under the heading \u201cassessment.\u201d Dibs confirmed that she had merely recorded what the victim had told her. She also reiterated her prior testimony, given on direct examination, that the victim\u2019s medical examination did not reveal signs of sexual assault. The court gave the jury a limiting instruction as to the permissible consideration of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements to other persons.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cIt is well settled that out-of-court statements made by a patient to a physician for the purposes of obtaining medical diagnosis and treatment are admissible under the treating physician exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>William B., </em>76 Conn. App. 730, 739, 822 A.2d 265, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 828 A.2d 618 (2003). Ordinarily, an expert witness may not express an opinion on an ultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>issue of fact, which must be decided by the trier of fact. Nonetheless, \u201c[a] physician, who is consulted by a patient for the purpose of obtaining from her [or him] professional medical treatment or advice incidental thereto, may testify to her [or his] opinion even though it is based, in whole or in part, on statements made . . . by the patient, and, <em>of course, she [or he] may also testify to such statements.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 44, 770 A.2d 908 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The defendant argues that the medical report imper-missibly gave an opinion as to whether a sexual assault had in fact occurred and that as a result, the report was highly prejudicial to him. The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>275 Conn. 624, 881 A.2d 1005 (2005). In that case, the examining physician offered an actual diagnosis, both within her unredacted written report and in her oral testimony, that sexual assault had occurred. Our Supreme Court ruled that such evidence was inadmissible because it was based in part on the victim\u2019s own account, it endorsed the very credibility the jury was to determine and \u201cfunctioned as an opinion as to whether the victim\u2019s claims were truthful.\u201d Id., 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The present case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Iban C. </em>In this case, no diagnosis was offered as to whether a sexual assault had occurred. The state did not present the hospital record for the purpose of providing an expert conclusion but merely as a means of corroborating the victim\u2019s size at the time of the assault and as a recording of the victim\u2019s account of what had happened. Dibs made clear through her testimony that the statements in question were merely recordings of the victim\u2019s statements and not her own conclusions. She also stated on direct examination, and reiterated on cross-examination, that there was no medical proof of sexual assault. Thus, any impermissible inferences the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>might have drawn were remedied by Dibs\u2019 explicit in-court testimony and by the court\u2019s limiting instruction. As a result, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the redacted hospital records into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the conviction of sexual assault in the second degree and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty as to that offense only. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...

Under this standard, a conviction based on a challenged information is valid unless the information is \u201cso obviously defective that by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

We decline, however, to address this issue without the benefit of adequate briefing and argument. See <em>State v.

There need not be a touching of all the intimate parts. It is sufficient if any one of the intimate parts is touched. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u201c[T]he state must prove that the contact with the intimate parts took place in a sexual and indecent manner, which was likely to impair the health or morals of the child.
