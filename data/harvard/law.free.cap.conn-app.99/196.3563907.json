We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">At the conclusion of trial, the court found the following facts. \u201cOn or about March 10, 2001, members of the Stamford police department were conducting a surveillance related to . . . suspected narcotics activity near the intersection of Sellick and Orchard Streets in Stamford, which is near the Southfield Village housing complex [Southfield Village]. [A]t that time, an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>. . . approached Officer [Timothy] Shaw, who was in an unmarked car in plain clothes working in an undercover capacity. . . . [T]his individual was later determined to be, and the court finds, was in fact the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cThe defendant offered to sell Officer Shaw a quantity of narcotics. Shaw gave the defendant money to go get . . . the drugs. Shaw held the defendant\u2019s license, which was given to him by the defendant apparently as a gesture that the defendant would in fact return with the drugs. The defendant did in fact return just a short time later with the narcotics, crack cocaine, which he gave to Shaw. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201cShaw made also an in-court identification of the defendant as the person who delivered the drugs to him. The drugs later were tested and found to be crack cocaine, a narcotic. The approximate weight was about .17 grams. Also, the activity described occurred within 1500 feet of Southfield Village ... a public housing project, within the meaning of that phrase under our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cFinally, the defendant has offered evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offense, and the court finds after considering the evidence, including the testimony and report of Dr. Jeremy August, that the defendant has in fact established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Accordingly, the court found the defendant guilty of possession of narcotics and sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a public housing project. Because it found that the defendant was a drug-dependent person, the court found him not guilty of the charge of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), instead finding him guilty of the lesser included offense of sale of narcotics in violation \u00a7 21a-277 (a). The court thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of nine years incarceration, followed by five years of special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Southfield Village is a public housing project. \u201cIn reviewing claims of insufficiency, we first review the evidence presented at trial and construe it in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt. . . . We then look at the facts established at trial and the reasonable inferences drawn from those facts and decide whether the court could have reasonably concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Our standard in reviewing the conclusions of the trier of fact is limited. . . . We will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s judgment and will affirm the court\u2019s conclusions if reasonably supported by the evidence and logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u201cThe question on appeal is not whether we believe that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the judgment, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We give deference to the unique opportunity of the trier of fact to observe the conduct, demeanor and attitude of the trial witnesses and to assess their credibility. . . . The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to great weight . . . but those findings are not conclusive.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>41 Conn. App. 333, 337-38, 675 A.2d 925 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">At trial, the court heard the testimony of Shaw. Four times during his testimony, Shaw stated that Southfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Village is a public housing project. The defendant made no objection to Shaw\u2019s testimony, nor did he request an offer of proof as to Shaw\u2019s qualifications to so testify. He likewise did not cross-examine Shaw as to the statement that Southfield Village was a public housing project. As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffreys, </em>78 Conn. App. 659, 681, 828 A.2d 659, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 913, 833 A.2d 465 (2003), the court thus \u201chad before it an unchallenged affirmative statement that the apartment complex at issue was a public housing project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The court also heard the testimony of Steven DeVito of the Stamford housing authority. DeVito testified repeatedly that Southfield Village is a public housing project and that it was owned and operated by the Stamford housing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The defendant argues on appeal that DeVito opined that Southfield Village was operated by a for-profit management coiporation. During cross-examination, DeVito testified otherwise. In response to defense counsel\u2019s query as to whether DeVito had testified that South-field Village was <em>operated </em>by a private management company, DeVito stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t. If I said operated by, that was a mistake. It is managed day to day by a for-profit company.\u201d DeVito maintained that Southfield Village was operated by the Stamford housing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The defendant also refers to DeVito\u2019s testimony that Southfield Village is \u201ca mixture of market rate and low income\u201d as conclusive evidence that the property is not a public housing project. General Statutes \u00a7 8-39 (i) defines \u201chousing project\u201d in relevant part as \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary urban or rural dwellings, apartments or other living accommodations for families of low or moderate income . . . .\u201d Although \u00a7 8-39 (i) requires a housing project to provide living accommodations for families of low or moderate income, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>expressly require that one must provide such accommodations <em>exclusively </em>for families of low or moderate income. The defendant has provided this court with no authority or analysis indicating otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is well established that analysis, rather than abstract assertion, of claims is a prerequisite to appellate review. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pink, </em>274 Conn. 241, 256, 875 A.2d 447 (2005); <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>95 Conn. App. 436, 452, 897 A.2d 624, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 933, 909 A.2d 963 (2006). Moreover, DeVito, aware of the \u201cmixture of market rate and low income\u201d at Southfield Village, nevertheless testified that it was a public housing project.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the judgment, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination that Southfield Village is a public housing project is reasonably supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The defendant next contends that his conviction under \u00a7 21a-278a (b) violates his right to equal protection because it does not exempt persons who are drug-dependent from receiving a mandatory minimum sentence as do other similar provisions of our Penal Code. The record before us reveals that the defendant never presented that claim to the trial court. \u201cConnecticut law is clear that a party seeking review of unpreserved claims under either the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; or <em>State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), must affirmatively request such review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wheatland, </em>93 Conn. App. 232, 243-44, 888 A.2d 1098, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 919, 895 A.2d 793 (2006). The defendant has not done so in the present case. His claim, therefore, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who possesses or has under his control any quantity of any narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, may be imprisoned not more than seven years or be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) provides: \u201cAny person who violates section 21a-277 or 21a-278 by manufacturing, distributing, selling, prescribing, dispensing, compounding, transporting with the intent to sell or dispense, possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, giving or administering to another person any controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school, a public housing project or a licensed child day care center, as defined in section 19a-77, that is identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place shall be imprisoned for a term of three years, which shall not be suspended and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of section 21a-277 or 21a-278.
