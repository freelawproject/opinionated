J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">The petitioner, Charles Coleman, appeals following the habeas court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by (1) denying his petition for certification to appeal, which challenged the habeas court\u2019s order allowing his attorney to withdraw over his objections, and (2) granting his attorney\u2019s motion for permission to withdraw. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \u201cFollowing a court trial, the [petitioner] was convicted of four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102, unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a), and robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-136 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and 53a-133. The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the [petitioner] to an effective term of imprisonment of 110 years.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>242 Conn. 523, 525-26, 700 A.2d 14 (1997). The petitioner\u2019s conviction of burglary in the second degree was later vacated. Id., 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The petitioner subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he claimed that his trial attorney, Thomas E. Farver, did not prepare for trial and withheld material evidence at trial. The habeas court, <em>Zarella, J., </em>appointed Kathleen O\u2019Reilly Berry as the petitioner\u2019s special public defender in the habeas proceedings. Thereafter, Berry filed a motion to withdraw from the case, pursuant to the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 23-41,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s claims were frivolous. Berry included with the motion to withdraw a memorandum of law pursuant to <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967). On March 6, 2002, the habeas court, <em>Levine, J., </em>found the petitioner\u2019s claims to be wholly without merit and granted the motion to withdraw. The habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>court, however, did not dismiss the habeas petition. Rather, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-42 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the case proceeded with the petitioner acting pro se. The petitioner\u2019s subsequent written and oral motions for the appointment of counsel were denied. The petitioner filed an amended petition, and the case proceeded to a hearing on the merits. At the conclusion of the hearing, the habeas court, <em>White, J., </em>dismissed the petition. Judge White subsequently denied the petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We begin by noting our standard of review. \u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is the proper standard because that is the standard to which we have held other litigants whose rights to appeal the legislature has conditioned upon the obtaining of the trial court\u2019s permission. . . . If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). In order for us to conclude that the habeas court abused its discretion, the petitioner first must demonstrate \u201cthat the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court <em>could </em>resolve the issues [in a different, manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 616, quoting <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Applying these principles, the petitioner argues that the issues regarding the reviewability of a decision granting a motion to withdraw under Practice Book \u00a7 23-41, thereby depriving a habeas petitioner of his statutory right to counsel, are debatable among jurists of reason and, therefore, are worthy of review by this court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The issues raised in the present appeal are almost identical to the issues raised by the petitioner in <em>Coleman v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 422, 876 A.2d 533 (2005) <em>(Coleman I). </em>In that case, the petitioner brought a habeas petition in which he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to a criminal conviction following a jury trial on similar yet unrelated charges. In both <em>Coleman I </em>and the present case, Berry was appointed as the petitioner\u2019s special public defender. In both cases, Judge Levine permitted Berry to withdraw as counsel, and the cases proceeded to trial on the merits. Although <em>Coleman I </em>and the present case never were consolidated, they were tried together, following which Judge White denied both habeas petitions. In <em>Coleman I, </em>the petitioner argued on appeal that \u201cthe habeas court, <em>White, J., </em>abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus because he was denied his constitutional right to counsel at the habeas proceeding when Berry was allowed to withdraw. He further claimfed] that the habeas court, <em>Levine, J., </em>abused its discretion in granting the motion to withdraw.\u201d Id., 425. Our Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal as frivolous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The petitioner attempts to distinguish the present case from <em>Coleman I </em>on the grounds that the present case involves a different underlying trial record, a different crime scene officer and different representations made by Berry about her investigation of the case. We conclude, however, that the issues and arguments raised in the present appeal are not distinguishable significantly from those raised in <em>Coleman I. </em>We, therefore, are persuaded that the present appeal should be dismissed, as was the appeal in <em>Coleman I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 23-41, entitled \u201cMotion for Leave to Withdraw Appearance of Appointed Counsel,\u201d provides: \u201c(a) When counsel has been appointedpursuant to Section 23-26, and counsel, after conscientious investigation and examination of the case, concludes that the case is wholly frivolous, counsel shall so advise the judicial authority by filing a motion for leave to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u201c(b) Any motion for leave to withdraw shall be filed under seal and provided to the petitioner.

If the petition is not dismissed, the judge ruling on the motion to withdraw as counsel shall not preside at any subsequent hearing on the merits of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\"> The opinion in <em>Coleman I </em>states: \u201cAfter a careful review of the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues he has raised are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed as frivolous.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 426.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
