Boysaw, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to correct the sex offender registration requirement of his criminal conviction. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to correct the requirement that he register as a sex offender because his registration is not required under the current law. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. On February 28, 1997, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21 (2), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-142, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for having engaged in a sexual relationship with his fifteen year old girlfriend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was eighteen years old at the time. He was sentenced to one year incarceration, execution suspended, and three years of probation. Subsequently, the defendant was informed that he was required to register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant filed an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>exemption from sex offender registration requirements<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-251.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to correct, which was denied by the court. In articulating its decision, the court stated that its decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to correct was based on the registration statute in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s conviction, General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 54-102r,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as the current sex offender registration law as stated in Public Acts 1998, No. 98-111, \u00a7 (3) (b) (P.A. 98-lll).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly relied on General Statutes \u00a7 54-252 (b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in denying his motion to correct because under the current registration statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-250 et seq., he is not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>to register. Specifically, the defendant contends that \u00a7 54-251 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which applies to persons convicted of committing a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor, is the applicable registration statute because the offense of which he was convicted, risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2), is considered such an offense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argues that under \u00a7 54-251 (a) only persons released into the community on or after October 1, 1998, are required to register and that, therefore, he is not required to register pursuant to the statute because he was released into the community in 1997 when he received a suspended sentence and probation. The state counters that the defendant is required to register pursuant to the statute in effect at the time of his conviction, \u00a7 54-102r. The state further asserts that the defendant\u2019s registration is authorized under \u00a7 54-252 (b) of the current sex offender registration statute because that statutory subsection specifically requires registration of those persons previously subject to the registration requirements of \u00a7 54-102r. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tarnowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287, 856 A.2d 408 (2004). \u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory construction is that statutes are to be considered to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body. . . . The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. [General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 129, 848 A.2d 451 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">A brief review of the pertinent statutory provisions is necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Section 54-102r required those convicted of sexual assault offenses, including risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (2), to register not later than five days prior to the termination of a probationary sentence. On October 1, 1998, however, the legislature repealed \u00a7 54-102r, and the current statutory scheme, \u00a7 54-250 et seq., became effective. See P.A. 98-111, \u00a7 12. The current law, \u00a7 54-250 et seq. of chapter 969 of the General Statutes, is commonly referred to as Megan\u2019s Law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>264 Conn. 484, 490, 825 A.2d 63 (2003). The intent behind this legislation \u201cwas to alert the public by identifying potential sexual offender recidivists when necessary for public safety. . . . Prior to the enactment of Megan\u2019s Law, the law imposed a registration requirement only on specified sex offenders who were convicted on or after January 1, 1995. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-102r. The law was broadened in 1997 to include <em>all </em>convicted sex offenders.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>supra, 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">We begin by noting that at the time of the defendant\u2019s conviction in 1997, the defendant was subject to \u00a7 54-102r. Consequently, pursuant to that statutory provision, the defendant would have been required to register as a sex offender five days prior to the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>his probation sentence. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-102r (b). The defendant, in arguing that \u00a7 54-251 (a) is the applicable registration statute, essentially seeks a retroactive application of the current law. The defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing, however, because our Supreme Court has stated that a criminal statute will not be applied retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Quinet, </em>253 Conn. 392, 414, 752 A.2d 490 (2000). There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 54-250 et seq. or the legislative history of P.A. 98-111 clearly indicating that the legislature intended the current statutory scheme to be applied retroactively. To the contrary, the legislative intent appears to be prospective because \u00a7 54-251 (a) imposes a registration requirement on or after October 1, 1998, the effective date of the current law. Furthermore, we note that \u201c[i]n criminal cases, to determine whether a change in the law applies to a defendant, we generally have applied the law in existence on the date of the offense, regardless of its procedural or substantive nature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>56 Conn. App. 507, 510, 743 A.2d 1158 (2000). Applying this principle to the present case, the relevant date is that of the defendant\u2019s conviction, as \u00a7 54-102r imposes the requirement of registration upon a conviction of risk of injury to a child under subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In challenging the registration requirement, the defendant argues that the legislature would not have intended that young adults who are found to have committed sexual offenses as a result of having engaged in consensual sexual relationships be required to register as sex offenders. Essentially, the defendant asserts that the legislature intended that a distinction be drawn between such individuals and sexually violent offenders. The defendant contends that the legislature has manifested this intent by providing in \u00a7 54-251 (b) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the court has discretion to exempt from registration individuals who have committed sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) upon finding that the offender was younger than nineteen years of age at the time of the offense and that registration is not required for public safety. Further, at oral argument, the defendant averred that this legislative intent is also demonstrated through the delineation in \u00a7\u00a7 54-251 and 54-252 of separate registration requirements for nonviolent offenses or offenses committed against victims who are minors and for sexually violent offenses, as well as by requiring mandatory registration of individuals previously subject to \u00a7 54-102r under \u00a7 54-252, the statutory provision concerning sexually violent offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In considering the defendant\u2019s argument, we turn to the statutory text. Section 54-252 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who has been subject to the registration requirements of section 54-102r of the general statutes, revised to January 1, 1997, as amended by section 1 of public act 97-183, shall, not later than three working days after October 1, 1998, register under this section and thereafter comply with the provisions of sections 54-102g and 54-250 to 54-258a, inclusive.\u201d As the first step in our statutory analysis, we examine the relevant language of \u00a7 54-252 (b) \u201cto determine whether it is plain and unambiguous. To determine whether statutory language is plain and unambiguous, we examine the text itself and its relationship to other statutes. The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chesler v. Derby, </em>96 Conn. App. 207, 212, 899 A.2d 624, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 909, 907 A.2d 88 (2006). We conclude that \u00a7 54-252 (b) plainly and unambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>refers to the former registration statute and imposes a renewed registration requirement. The effect of the current law, therefore, is to maintain the registration of prior offenders despite the repeal of the former statutory provision. Moreover, the statutory subsection clearly applies to the defendant as someone who, as we noted previously, has been subject to the requirements of \u00a7 54-102r.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Our rejection of the defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 54-251 (a) eliminates the requirement that he register is further reinforced by the basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature does not intend to enact meaningless provisions. \u201c [N] o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase ... [so that] no word [or phrase] in a statute is to be treated as superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 434-35, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). To determine that \u00a7 54-251 (a) is the applicable registration statute pursuant to which the defendant is not required to register would render \u00a7 54-252 (b) superfluous insofar as it imposes a registration requirement on those previously subject to \u00a7 54-102r.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We conclude that the defendant is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 54-102r and 54-252 (b). Accordingly, the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to correct was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AZe\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-142, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...
