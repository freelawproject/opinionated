Following that denial, the court granted the petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner claims that the court improperly denied the habeas corpus petition because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>he wrongfully was denied the right to self-representation during his criminal trial. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the appeal. The petitioner was convicted after a jury trial of three counts of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a) and three counts of criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He received an effective sentence of six years imprisonment, execution suspended after five years, and three months of probation. The petitioner\u2019s convictions were upheld on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Quint, </em>97 Conn. App. 72, 904 A.2d 216, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 924, 908 A.2d 1089 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On February 5, 2003, before his trial commenced, the petitioner appeared in court to be heard on some motions that he had filed pro se. Prior to that hearing, the petitioner had been appointed a public defender, who subsequently had been removed at the petitioner\u2019s request. The petitioner informed the court, <em>Holden, J., </em>that he was being represented by attorney Thomas Bucci on a different file concerning charges unrelated to those underlying the present petition, but indicated that otherwise, he was without counsel. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThe Court: You intend to represent yourself. Is that your request of this court, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201c[The Petitioner]: At this point and time, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u201cThe Court: At this point and time? You wish to proceed for purposes of arguing these motions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201c[The Petitioner]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cThe Court: You like that arena? And then following that, you wish to determine whether or not you wish to hire a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201c[The Petitioner]: There about, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Thereafter, the court passed on the petitioner\u2019s motions until Bucci arrived, apparently to be heard in connection with the petitioner\u2019s other file. The petitioner\u2019s motions were addressed, with the petitioner acting as his own counsel and presenting argument. The court then inquired of Bucci whether he wanted to represent the petitioner on his other charges, i.e., those underlying the petition. Bucci agreed, albeit reluctantly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded: \u201cThank you. All the matters, absent some other intervention, Mr. Bucci is representing [the petitioner\u2019s] interest as of today. He has had his day in arguing his own motions. He has done quite well.\u201d The petitioner remained silent during this exchange and as the court and counsel proceeded to discuss scheduling matters. When Bucci requested that discovery materials be directed to his office instead of the correctional facility where the petitioner was incarcerated, the petitioner did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The petitioner\u2019s cases proceeded to trial before a different judge, <em>Cremins, J. </em>At no time during trial or sentencing did the petitioner inform that judge<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>wanted to represent himself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ultimately, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed July 23, 2004, the petitioner alleged that his confinement was unlawful because (1) Bucci was ineffective in failing to ensure that the petitioner be permitted to represent himself at trial, and (2) the petitioner was deprived of due process and the right to effective assistance of counsel because the trial court improperly failed to allow him to represent himself at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A hearing was held at which the petitioner and Bucci testified, and the record of the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial was submitted as evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court, in an oral decision rendered December 2, 2004, denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">As to the claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the court noted that the claim lacked allegations of Bucci\u2019s deficient performance or any resultant prejudice<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, therefore, that portion of the petition \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\u201d According to the court, \u201c[t]here is no allegation that Mr. Bucci did anything other than an appropriate job in representing the petitioner. There is no allegation of any deficient performance, and there is no prejudice alleged on the part of any deficient performance by attorney Bucci. So, the court will find that even though [the petitioner] might not have wanted to be represented by attorney Bucci, there\u2019s nothing that the attorney did, nor is anything pleaded that the attorney did, that was anything other than appropriate.\u201d The court concluded that, as to the \u201ctwo-pronged test of deficient performance and prejudice to the petitioner<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> . . . [n] either [was] alleged, [and] neither has been proven.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The court concluded further that no relief could be granted on the petitioner\u2019s claim that he \u201chad a constitutional right to represent himself and that by [the trial court] not honoring that request . . . there has been a due process violation . . . .\u201d The court recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>that such a right was established by United States Supreme Court jurisprudence; see <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975); and observed that Judge Holden, \u201cimplicit[ly],\u201d had found that the petitioner had not waived his right to counsel in a knowing and intelligent manner. It concluded, however, that the question of \u201cwhether that was a proper action by the trial court [is] not before this habeas court.\u201d In so concluding, the court noted that it was unclear whether the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal of his underlying convictions, which was alluded to in the petition, still was ongoing. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the court denied the petition. It thereafter granted certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The petitioner claims that the court improperly concluded that no relief could be granted on his petition. He argues that the right to proceed pro se is one guaranteed by both the Connecticut and federal constitutions, and, when a criminal defendant asserts that right, a trial court is required to make a determination of whether the concomitant waiver of the right to counsel is knowing, intelligent and voluntary. According to the petitioner, the evidence presented to the habeas court showed that he was deprived of his right to self-representation because he asserted that right, and the trial court thereafter failed to make the requisite determination of waiver. The petitioner claims that the foregoing requires an automatic reversal of his convictions, even if no prejudice has been shown. Although the petitioner is correct in his recitation of the legal principles governing the right to self-representation, we conclude nevertheless that he was not deprived of that right because the record demonstrates that he failed to assert it in a clear and unequivocal manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We begin by noting the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The application of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed question of law and fact . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faraday </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>95 Conn. App. 1, 8, 894 A.2d 1048, cert. granted on other grounds, 279 Conn. 907, 901 A.2d 1225 (2006). Particularly, when the \u201cfacts are essential to a determination of whether the petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment rights have been violated, we are presented with a mixed question of law and fact requiring plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>51 Conn. App. 638, 644, 724 A.2d 1130, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 907, 731 A.2d 309 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">At the outset, we agree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that the habeas court improperly concluded that no relief could be granted on the portion of the petition claiming deprivation of the right to self-representation. Normally, because such a claim concerns the actions of the trial court on the record and does not require the development of additional evidence, it properly is raised in the context of a direct appeal. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>200 Conn. 607, 611-14, 513 A.2d 47 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>64 Conn. App. 512, 525-31, 781 A.2d 325, cert. granted on other grounds, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001) (appeal dismissed April 24,2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Casado, </em>42 Conn. App. 371, 381-82, 680 A.2d 981, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 920, 682 A.2d 1006 (1996). Furthermore, when a habeas petitioner raises a claim that he could have brought in the context of his direct appeal, he typically must surmount an additional procedural hurdle before that claim may be considered on its merits. Specifically, \u201c[b]ecause habeas corpus proceedings are not an additional forum for asserting claims that should properly be raised at trial or in a direct appeal, a petitioner must meet the cause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>prejudice standard of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977), for determining the reviewability of habeas claims that were not properly pursued on direct appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Milnerv. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 726, 731, 779 A.2d 156 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">When the respondent, however, fails to raise the petitioner\u2019s procedural default in the answer to the petition, the petitioner is excused from meeting the requirements of <em>Wainwright, </em>and his claim should be heard on its merits. See id., 732-34; see also Practice Book \u00a7 23-30 (b) (requiring procedural default to be pleaded in respondent\u2019s answer). The pleadings demonstrate that such was the case here. See footnote 6. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court improperly determined that the petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court wrongfully precluded him from representing himself was not properly before it and, therefore, was not a claim on which relief could be granted. A determination that a trial court improperly failed to consider an issue properly before it typically requires a remand. Because the relevant facts are not in dispute, however, and resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim requires only the application of the law governing self-representation to those undisputed facts, this court properly may reach the merits of the issue on appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>87 Conn. App. 814, 816, 867 A.2d 145 (when question purely one of law, habeas court\u2019s legal analysis not essential to appellate review), cert. denied, 274 Conn. 918, 879 A.2d 895 (2005). We thus turn to those merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cThere is no doubt that a defendant has a right under both the state and the federal constitutions to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>himself at his criminal trial. . . ,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The constitutional right of self-representation depends, however, upon its invocation by the defendant in a clear and unequivocal manner.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u201cIn the absence of a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation, a trial court has no independent obligation to inquire into the defendant\u2019s interest in representing himself, because the right of self-representation, unlike the right to counsel, is not a critical aspect of a fair trial, but instead affords protection to the defendant\u2019s interest in personal autonomy. . . . When a defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to self-representation is not clear and unequivocal, recognition of the right becomes a matter entrusted to the exercise of discretion by the trial court. ... In the exercise of that discretion, <em>the trial court must weigh into the balance its obligation to indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of the right to </em>counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 613-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Pursuant to the applicable case law, mere expressions of dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s performance do not constitute a clear and unequivocal invocation of the right to self-representation. See id., 611, 614; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 530; <em>State </em>v. <em>Casado, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 379-82. Neither does vacillation between the options of proceeding pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>or with counsel suffice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>539 F.2d 45, 51 (10th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Moreover, it is well established that a petitioner may successfully invoke the right to self-representation but thereafter waive it by acquiescing, either overtly or by a failure to object, to a subsequent reappointment of counsel. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 497 A.2d 408 (1985); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>204 F.3d 33, 37-39 (2d Cir.) (when petitioner voiced no objection to appointment of counsel, stated nothing about representing himself and cooperated with appointed counsel, he waived through abandonment his prior assertion of right to proceed pro se), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 892, 121 S. Ct. 218, 148 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2000); <em>Cain </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>972 F.2d 748 (7th Cir. 1992) (petitioner \u201cwaived his [previously asserted] right to conduct his own defense by remaining mute when the court appointed a new lawyer for him and not raising the subject at trial\u201d), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 930, 113 S. Ct. 1310, 122 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1993); cf. <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 182, 104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1984) (\u201c[e]ven when he insists that he is not waiving his <em>Faretta </em>rights, a pro se defendant\u2019s solicitation of or acquiescence in certain types of participation by [standby] counsel substantially undermines later protestations that counsel interfered unacceptably\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">To regain pro se status, the defendant must reassert the right to self-representation in a clear and unequivocal manner. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 204 F.3d 38-39; cf. <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>supra, 465 U.S. 183 (\u201c[o]nce a pro se defendant invites or agrees to any substantial participation by counsel, subsequent appearances by counsel must be presumed to be with the defendant\u2019s acquiescence, at least until the defendant expressly and unambiguously renews his request that standby counsel be silenced\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>other words, a right to self-representation once asserted does not necessarily persist throughout an entire criminal trial if the petitioner, by his words or conduct, relinquishes it in favor of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The foregoing principles guide our resolution of the present matter. Although the petitioner effectively invoked his right to self-representation during the pretrial proceedings before Judge Holden, his request specifically was targeted at arguing the motions that were presently before that court. When the court inquired as to whether the petitioner, thereafter, wanted to revisit the option of retaining counsel, the petitioner responded affirmatively.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The petitioner subsequently stood silent as the court appointed Bucci to represent him on his additional charges and stated that the petitioner had had his day in representing himself on various motions. The court then proceeded to discuss scheduling matters with counsel. The petitioner did not attempt to reassert his right to proceed pro se when Bucci requested that discovery materials be directed to his office instead of to the petitioner or throughout the entire trial that followed before Judge Cremins. Applying the case law to this chain of events, we are compelled to conclude that although the petitioner effectively asserted his right to self-representation briefly during pretrial proceedings, he thereafter waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>it for purposes of trial (1) explicitly, by limiting the scope of his request, and (2) impliedly, by silently acquiescing in the appointment and participation of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Given our determination that the petitioner failed to assert clearly and equivocally his right to represent himself at trial, his claim that the court improperly failed to determine that his waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent necessarily fails. A \u201cdefendant cannot succeed in his claim that the court failed to inquire adequately into his interest in representing himself unless the court was required to make such an inquiry. A court is required to do so only when the defendant clearly and unequivocally asserts the right to self-representation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 530-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cA trial court, faced with the responsibility of reconciling a defendant\u2019s inherently inconsistent rights to self-representation and to counsel, is entitled to await a definitive assertion of a request to proceed pro se. Any other ruling would permit a defendant on appeal to claim a violation of his rights whether he defended himself or was represented by an attorney.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 614. Courts \u201chave therefore been unwilling to find a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation in . . . ambiguous circumstances.\u201d Id. The facts of this case present a classic example of such ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> The petitioner was acquitted of one charge of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1).

Those motions did not include a motion to discharge Bucci as counsel. The petitioner\u2019s awareness of such an option, however, is evidenced by his motion to discharge his prior counsel, which was granted on November 6, 2002, and his eventual, postsentencing motion to discharge Bucci, which he filed on June 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\"><em>As to </em>the appearance form filed by the petitioner, we observe that it is date stamped March 27, 2003, which was after the petitioner\u2019s trial had concluded but prior to his sentencing.

In any event, regardless of whether Bucci\u2019s failure to assist the petitioner in his purported quest to represent himself at trial could be considered substandard performance, it is clear that the court correctly concluded that the petitioner neither alleged, nor proved, any prejudice flowing from that circumstance. Although the petition averred that had Bucci ensured that the petitioner be permitted to represent himself, the result of his trial \u201cwould have been different,\u201d he presented no evidence to establish precisely how or that that difference would have been a favorable one.
