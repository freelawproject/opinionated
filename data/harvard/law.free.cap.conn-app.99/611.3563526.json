His principal claims are that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial by responding inappropriately to his disruptive courtroom behavior and by limiting his opportunity to present evidence of his mental state when he committed the crimes. Because we find none of his claims of error persuasive, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">In a multicount amended substitute information, the state charged the defendant, Richard W. Strich, with the crimes of attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) and 53a-54a (a), assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1), criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (5), carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) and possession of weapons in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. The defendant pleaded not guilty. After accepting the verdict of the jury finding the defendant guilty of these charges, the trial court imposed a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>effective sentence of forty years incarceration. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts, which were essentially undisputed. Early in August, 2002, the defendant\u2019s wife, Sandra Kopaz Strich (Kopaz), decided to end her long marriage to the defendant. She moved into the Milford home of her sister, Diane Visconti, and her sister\u2019s ex-husband, Edward Visconti. The Viscontis thereupon posted \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs outside their home. On August 6, 2002, Kopaz and the Viscontis obtained a temporary restraining order for their protection from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">On August 8, 2002, in response to timely notification of the temporary restraining order, the defendant went to the Milford police department to surrender his pistol permit and a .357 magnum handgun. Although he was asked whether he owned other guns, he did not turn in other weapons that he had in his possession, such as his shotgun or another handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">On August 20, 2002, after a hearing, a full restraining order was issued for the protection of Kopaz and the Viscontis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That same day, the defendant was served with papers for the dissolution of his marriage to Kopaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">On August 28, 2002, the defendant repeatedly attempted to contact Kopaz at her workplace to tell her, falsely, that he had been shot and hospitalized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When she refused to talk to him, he drove to the parking lot of the company where she worked in an attempt to confront her there. In his vehicle, he had a number of weapons, including a loaded shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Having missed Kopaz at the parking lot, the defendant drove to the Visconti residence, pushed his way in and asked her to leave with him. As she was trying to escape from him, he shot her with his shotgun. As a result of the shooting, her back and shoulder area was seriously and permanently injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendant then drove away from the Visconti residence. On his way toward Milford center, he was stopped by Milford police officers because he had been observed loading a shotgun in his vehicle and driving erratically. For an extended period, the defendant threatened to kill himself with his handgun, but the gun did not fire because he had not chambered a round. He also threatened to light a gasoline can to blow himself up. After a five hour standoff, the defendant requested coffee, which the police laced with a sedative. He was subdued and taken into custody. When the police searched the defendant\u2019s vehicle after his arrest, they found a loaded shotgun, a loaded handgun, an axe, a machete, a carpentry belt and a pocketknife.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">At trial, the defendant did not deny that he had committed the acts charged in the information against him. His defense was that, distressed about the dissolution of his marriage, he had shot Kopaz accidentally and unintentionally. The jury heard conflicting evidence about the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Although the defendant testified that he loved Kopaz and wanted to reconcile, a neighbor testified that, before the shooting, the defendant had told him that he had thoughts of killing her. A police officer testified to having heard the defendant say, after the shooting, that he had worked hard for many years to build up the family\u2019s estate and that they would either reconcile \u201cor they were both going to die.\u201d In addition, to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility, the state introduced into evidence threatening letters he had sent to Kopaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s rejection of his defense. He maintains instead that the trial court (1) deprived him of his constitutional right to be present in the courtroom, (2) impaired his constitutional right to defend himself by excluding evidence about his state of mind, (3) interfered with his right of allocution at sentencing and (4) improperly included the Viscontis in the posttrial criminal restraining order against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">PRESENCE IN THE COURTROOM</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Although the trial court warned the defendant on numerous occasions that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued to violate orders of the court, the court did not order the defendant\u2019s removal until he disrupted the proceedings at the beginning of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury. The defendant loudly challenged the prosecutor\u2019s sexual orientation and claimed that the prosecutor had no right to prosecute the case against him. After a further unsatisfactory conversation with the defendant, the court ordered his removal from the courtroom for the remaining closing argument, for the jury instructions and for the jury verdict. The defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because his removal was unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The defendant raises four issues with respect to his removal. He maintains that (1) his conduct was not sufficiently disruptive to warrant his removal, (2) he was removed in an improper manner, (3) the jury was not properly instructed to disregard his disruptive conduct and (4) he was not expressly informed of his right to return to the courtroom if he agreed to obey the court\u2019s orders. Because none of these issues was raised at trial, the defendant argues that the trial court violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>constitutional rights that entitle him to appellate review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim does not need discussion. Although he had raised it in his brief, appellate counsel properly conceded, at oral argument in this court, that the defendant\u2019s outburst was disruptive. The record amply demonstrates a pattern of disruptive behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, at trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel immediately apologized for the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that he was removed from the courtroom in an improper manner. He complains that, without waiting for an order from the trial court, and in the presence of the jury, court marshals improperly removed him from the courtroom. This claim borders on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The record shows that, upon hearing the defendant\u2019s outburst, the court immediately excused the jury and then ordered the defendant to be returned to the courtroom. Having no reason to anticipate the defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct, the court could not have acted more expeditiously than it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The court then engaged in a colloquy with the defendant in which the defendant declined to commit himself to listening quietly to the proceedings as they went forward.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only after a further conference with counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>off the record, and further evidence of untoward statements on the part of the defendant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was the defendant ordered removed from the courtroom for the remaining proceedings. The defendant was able thereafter to hear these proceedings in a holding cell that was equipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>with a speaker system. We can find no flaw, constitutional or otherwise, in the manner in which the trial court proceeded to address the defendant\u2019s outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court misin-structed the jury with respect to the defendant\u2019s removal. Promptly upon the jury\u2019s return to the courtroom, the court informed the jury that the state would present its final argument in the absence of the defendant. The court then instructed the jury that what it had just observed was not evidence and was not to be considered by the jury in any way whatsoever. In making its decision, the court said, the jurors would have to put what they had obseived out of their minds and would have to focus on the testimony that had been presented under oath and on the exhibits that had been admitted. \u201cOther things,\u201d the court instructed the jury, \u201care not evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The defendant faults this instruction for failing to inform the jury to disregard his untoward behavior, as distinguished from his inappropriate statements. He cites Practice Book \u00a7 42-47, which provides in relevant part that, when a defendant is removed from the courtroom, \u201cthe judicial authority shall instruct the jurors that such removal is not to be considered in assessing the evidence or in the determination of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In our view, in the absence of a timely exception, the court\u2019s instruction was sufficient to comply with the rules of practice. We find it significant that the court not only warned the jury that the defendant\u2019s statements were not evidence, but also cautioned the jurors not to consider \u201cmatters\u201d that they might \u201chave observed.\u201d Even when our rules of practice implement constitutional rights, our Supreme Court has not required literal compliance with its provisions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 709-14, 877 A.2d 696 (2005) (allowing defendant to proceed pro se); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>253 Conn. 375, 378-80, 751 A.2d 825 (2000) (acceptance of guilty plea). These precedents govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The defendant\u2019s fourth and final claim with respect to his removal relates to his constitutional right to be informed, after his removal, of his right to return to the courtroom if he agreed not to engage in further disruptive conduct. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 346, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970); <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 695-96, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990); Practice Book \u00a7 42-47.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the corut never informed the defendant that, with proper assurances, he could reclaim his right to be present for the remaining courtroom proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">We must decide whether the court\u2019s oversight was harmless error. The defendant claims that, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>of law, a court\u2019s impairment of his federally guaranteed constitutional right of presence is a structural error that requires automatic reversal of his conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the alternative, he claims that his removal, under the circumstances of this case, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are not persuaded of either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">As have other courts around the country that have addressed issues arising out of the right of presence, we hold that a new trial is not required if the state can establish the harmlessness of the court\u2019s error beyond a reasonable doubt. The United States Supreme Court addressed this issue in a case in which a trial judge concededly had violated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present during all critical stages of criminal proceedings by having an ex parte conversation with a juror. <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 104 S. Ct. 453, 76 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1983). In a per curiam decision, the court held that this violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights did not automatically require a new trial but was subject to harmless error analysis. Id., 118 &amp; n.2;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>also <em>Luu </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>841 P.2d 271, 275 (Colo. 1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>252 Ga. 498, 501, 314 S.E.2d 888 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>198 W. Va. 620, 629, 482 S.E.2d 605 (1996); contra, <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Calderson, </em>270 Kan. 241, 253, 13 P.3d 871 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The state maintains that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s failure to advise the defendant of his conditional right to return to the courtroom was harmless error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">A criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at all critical stages in a criminal proceeding has long been recognized. See, e.g., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 373, 13 S. Ct. 136, 36 L. Ed. 1011 (1892) and, more recently, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 397 U.S. 338, 346. This constitutional right serves three important purposes. One purpose is protection of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s literal right to confront the witnesses at the time of trial . . . forms the core of the values furthered by the Confrontation Clause. <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 692, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988). A second purpose is protection of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment due process right to participate in the proceedings against him. Implicit in this right is the defendant\u2019s entitlement to the opportunity to provide evidence for rebuttal of adverse testimony presented by the witnesses against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>193 W. Va. 172, 455 S.E.2d 541 (1994). A third purpose is avoidance of the risk that the jury might draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s absence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>supra, 198 W. Va. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In this case, the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s exclusion from his trial implicate only his generic fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>amendment right to participate in the proceedings. Because he was in the courtroom during jury selection, during presentation of the evidence against him, during the initial closing argument of the prosecutor and during his own counsel\u2019s closing argument, his sixth amendment confrontation rights were never in jeopardy. After his disruptive outburst caused his removal from the courtroom, when he was placed in the holding area of the courthouse, his fifth amendment rights were respected by affording him the opportunity, through a closed circuit hookup, to hear the remainder of the trial, consisting of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and the court\u2019s charge to the jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, as we already have held, the court adequately instructed the jury not to consider his removal in adjudicating the merits of the state\u2019s case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In light of this record, we conclude that the state has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of his right to reclaim his right of presence in the courtroom was harmless error. It is in the nature of many claims of constitutional error that no one asked the trial court to give the advice the absence of which the defendant now strongly criticizes. On appeal, it is our duty, however, to exercise reasonable judgment to decide whether, under the particular conditions of this case, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo put it,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the failure to give this advice violated the constitutional requirements of fundamental fairness that are guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. In our judgment, a new trial on this ground is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">EVIDENCE OF STATE OF MIND</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The defendant\u2019s second constitutional claim is that the court improperly deprived him of his right to present a defense and to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him by excluding evidence to negate his specific intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted. Because, at trial, he did not challenge the propriety of any of the four rulings on the grounds on which he now relies, he again seeks appellate review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The evidentiary rulings with which the defendant takes issue in his appeal fall into two categories. He claims that the court improperly (1) granted the state\u2019s motion in limine barring his presentation of evidence with respect to his treatment for mental illness and (2) precluded his cross-examination of Kopaz with respect to his mental state. We are not persuaded that the court\u2019s rulings entitle the defendant to appellate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The state\u2019s motion in limine was granted in the following procedural setting. Anticipating that the defendant would raise questions about his intent to injure Kopaz, and noting that the defendant had not disclosed the names of any physicians who might be qualified to testify about whether he suffered from mental disease, defect or extreme emotional disturbance, the state filed a motion to bar the defendant from presenting any evidence that would have been subject to the notice requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 40-17.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At trial, however, the state limited the scope of its motion. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>described its motion as seeking only to preclude the defendant from presenting mental health evidence to the jury prior to making an offer of proof. The defendant expressly acquiesced in this procedure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court then granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Even under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant may not, on appeal, challenge the validity of a trial court ruling in which he expressly acquiesced. \u201cConnecticut courts have consistently held that when a party fails to raise in the trial court the constitutional claim presented on appeal and affirmatively acquiesces to the trial court\u2019s order, that party waives any such claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Felder, </em>95 Conn. App. 248, 255, 897 A.2d 614, cert. denied, 279 Conn. 905, 901 A.2d 1226 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>86 Conn. App. 607, 613, 862 A.2d 363 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 927, 873 A.2d 1000 (2005). We decline, therefore, to review the merits of court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The defendant\u2019s alternate evidentiary claim is that the court deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense by improperly limiting his cross-examination of Kopaz. Conceding that he could not pursue a claim of mental illness,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> he maintains that he had a right to introduce evidence with respect to his specific intent to commit the crimes charged. He claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that, on three specific occasions during the cross-examination, the court\u2019s rulings, in effect, interfered with his right to pursue this defense. We are not persuaded that the court violated his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Our Supreme Court has articulated the legal principles that govern our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims. \u201cThe federal constitution require[s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. . . . The sixth amendment . . . includes the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\u201cA defendant is, however, bound by the rules of evidence in presenting a defense. . . . Although exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied mechanistically to deprive a defendant of his rights, the constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wishes. . . . Thus, our law is clear that a defendant may introduce only relevant evidence, and, if the proffered evidence is not relevant, its exclusion is proper and the defendant\u2019s right is not violated. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">\u201cFinally, [i]t is well established that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on evidentiary matters, including matters related to relevancy. . . . Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to every reasonable presumption in its favor . . . and we will disturb the ruling only if the defendant can demonstrate a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>263 Conn. 524, 541-43, 821 A.2d 247 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The first evidentiary ruling that the defendant challenges concerns the admissibility of an affidavit accompanying Kopaz\u2019 August 6, 2002 application for a temporary restraining order. In this affidavit, she stated that the defendant has \u201cbipolar syndrome disease\u201d and that \u201che gets violent, and he has not been taking his lithium medication . . . .\u201d In her testimony on direct examination, Kopaz had described obtaining the restraining order, but she had not testified about the contents of her affidavit or about the defendant\u2019s mental state. The state objected to the admission of the affidavit without redaction of the references to bipolar disease and lithium medication. The state also questioned Kopaz\u2019 qualification to express an opinion on the defendant\u2019s mental health. After the court indicated its agreement with the state\u2019s objection, the defendant elected to withdraw his offer rather than to have the affidavit redacted, although he indicated that he would have acquiesced in a limiting instruction. He never articulated his present claim that the affidavit was admissible as evidence of his lack of criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We agree with the state that the court\u2019s ruling did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The defendant has not explained how his constitutional right to present a defense gives him the right to question a witness on a subject about which she was unqualified to testify. <em>See Raudat v. Leary, </em>88 Conn. App. 44, 50-51, 868 A.2d 120 (2005). On that ground alone, the court\u2019s ruling must be sustained. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 541-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The second evidentiary ruling that the defendant challenges relates to his attempt to cross-examine Kopaz about an action that she allegedly had filed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Danbury Hospital to recover damages for negligence in the hospital\u2019s psychiatric care of the defendant. The defendant offered this evidence as a prior inconsistent statement that was alleged to be admissible to impeach Kopaz\u2019 credibility on the theory that the lawsuit attributed Kopaz\u2019 injuries to the negligence of the psychiatrists, not the intentional act of the defendant. Asked by the court to identify the nature of the inconsistency, defense counsel responded that Kopaz had \u201cin fact, alleged, at least implicitly, that [the defendant] did act with the intent to cause her injury.\u201d In his appeal brief, the defendant amplifies this claim by noting that Kopaz testified, on direct examination, that the defendant had pushed through the door at the Visconti residence while holding a gun, had ordered her to come with him and, when she had refused, had shot her. We agree with the state that a description of the defendant\u2019s conduct is not the functional equivalent of a statement about the defendant\u2019s mental state. As the state further notes, Kopaz would not have been a competent witness for testimony relating to the defendant\u2019s intent. See <em>State </em>v. Delgado, 178 Conn. 448, 449, 423 A.2d 106 (1979). The court\u2019s ruling was therefore proper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 541-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The third evidentiary ruling to which the defendant assigns constitutional significance is his inability to cross-examine Kopaz on a stipulation, in the parties\u2019 divorce agreement, in which she allegedly released him \u201cfrom liability for any claims not related to the dissolution of their marriage.\u201d The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection that the defendant was \u201cquoting [from] a document, not in evidence, which is irrelevant . . . .\u201d The defendant did not attempt to make the dissolution agreement an exhibit, nor did he inform the court that the stipulation was relevant to his intent to commit the crimes charged. Even now, the defendant does not fill in these gaps except by reiterating the questions asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>at trial. We agree with the state that this claim was briefed inadequately. We therefore decline to review it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vicente, </em>62 Conn. App. 625, 632, 772 A.2d 643 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense based on his alleged lack of a specific intent to commit the crimes charged. In each instance, in light of the arguments and the record before the court, the court\u2019s rulings represented a proper exercise of its evidentiary discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">RIGHT OF ALLOCUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (3) provides a right of allocution for defendants in criminal proceedings. Prior to imposing a sentence, the court must \u201callow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to make a personal statement in his or her own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of the sentence.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (3). In his third argument for reversal of his conviction, the defendant maintains that the trial court unreasonably restricted his right of allocution by limiting the scope of his remarks and by refusing to allow him to address Kopaz personally. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The right of allocution that today is codified in the Practice Book \u201chas its origins in the ancient common-law practice of inquiring of every defendant if he had anything to say before sentence was imposed. The practice is so old that its precise origins are unknown, but, as early as 1689, it had become apparent that the practice was more than a mere formality; in fact, the right of allocution was considered important enough at that time to require reversal when the court failed to make the inquiry of a defendant. See <em>Anonymous, </em>3 Mod. 265, 87 Eng. Rep. 175 (1689). Historically, the practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>marked a critical juncture in criminal proceedings, as it afforded defendants the opportunity to inform the court as to the applicability of any of numerous recognized exemptions from the otherwise severe punishments imposed by the common law of the period. . . . The idea of permitting defendants an opportunity to request mitigated punishment was present in Connecticut\u2019s early jurisprudence. Chief Judge Zephaniah Swift described the practice as follows: The judge then demands of the prisoner if he has any thing to say .... This is rather [a] matter of form, as all the legal means of defence have been previously exhausted: but the court will permit the prisoner to make any respectful remarks respecting his case in mitigation of his conduct .... 2 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1823) p. 417. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\u201cModem day justifications for preserving the practice focus on tailoring punishment to individual circumstances, providing an avenue through which a defendant may ask for mercy based on factors that might not otherwise be brought to the court\u2019s attention, and promoting safety, certainty and equity in sentencing and the judicial process overall.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 343-45, 703 A.2d 109 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The defendant does not claim that the court lacked the authority to impose reasonable limitations on the duration and content of his right of allocution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 407, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005). He concedes that our standard of review is abuse of discretion. He nonetheless maintains that he was unfairly precluded from exercising a reasonable opportunity to make a statement in mitigation of his culpability. We are not persuaded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The court permitted the defendant to describe, in some detail, the circumstances that led to his criminal conduct. He spoke at length about the nature and the origin of the deterioration in his relationship with Kopaz, which he attributed to her unsympathetic response to his loss of his employment. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the terms of the dissolution settlement that was negotiated during his incarceration pending trial. He attempted to minimize the seriousness of his conduct, which he characterized as an unintended accident that was not life threatening. He denied having had any intent to cause serious harm to Kopaz and expressed remorse for having caused her to suffer but also opined that she was overreacting to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The issues that the court precluded the defendant from addressing related to events that had no connection with the matters adjudicated at trial. The court stopped the defendant from criticizing the terms of his dissolution agreement, the conditions of his incarceration or the destruction of his personal property during his absence from his home. Furthermore, the court refused his request to address Kopaz directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We note, finally, that when the court asked the defendant to conclude his remarks, the defendant replied, \u201cFine. All right.\u201d His trial attorney was afforded an opportunity to comment but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Looking at this record in its entirety, we are persuaded that the court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the defendant\u2019s allocution. The court\u2019s interjections were appropriate, specific and limited. An allocution is an address to the court and not to the victim. Neither the defendant nor his attorney indicated, at trial, that the defendant\u2019s presentation had been ended prematurely. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s appellate claim that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to make a statement in mitigation of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">RESTRAINING ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The defendant\u2019s fourth and final claim is that the court exceeded its statutory authority by issuing a restraining order for the protection of Diane Visconti and Edward Visconti. Because of the nature of the crimes of which the defendant was convicted, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> concededly authorized the court to issue a standing criminal restraining order for the protection of Kopaz. The defendant argues, however, that the statute did not authorize such protection for Kopaz\u2019 sister and her former husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Although the defendant did not object to the issuance of the restraining order at trial, the state does not dispute that the defendant\u2019s claim of statutory misconstruction is reviewable to determine whether the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>construction of the statute was plain error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 199, 502 A.2d 858 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Well established tenets of statutory construction govern our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\u201cSeveral additional tenets of statutory construction guide our interpretation of a penal statute. . . . [Criminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . [U]nless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 219-20, 751 A.2d 800 (2000); see also General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The defendant maintains that \u00a7 53a-40e does not authorize the issuance of a restraining order for the protection of Kopaz\u2019 sister, Diane Visconti, and her former husband, Edward Visconti, because subsection (a) limits the scope of the statute to \u201cvictim[s]\u201d of one of specified offenses who are \u201cfamily or household member[s] . . . .\u201d At the least, he argues that Edward Vis-conti does not qualify as \u201cfamily.\u201d More broadly, he argues that neither of the Viscontis was a member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>his household because his marriage to Kopaz had been dissolved by the time of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We agree with the state that the defendant reads the statute too narrowly. In subsection (a), the statute authorizes a restraining order to serve \u201cthe interest of the victim and <em>the public </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e (a). In subsection (b), the restraining order <em>\u201cmay include but is not limited to </em>enjoining the offender from (1) imposing any restraint upon . . . the victim; (2) threatening . . . the victim; or (3) entering the family dwelling or the <em>dwelling of the </em>victim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40e (b). Uncontested evidence at trial established the fact that Kopaz had made the Visconti home her dwelling before she was shot there by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">As this court has noted, \u00a7 53a-40e does not give the court unlimited authority to issue postconviction restraining orders. <em>State v. Punsalan, </em>81 Conn. App. 84, 91, 838 A.2d 232, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 905, 845 A.2d 408 (2004). The principles of strict construction that govern the interpretation of criminal statutes counsel against overreaching in application of the power that the statute confers on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">As we also held in <em>Punsalan, </em>however, some cases clearly fall within the statute. This is one of them. It was not plain error for the court to issue a standing restraining order pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40e for the protection of Kopaz and the members of the household in which she was residing when she was assaulted by the defendant. If, at some future time, the defendant can demonstrate that the restraining order should be modified, subsection (c) of the statute expressly permits him to seek such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">By way of summary, we conclude that the defendant has not established that the court violated his constitutional right of presence in the courtroom or his constitutional right to present to the jury evidence of his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>that he lacked the specific intent to commit the crimes with which he was charged. We further conclude that the defendant has not established that the court committed plain error in imposing some limitations on his right of allocution or in determining the terms of a standing criminal restraining order following his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> Although the defendant also obtained a temporary restraining order against Kopaz, alleging that she had threatened his life, the permanent restraining order was addressed only to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> He also tried, unsuccessfully, to enlist a neighbor to convey this false message.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\"> The defendant made Inappropriate comments during the voir dire process, during discussion of his telephone privileges, during the testimony of Diane Visconti and during his own testimony. He does not deny that he repeatedly was warned that continuation of his interjections would lead to his removal from the courtroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\"> When the defendant returned to the courtroom, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Is this a fair trial, ladies and gentlemen?

God. Got the clubs, too?</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Strich, if I could have your attention, sir, for just a moment? We are going to continue with these proceedings, sir, without you. You are going to be removed to the holding area. I am concerned that there will be continued disruptions here.

Take him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: John, would you take care of my legal work, please?

That\u2019s not evidence. Again, you need to focus with respect to the decision you make in this case on the evidence that was presented by the testimony that was under oath and the full exhibits that have been admitted. <em>Other things are not evidence. </em>And as I told you earlier, there is a portion of your mind where you need to put these things in the area that I call \u2018non-evidence.\u2019 I know it\u2019s difficult to psychologically separate those things, but you have to do best \u2014 to the best of your ability to do that separation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-47, in <em>its </em>entirety, provides: \u201cUpon the direction of the judicial authority, a defendant may be removed from the courtroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>during trial or hearing when the defendant\u2019s conduct has become so disruptive that the trial or hearing cannot proceed in an orderly manner.
