We agree with the defendant, and, therefore, reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the matter with direction to dismiss the charge against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our discussion of the issues on appeal. On or about July 12, 2000, the defendant was arrested and charged in four separate cases, three for violation of probation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 and one for failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 54-251. In an amended information, the state alleged that the defendant failed to register his residential address with the commissioner of public safety on such forms and in such location as the commissioner shall direct in violation of \u00a7 54-251. On August 2,2000, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty, with a jury election, to the charge of failure to register in violation of the requirements of \u00a7 54-251. On May 9, 2001, following a hearing on the combined violation of probation cases, the court found the defendant to be in violation of probation and sentenced him to six years incarceration. On June 13, 2001, the defendant\u2019s violation of probation cases appeared on a postjudgment docket together with this case, which previously had been placed on the firm jury trial list. During this appearance, the state indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>to the court that this case was on the firm trial list and was \u201cgoing to remain on the firm trial list.\u201d Subsequently, on October 29, 2004, while in court on another matter, the defendant inquired of the clerk the status of this case, and the clerk notified him that it was still pending. The defendant subsequently wrote a letter to the clerk of the court requesting that the court construe the case as nolled pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c). The clerk brought the letter to the attention of the state, and the case was placed on the docket for December 14, 2004. On December 14, 2004, the state requested that the court place the case on the active case list for trial on January 11, 2005. On December 17, 2004, the defendant filed a motion to construe a nolle and to dismiss with prejudice along with a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. On January 11, 2005, the defendant filed a corrected motion to construe a nolle and to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In considering the defendant\u2019s motion to construe a nolle, the court, sua sponte, sought testimony from the clerk\u2019s office as to when the last time a trial was held in the district and how many judges were available to try cases during the period of time that the defendant\u2019s case was pending. The clerk testified that during the time period when the defendant\u2019s case was pending, many cases were called for trial by the state but not the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant testified that he thought that the case had been nolled earlier. The court dismissed the defendant\u2019s testimony as not credible, commenting, in sum, that the defendant is an experienced person and knows that cases do not disappear. The court found that \u00a7 54-142a (c) was \u201cdirected at prohibiting [the state] from attempting to get a defendant to serve time short of a conviction by simply placing a case on a jury docket and allowing it to stay dormant for the same amount of time . . . the person would get if the person had been convicted. It\u2019s to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>prohibit and prevent misconduct on the part of the [state], which is why it incorporates the statement [regarding] when the case has been on the firm jury docket for thirteen months at the request\u2014and the [state] has requested a continuance.\u201d The court found that the length of the delay was not due to the misconduct or bad motive of the state. The court further found that because the defendant did not accept the state\u2019s plea bargain offer regarding this charge and sought a trial, the case had been continued at his request. The court also intimated that the delay had been a strategy on the part of the defendant to enable him to make this claim. The court concluded that because the case had not been continued at the request of the state, \u00a7 54-142a (c) did not apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied the defendant\u2019s motions on January 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Following a four day trial, the jury found the defendant guilty. The court subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for arrest of judgment, and sentenced the defendant to three years incarceration, execution suspended, and three years probation to run concurrently with the sentence he was then serving. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The issue on appeal is whether the court properly concluded that \u00a7 54-142a (c) does not apply to the defendant\u2019s case and, more specifically, whether the court\u2019s finding that the defendant, not the state, had requested that the matter be continued is clearly erroneous. Such a determination, however, inherently depends on the proper interpretation of the statute and requires a legal conclusion as to the circumstances in which the legislature considers a case to be continued at the request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the state. Therefore, because the issue is ultimately one of statutory inteipretation, our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDevitt, </em>94 Conn. App. 356, 359, 892 A.2d 338 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cRelevant legislation and precedent guide the process of statutory inteipretation. [General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z] provides that, [t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratex-tual evidence of the statute shall not be considered. . . . [P]ursuant to \u00a7 l-2z, [the court is] to go through the following initial steps: first, consider the language of the statute at issue, including its relationship to other statutes, as applied to the facts of the case; second, if after the completion of step one, [the court] conclude [s] that, as so applied, there is but one likely or plausible meaning of the statutory language, [the court] stop[s] there; but third, if after the completion of step one, [the court] conclude [s] that, as applied to the facts of the case, there is more than one likely or plausible meaning of the statute, [the court] may consult other sources, beyond the statutory language, to ascertain the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cIt is useful to remind ourselves of what, in this context, we mean when we say that a statutory text has a plain meaning, or, what is the same, a plain and unambiguous meaning. [Our Supreme Court] has already defined that phrase. By that phrase we mean the meaning that is so strongly indicated or suggested by the language as applied to facts of the case, without consideration, however, of its purpose or the other, extratex-tual sources of meaning . . . that, when the language is read as so applied, it appears to be the meaning and appears to preclude any other likely meaning. . . . Put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>another way, if the text of the statute at issue, considering its relationship to other statutes, would permit more than one likely or plausible meaning, its meaning cannot be said to be plain and unambiguous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prazeres, </em>97 Conn. App. 591, 594-95, 905 A.2d 719 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the case at hand. We first look to the record to determine whether the court correctly concluded that the defendant\u2019s case was not continued at the request of the state. On June 13, 2001, as noted, the state indicated that the case was \u201cgoing to remain on the firm trial list.\u201d Although this statement effectively postponed the defendant\u2019s case and continued it to an indefinite time in the future, because the state did not explicitly request a continuance, it is not clear whether this is a continuance at the request of the state as contemplated in \u00a7 54-142a (c). Because the phrase \u201ccontinued at the request of the state\u201d may be interpreted in many different ways, particularly as applied to the facts of this case, and the intended meaning of the phrase is not clear from the language of the statute, we look to extratextual sources for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the word \u201ccontinue\u201d as \u201cto carry onward or extend\u201d or \u201cto keep on the court calendar: subject to further consideration; postpone by a continuance.\u201d It defines the term \u201ccontinuance\u201d as \u201ca holding on or remaining in a particular state or course of action\u201d or \u201cthe adjournment of the court proceedings in a case to a future day.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) also defines a \u201ccontinuance\u201d as \u201c[t]he adjournment or postponement of a trial or other proceeding to a future date.\u201d These definitions suggest that the state\u2019s actions on June 13, 2001, amounted to a continuance of the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>We next turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 54-142a (c). In 1981, the language \u201cat the request of the prosecuting attorney\u201d was added to the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is scant reference to the purpose for this change in the legislative history.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we look to the intent of the statute as a whole. The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part that \u201c [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial . . . .\u201d This guarantee of a speedy trial is a fundamental right applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 222, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967). The thirteen month provision was also inspired by the <em>Klopfer </em>decision. In fashioning the statute at hand, the legislature noted: \u201c[T]he Supreme court in the case of <em>[Klopfer] </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>has laid down a doctrine which is mandated and states . . . that if there has been no prosecution of the case ... or disposition of the case for a thirteen month period, if it has simply been continued and continued and continued, that case must constitutionally be dismissed.\u201d 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2,1974 Sess., p. 737, remarks of Representative Samuel S. Freedman. Our Supreme Court has held that the legislature \u201cspecifically designed \u00a7 54-142a (c) in order to avoid the speedy trial violations that the legislature feared otherwise might occur.\u201d <em>Cislo </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>240 Conn. 590, 599, 692 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>A.2d 1255 (1997). These concerns have been mirrored by the judges of the Superior Court as demonstrated by the time limitations for trials set forth in the rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 sets forth the general rule and provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided herein and in [\u00a7] 43-40, the trial of a defendant charged with a criminal offense . . . (c) . . . shall commence within twelve months from the filing of the information or from the date of the arrest, whichever is later.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-40 then sets forth ten circumstances constituting those \u201cperiods of time [that] shall be excluded in computing the [twelve months] within which the trial of a defendant . . . must commence pursuant to [\u00a7] 43-39 . . . .\u201d The first nine delineate specific circumstances; the tenth provides more generally for \u201c[o]ther periods of delay occasioned by exceptional circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 43-40 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 11, 425 A.2d 924 (1979), the defendant sought a nolle pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-90 (c) (now \u00a7 54-142a [c]). Our Supreme Court concluded that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s request on the ground that the defendant\u2019s case had not been dormant for thirteen months or more. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 12. The Supreme Court concluded that the case was being actively prosecuted during that time period and noted that several motions were filed and argued during that time period, including motions to dismiss, bills of particulars, motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>disclosure, a motion to quash, a bond review, motions addressed to the grand jury and a motion for a speedy trial. Id. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 500 A.2d 555 (1985), our Supreme Court similarly upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a nolle because it had not been dormant for thirteen months, noting that the defendant\u2019s case was subject to trial several times during that time period. Id., 604 n.2. Both <em>McCarthy </em>and <em>Milum </em>cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 384 A.2d 326 (1977), for the following proposition: \u201cThe statute appears to be directed not to a situation such as this, but to circumstances in which the state obtains an initial continuance and then completely ignores the case for thirteen months.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>supra, 604 n.2. In <em>Troynack, </em>our Supreme Court found that the defendant\u2019s case was consistently placed on the monthly calendar and then, after notice to the defendant, was put over when it could not be reached. The court, therefore, concluded that the defendant\u2019s case was not dormant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>supra, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">This case is readily distinguishable from those previously cited. Here, on June 13, 2001, as noted, the state indicated to the court that the defendant\u2019s case was \u201cgoing to remain on the firm trial list.\u201d Although neither party explicitly requested a continuance, in indicating that the case was going to remain on the firm trial list, the state effectively informed the court that it was not going to be tried on that day. Such a statement may be construed as a continuance by the state in its routine responsibility for prosecuting cases on the docket. In sum, given the common meaning of the term \u201ccontinuance,\u201d it is clear- that by postponing the trial of the defendant\u2019s case and advancing it on the trial list to no certain date, the case was continued at the request of the state. Following the state\u2019s request on June 13,2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s case remain on the firm trial list, the state completely abandoned the prosecution of the defendant\u2019s case until December, 2004. Unlike the situations in <em>McCarthy, Milum </em>and <em>Troynack, </em>the defendant\u2019s case was not called for trial, nor were there any motions filed or argued for a period of more than three years. The defendant testified that he was not even aware that his case was still pending. Although the court found that the defendant\u2019s testimony was not credible, the burden to prosecute the case is not on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The court further intimated that the delay may have been a strategic move employed by the defendant to take advantage of \u00a7 54-142a (c). There is no evidence in the record to support the suggestion that the defendant allowed his case to be ignored because he intended to seek a nolle after the expiration of the thirteen month period. Even if the defendant had wanted to stall his case for the purpose of invoking \u00a7 54-142a (c), it is undeniable that the state retains the responsibility to advance the prosecution of a case. Reading \u00a7 54-142a (c) together with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-39 and 43-40, it is reasonable to infer that the legislature added the language \u201cat the request of the prosecuting attorney\u201d to the statute not solely for the purpose of preventing misconduct or bad faith on the part of the state, as stated by the court, but also to make it clear that a defendant should not be permitted to stall the proceedings and then seek dismissal. Although we agree that the record is devoid of any evidence of misconduct or bad faith on the part of the state, the record equally lacks any indication that the defendant intentionally delayed the prosecution of his case. It is undisputed here that the defendant\u2019s case was completely dormant from June 13, 2001, until December, 2004. We conclude that this is the very situation that \u00a7 54-142a (c) was intended to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the charge against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\"> Since 2000, General Statutes \u00a7 54-251 (a) has been amended for purposes not relevant to this appeal.
