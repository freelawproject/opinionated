We conclude that there were insufficient subordinate facts before the commissioner from which he reasonably could make such a finding and, thus, reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On appeal, the defendant Dan Perkins Chevrolet Geo, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s findings because (1) the findings were predicated on expert medical testimony grounded in conjecture, speculation or surmise, (2) the expert medical testimony was not supported by the subordinate facts and (3) the expert testimony was not provided by a qualified or competent medical expert. We agree with the first and second claims, which are interrelated, and, therefore, need not reach the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Following the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff, Evana DiNuzzo, submitted a claim for dependent widow\u2019s benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-306.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commissioner, after a hearing, made the following relevant findings of fact. The decedent was employed by the defendant and sustained a compensa-ble injury to his cervical spine when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident on June 26,1997. As a result of the injury, the decedent experienced radiculopathy into his left side and upper extremity. He underwent a three level spinal fusion and foraminectomy. After the surgery, the decedent continued to experience neck pain, left side body pain and paresthesia into his left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Prior to his death on January 12, 2002, the decedent had suffered from injuries and illnesses that were unrelated to his compensable injury. He had chronic bilateral shoulder and low back pain that were the result of a bicycle accident he had in 1974. Since before 1982, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the decedent had been treated for a chronic hepatitis C infection, a result of his intravenous drug use. The decedent was diagnosed with adult onset diabetes in 1995. In 1994 or 1995, he was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol. The decedent\u2019s diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol were controlled by medication. On December 1, 2001, the decedent was hospitalized with complaints of dizziness, diaphoresis and pain. The symptoms were caused by the effect Interferon, a medicine he took to control the hepatitis C infection, had on his blood sugar level.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">On the evening of January 11, 2002, the plaintiff observed that the decedent was mumbling and incoherent. He complained that he had severe lower back pain, his stomach was bothering him, and he was constipated. At midnight, the decedent struggled successfully to have a bowel movement, after which he said that he felt better. The plaintiff last saw the decedent at 2 a.m. on January 12, 2002. Because the plaintiff and the decedent slept in separate rooms, the plaintiff was unaware of the decedent\u2019s activities between 2 and 8 a.m. when she discovered his body. Members of the Milford police department responded to the plaintiffs call for assistance. The police report indicates that the decedent was declared dead at 8:50 a.m. on January 12, 2002, and that the body was not examined by the medical examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Cosmo Filiberto, a board certified family practitioner and expert in preventive medicine and care, prepared the decedent\u2019s death certificate. Filiberto stated that the cause of death was heart disease, secondary to atherosclerotic heart disease. Filiberto had treated the decedent for twenty years and had seen him days before his death but did not examine his body postmortem. No autopsy was performed on the decedent\u2019s body. The record is silent as to why no postmortem examination or autopsy was done. Filiberto opined at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>before the commissioner that the decedent\u2019s death was brought about by the curtailment of his physical activities. His weight sometimes exceeded 300 pounds. His weight gain and resulting inactivity, along with the heavy doses of narcotics he was required to take to control his pain, made it \u201cmedically probable and certain that the stress\u201d of the decedent\u2019s compensable injury and its treatment substantially contributed to his death, in Filiberto\u2019s view, because they severely limited his ability to maintain his physical fitness and aerobic conditioning. Prior to the decedent\u2019s compensable injury, he was able to control his pain due to prior accidents with over-the-counter medication and muscle relaxants. Relief from the pain of the decedent\u2019s 1997 accident, however, required high doses of narcotics, eventually reaching 3200 milligrams a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Jonathan Alexander, a cardiologist at Danbury Hospital and clinical faculty member of Yale University School of Medicine, testified for the defendant. Alexander based his opinion and report on a review of the decedent\u2019s medical records, including Filiberto\u2019s records. Alexander found no evidence of atheroscle-rotic heart disease in the decedent\u2019s medical records. Alexander concluded, therefore, that neither the treatment the decedent received as a result of his cervical injury nor his inactivity nor his weight gain were factors in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The commissioner was not persuaded by Alexander\u2019s opinions. He found, on the basis of Filiberto\u2019s twenty year treatment of the decedent and familiarity with his ongoing medical condition, that there was a relationship between the compensable injury and the decedent\u2019s death. He concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-306. The defendant thereafter filed a motion to correct the findings and award, which the commissioner denied in its entirety. The defendant appealed to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The defendant gave eleven reasons for the appeal, which we summarize here: the commissioner improperly found that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to the compensable injury because (1) the plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to rule out nonatherosclerotic heart disease as the cause of death, particularly when the decedent had no history of athero-sclerotic heart disease, (2) the decedent\u2019s body had not been examined postmortem, (3) there were insufficient underlying facts to support the inferential claim asserted, (4) the medical testimony on which the commissioner relied was not provided by an expert in heart disease and (5) the commissioner disregarded the expert testimony of a cardiologist. The board resolved the appeal by concluding that the weight and credibility of the evidence is to be determined by the trier of fact, in this instance, the commissioner. The board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s award was not contrary to law, without evidence or based on unreasonable or impermissible inferences. The board, therefore, affirmed the commissioner\u2019s award. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Our workers\u2019 compensation scheme \u201cindisputably is a remedial statute that should be construed generously to accomplish its purpose. . . . The humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation [benefits].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee </em>v. <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co., </em>279 Conn. 239, 245, 902 A.2d 620 (2006). \u201cTo recover under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a plaintiff must prove that the claimed injury is connected causally to the employment by demonstrating that the injury (1) arose out of the employment and (2) occurred in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>73 Conn. App. 619, 625, 808 A.2d 1171 (2002). \u201cA commissioner may exercise jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to hear a claim only under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. . . . The [act] is not triggered by a claimant until he brings himself within its statutory ambit. . . . Although the [act] should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose ... its remedial purpose cannot transcend its statutorily defined jurisdictional boundaries.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labadie </em>v. <em>Norwalk Rehabilitation Services, Inc., </em>84 Conn. App. 220, 228, 853 A.2d 597 (2004), aff'd, 274 Conn. 219, 875 A.2d 485 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u201c[Traditional concepts of proximate cause furnish the appropriate analysis for determining causation in workers\u2019 compensation cases. . . . [T]he test for determining whether particular conduct is the proximate cause of an injury [is] whether it was a substantial factor in producing the result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>57 Conn. App. 51, 60, 748 A.2d 300, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 908, 753 A.2d 940 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe commissioner is the sole trier of fact and [t]he conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... On appeal, the board must determine whether there is any evidence in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s findings and award. . . . Our scope of review of the actions of the [board] is [similarly] . . . limited. . . . [However] [t]he decision of the [board] must be correct in law, and it must not include facts found without evidence or fail to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Sellers Garage, Inc., </em>80 Conn. App. 15, 18-19, 832 A.2d 679, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 904, 838 A.2d 210 (2003). \u201cOur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>role is to determine whether the review [board\u2019s] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . This standard clearly applies to conflicting expert medical testimony. It [is] the province of the commissioner to accept the evidence which impress [es] him as being credible and the more weighty.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>52 Conn. App. 813, 816, 728 A.2d 527 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u201cAs long as it is clear that the expert\u2019s opinion was based on more than mere conjecture, the entire substance of the expert\u2019s testimony should be examined.\u201d Id., 817. \u201c[E]xpert opinions must be based on reasonable probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture if they are to be admissible in establishing causation. ... To be reasonably probable, a conclusion must be more likely than not. An expert\u2019s testimony as to the reasonable probability of the occurrence of an event does not depend on semantics or the use of any particular term or phrase, but rather, is determined by looking at the entire substance of the testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 817-18. \u201cThe [commissioner] alone is charged with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not be disturbed by a reviewing court. . . . Inferences may only be drawn from competent evidence. Competent evidence does not mean any evidence at all. It means evidence on which the trier properly can rely and from which it may draw reasonable inferences.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dengler </em>v. <em>Special Attention Health Services, Inc., </em>62 Conn. App. 440, 451, 774 A.2d 992 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In this case, the commissioner credited the testimony of Flliberto, the plaintiffs personal physician. We accept the commissioner\u2019s credibility determination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>purposes of our analysis, but the testimony of even the most persuasive expert witness cannot be credited if it is not based on facts. The determinative question, therefore, is not whether FUiberto was credible but whether there are sufficient subordinate facts in the record to support his opinion that the decedent\u2019s death was causaUy related to his compensable injury. On the basis of our review of Filiberto\u2019s testimony, we conclude that there are not and that Filiberto\u2019s opinion was grounded in speculation or conjecture. See <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">FUiberto testified before the commissioner on May 5, 2004, and a copy of his deposition testimony was placed into evidence. Our review of the transcripts reveals that the decedent was morbidly obese in 1982 and that he gained twenty to thirty pounds after the 1997 accident and thirty to thirty-five more pounds after his cervical fusion. Due to the decedent\u2019s weight and the drugs he took to control his pain, Filiberto opined that the decedent was unable to exercise and that he would have lived longer had he exercised. According to FUiberto, the decedent died of a heart attack caused by atherosclerotic disease, although he never ordered tests to determine whether the decedent, in fact, had atherosclerotic heart disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Filiberto also opined that Oxycontin, which the decedent was taking for pain, can cause constipation. According to FUiberto, straining to have a bowel movement can cause changes in the body\u2019s system that can produce cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">FUiberto also testified that he did not examine the decedent\u2019s body subsequent to its being found and that no autopsy had been performed. FUiberto did not know whether the decedent had a congenital heart defect that could have caused a heart attack and acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that a ruptured aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, stroke or sudden arrhythmia can cause sudden death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He conceded that, without an autopsy, there is no way to know the exact cause of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On cross-examination before the commissioner, the defendant\u2019s counsel presented Filiberto with a copy of the decedent\u2019s January 11, 2002 Milford Hospital records, which he previously had not seen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A gastroen-terologist was treating the decedent\u2019s chronic hepatitis C infection, and Filiberto was unaware that the decedent had commenced taking Interferon. Filiberto conceded that the symptoms the decedent complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>on January 11, 2002, could have resulted from taking Interferon. See footnote 5. The reality is that it was not possible to determine with any reasonable degree of probability the cause of the decedent\u2019s death given the factual gaps in the record. On the basis of our examination of Filiberto\u2019s testimony and opinion, we conclude that there were insufficient subordinate facts to support his opinion that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to the compensable injury or to remove the cause of death from the realm of conjecture.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 632, 535 A.2d 338 (1987) (expert opinion cannot be based on conjecture or surmise but must be reasonably probable). We therefore reverse the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to sustain the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> Utica Mutual Insurance Company, which provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance benefits, also was named a defendant and joined this appeal.

December 1, 2001. Are you familiar with that care?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Have you seen the records with regard to the care?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Now that [the Milford Hospital record] has been marked as a full exhibit, I just want you to reiterate a couple of things. First, prior to giving your opinions in this case, you did not know that [the decedent] had been a patient at Milford Hospital on December 1, 2001?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Now, you see there\u2019s reference to a word ataxia. Can you tell us what ataxia means?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">\u201c[The Witness]: Unsteady when you are walking. Wobbly walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: In fact, they performed, apparently at the hospital at this time a CAT [computerized axial tomography] scan of the brain, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">\u201c[The Witness]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: And they said they were doing so for what symptom complaints?</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c[The Witness]: For ataxia, disorientation. . . . Sure. I\u2019ll read the whole paragraph [of the Milford Hospital record]. T discussed the case with [a gastroenterologist]. He states side affects of hypertension, sweating and dizziness expected for five days after Interferon. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"A6cq\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: In fact, you do not have records showing when your patient was administered Interferon, do you?</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">\u201c[The Witness]: No. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AlZg\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Now that you have seen [the Milford Hospital records], is it also a possibility that some of the symptom complaints that [the plaintiff] testified about on that night could have been as a result of some side effect of his Interferon treatment?</p>\n<p id=\"AW_\">\u201c[The Witness]: If he had gotten it close to that time frame. The doctor there said four days.</p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: You don\u2019t know when he last might have had any Interferon treatment prior to his death?</p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">\u201c[The Witness]: That\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> The plaintiff has argued that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s medical expert, Alexander, provided the necessary evidence to establish a causal connection between the decedent\u2019s compensable injury and his death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">During his deposition, Alexander testified on cross-examination by the plaintiffs counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">\u201c [The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Well, let me ask you: In your opinion, if someone dies suddenly, would you presume that that was a cardiac event?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Why is that?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">\u201c[The Witness]: Sudden death is not slow death, and there are several organ systems that can fail that can cause one to die suddenly within a matter of minutes, seconds or minutes. And one of those organic systems is the heart. Again, without a witnessed death . . . nobody saw him die; they found him dead, and, without an autopsy, you cannot come to a conclusion as to the cause of this man\u2019s death. It\u2019s certainly <em>possible </em>it\u2019s cardiac, but, as we stated earlier, there are other things that could have caused him to die.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"and-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Alexander testified that it was <em>possible </em>for the decedent to have died as the result of a cardiac event. <em>Possibilities </em>do not provide a sufficient basis for establishing a causal relationship. \u201c[E]xpert opinions must be based upon reasonable probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture ....
