We further conclude that the court properly admitted a witness\u2019 out-of-court, prior inconsistent statement, which included a statement made to the witness by another person, for the limited purpose of impeachment and not for the substantive purpose of proving third party culpability. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 12, 2003, the defendant drove his then girlfriend, Kristina Monterio, and her brother, Gino <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Monterio, to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torring-ton so that Gino Monterio could be admitted into the hospital\u2019s substance abuse detoxification program. After learning that the hospital would not admit him for several hours, Gino Monterio telephoned Michael Haskill, looking for narcotics because Haskill, who also was involved in a romantic relationship with Kristina Monterio, frequently supplied Gino Monterio with drugs. On that particular day, Gino Monterio was unsuccessful in his quest to obtain narcotics from Haskill.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Thereafter, the defendant, together with Gino Mont-erio and Kristina Monterio, left the hospital and went to a liquor store. While Gino Monterio was inside the liquor store, the defendant attempted to park his motor vehicle. However, in doing so, the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle almost collided with a motor vehicle driven by Eric Hoenig, in which Steven Hill was a passenger. Hoenig and Hill were on their way to procure drugs at Haskill\u2019s house, which was located around the comer from the liquor store. A verbal confrontation ensued between the defendant and Hill, prompting Gino Mont-erio to exit the liquor store to deteimine the cause of the altercation. Gino Monterio, who was acquainted with Hill, then walked with Hill around the comer toward Haskill\u2019s house as the defendant followed them in his motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Because Haskill was awaiting the arrival of Hill, he was standing outside his residence. Haskill became upset when he observed Gino Monterio accompanying Hill because he did not like people to know where he resided. Soon after Hill and Gino Monterio arrived at Haskill\u2019s house, Haskill noticed the defendant approaching. The defendant and Haskill had exchanged words in the past concerning the romantic relationship that each had with Kristina Monterio.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Haskill then approached his motor vehicle, a Dodge Neon, which was parked in his driveway, and sat in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>driver\u2019s seat. While Haskill was sitting in the Dodge Neon, he was shot in the head with a .45 caliber handgun. A shell casing from a .45 caliber handgun was recovered by the police department on the passenger side of the Dodge Neon.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The state charged the defendant with attempt to commit murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-54a, assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 and two counts of commission of a class B felony with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the state presented several witnesses, including Haskill, who testified that the defendant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Gino Monterio testified that after the defendant arrived at Hask\u00fcl\u2019s house, Gino Monterio observed the defendant approach the driver\u2019s side of the Dodge Neon with his handgun drawn. The defendant then pointed the handgun at Haskill\u2019s head and fired. After the shooting, Gino Monterio approached the Dodge Neon, observed Haskill\u2019s injuries and then fled from the scene with the defendant. Gino Monterio further testified that, although he had not seen the .45 caliber handgun in the defendant\u2019s possession on that day prior to the shooting, he had seen it in the defendant\u2019s possession on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Hill also provided testimony connecting the defendant to the shooting of Haskill. According to Hill, after Haskill sat in the driver\u2019s seat of the Dodge Neon, the defendant proceeded up Haskill\u2019s driveway, reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>into his pocket and produced a handgun. From his vantage point alongside the passenger side of the Dodge Neon, Hill observed the defendant, who was standing adjacent to the driver\u2019s side, shoot Haskill. Hill also testified that Gino Monterio was standing near him when this incident occurred. After Gino Monterio and the defendant departed from Haskill\u2019s house, Hill approached the Dodge Neon, observed the nonrespon-sive Haskill and left the scene. Hill further testified that after the shooting, he telephoned his girlfriend, Shannon Roche, but he did not tell her that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Haskill testified that as he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the Dodge Neon, the defendant approached the driver\u2019s side, opened the door and shot him in the face with a handgun. Haskill testified that he was positive that the defendant was the person who shot him. Haskill stated that at the time of the shooting, Gino Monterio was standing on the passenger side of the Dodge Neon. Haskill also testified that he had seen the handgun that the defendant used to commit the crime in the defendant\u2019s possession on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The defendant presented Roche as one of his witnesses, and, on direct examination, defense counsel questioned her about a statement that she had made to the police, detailing the telephone conversation she had had with Hill after the shooting. Roche testified that when Hill telephoned her on the night of the shooting, he was crying. During her direct testimony, Roche denied having informed the police that Hill had told her that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill and instead claimed that she had told the police that \u201cGino\u2019s boy\u201d had shot Haskill. Consequently, defense counsel produced Roche\u2019s written police statement, in which she reported that Hill had told her that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill. After rereading her written and signed police statement, Roche again denied telling the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill and continued to assert that she had told the police that Hill had said that \u201cGino\u2019s boy\u201d was responsible for shooting Haskill.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Thereafter, defense counsel offered into evidence, as a prior inconsistent statement, Roche\u2019s written police statement, and the prosecutor objected. Outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the prosecutor argued that if Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement was admitted, then the proffered evidence should be admissible only for the purposes of impeachment and further contended that the court should instruct the jury that it could not consider the prior inconsistent statement for substantive purposes. In response, defense counsel argued that in addition to impeachment purposes, Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement also should be admitted substantively to establish third party culpability. The court then ruled that it would allow the admission of the prior inconsistent statement to impeach the testimony of both Hill and Roche and would provide a limiting instruction to the jury. Following the return of the jury, Roche testified that Hill told her that \u201cGino\u2019s boy\u201d shot Haskill, and she denied reporting to the police that Hill had stated that Gino Monterio shot Haskill. Defense counsel then introduced Roche\u2019s statement as a prior inconsistent statement, and the court instructed the jury that it could consider Roche\u2019s prior statement for the limited purpose of determining the credibility of Hill and Roche and not for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Subsequently, on May 7, 2004, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts, but on October 19, 2004, the court vacated, sua sponte, the guilty verdicts on the two counts of commission of a class B felony with a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also denied the defendant\u2019s motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. Thereafter, on the offense of attempt to commit murder, the court sentenced the defendant to nineteen years to serve plus five years enhancement because of the use of a gun. On the first degree assault count, the court also imposed a sentence, to run concurrently to the sentence for attempt to commit murder, of nineteen years to serve plus five years enhancement for a total effective sentence of twenty-four years incarceration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly permitted the state to present evidence, through the testimony of Haskill and Gino Monterio, of alleged prior misconduct. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly admitted evidence that the defendant had the same gun, which was used to commit the charged crimes, in his possession on prior occasions because such evidence tended to show criminal propensity, was not relevant and was prejudicial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>argues that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony because it was relevant to demonstrate that the defendant had the means to commit the crimes charged. The state further argues that the evidence did not prejudice the defendant. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On appeal, the parties briefed the issue regarding the admissibility of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the gun as prior misconduct evidence, but, at trial, the parties did not refer to the evidence as prior misconduct evidence. However, whether one characterizes the court\u2019s action with respect to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the gun as a simple improper admission of evidence or as an improper admission of prior misconduct, which is a specific type of evidence, the analysis is the same. In each case, we look to the relevance of the evidence and to whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed its potential prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In assessing a defendant\u2019s claim of improper admission of evidence, we employ the following standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>review. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evi-dentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cRelevant evidence, that is, evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence . . . generally is admissible . . . unless its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 50-51, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">During the direct examination of Gino Monterio and prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the evidence, the state made an offer of proof, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, concerning the admission of the evidence. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: What I want to ask the witness, Your Honor, is, had you ever seen that gun before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And under what circumstances\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Seen what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cThe Court: The gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Outside of the jury's presence as part of the offer of proof, Gino Monterio then testified that the defendant had the same handgun on his person, daily, in the weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>prior to the shooting for self-protection. He also testified that he had seen the defendant in possession of other shotguns and anununition prior to the shooting of Haskill.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The prosecutor then advised the court that \u201cfor the purposes of the jury trial, I would claim and wish to elicitbefore the jury the fact that it was [the defendant\u2019s] habit and custom to carry that handgun.\u201d Defense counsel argued that what would be relevant was what happened on the day of the shooting and that the defendant\u2019s possession of the gun on prior days was irrelevant and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">After considering the arguments from both parties, the court allowed Gino Monterio to testify about whether he had seen the particular handgun used in the shooting in the possession of the defendant on previous occasions but not about any other guns or ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Then, Gino Monterio testified before the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: The gun that [the defendant] had, had you seen that particular gun before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, weeks prior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Weeks prior? How many times had you seen that particular gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: Every day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Under what circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: For protection for himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: [The defendant] would carry that gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">The state argues that Gino Monterio\u2019s testimony was relevant to demonstrate that the defendant had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>means to commit the charged crimes. Moreover, the state argues that the evidence did not prejudice the defendant. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">First, we examine the relevance of the evidence. Section 4-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d It is well established that \u201c[ejvidence indicating that an accused possessed an article with which the particular crime charged may have been accomplished is generally relevant to show that the accused had the means to commit the crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>46 Conn. App. 578, 584, 700 A.2d 96, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 584, this court held that the defendant\u2019s brother could testify as to the existence of several large caliber handguns and ammunition in the defendant\u2019s home that he shared with his brother because such evidence was relevant to show that the defendant had the tools necessary to commit the charged offense of murder. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>53 Conn. App. 551, 570-73, 733 A.2d 253 (witness\u2019 testimony about her observations of defendant in possession of same type of handgun used to kill victim was relevant), cert. denied, 250 Conn. 917, 734 A.2d 990 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s possession of the handgun was relevant to the present case. Testimony at trial indicated that a shell casing from a .45 caliber handgun was recovered near the passenger side of the Dodge Neon, and Gino Monterio testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that he had seen the .45 caliber handgun that the defendant used to shoot Haskill in the defendant\u2019s possession on previous occasions. The court properly admitted Gino Monterio\u2019s testimony because it helped the state prove that the defendant had the means necessary for committing the charged crimes. In addition, the evidence was relevant to the state\u2019s case because it helped to establish the elements of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">This court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 584, held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a witness to testify about the presence of large caliber firearms in the defendant\u2019s home before the commission of the crime, even though there was no testimony connecting a particular gun seen in the home on a prior occasion to the gun used to commit the charged crime. In the present case, the connection between the gun used to commit the crime and the defendant is even stronger than in <em>Sivri </em>because testimony linked the gun seen on prior occasions to Hask\u00fcl\u2019s shooting. The jury could infer, on the basis of this evidence, that the defendant used the same gun that Gino Monterio previously had seen in the defendant\u2019s possession to commit the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We next examine whether the prejudicial effect of the admission of Gino Monterio\u2019s testimony relating to the defendant\u2019s gun possession outweighed its probative value. \u201c[Ejvidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett-Gibson, </em>84 Conn. App. 48, 66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>851 A.2d 1214, cert. denied. 271 Conn. 916, 859 A.2d 570 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We conclude that the court carefully and properly balanced the probative value of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the same handgun used in the charged crimes against its prejudice to the defendant. Moreover, to minimize any prejudice to the defendant, the court limited the state\u2019s inquiry concerning the defendant\u2019s possession of firearms to the solicitation of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the particular handgun used in the charged crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court did not allow Gino Monterio to testify about how he had observed the defendant in possession of a shotgun and ammunition clips in Kristina Monterio\u2019s apartment on an occasion prior to the shooting. In addition, in the presence of the jury, Gino Monterio testified only that he had seen the defendant previously with the gun that was used in the shooting and that the defendant used the gun for the purpose of protection. We conclude that the court did not abuse its broad discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The defendant next claims that the court should have admitted, as third party culpability evidence, Roche\u2019s prior written and signed police statement, in which she indicated that Hill had told her in a telephone conversation that Gino Monterio, and not \u201cGino\u2019s boy,\u201d shot Haskill. Specifically, the defendant claims that in refusing to admit Roche\u2019s statement, the court deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. We conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to determine that the evidence could not be used to prove third party culpability, and, in any event, even if improper, the refusal of the court to admit the evidence to establish third party culpability was harmless, as it did not substantially affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Although the defendant frames the issue on appeal as a constitutional violation, our ultimate determination rests on evidentiary grounds; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Galarza, </em>97 Conn. App. 444, 463-64, 906 A.2d 685, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 936, 909 A.2d 962 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>74 Conn. App. 332, 335, 812 A.2d 124 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 953, 818 A.2d 781 (2003); and, therefore, we review the court\u2019s ruling on this evidentiary matter for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>It is well established that \u201ca defendant may introduce evidence which indicates that a third party, and not the defendant, committed the crime with which the defendant is charged. . . . The defendant, however, must show some evidence which directly connects a third party to the crime with which the defendant is charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 354, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002). \u201cUnless that direct connection exists it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Galarza, </em>supra, 97 Conn. App. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense \u201cdoes not require the trial court to forgo completely restraints on the admissibility of evidence. . . . Generally, an accused must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence in exercising his right to present a defense.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerreta, </em>260 Conn. 251, 261, 796 A.2d 1176 (2002). \u201cAlthough exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied mechanistically to deprive a defendant of his rights, the constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wishes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>274 Conn. 605, 624-25, 877 A.2d 787, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1049, 126 S. Ct. 775, 163 L. Ed. 2d 601 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Our Supreme Court has stated that the first criterion governing the admissibility of third party culpability evidence relates to the rules of relevance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 304, 579 A.2d 515 (1990). Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201cThe determination that the proffered testimony is relevant, [however], does not end the inquiry. . . . [T]he court must also determine whether the statement falls within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 305; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 799, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that any exculpatory hearsay evidence is constitutionally required to be admitted, regardless of its admissibility under evidentiary mies); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>50 Conn. App. 268, 279-80, 718 A.2d 450 (holding that defendant was precluded from offering evidence, based on hearsay, to establish third party culpability because without hearsay evidence, no direct connection could be established), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 937, 722 A.2d 1216 (1998). \u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 127, 763 A.2d 1 (2000); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 8-1 (3), 8-2. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-7 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, \u201c[h]earsay within hearsay is admissible only if each part of the combined statements is independently admissible under a hearsay exception.\u201d \u201cWhen a statement is offered that contains hearsay within hearsay, each level of hearsay must itself be supported by an exception to the hearsay rule in order for that level of hearsay to be admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">At trial, the defendant sought to use Roche\u2019s out-of-court statement, which contained Hill\u2019s statement that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill, substantively to prove third party culpability. The court, however, admitted Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement only for the limited purpose of impeaching the testimony of Roche and Hill. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly refused to admit Roche\u2019s police statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>consisting, in part, of a statement made by Hill, as evidence of third party culpability. Guided by the principle that a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense \u201cdoes not require the trial court to forgo completely restraints on the admissibility of evidence\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerreta, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 261; we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement only for the limited purpose of impeaching the credibility of Hill and Roche.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Because it is dispositive, we turn first to <em>Alvarez\u2019 </em>second prong requiring that the evidence fit within some recognized hearsay exception. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 305. Roche\u2019s written police statement and its contents, which the defendant sought to admit as third party culpability evidence, contained two levels of hearsay. The first layer, consisting of Roche\u2019s written and signed police statement, is hearsay because the content of the police statement, which the defendant offered into evidence for the truth of the matter asserted, was made out of court, and Roche was not a party to the case. In addition to this first level of hearsay, the document also contained Roche\u2019s iteration of Hill\u2019s statement, indicating that Gino Monterio had shot Haskill, which constitutes a second layer of hearsay. We will examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1986), our Supreme Court carved out a hearsay exception for a prior inconsistent written statement, allowing the statement to be admitted for substantive purposes, rather than only for impeachment purposes, if the following conditions have been satisfied: \u201c(1) the statement is signed by the declarant; (2) the declarant has personal knowledge of the facts stated; and (3) the declarant testifies at trial and is available for cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>260 Conn. 730, 737, 799 A.2d 1056 (2002); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5, commentary (noting that Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 8-5 [1] codified <em>Whelan </em>rule and incorporated all of its subsequent developments and clarifications). A statement meeting the <em>Whelan </em>requirements will be admissible, unless the trial court, acting as a gatekeeper, determines that the \u201ccircumstances under which the statement was made nonetheless render it so unreliable that a jury should not be permitted to consider it for substantive purposes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 307 n.27, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan </em>is a matter within the wide discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 596, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). We conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that the court abused its discretion in declining to admit Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for substantive purposes under <em>Whelan. </em>Even in his reply brief, the defendant failed to analyze the essential <em>Whelan </em>elements and to relate them to the facts of his case. Although Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement was in writing and signed by Roche, and Roche testified at trial and was available for cross-examination, the defendant has not provided any analysis as to whether Roche had personal knowledge of the facts stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our Supreme Court has concluded that although \u201c \u2018the personal knowledge\u2019 prong of the <em>Whelan </em>rule does not require that the declarant have witnessed the commission of the crime that is the subject of the prior inconsistent written or recorded statement\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 99, 602 A.2d 581 (1992); our case law makes clear that a declarant will be said to possess personal knowledge in such a situation \u201c [i]f the substance of the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is an admission made by the defendant to the witness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 22, 629 A.2d 386 (1993); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 58-59, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006). In the present case, even if Roche\u2019s statement satisfied the other requirements for admissibility under <em>Whelan, </em>the words spoken to Roche were by Hill and not by the defendant as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 22. The defendant has provided us with no analysis as to how Roche\u2019s police statement would satisfy the personal knowledge prong, and we decline to make such argument on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In his reply brief, the defendant also argues that the statement Hill made to Roche during their telephone conversation qualifies as a spontaneous utterance, and, therefore, the court improperly concluded that Hill\u2019s statement was not admissible substantively as an exception to the hearsay rule. Under the spontaneous utterance exception, \u201c[h]earsay statements, otherwise inadmissible, may be admitted into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein when (1) the declaration follows a startling occurrence, (2) the declaration refers to that occurrence, (3) the declarant observed the occurrence, and (4) the declaration is made under circumstances that negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 41-42, 770 A.2d 908 (2001); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (2) (\u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declar-ant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201cThe requirement that a spontaneous utterance be made under such circumstances to [negate] the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant . . . does not preclude the admission of statements made after a startling occurrence as long as the statement is made under the stress of that occurrence. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>While [a] short time between the incident and the statement is important, it is not dispositive.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 42. The trial court has broad discretion in determining whether an utterance is spontaneous, and this determination \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal absent an unreasonable exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 766, 719 A.2d 440 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S. Ct. 1116, 143 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A key element of the spontaneous utterance exception is that the statement was spontaneous, as evidenced by a showing that the declarant made the statement before he had time for deliberation, reflection or fabrication. In the present case, the record provides no indication of when Hill telephoned Roche, except that the telephone call occurred on the same day as the shooting. Although we are cognizant that \u201cthere is no identifiable discrete time interval within which an utterance becomes spontaneous\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 375, 908 A.2d 506 (2006); under the circumstances of this case, there is no evidence in the record from which we could conclude that Hill \u201cmade the statement before he . . . had the opportunity to undertake a reasoned reflection of the event described therein.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Westberry, </em>68 Conn. App. 622, 628, 792 A.2d 154, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519 (2002). In his reply brief, the defendant urges us to determine that the court could have concluded that \u201cthe statement was made close in time to the incident, since Roche said that Hill was \u2018crying like a girl\u2019 and very upset.\u201d Although the statement was made on the same night as the shooting, evidence was not submitted about how much time had passed between the statement and the shooting. Furthermore, knowledge of human nature teaches us that grieving people may cry about upsetting events long after they are over. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>more evidence as to the passage of time between the incident and the utterance and how the statement came to be made, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in refusing to admit this statement into evidence as a spontaneous utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has failed to prove that the court abused its discretion in declining to admit Roche\u2019s written statement, which contained a remark made by Hill. There is nothing in the record to support the admissibility of each of the two levels of hearsay, which would have been necessary to admit Roche\u2019s statement into evidence for substantive purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">As a final matter, although not required, we do resolve the defendant\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s refusal to admit Roche\u2019s written statement for the substantive purpose of establishing third party culpability constituted harmful error warranting a new trial. Even if we were to conclude, which we do not, that the court improperly refused to admit Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement and its contents substantively, we nonetheless would conclude that under the circumstances of this case, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The defendant claims that the exclusion of Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent statement to prove third party culpability amounted to a constitutional violation requiring the state to prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant, however, provides no citation to legal authority to support this proposition. In part II A, we noted that the impropriety alleged by the defendant is not constitutional in nature, but rather is evidentiary. The defendant, therefore, bears the burden, on appeal, of establishing harmful error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 352, 904 A.2d 101 (2006). Our Supreme Court recently concluded in <em>Sawyer </em>that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury\u2019s verdict was substantially swayed by the error.\u201d Id., 357. This standard \u201cexpressly requires the reviewing court to consider the effect of the erroneous ruling on the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>280 Conn. 285, 307, 907 A.2d 73 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In applying the standard articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 357, we do not have a \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the alleged error substantially affected the verdict, and, therefore, we conclude that the defendant has not satisfied his burden of demonstrating the existence of harmful error. Several factors guide our determination that the defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the alleged error was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">With respect to the court\u2019s refusal to admit Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent written statement for substantive purposes pursuant to the hearsay exception enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, we find our Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 595 A.2d 322 (1991), instructive. In <em>Tatum, </em>a witness testified at trial that the defendant was responsible for killing the victim, and the defendant sought to admit the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement for its substantive truth that a person other than the defendant had shot the victim. Id., 737. The trial court, however, limited the use of the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement to evaluating his credibility. Id. After acknowledging that the failure to give the requested <em>Whelan </em>instruction constituted error, our Supreme Court noted that if the court had permitted the substantive use of the witness\u2019 prior identification of another person as the perpetrator, the jury could have concluded that, someone other than the defendant had killed the victim. Id., 737-39. On the other hand, our Supreme Court also explained that when the court limited the use of the prior inconsistent statement to impeachment purposes only, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>could have concluded that the witness may have been \u201cmistaken when he identified the defendant as the perpetrator since he had previously identified someone else.\u201d Id., 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Our Supreme Court then concluded that the defendant had not demonstrated harmful error affecting the verdict because \u201cin both instances the jury would have been authorized to use the prior inconsistent statement to find that the defendant had not committed [the crime], either because [the witness] was lying at trial when he asserted that the defendant was the guilty party or because [the witness] was telling the truth when he had previously stated that [a person other than the defendant] was the guilty party.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>227 Conn. 677, 699-702, 631 A.2d 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 739, the jury in the present case could have found the defendant not guilty, based on reasonable doubt, on the basis of Roche\u2019s prior inconsistent written statement, describing Gino Monterio as the shooter, even though the statement was admitted only for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Moreover, the strength of the state\u2019s case against the defendant militates against a conclusion by this court that the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit Roche\u2019s police statement, containing Hill\u2019s comment, had the effect of substantially swaying the jury\u2019s verdict. The present case did not rest only on Roche\u2019s testimony that Hill identified the defendant as the shooter. Rather, properly admitted evidence was elicited from the testimony of three of the state\u2019s witnesses, all of whom unequivocally identified the defendant as the shooter. Haskill, the victim of the shooting, was one of the three eyewitnesses, and he testified that the defendant approached the Dodge Neon in which he was sitting and shot him in the face with a handgun. Testimony placing the defendant near the driver\u2019s side of Haskill\u2019s Dodge Neon and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the other witnesses near the passenger side, coupled with the other evidence, supports the identification of the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In light of the minimal effect of the challenged ruling, and the compelling, properly admitted evidence indicating that the defendant was the shooter, we conclude that the failure to admit the evidence, even if improper, was harmless and that it did not have a substantial effect on the jury\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

As a result, we will not review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim that the court improperly allowed Haskill to testify about his observations of the defendant carrying the gun on prior occasions.
