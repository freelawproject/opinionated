We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 12,2003, Lou DeRubeis, a Stamford police officer, was assigned to conduct a seat belt enforcement checkpoint. He observed the defendant operating a gray motor vehicle without wearing his seat belt. Earlier that day, DeRubeis had learned that there was a possible active arrest warrant for an individual named Paul Campbell. DeRubeis followed the defendant, whom he had recognized from prior police encounters as Paul Campbell. After learning that a warrant in fact existed for Paul Campbell with a date of birth of 1966, DeRubeis activated his vehicle\u2019s lights and sirens and stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As DeRubeis approached the vehicle, the defendant began screaming obscenities at him. The defendant\u2019s tirade prevented DeRubeis from having any meaningful conversation with him. DeRubeis eventually managed to ask the defendant for his driver\u2019s license and date of birth, but the defendant refused to cooperate. Carlos Vinhais, a state police trooper, drove by and heard the defendant yelling at DeRubeis. Vinhais turned his vehicle around in order to assist DeRubeis and to ensure his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As Vinhais approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle on foot, DeRubeis observed that pedestrians had started to gather and that traffic had begun to back up. The defendant failed to comply with Vinhais\u2019 instruction to shut the engine off. Vinhais opened the passenger door, reached into the vehicle, turned off the engine and removed the keys from the ignition. The defendant began clenching his fists and rocking back and forth. At this point, DeRubeis decided to place the defendant under arrest and ordered him to step outside of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>vehicle. When the defendant refused, DeRubeis and Vinhais forcibly removed him from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">While restraining the defendant, DeRubeis observed in plain view a knife located in an open compartment of the driver\u2019s side door. The length of the blade was 4.75 inches. The defendant was escorted to the backseat of DeRubeis\u2019 patrol vehicle. DeRubeis again asked the defendant for his date of birth. The defendant complied and, at that point, DeRubeis learned that the arrest warrant was not for the defendant but for another individual named Paul Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The defendant was charged, tried and convicted. The court sentenced him to a total effective term of five years incarceration, suspended after eighteen months, and five years probation. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the crime of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. Specifically, he argues that the court failed to instruct the jury as to the element of the absence of a permit for the weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that this claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>unpreserved and seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state responds that the defendant induced or waived any error and therefore cannot prevail on his claim. We agree with the state\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. Following closing arguments, the court reviewed its proposed jury charge with the parties. With respect to the charge of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle, the court stated: \u201cI want to go over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>that with you because it seems to me there [are] four statutory elements, three of which were applicable in this particular case. The first being that the defendant owned, operated or occupied a motor vehicle. The second being that the defendant had a weapon in the vehicle. And the third being that the defendant knew the weapon was in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u201cIt is interesting that the fourth element you usually give [to the jury] is [that] the defendant did not possess a permit for the weapon. Many times you are dealing with a pistol or a firearm. Sometimes you can have fishing and hunting permits. There is a whole list or plethora of statutory exceptions as to how you can carry it, none of which I thought were justified by the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u201cNow, there are two ways of handling this. Either I can mention this, that he did not possess a permit for a weapon, such as\u2014and give examples. Or I can go through all the statutory exceptions. I am of the opinion that that would simply confuse the jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Defense counsel agreed with the court and requested that this portion of the instruction not be given to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor argued for the inclusion of the statutory exceptions in the charge to the jury. The prosecutor contended that this would assist the members of the jury to understand that, although some circumstances permit the carrying of weapon in a vehicle, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>defendant did not fall within these statutory exceptions. Defense counsel responded to the prosecutor\u2019s argument by stating: \u201cWell, Your Honor, I thought we were going to take out the part about the permits because I thought that it made it easier for the jury to understand. \u201d After the court indicated that it would not give the charge requested by the state, defense counsel indicated that he did not \u201csee any problem with that the way that is.\u201d Finally, after the court decided that it would not instruct the jury on the permit exception, defense counsel stated: \u201cI am satisfied with the way it is, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We conclude that the defendant is precluded from claiming that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury as to the element of the absence of a permit for the weapon because he induced the court to eliminate that instruction. \u201cThe term induced error, or invited error, has been defined as [a]n error that a party cannot complain of on appeal because the party, through conduct, encouraged or prompted the trial court to make the erroneous ruling. ... It is well established that a party who induces an error cannot be heard to later complain about that error. . . . [T]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] ... his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>88 Conn. App. 393, 397-98, 870 A.2d 1095 (2005). Our Supreme Court has held that <em>Golding </em>review will not be afforded in cases of induced error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 105-107, 848 A.2d 445 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 456, 862 A.2d 817 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>270 Conn. 55, 66-68, 850 A.2d 1040 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Felder, </em>95 Conn.

Accordingly, we will not review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 provides: \u201c(a) Any person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by such person, any weapon, any pistol or revolver for which a proper permit has not been issued as provided in section 29-28 or any machine gun which has not been registered as required by section 53-202, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both, and the presence of any such weapon, pistol or revolver, or machine gun in any vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the owner, operator and each occupant thereof.
