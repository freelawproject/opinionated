D.L.T. appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred by denying D.L.T.\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u00b63 D.L.T. was arrested in Poison, Montana, after allegedly assaulting her husband while on a family visit there, and ultimately charged with partner or family member assault and resisting arrest. The Poison City Court released her on bond, on condition that she undergo psychological evaluation. Dr. Mary Ann Evans (Dr. Evans) initially evaluated D.L.T. at Benefis Hospital in Great Falls. D.L.T. left the hospital before the evaluation was complete and went to Malmstrom Air Force Base (MAFB), where her family resides. Air Force authorities brought her to Dr. Mark Moser (Dr. Moser), the MAFB psychiatrist, with whom she waited until deputies from the Cascade County Sheriffs Office arrived and returned her to Benefis Hospital for further evaluation by Dr. Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u00b64 The Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office (State) petitioned the District Court to determine that D.L.T. was suffering from a mental disorder and commit her to a mental health facility. At a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>July 18, 2002, D.L.T. objected to the admissibility of certain evidence and the court overruled the objections. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, D.L.T. moved for a directed verdict and the District Court denied her motion. Following the hearing, the court issued its findings, conclusions and order committing D.L.T. to the Montana State Hospital. D.L.T. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b65 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence and by denying D.L.T.\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b66 D.L.T. argues that the District Court erred in overruling her evidentiary objections during the State\u2019s presentation of evidence. Because her objections should have been sustained, she asserts the State did not introduce evidence required by statute and, consequently, the court also erred in denying her later motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hope, </em>2001 MT 207, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 334, \u00b6 11, 33 P.3d 629, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). We also review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion for a directed verdict for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6 25, 301 Mont. 259, \u00b6 25, 9 P.3d 38, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b68  The statutes governing involuntary commitments in Montana are contained in Title 53, Chapter 21, Part 1, MCA. We require that those laws be strictly followed, since they \u201care of critical importance because of the \u2018calamitous effect of a commitment,\u2019 including loss of liberty and damage to a person\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>In re T.J.D., </em>2002 MT 24, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 222, \u00b6 20, 41 P.3d 323, \u00b6 20 (citing <em>In re R.M. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 40, 44, 889 P.2d 1201, 1204 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b69 Section 53-21-126(1), MCA, authorizes the involuntary commitment of a person suffering from a mental disorder if the person poses an \u201cimminent threat of injury\u201d to the person or others. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA, requires that \u201c[i]mminent threat of ... injury to others ... be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the [person]\u2019s present condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b610  A professional person appointed by the court must examine the person against whom a petition is filed and report to the court; the report must state whether the professional person recommends commitment. Section 53-21-123(1), MCA. The professional person must be present at the trial and his or her report \u201cmay be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Section 53-21-126(3), MCA. As applied to the present case, the testimony of the professional person is insufficient unless accompanied by evidence that \u201cthere is an imminent threat of injury to the [person] or to others because of the [personj\u2019s acts or omissions,\u201d or \u201cthe [person] has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b611 The State called Dr. Evans as its only witness at trial. Dr. Evans testified regarding matters reported to her by D.L.T.\u2019s husband and parents, and by Dr. Moser and the Poison City Court judge. D.L.T.\u2019s family members reported disturbing behavior by D.L.T., including one incident some years before in which she threw her infant son to her father while yelling a profanity. The criminal charges pending in Poison City Court alleged D.L.T. had recently assaulted her husband. Dr. Moser described D.L.T.\u2019s behavior to Dr. Evans as like a \u201clive wire\u201d while waiting at MAFB for sheriffs deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b612 D.L.T. objected to Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony reiterating the information reported to her by others on hearsay grounds, and the District Court overruled her objections. On appeal, she asserts the only evidence introduced of her recent \u201covert act[s] or omission[s]\u201d was Dr. Evans\u2019 inadmissible hearsay and that, the District Court having abused its discretion in admitting the evidence, the court also abused its discretion in denying her motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b613 \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. Unless an exception applies, hearsay is not admissible. Rule 802, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b614 The State neither concedes that Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony contained inadmissible hearsay nor contests D.L.T.\u2019s argument characterizing the testimony as hearsay. Instead, the State argues that sufficient evidence in the record, \u201c[a]side [f]rom [inadmissible [h]earsay,\u201d supports the District Court\u2019s determination that D.L.T. poses an imminent threat to herself and others. Specifically, the State contends information about the Poison incident is contained in a restraining order obtained by D.L.T.\u2019s husband and is further supported by the existence of criminal charges filed in the Poison City Court. The State asserts these documents are public records of which the District Court could take judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b615 We will not consider whether the District Court <em>could </em>take judicial notice of any public records, because the record before us is devoid of any request that it do so. Moreover, the District Court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>for commitment clearly reflects that it is based on Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b616 The State also asks that we overlook the fact that it did not present any testimony from D.L.T.\u2019s husband, based on its representations to the District Court that he loves his wife and feared his presence might \u201cagitate\u201d her. D.L.T.\u2019s husband\u2019s motives aside, the State was obligated in this case, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(2) and (4), MCA, to introduce evidence of D.L.T.\u2019s recent overt acts or omissions separate from the professional person\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b617  The only evidence the State presented at D.L.T.\u2019s commitment hearing was Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony. Therefore, the only evidence of D.L.T.\u2019s \u201cact[s] or omission[s]\u201d leading to injury or imminent threat of injury to herself or others, as required by \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), (2) and (4)(c), MCA, is the statements of persons not present at the hearing, which were introduced for purposes of proving D.L.T.\u2019s acts. This evidence is, on the face of it, hearsay, and the State does not raise on appeal-and did not raise at trial-any applicable exception. We conclude the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the statements of D.L.T.\u2019s husband, the Poison City Court judge, and Dr. Moser-all presented via Dr. Evans\u2019 testimony-for the truth of the matters stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b618  The State having failed to introduce the evidence required by \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA, the statutory criteria for involuntary commitment were not met. Because the statutory criteria were not met, and because the laws regarding involuntary commitment must be strictly followed, <em>T.J.D., </em>\u00b6 20, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in denying D.L.T.\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. Consequently, we hold the court erred in committing D.L.T. to the Montana State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">\u00b619 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b321-8\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"A1E\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b620 Disregarding the hearsay matters, I believe there was sufficient testimony presented by Dr. Evans to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that D.L.T. was a danger to herself and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00b621 Dr. Evans testified that D.L.T. suffered from a serious mental illness which she diagnosed as bipolar affective disorder. More problematical, D.L.T. was refusing medication. The psychiatrist further observed that D.L.T. was not a cooperative patient nor did she respond well to treatment recommendations. It was Dr. Evans\u2019 opinion that D.L.T. suffered from a lack of insight which she characterized as delusional and psychotic. Because of this combination, Dr. Evans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>testified that D.L.T.\u2019s untreated mental condition posed a threat to the community. These observations and medical conclusions were not based on hearsay but on Dr. Evans\u2019 personal observations. In my view, this testimony alone supports the District Court\u2019s commitment. The District Court focused on this testimony and also concluded that D.L.T. was a threat to the community in her untreated condition. See Finding of Fact No. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b622 I would affirm the District Court and dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
