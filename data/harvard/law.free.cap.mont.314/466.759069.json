She contended that because the benefits provided to her for partial disability pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA (1997), were less than provided for the same partial disability pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1997), of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, she was denied equal protection of the law in violation of Article II, Sec. 4 of the Montana Constitution. After the parties agreed on the relevant facts, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that based on our decision in <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456, Stavenjord had been denied equal protection of the law and entered judgment for her in the amount she would have received pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The Montana State Fund appeals from that conclusion. We affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b62 The Montana State Fund raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"AGT\">\u00b63 1. Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court abused its discretion when it declined to reopen the record at the request of the Respondent to allow additional evidence of the historical and anatomical differences between injuries and occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"Abd\">\u00b64 2. Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1997), of the Occupational Disease Act violated the equal protection clause of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u00b65 The parties agreed to the following facts which form the basis for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">\u00b66 Debra Stavenjord contracted an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of her employment with Prairie Nest Ranch in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Cascade County, Montana, on April 1,1998, when she was diagnosed with epicondylitis of both elbows. She had surgery on both elbows. She also had cervical disc removal surgery. (It is not clear from the facts whether the cervical disc removal surgery was related to her occupational disease.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b67 At the time of her injury, Stavenjord\u2019s employer was enrolled in compensation plan III of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and its insurer was the State Compensation Insurance Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b68 After Stavenjord reached maximum medical improvement, she was given a 12% impairment rating of the whole person. As a result of her condition, her lifting ability had been diminished. She had previously been able to perform heavy work but as a result of her condition, could only perform work in the \u201clight\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b69 Stavenjord sustained a wage loss of more than $2 per hour and would have been entitled to a permanent partial disability rate of $198 under the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Because of the extent of her impairment, her age (45 years), her education (11th grade), her lifting restrictions and her wage loss, she would have been entitled to $27,027 for permanent partial disability benefits if her entitlement was calculated pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1997), the partial disability provision of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b610 However, the maximum that Stavenjord could recover pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1997), of the Occupational Disease Act, even though she suffered a wage loss and could no longer return to her former employment, was $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b611 In the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, Stavenjord argued that \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA (1997), violated her right to equal protection of the law by limiting her to less compensation for her disability than she would be entitled to for the same degree of disability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. She invoked her right to equal protection pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. She contended that her situation was similar to that of the petitioner in <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456, and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">\u00b612 In response, the State Fund argued that benefits provided pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-405(2), MCA, are not technically \u201cpartial disability\u201d benefits; the class of claimants entitled to benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are not similarly situated to those claiming benefits pursuant to the Occupational Disease Act; and that the public policy set forth at \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (1997), to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>benefits to injured or diseased workers in an expeditious fashion with a minimal amount of legal involvement provided a rational basis for treating the two classes differently. The State Fund also contended that this state\u2019s ability to compete with other states economically would be affected by the nature and amount of benefits provided for work-related injuries and diseases and that the disparate treatment of injured and diseased workers furthered that economic interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b613 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that its decision was compelled by our decision in <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>and that the broad language used in that opinion contraindicated limiting its affect to only the type of benefits (vocational rehabilitation benefits) at issue in that case. As a result, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that Stavenjord was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits in the amount of $27,027.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b614 After the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision and judgment were entered, the State Fund moved for reconsideration or rehearing and for an order re-opening evidence. The State Fund sought to offer additional evidence of the historical difference between injuries and occupational diseases. Those motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b615  Whether to reopen a case for the introduction of further evidence after the case has been submitted to the court is within the discretion of the trial court. Its ruling, upon the request to reopen, will not be disturbed by this Court unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Cole v. Helena Light &amp; Ry. Co. </em>(1914), 49 Mont. 443, 143 P. 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b616 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision on the merits was based on its construction of constitutional law. We review conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Henry, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT 70, \u00b6 7, 294 Mont. 17, \u00b6 7, 977 P.2d 1000, \u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">\u00b617 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court abuse its discretion when it declined to reopen the record at the request of the Respondent to allow additional evidence of the historical and anatomical differences between injuries and occupational diseases?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\u00b618 The State Fund contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court abused its discretion when it denied its motion to reopen evidence so that it could offer statistical evidence demonstrating that most occupational disease claims do not involve herniated intervertebral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>discs such as were at issue in <em>Henry </em>and that, therefore, the traditional reasons for treating occupational diseases differently from injuries are as applicable now as ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b619 In <em>Cole, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">The reopening of a case for the introduction of further evidence after it has been closed is within the discretion of the trial court. Its ruling upon the request to reopen will not be disturbed by the appellate court, unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Cole, </em>49 Mont. at 453, 143 P. at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b620 In <em>Kipp v. Wong </em>(1974), 163 Mont. 476, 484, 517 P.2d 897, 902, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">Ordinarily neither denial of reopening for testimony of a witness available during reception of evidence at the trial nor denial of reopening absent a showing of a witness\u2019s qualifications and the materiality of his testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b621  We conclude that the State Fund could have offered the evidence for which it sought to reopen its case prior to the close of evidence and that it did not demonstrate the materiality of the evidence in support of its motion to reopen. The State Fund sought to prove the nature of most occupational disease claims and their similarity to the traditional occupational diseases discussed by this Court in <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 332, 777 P.2d 862. However, Stavenjord\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA (1997), was not based on the traditional treatment of occupational diseases nor the types of claims that are currently being brought by others. It was based upon the current definition of occupational disease as opposed to the current definition of injury and based upon her own condition of epicondylitis, which the State concedes is an inflammatory disease of the connective tissues of the elbow which develops over time. Stavenjord\u2019s affliction is exactly the kind of condition that would traditionally have been treated as an injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but is no longer treated as such based upon definitional changes made to \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, and \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA, in 1987. For example, in <em>Hoehne v. Granite Lumber Co. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 221, 615 P.2d 863, we held that Carpel Tunnel Syndrome caused over time by the continual strain involved in lifting and stacking lumber was an injury pursuant to the definition formerly found at \u00a7 39-71-119(1), MCA, even though it could not be related to any specific incident and \u201cdeveloped gradually\u201d over time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>We held that pursuant to the pre-1987 definition of injury, all that had to be shown was a chain of actions resulting in physical harm to some part of the body from unusual strain. <em>Hoehne, </em>189 Mont. at 225, 615 P.2d at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b622  Therefore, because there is no indication that the evidence which the State Fund sought to offer following trial was not available prior to trial and because the evidence of other claims for occupational disease were not material to the issue involved in this case, we conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the State Fund\u2019s motion to reopen the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b623 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it concluded that \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1997), of the Occupational Disease Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b624 The State Fund contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by concluding that \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA (1997), violates Stavenjord\u2019s right to equal protection of the law because 1) injured workers and those with occupational diseases are not similarly situated; 2) if this Court concludes they are similarly situated, there is a legitimate government interest in treating the two classes differently; and 3) the manner in which the legislature has chosen to treat the two classes is rationally related to that legitimate interest. The State Fund also contends that this case presents facts more similar to those before the Court in <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(where the Court was asked to address the equal protection issue based on a difference in the amount of benefits provided) than <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(where workers with occupational diseases were completely denied the vocational rehabilitation benefit at issue.) Finally, the State Fund asks that we limit our holding in <em>Henry </em>to the unique factual circumstances presented in that case where a worker was denied benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act simply because his herniated intervertebral disc was caused over two work shifts rather than one.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b625 Stavenjord, of course, contends that her right to equal protection was violated for the same reason that we concluded that Jerry Henry\u2019s right to equal protection was violated and that the result in this case is compelled by our decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b626 Before considering our decisions in <em>Eastman </em>and <em>Henry </em>and applying them to the circumstances before us, it is appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>consider the statutory framework applicable to Debra Stavenjord\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b627 The legislature\u2019s objective for enactment of the 1997 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and Occupational Disease Act as they relate to compensation of workers who sustain a reduction in their earning capacity due to a work-related injury or disease is set forth in the legislature\u2019s declaration of public policy found at \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (1997), which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">For the purposes of interpreting and applying Title 39, chapters 71 and 72, the following is the public policy of this state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">(1) <em>It is an objective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system to provide, without regard to fault, wage supplement and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. </em>Wage-loss benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole; <em>they are intended to assist a worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. </em>Within that limitation, <em>the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work related injury or disease. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b628 The manner in which the legislature sought to provide a partial wage loss benefit for workers suffering an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined at \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1997), is set forth at \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1997), of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Without setting forth that statute in its entirety, it provides for a partial disability benefit based on the injured worker\u2019s actual wage loss, permanent impairment, age, education and occupational limitations. The parties agree that based on those factors, if Stavenjord had met the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d she would have been entitled to permanent partial disability benefits in the amount of $27,027.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b629 However, the legislature sought to compensate workers who suffer a wage loss as the result of an occupational disease at \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA (1997), of the Occupational Disease Act which provides that when an employee cannot return to his or her employment due to an occupational disease and suffers a wage loss as a result, that employee can be paid an amount not exceeding $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b630 We first considered disparate legislative treatment under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the Occupational Disease Act in <em>Eastman. </em>In that case, the claimant had been employed as a welder for Atlantic Richfield Company\u2019s aluminum plant from 1977 until 1985. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease leading to steroid dependency which caused severe physical and emotional side affects. He petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>compensation benefits based on his contention that his condition had been aggravated by a single incident which led to smoke and fume inhalation while at work. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that he suffered from an occupational disease and was limited to $10,000 of benefits pursuant to the Occupational Disease Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b631 Eastman appealed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decision. However, according to the dissenting opinion, Eastman was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[Fjorced to surmount hurdles that would challenge even the greatest trial tactician. He appears before this Court pro se because his attorney, after collecting his fee, merged his law firm with the firm representing Arco.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 343, 777 P.2d at 868 (Hunt, J., dissenting). \u00b632 Whatever the reason, Eastman filed his appeal and his brief on appeal without the benefit of counsel. Furthermore, the equal protection issue for which this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Eastman </em>is cited, had not even been raised in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court when he was represented by counsel. Normally this Court would not reach a constitutional issue under those circumstances. Currently this Court would at least not allow the result to be cited a precedent under those circumstances. However, in <em>Eastman </em>the Court, in a 4-3 opinion, acknowledged the general rule and then, without the benefit of adequate briefing by Eastman, decided the issue anyway. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">It is a general rule that new issues may not be raised for the first time on appeal. [Citation omitted.] However, this Court \u201creserves to itself the power to examine constitutional issues that involve broad public concerns,\u201d and even if raised for the first time on appeal, this Court can hear the issue if the alleged error affects the substantial right of a litigant. [Citation omitted.] <em>Claimant has not briefed his constitutional contentions in detail. </em>Nonetheless, considering the nature of such contentions as well as his pro se status, we will consider his constitutional challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeP\"><em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 337, 777 P.2d at 865 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b633 The Court then went on to decide the constitutional rights of the pro se claimant whose trial counsel had not raised the constitutional issue and who had not briefed his constitutional contentions in detail adversely to the claimant. More importantly, the Court decided the issue based on the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d found at \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1985) -not the definition at issue in this case. <em>See Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 341, 777 P.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b634 In <em>Eastman, </em>the Court first concluded that no fundamental right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>was at issue and that the disparate treatment of injured and diseased workers should be analyzed under the rational basis test which required a legitimate government objective which bore some rational relationship to the classifications in question. The Court proceeded to discuss the historical substitution of the no-fault compensation act for the type of injuries that were the subject of common law liability for employers and the more recent enactment of the Occupational Disease Act in 1959 as the incidents of devastating diseases in the work place also increased. <em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 338-39, 777 P.2d 865-66. Then, without further analysis, the Court concluded that there was a rational basis for the enactment of the Occupational Disease Act and that <em>Eastman, </em>the pro se claimant, \"... has failed to show that the legislature is required to award the same or comparable benefits under the Occupational Disease Act as compared to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b635 The Court concluded without further explanation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">We hold that there is a rational basis for the benefits awarded trader the Occupational Disease Act and that the claimant has failed to establish a violation under the equal protection clauses of the Montana Constitution and of the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\"><em>Eastman, </em>237 Mont. at 339, 777 P.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b636 Ten years later, following substantial revision to the definitions of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201coccupational disease\u201d by the 1987 Legislature, this Court considered a second challenge to disparate treatment of workers with \u201cinjuries\u201d and workers with \u201coccupational diseases\u201d in <em>Henry. </em>In that case, the claimant, Jerry Henry, suffered a herniated intervertebral disc in his back while moving and lifting appliances for his employer. However, the injury apparently occurred over more than one work shift because it was treated as an occupational disease. After reaching maximum medical improvement, Henry sought but was denied rehabilitation benefits because they were not available under the Occupational Disease Act even though Henry was unable to return to the job he performed at the time of his injury as a result of his herniated disc. On appeal, Henry contended that he was denied equal protection of the law based on the fact that he was denied benefits for an occupational disease that were available pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act if he had been \u201cinjured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b637 We began our analysis with a historical review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the Occupational Disease Act. We acknowledged, as we did in <em>Eastman, </em>that the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>system is an outgrowth of tort law, <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 12; that the workers\u2019 compensation system was not originally designed to compensate workers suffering from occupational diseases, <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 13; but that due to the frequency of diseases such as silicosis and asbestosis in the work place, the Occupational Disease Act was finally enacted in Montana in 1959. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 14. We noted that based on the historical circumstances that gave rise to each act, an \u201cinjury\u201d was defined differently from an \u201coccupational disease\u201d but that in 1987, those terms were significantly redefined so that now, rather than focusing on the nature of the medical condition, the terms are differentiated based on the number of work shifts over which a worker contracts an affliction. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15 and 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b638 We pointed out that the public policy of the 1987 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and Occupational Disease Act, as it relates to vocational rehabilitation benefits, was set forth in \u00a7 39-71-105(2), MCA (1987), where the legislature provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">[I]t is an objective of the workers\u2019 compensation system to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the worker has a suffered a work related injury or disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b639 We pointed out, however, that vocational rehabilitation benefits for the purpose of getting workers back to work were only provided for in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and not the Occupational Disease Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b640 In <em>Henry, </em>for the purposes of equal protection analysis of benefits provided to injured or diseased workers, we applied the rational basis test and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">The rational basis test requires the government to show (1) that the statute\u2019s objective was legitimate, and (2) that the statute\u2019s objective bears a rational relationship to the classification used by the legislature. Stated another way, the statute must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\"><em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u00b641 We identified the Legislature\u2019s objective as the declaration of public policy previously set forth from \u00a7 39-71-105(2), MCA (1987), and agreed that the early return to work of an employee following an injury or disease is a legitimate objective. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35. However, we held that elimination of workers suffering occupational diseases from access to rehabilitation benefits bore no rational relationship to the government objective of returning workers to work as soon as possible. We held that there was no rational basis for providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>rehabilitation benefits to workers based simply on the number of work shifts over which a worker is injured. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Furthermore, we held that economic reasons are not sufficient justification for treating the class of workers injured during one shift differently from the class of workers injured from activity or events that occurred over more than one work shift. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b642 We distinguished <em>Henry </em>from <em>Eastman </em>for two reasons. The first was that in <em>Eastman, </em>the Court was concerned with the degree of benefits awarded to a similarly situated claimant while in <em>Henry </em>one group of similarly situated claimants was totally denied a type of benefit. It is on that language that the State Fund now relies for its argument that this case is more similar to <em>Eastman </em>than to <em>Henry. </em>However, we also distinguished <em>Eastman </em>for the following reason which is equally applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Second, Eastman filed his claim for compensation benefits in 1985, prior to the 1987 amendments to the WCA and the ODA. As pointed out earlier, after the 1987 amendments to the WCA and the ODA, the definitions of \u201cinjury\u2019 and \u201coccupational disease\u201d no longer focus on the nature of the medical condition, but rather focus on the number of work shifts over which the worker incurs an injury. Thus, the historical justification for treating workers differently under the WCA and the ODA no longer exists. Indeed, the entire underpinnings of <em>Eastman </em>have evaporated, rendering its continued validity questionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b643 In <em>Henry, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">[T]hat providing rehabilitation benefits to workers covered by the WCA, but not to workers covered by the ODA, is not rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of returning workers to work as soon as possible after they have suffered a work related injury. We hold that the ODA violates the equal protection clause of the Montana Constitution to the extent that it fails to provide vocational rehabilitation benefits ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\"><em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b644 We conclude that our reasoning in <em>Henry </em>is equally applicable to the facts before us and that our holding in <em>Henry </em>compels the result reached by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b645  As we have previously stated, legislative enactments are presumed constitutional and the party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>70, \u00b6 8, 294 Mont. 17, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 1000, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b646 As we did in <em>Henry, </em>we identify the two classes involved in the present case as those workers whose benefits are provided for pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and those workers whose benefits are provided for pursuant to the Occupational Disease Act. However, since 1987, they are distinguished merely by the number of work shifts over which their work-related affliction is sustained. Therefore, as in <em>Henry, </em>the two classes on appeal remain \u201c(1) workers who suffer a work related injury on one shift; and (2) workers who suffered a work related injury on more than one work shift.\u201d <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 27. We conclude that they are similarly situated because regardless of the number of days over which their condition occurs or the mechanism which causes their affliction, they are, for purposes of the facts in this case, both physically impaired as a result of work related activity and both in need of wage supplement benefits to compensate for the impairment to their earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b647 We identify the government\u2019s objective or interest in this case by the declaration of public policy found at \u00a7 39-71-105(1), MCA (1997), as to provide a wage loss benefit which bears \u201ca reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury <em>or disease.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). However, we conclude that the disparate treatment of disabled workers based simply on the length of time over which their injury or disease is sustained is not rationally related to that legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b648  Therefore, we conclude that providing partial disability benefits to a person in Stavenjord\u2019s situation in the amount of $27,027 under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but limiting her wage supplement to $10,000 under the Occupational Disease Act violates the Equal Protection Clause found at Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. For that reason, we conclude that our holding in <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Company </em>is not applicable to those wage supplement benefits provided for at \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, and \u00a7 39-72-405(2), MCA, since 1987 and we affirm the decision and judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b498-8\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"ACL\">dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b649 I respectfully dissent with the Court\u2019s holding on Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b650 The Court arrives at a conclusion which seems to be \u201cfair.\u201d Indeed, requiring equal compensation for workers suffering from an equal impairment would also seem to be the essence of constitutional \u201cequal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>protection.\u201d However, it is not. In reaching its decision, the Court has applied an incomplete constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b651 The Court\u2019s opinion consists of a restatement of the rationale offered by the Court in <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456, and a conclusion that \u201cour reasoning in <em>Henry </em>is equally applicable to the facts before us.\u201d Thus, a critique of the Court\u2019s holding here must necessarily address <em>Henry. </em>First, however, a complete statement of our standards of constitutional review must be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b652 As the Court notes, the constitutionality of a legislative enactment is prima facie presumed, and every intendment in its favor will be presumed, unless its unconstitutionality appears beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Powell v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 518, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 877, \u00b6 13; <em>State v.

But further, <em>the question of constitutionality is not whether it is possible to condemn, but whether it is possible to uphold the legislative action, </em>which will not be declared invalid unless it conflicts with the constitution beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 27. <em>Every possible presumption </em>must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative act. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 28. If <em>any </em>doubt exists about a statute\u2019s constitutionality, that doubt <em>must be resolved in favor of the statute. Powell, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 28. If these words have actual meaning, they require a different result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b653 The Court in <em>Henry </em>summarized its equal protection analysis of the 1987 amendments to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) and the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) by its now-famous statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">In sum, we can see no rational basis for treating workers who are injured over one work shift differently from workers who are injured over two work shifts. Simply put, a herniated disc is a herniated disc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\"><em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 44. Today, the Court again embraces this rationale <em>in toto, </em>concluding that workers injured under the two Acts \u201care distinguished <em>merely </em>by the number of work shifts over which their work-related affliction is sustained\u201d and that such \u201cdisparate treatment of disabled workers based <em>simply </em>on the length of time\u201d is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46 and 47 (emphasis added). However, the conclusion that workers injured under the two Acts are distinguished only by the number of work shifts was erroneous in <em>Henry </em>and is erroneous today. Although this error, given the issues in <em>Henry, </em>may not have affected the outcome there, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b654 <em>Henry\u2019s </em>conclusion that the 1987 amendments had fundamentally altered the definitions of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201coccupational disease\u201d so that they \u201cno longer focus on the nature of the medical condition, but rather focus on the number of work shifts over which the worker incurs an injury\u201d was flawed, in the first instance, because it failed to recognize \u25a0that pre-1987 law had not focused on the nature of the condition either.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 43. Prior to 1987, this Court had recognized that the two distinctions between injury and disease were those which Larson had explained in his treatise, i.e., unexpectedness and time-definiteness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">The two crucial points of distinction between accident and occupational disease were the elements of unexpectedness and time-definiteness. What sets occupational diseases apart from accidental injuries was both the fact that they could not honestly be said to be unexpected, since they were recognized as inherent hazards of continued exposure to conditions of the particular employment, and the fact that they were gradual rather than sudden in onset. <em>Thus, what would ordinarily be an occupational disease might be converted to an accident </em>by an unusual and sudden dosage of the same kind of dust or fumes that, absorbed gradually over a long period, would produce typical industrial disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>Vol. IB, \u00a7 41.31 (1987) (emphasis added). Application of these factors led to numerous decisions involving various medical conditions which were considered either as injury, or as disease, depending only on <em>how </em>they occurred. Thus, for example, in 1983, we concluded that a phlebitis condition in the worker\u2019s legs was an injury, rather than a disease, because of the manner in which it had developed \u2014 from extra work shifts during the course of one week. <em>Wise v. Perkins </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 157, 656 P.2d 816. We noted in <em>Wise </em>that the \u201ctwo critical points of distinction\u201d between injuries and diseases \u201care time definiteness and unexpectedness,\u201d citing to Larson. <em>Wise, </em>202 Mont. at 166, 656 P.2d at 820. Finding that the phlebitis neither \u201cdeveloped over time\u201d nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201cexpected\u201d from Wise\u2019s work activities, we concluded that the condition constituted an injury and not a disease. <em>Wise, </em>202 Mont. at 166, 656 P.2d at 820. Thus, the decision turned on the manner in which the condition was sustained, or caused, <em>not </em>the nature of the condition itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b655 The Court\u2019s citation to <em>Hoehne v. Granite Lumber Co. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 221, 615 P.2d 863, precisely illustrates this point. The Court asserts that Stavenjord\u2019s affliction, epicondylitis, \u201cis exactly the kind of condition that would traditionally have been treated as an injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 21. Support for this proposition is drawn from <em>Hoehne, </em>wherein we concluded that the carpel tunnel syndrome at issue was an injury. <em>Hoehne </em>is another case which demonstrates that it was not the nature of a condition which resulted in an injury determination, but rather, the manner by which the condition had been caused: by \u201ca tangible happening of a traumatic nature.\u201d In other words, under pre-1987 law, a medical condition was considered an \u201cinjury\u201d when it was caused by an event or events defined as an injury under the statute. In <em>Hoehne, </em>we determined that the carpel tunnel syndrome was caused by a chain or series of \u201ctangible happenings\u201d (repeatedly stacking lumber), and therefore, constituted an injury. <em>Wise </em>and many other cases were decided on the same rationale. Thus, <em>Henry\u2019s </em>conclusion that pre-1987 law was focused on the nature of the condition is simply not tenable. Rather, the focus has always been causation -the manner in which the condition was sustained. Indeed, the current proximate cause provision for occupational diseases, set forth in \u00a7 39-72-408, MCA, and discussed below, is identical to the proximate cause provision contained in the original Occupational Disease Act enacted by the Legislature in 1959. <em>See </em>1959 Mont. Laws, ch. 155, sec. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b656 However, court decisions applying these statutes gave rise to considerable uncertainty in the law, and obvious difficulty in ascertaining whether conditions were injuries or diseases. The 1987 amendments sought to clarify and simplify this determination, as well as to fulfill other stated purposes: eliminate time-consuming, costly litigation, provide benefits to injured workers \u201cspeedily,\u201d and provide constant premiums to employers. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-105, MCA (1987), \u201cDeclaration of public policy.\u201d However, notwithstanding the 1987 revisions, the traditional factors which distinguished injuries and diseases, namely, time-definiteness and unexpectedness, as well as other distinctions, were clearly retained, and remain a part of the 1997 version at issue here, and are discussed below. Thus, <em>Henry\u2019s </em>conclusion that these distinctions had been erased in 1987 was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b657 Causation for an injury is defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">(2)An injury is caused by an accident. An accident is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">(a) an unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">(b) identifiable by time and place of occurrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">(c) identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">(d) caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">(4) \u201cInjury\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d does not include a disease that is not caused by an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">In contrast to the above definition of injury, but consistent with pre1987 law, an occupational disease is now defined as the same medical condition which would constitute an injury, but which occurs on more than one day or work shift, and which is proximally caused by the employment, a requirement which must not be demonstrated in order to establish an injury. Section 39-72-408, MCA, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">Proximate causation. Occupational diseases shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">(1) there is a direct causal connection between the conditions under which the work is performed and the occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">(2) the disease can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">(3) the disease can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">(4) the disease does not come from a hazard to which workmen would have been equally exposed outside of the employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">(5) the disease is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-18\">This proximate cause provision is necessary for occupational disease conditions because there is no clearly identifiable work injury caused by a single accident. As in pre-1987 law, time-definiteness and unexpectedness remain as the two causation-related distinctions between injury and disease. Further, the condition may be caused, in part, by conditions outside of employment, and thus, a connection to the employment must be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\">\u00b658 In a discussion of the differing exclusivity statutes for injuries and diseases, a dissenting opinion in <em>Torres v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 83, 902 P.2d 999, noted some of the fundamental distinctions between diseases and injuries, including the possibility that diseases may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>contributing causes from outside of the employment, based upon the above-quoted definition of proximate cause, which, as mentioned, has been in effect since the ODA was originally enacted. The dissenting opinion explained that the distinctions between injuries and diseases required a different application of their respective exclusivity provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">[A]n occupational disease, by definition, occurs over a prolonged period of time, and unlike an industrial injury, may be caused from conditions that existed not only in the workplace, but elsewhere. That is why the Occupational Disease Act, unlike the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, specifically provides for apportionment of disability benefits based on the percent of a given disease or disability that is attributable to exposure that occurs during the course of employment. Section 39-72-706(1), MCA, specifically provides in relevant part that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201c[I]f disability ... from any other cause not itself compensable is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease, the compensation payable under this chapter must be reduced and limited to such proportion only of the compensation that would be payable if the occupational disease were the sole cause of the disability ... as such occupational disease as a causative factor bears to all the causes of such disability....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">In other words, under the Occupational Disease Act, a claimant is entitled to recover only that portion of his or her disability benefits which represents the portion of his or her disability that arose out of employment. The Act specifically allows for an employer to disclaim liability for any portion of a person\u2019s disability which is unrelated to employment. Therefore, based upon the previously mentioned statutes, that portion of disability would not be covered by the exclusive remedy provision found at \u00a7 39-72-305, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>Torres, </em>273 Mont. at 92, 902 P.2d at 1005 (Trieweiler, J., dissenting). Thus, an occupational disease, unlike an injury, can develop over the course of time, while on duty and off duty, and while the claimant is working for more than one employer. The ODA, unlike the WCA, contemplates such development and the proper compensation therefor. However, this distinction, and the others discussed herein, have been brushed aside by the Court\u2019s adoption <em>of Henry\u2019s </em>erroneous conclusion that the only difference between the WCA and ODA is the number of shifts involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u00b659 There are other distinctions as well. Consistent with its determination that injury and disease are caused differently, the Legislature enacted different notice provisions under each Act. Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an injured worker must, within 30 days after the occurrence of the accident, give notice of the time and place of the accident, and the kind of injury sustained, to the employer or insurer. Because accidents are often obvious happenings, actual knowledge of the accident by the employer is deemed to be sufficient notice of the claim. Section 39-71-603(1), MCA. No such deeming of notice is provided for occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b660 In contrast to the WCA\u2019s 30-day requirement, the ODA requires a claim to be filed \u201cwithin 1 year from the date the claimant knew or should have known that the claimant\u2019s condition resulted from an occupational disease.\u201d Section 39-72-403(1), MCA. These distinctive notice provisions are tied to the fundamental differences between injuries and diseases which remain in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b661 Further, consistent with its recognition of the differences between injuries and diseases, the Legislature created distinctions in the financial benefits which are available under the two Acts. It is this difference which the Court finds troubling, because the claimant here would have received a higher benefit had she sustained an injury, instead of a disease. While it is natural to feel sympathetic to someone in the claimant\u2019s situation, a failure of parity can occur between any number of claimants under these Acts, depending on the circumstances, including the possibility that an ODA claimant may receive more than a WCA claimant, and this should not render the Acts unconstitutional. The Nevada Supreme Court, when faced with a similar equal protection challenge to Nevada\u2019s occupational disease act by a diseased worker who was not eligible to obtain permanent partial disability benefits under a statute which limited those benefits to injured workers, recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">[I]t is evident the legislature had a rational basis for denying permanent partial disability benefits to individuals suffering from an occupational disease. Diseases take a period of time to develop, and objective manifestations exacerbate and remit as an illness progresses. Arguably, this exacerbation-remission cycle makes it difficult to assess the anatomical percentage which may be assigned to a partial disability, and, therefore, we view the legislature as justified in drawing the distinction in question. We note, since 1947 the legislature has paid particular attention to the Occupational Disease Act through repeated amendment, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>has never seen fit to provide permanent partial disability awards for occupational respiratory diseases. [Citations omitted.] <em>While it may be a better practice to provide such compensation to a diseased employee, that determination must rest with the legislature.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Holt v. Nevada Industrial Commission </em>(Nev. 1978), 578 P.2d 752, 753 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b662 Imbedded into the constitutional law of this country and this state is the principle that the legislature is the body which is charged with drawing lines and making choices, even if those choices are illogical or unfair. These differences, in and of themselves, do not render such decisions violative of equal protection. As we have recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">To a certain extent, nearly all legislation sets forth classifications regarding applicability, benefits and recipients; the fact that some of these classifications are imperfect does not necessarily mandate a conclusion that they violate the equal protection clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\"><em>Gulbrandson v. Carey </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 494, 503, 901 P.2d 573, 579 (citing <em>Arneson v. State </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 269, 274, 864 P.2d 1245, 1248). In fact, a presumption arises that imprudent legislative decisions will ultimately be corrected by the legislative body. As noted by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">[C]ourts are quite reluctant to overturn governmental action on the ground that it denies equal protection of the laws. The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\"><em>Vance v. Bradley </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 942-43, 59 L.Ed.2d 171, 176. <em>Vance\u2019s </em>statement that the legislature must act with \u201cantipathy,\u201d at least inferred, to violate equal protection guarantees, is a requirement which has been reiterated by this Court. As we recently held in <em>Price:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">\u201cIt is a basic equal protection principle that the invidious quality of a law claimed to be discriminatory must ultimately be traced to an impermissibly discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 85 [1999 MT 113, 294 Mont. 367, 982 P.2d 421] (citing <em>Washington v. Davis </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2048, 48 L.Ed.2d 597, 607-08). None exists here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-11\"><em>Price, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00b663 Neither has such a purpose been demonstrated here. Without a doubt, the Legislature chose to draw lines which differentiated injuries from diseases, established different timing and administrative requirements for each type of claim, and provided different benefits for each. However, reviewing these Acts as a whole, instead of focusing on the single factor of the number of work shifts, reveals that the appropriate legislative purposes at work here-provision of workable definitions of injury and disease, elimination of prolonged litigation by a self-administering system, speedy payment of benefits to workers, and constant insurance rates for employers-are legitimately served by the statutory scheme. I conclude from this review, and the historical distinctions between injury and disease that still prevail in the law, that there is a class of workers who sustain an injury, and a separate class of workers who sustain an occupational disease, and that these classes are not, for the reasons discussed above, similarly situated. It is, therefore, \u201cpossible to uphold the legislative action.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13. I would do so and reverse the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, which necessarily followed the erroneous language expressed in <em>Henry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b664 Given that the Acts\u2019 legitimate purposes are demonstrated in the legislation itself, I find no error in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s denial of the State Fund\u2019s motion to reopen evidence, and therefore, on that issue, I concur with the Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing dissenting and concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> Arguably, there was more of a \u201cfocus\u201d on the nature of the condition at issue when the ODA specifically listed occupational diseases, such as silicosis, anthrax and tamarack poisoning, as opposed to the general reference to \u201call diseases,\u201d for which the ODA was later amended to provide coverage. However, coverage for both injuries and diseases has always been dependent upon, and thus \u201cfocused\u201d on, causation, as our case law reveals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
