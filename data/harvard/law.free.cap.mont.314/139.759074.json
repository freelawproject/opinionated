Drollinger appeals the denial of her motion requesting the court decline to exercise jurisdiction over a custody dispute with her former husband, Mark J. Stoneman. In September 1999, Drollinger relocated with her four children to the State of Washington. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) enumerates domestic violence as one of eight factors that a Montana court must consider when determining whether it is an inconvenient forum to adjudicate child custody issues. Although Stoneman\u2019s past acts of violence against Drollinger are well documented, the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, failed to consider Drollinger\u2019s safety and well-being when evaluating whether transfer of proceedings to Washington is appropriate. We hold that a finding of domestic violence authorizes a court to yield jurisdiction to another state if the victim could be better protected in the other forum and if the other statutory factors do not militate against the transfer. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised by Drollinger on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying her motion to decline to exercise jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum under the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">\u00b63 Stoneman and Drollinger married on October 1, 1988, in Livingston, Montana. On August 1,1990, a few months after the birth of the couple\u2019s first child, Stoneman filed a petition for dissolution in Gallatin County. Thereafter, the parties reconciled, reunited and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>broke-up numerous times before they finally separated in 1996 while Drollinger was pregnant with their fourth child. The children have resided with Drollinger since their parents\u2019 final separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b64 Stoneman repeatedly battered Drollinger during the marriage and Drollinger obtained several court-issued orders of protection during the parties\u2019 multiple separations. Stoneman pled guilty to partner and family member assault in 1990,1991,1994 and 1996. The record details Stoneman\u2019s violations of the orders of protection as well as several incidents involving Stoneman\u2019s violent behavior after the parties\u2019 final separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b65 The District Court appointed a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) in 1997 to represent the interests of the children in the dissolution proceedings. The GAL consistently recommended against Stoneman\u2019s unsupervised visitation with the children. In its October 23, 1998 decree of dissolution, the court divided the marital estate and awarded custody of the children to Drollinger. Drollinger, acting <em>pro se </em>and in <em>forma pauperis, </em>appealed the division of marital property, denial of a maintenance award, determination of child support and the visitation provisions of the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b66 While the appeal was pending, Drollinger filed a notice of intent to move and relocated with her children to Washington in September 1999. The District Court in Montana directed Drollinger to bring the four children on alternate weekends from Washington to a designated location in Bozeman where the children\u2019s transfer to Stoneman for unsupervised visits was facilitated by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b67 On November 30, 2000, this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment on the issues of property apportionment, maintenance and child support, but held that the court committed reversible error by allowing Stoneman unsupervised visitation with the children in light of his history of violence toward their mother. <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2000 MT 274, 302 Mont. 107, 14 P.3d 12. We noted that the overwhelming evidence in this case demonstrates an emotional and physical risk to the children if they are left alone with their father. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 59. We remanded for entry of an order requiring the children\u2019s visits with Stoneman to be supervised and well-structured. Stoneman, \u00b6 61. Stoneman filed a petition for rehearing, which this Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b68 On February 6, 2001, the Whitman County Superior Court of Washington issued a Permanent Order of Protection that bars Stoneman from all direct contact with Drollinger and the four children, except for Stoneman\u2019s supervised visitation, which had not yet been established by the Montana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00b69 On March 9, 2001, Drollinger, again acting <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>filed a motion requesting the Montana court to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum in order to allow the Whitman County, Washington court to assume jurisdiction. Stoneman opposed the motion. On May 3, 2001, the day set for a hearing on the parties\u2019 various motions, Drollinger moved to bifurcate property and parenting issues and requested the court decline jurisdiction over custody proceedings only. The court denied both of Drollinger\u2019s motions on September 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b610 The standard of review of a motion to decline jurisdiction is whether the District Court abused its discretion. <em>In re Paternity and Custody of B.E.S., </em>1998 MT 190, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 188, \u00b6 19, 963 P.2d 449, \u00b6 19 (citing In <em>re Marriage of Cook </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 293, 297, 725 P.2d 562, 564-65).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b611 As a case of first impression, this Court is asked to examine the provisions of the UCCJEA that allow a Montana court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over child custody proceedings when the court determines that it is an inconvenient forum. For background, a brief discussion of the statutory schemes designed to address jurisdictional problems raised by interstate child custody disputes is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">\u00b612 In 1977, Montana adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) for the purpose of avoiding competition between states for jurisdiction over child custody proceedings and promoting cooperation of the courts by establishing uniform criteria for the state with the closest connections with the child to exercise jurisdiction. Sec. 1, Ch. 537, L. 1977. Although all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands adopted the UCCJA, problems of interstate forum shopping and other jurisdictional disputes continued to vex the nation\u2019s courts. <em>See </em>9 Uniform Laws Annotated (U.L.A.) 650 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b613 In 1980, the federal government enacted the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, which mandates that state authorities give full faith and credit to another state\u2019s custody determinations, so long as those determinations were made in conformity with the notice and procedural provisions of the PKPA. The PKPA also authorizes continuing exclusive jurisdiction in the state that issued the original child custody decree so long as one parent or the child remains there and the state has continuing jurisdiction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>its own law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b614 To harmonize state child custody jurisdictional provisions with the PKPA and to eliminate inconsistent state court interpretations of jurisdictional issues, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) approved the UCCJEA in 1997 and recommended its enactment by all states.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Montana Legislature adopted the UCCJEA in 1999 (codified under Title 40, Chapter 7, Montana Code Annotated), which repealed and replaced the provisions of the UCCJA in Montana law. <em>See </em>Sec. 1-14, Ch. 91, L. 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b615  Under the UCCJEA, a Montana court has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination if Montana is the \u201chome state\u201d of the child. Section 40-7-201(1), MCA. The \u201chome state\u201d is defined as the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as parent for a least six months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding. Section 40-7-103(7), MCA. As the \u201chome state\u201d of a child, Montana will continue to have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction unless a Montana court declines to exercise its jurisdiction. Section 40-7-202(2), MCA. A court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if the court determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum to make the child custody determination. Section 40-7-108(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b616 To that end, the UCCJEA specifically mandates that a Montana court, at a minimum, consider the following factors when evaluating a motion to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">(a) whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">(b) the length of time that the child has resided outside this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">(c) the distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">(d) the relative financial circumstances of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">(e) any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">(f) the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">(g) the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">(h) the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Section 40-7-108(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b617 In the case before us on appeal, Stoneman contends that the criteria for evaluating inconvenient forum under the UCCJA are encompassed by the UCCJEA\u2019s requirement that courts consider \u201call relevant factors.\u201d He cites <em>In re Paternity and Custody of B.E.S., </em>1998 MT 190, 290 Mont. 188, 963 P.2d 449, as support for his position that it is not appropriate that Washington assume jurisdiction and determine pending visitation issues because his children have a closer connection with Montana, which is where the children have resided for most of their lives. Stoneman also argues that the Montana court should retain jurisdiction because the court has overseen the protracted litigation between the parties and Drollinger\u2019s effort to transfer jurisdiction is only an attempt to frustrate Stoneman\u2019s visitation with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b618 In <em>B.E.S., </em>this Court interpreted the statutory criteria for determining inconvenient forum as it existed in 1998, prior to the Montana Legislature\u2019s enactment of the UCCJEA in 1999. However, the UCCJEA significantly altered the earlier provisions of \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA. For example, as noted in <em>B.E.S, </em>the UCCJA required a court to decide the jurisdiction question by resort to a determination \u201cif it is in the interest of the child that another state assume jurisdiction.\u201d Section 40-7-108(3), MCA (1997); <em>B.E.S., </em>\u00b6 19. The UCCJEA includes no similar provision and eliminates \u201cinterest of the child\u201d from the jurisdictional standard. <em>See </em>9 U.L.A. 654. The UCCJA also did not include domestic violence as a factor that a court must consider in evaluating jurisdictional issues in child custody disputes. The UCCJEA, for the first time, focuses a court\u2019s attention on the safety and well-being of the victims of domestic violence when determining appropriate jurisdiction. Section 40-4-108(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b619  At oral argument before this Court, Stoneman conceded that the UCCJEA rather than the UCCJA governs this case. Also, the parties do not dispute that Montana is the \u201chome state\u201d for the four children. The children were born in Montana; child custody proceedings commenced in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County; the Montana court made the initial child custody determination; and Stoneman continues to reside in Montana. Consequently, the Montana court has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction to establish Stoneman\u2019s supervised visitation with his children unless, under the circumstances, it would be appropriate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the Montana court to allow the Washington court to assume jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b620 When evaluating whether to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum, a court must allow the parties to submit information for the court\u2019s consideration. Section 40-7-108(2), MCA. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court\u2019s own motion, or request of another court. Section 40-7-108(1), MCA. The law does not allocate a burden of proof to either party, but directs the court to conduct an evaluation based upon the relevant information available to determine whether it is appropriate for another state to exercise jurisdiction. The District Court addressed each statutory factor in its decision denying the motion to decline jurisdiction, which we discuss in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b621 The first factor inquires \u201cwhether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child.\u201d Section 40-7-108(2)(a), MCA. The District Court found that \u201c[djomestic violence towards Respondent is well documented in this case, but Respondent fails to show this [cjourt how declining jurisdiction will better protect her and the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ank\">\u00b622  The UCCJEA places domestic violence at the top of the list of factors that courts are required to evaluate when determining whether to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum for child custody proceedings. Since domestic violence was not raised by the now-repealed UCC JA as afactor for court consideration, the NCCUSL, which drafted the UCCJEA, offered the following guidance to assist courts in applying this factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">For this purpose, the court should determine whether the parties are located in different States because one party is a victim of domestic violence or child abuse. If domestic violence or child abuse has occurred, this factor authorizes the court to consider which State can best protect the victim from further violence or abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">9 U.L.A. 683. The NCCUSL explicitly recognized that past abuse or a continuing threat of violence might compel a battered spouse or parent of an abused child to relocate to another state. The NCCUSL further directed courts to proceed with an evaluation of which forum can provide the greater safety whenever domestic violence or child abuse has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b623 The priority the NCCUSL assigned to the protection of victims from further domestic violence is supported by the research findings of the United States Department of Justice. Those findings suggest that termination of an abusive relationship actually poses an increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>risk of escalation in domestic violence. Interviews with men who killed their wives indicated that either threats of separation or actual separation most often precipitated events leading to the murder. <em>See </em>Patricia Tjanden and Nancy Thoennes, United States Department of Justice, <em>Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence </em>37 (July 2000). \u201cDomestic violence often escalates over time in frequency, intensity and duration. ... Although divorced women and separated women comprise only 10 percent of all women in America, they account for three-quarters of all battered women and report being battered 14 times as often as women still living with their partners. Divorced or separated men, as opposed to husbands living with their wives, commit 79% of all spousal violence.\u201d Joan Zorza, <em>Recognizing and Protecting the Privacy and Confidentiality Needs of Battered Women, </em>29 Fam. L. Q. 273, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b624 An alarming report from the State Justice Institute lists risk factors for intimate partner homicide recognized by a majority of domestic violence experts. Identified indicators of homicidal potential are the batterer\u2019s access to or ownership of guns; use of weapons in prior abusive incidents; threats with weapons; serious injury in prior abusive incidents; threats of suicide; drug or alcohol abuse; forced sex with the female partner; obsessiveness; extreme jealousy; and extreme dominance. <em>See </em>Jan Roehl and Kristin Guertin, State Justice Institute, <em>Current Use of Dangerous Assessments in Sentencing Domestic Violence Offenders </em>3-7 (Sept. 1998) (hereafter, <em>Roehl).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b625 Orders of protection have proven inadequate to guard women and children from further abuse. A recent two-year study of male batterers against whom an order of protection had been filed found that almost half of abusers assaulted their victims again within the study period. The re-abuse rate did not differ for those who maintained the orders and those who dropped them. Andrew R. Klein, United States Department of Justice, \u201cRe-abuse in a Population of Court-Restrained Male Batterers: Why Restraining Orders Don\u2019t Work,\u201d <em>Legal Interventions in Family Violence: Research Findings and Policy Implications 52 </em>(July 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b626  Given the high propensity for recidivism in domestic violence, we hold that when a court finds intim ate partner violence or abuse of a child has occurred or that a party has fled Montana to avoid further violence or abuse, the court is authorized to consider whether the party and the child might be better protected if further custody proceedings were held in another state. While this factor alone is not dispositive under \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA, we urge district courts to give priority to the safety of victims of domestic violence when considering jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>issues under the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b627 Turning to the specific facts before us on appeal, the marriage of Stoneman and Drollinger was marked by repeated incidents of domestic violence. Local law enforcement officers arrested Stoneman on charges of partner and family member assault on numerous occasions between 1989 and 1996. Stoneman received four convictions and served a three-month sentence in the Park County Jail for the fourth conviction. When issues arising from the dissolution of the marriage between these parties were before this Court two years ago, we recounted the District Court\u2019s findings regarding two incidents that illustrate Stoneman\u2019s propensity for violence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">A disagreement escalated between Mark and Ruth to the point of violence. To protect the children, Ruth, who was pregnant at the time, was forced to put them in the Suburban and drive away from Mark. It is uncontroverted that Mark, in his pickup truck, rammed into the Suburban, endangering the lives of his children and Ruth. Mark testified that he was trying to catch up to Ruth because in her hurry to protect her life and the lives of her children, he thought Ruth had not used seat belts for the children. The Court finds Mark\u2019s seat belt explanation incredible versus his threat to the safety of his children and Ruth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">The second incident involved Mark painting his face with camouflage in the presence of the children, drinking, and driving out into the night, after hearing a story about Ruth. Mark\u2019s behavior was so bizarre that it frightened his friend Lisa Wolstad. Ms. Wolstad called 911 more than six times out of fear of what Mark would do.... Gallatin and Park County deputies pursued Mark and caught him near the 1-90 interchange, dressed in camouflage and in possession of a gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\"><em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b628 Stoneman asserts on appeal that his last act of reported domestic violence occurred in 1996 and claims that there has been \u201cno apparent problem\u201d during the past three years. He contends that Drollinger only wants to obtain a more \u201csympathetic judge\u201d by seeking the transfer of the remanded child custody proceedings to a court in Washington. \u00b629 Drollinger testified at the May 2001 hearing on her motion to decline jurisdiction that she relocated to Washington with the children in 1999 in order to be near her extended family. She stated that she preserved the confidentiality of her new address to escape a continuing threat of violence by Stoneman. Drollinger\u2019s mother and father, sister and brother and their families, as well as the children\u2019s paternal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>grandparents, live in Washington and Drollinger testified that they have provided emotional and material support to her and the children. \u00b630 Drollinger entered into evidence the Permanent Order of Protection issued by the Whitman County, Washington court in February 2001. Noting that Stoneman stipulated to having committed domestic violence, the Washington court made no findings on the matter and noted that Stoneman disputed Drollinger\u2019s allegations of violence subsequent to 1997. Drollinger explained to the Montana court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">I\u2019ve needed to leave the state with my children because I have family in [Washington] state that can help me.... The only reason there\u2019s not more domestic violence that\u2019s been occurring is because I no longer live here and I have a-I\u2019ve been able to-I have a permanent restraining order there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">There\u2019s been a number of things that has made me fearful for any way that he could find out where we live or, you know, where-what I\u2019m doing or anything like that. I feel that my safety is still in question, Your Honor. I\u2019m still afraid of him. I am being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, Your Honor, from the years of domestic violence that I went through.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b631 Drollinger\u2019s brief in support of her motion to decline jurisdiction referred the District Court to the supplemental information she submitted to this Court in September 2000, which documents Stoneman\u2019s \u201cacts of violence and abuse towards [her] and the children since fleeing Montana\u201d in September 1999. Although Drollinger did submit such documentation to this Court during her first appeal, we refused to consider the evidence. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 12. This Court does not engage in fact-finding and may not consider evidence that has not been submitted to the court below for a proper hearing. Consequently, the documentation provided this Court regarding Stoneman\u2019s more recent acts of violence is not of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b632 While the record in this case is voluminous and the District Court acknowledged the well-documented history of domestic violence perpetrated by Stoneman against Drollinger throughout their ten-year marriage, the court made no new findings regarding violent acts or threats of violence since the October 1998 dissolution proceedings. The court also made no findings regarding threats or the likelihood of future violence before determining that Drollinger failed to demonstrate how she and the children would be safer if proceedings were transferred to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b633 In her testimony before the District Court, Drollinger spoke of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fear of future violence by Stoneman and her efforts to prevent Stoneman from knowing her home address or her daily activities. Stoneman\u2019s criminal record of domestic violence reveals a pattern of recurrent wife-battering of escalating intensity, which includes severely beating Drollinger during pregnancy. The record also establishes that Stoneman used weapons in the context of spousal abuse, perpetrated serious injury upon his ex-spouse, and exhibited obsessive and domineering behavior, all of which correspond with indicators of homicidal potential identified by the State Justice Institute. <em>See Roehl, </em>3-7. Stoneman testified at the May 2001 hearing that he had not received any type of psychological counseling since his last incarceration in 1996 for domestic violence. Moreover, he made no showing before the District Court that his potential for future violence has abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b634  We conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it acknowledged the well documented history of domestic violence presented by this case, yet neglected to consider which forum could best protect Drollinger and the children from further abuse. Drollinger maintains that she feels safer in Washington where she is surrounded by extended family and where Stoneman does not know her address or daily pattern of activities. Therefore, we hold that Washington is an appropriate forum for further child custody proceedings in order to better protect Drollinger and the children from the threat of violence from Stoneman.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b635  Although a finding of past domestic violence can be the basis for a Montana court to yield jurisdiction to another state, the seven other jurisdictional factors enumerated by \u00a7 40-7-108(2), MCA, must also be taken into consideration. The second factor asks how long the children have resided outside Montana. Section 40-7-108(2)(b), MCA. The District Court found that the majority of the children\u2019s lives have been spent in Montana and \u201cthe [cjourt does not believe that two (2) years in Washington weigh against retaining jurisdiction given the extensive history of the parties in the Montana [c]ourts.\u201d The four children, ranging in age from four to eleven at the time of the hearing, have lived in Washington since September 1999. Drollinger testified that the children \u201chave significant connections to family, school and community\u201d in Washington and have developed relationships that have enhanced their sense of security and well-being, which is \u201ca contrast from the isolation they experienced while living in Montana.\u201d As the children\u2019s home for the most recent two years, we conclude that Washington would be an appropriate forum for child custody proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b636  The third factor evaluates the distance between the courts, which is approximately 600 miles in this case. Section 40-7-108(2)(c), MCA. The District Court stated, \u201c[wjhile the court sympathizes with Respondent\u2019s need to relocate, she did choose to relocate a great distance from Petitioner.\u201d Drollinger testified that the drive between her home and the court in Bozeman takes about eight hours each way. As the primary custodial parent, Drollinger must either bring the children with her to proceedings or arrange for their care in her absence. Since the distance between the Montana and Washington courts creates a transportation inconvenience that must be borne by one of the parties, we conclude that the facts suggest that Stoneman, as the noncustodial parent, may be in the better position to undertake the necessary travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b637 The fourth factor concerns the relative financial circumstances of the parties, which the District Court found to be disparate. Section 40-7-108(2)(d), MCA. The court determined that Stoneman enjoys an income of $31,797, based in part on imputed wages, while Drollinger has an imputed income of $6,500. Under the fifth factor, the parties have no agreement regarding appropriate jurisdiction. Section 40-7-108(2)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b638 The sixth factor examines the traditional bases for determining venue and inquires about the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the testimony of the children. Section 40-7-108(2)(f), MCA. The District Court stated that \u201cRespondent contends all current evidence regarding the children\u2019s mental health, medical, financial, and school records are in Washington. The [cjourt believes that Montana is just as convenient a forum as Washington for review of pertinent child records...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b639 Although records may be easily transportable, the District Court failed to address the convenience of the witnesses, the majority of whom reside in Washington, including the four children. Three of the children are enrolled in school and receive therapeutic counseling in Washington. Drollinger maintains that Washington is now the location of all witnesses and evidence regarding the children, with the single exception of the GAL who resides in Montana. The GAL testified at the May 2001 hearing that she actually has not seen the children for over one year, but has maintained contact by telephone. Stoneman did not refute Drollinger\u2019s assertions regarding the location of evidence and witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b640 The seventh factor inquires about the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence. Section 40-7-108(2)(g), MCA. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>District Court did not address this factor directly, we trust that courts in either Montana or Washington are competent to decide evidentiary and substantive issues expeditiously. The record does not indicate that the Montana court communicated with the Washington court to discuss the possible transfer of this case, pursuant to \u00a7 40-7-139, MCA. Consequently, no information is available regarding potential docketing problems or other concerns that might affect the Washington court\u2019s timely adjudication. Drollinger testified she has secured the services of a <em>pro bono </em>attorney to represent her through custody proceedings in Washington but has been unable to arrange for legal assistance in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b641 The final factor is the familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation. Section 40-7-108(2)(g), MCA. The District Court concluded that it is in the better position to address the issue of supervised visitation because the property and parenting issues arising from the dissolution of the marriage of Stoneman and Drollinger have been the subject of extensive litigation in Montana. The court noted that the case file is now in its thirteenth volume. While we acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the Eleventh Judicial District Court to resolve the issues presented by this case-three district court judges have presided over the matter, and this is the second time that these parties have come before this Court on appeal-the value the court attaches to retaining jurisdiction is misplaced. For more than five years, the court system has served as a forum in which Stoneman and Drollinger have waged a contentious and protracted battle. While the Montana court may be well versed in the conflict, Drollinger argues that the Washington court also has had an opportunity to become familiar with the facts and issues involved in the case when she applied for and received a Permanent Order of Protection in 2001 from the Superior Court of Whitman County. Therefore, under this factor, we again conclude that the Washington court would be an appropriate forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b642  It is the judgment of this Court that the protection of the parties, the years the children have resided in Washington, the significant distance between courts, the parties\u2019 disparate financial circumstances, the location of evidence and convenience of witnesses, and the familiarity factors, all support the Montana court declining jurisdiction to allow the Washington court to exercise jurisdiction. None of the jurisdictional factors enumerated by \u00a7 40-7-108(2), MCA, militate against declination and no factor outweighs the concern for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the safety and well-being of Drollinger and the children raised by the history of Stoneman\u2019s domestic violence. Therefore, we conclude that Washington is the more appropriate forum in which a supervised, well-structured visitation plan for Stoneman may be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b643 Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order as it pertains to custody matters and remand with directions that the court stay further proceedings and communicate with the appropriate court in Washington to discuss transfer of this case, pursuant to \u00a7 40-7-139, MCA. If transfer can be arranged, we direct the Montana court to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum and hold that further proceedings should occur in Drollinger\u2019s home court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b644 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-14\"> As of January 2003, thirty-one states, including Washington and Montana, have enacted the UCCJEA, and nine states have introduced UCCJEA legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b174-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AOo\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b645 I concur in much of the Court\u2019s opinion. However, I respectfully dissent from the result the Court reaches. I would remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b646 The District Court denied Drollinger\u2019s motion to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum. As the Court correctly states, our review of the District Court\u2019s decision is whether that court abused its discretion. Having properly begun to apply the correct standard, however, the Court takes it upon itself to make the ultimate decision about whether Montana is an inconvenient forum and, indeed, concludes that Washington is the \u201cmore appropriate\u201d forum for this case. I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u00b647 I do agree with the first sentence in \u00b6 34 of the opinion, where the Court determines that the District Court abused its discretion by neglecting to consider which forum could best protect Drollinger and the children. I also agree with \u00b6 32 of the opinion, which lists other findings not made by the District Court. The Court then implicitly makes these missing findings of fact-an undertaking totally outside this Court\u2019s authority-in order to reach the conclusion it desires to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u00b648 On this record, I conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to make sufficient findings on the domestic violence matters. I would remand, however, for the entry of those findings and, thereafter, for reconsideration of the entire issue of a convenient forum under \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA. I simply cannot agree with this Court\u2019s choice to make the ultimate decision which properly belongs with the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
