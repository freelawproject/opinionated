Root (Root) appeals from the order entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, dismissing his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b62 Although Root raises several issues on appeal, we find the following issue to be dispositive: Did the District Court err in dismissing the petition on the ground that it was time barred?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b63 The facts relating to the timeliness of Root\u2019s second petition are undisputed. On March 12, 1997, Root was found guilty of the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, following a jury trial. He appealed, and this Court affirmed his conviction in an opinion issued on August 30,1999. <em>See State v. Root, </em>1999 MT 203, 296 Mont. 1, 987 P.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u00b64 On January 18,2000, Root, then proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for postconviction relief, asserting several ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Finding that the petition conclusively demonstrated that Root was not entitled to relief, the District Court dismissed the petition on March 3,2000, without ordering a response from the State. Root appealed that dismissal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\u00b65 On May 23, 2000, we issued an interlocutory order appointing counsel on appeal for Root, noting that Root was incarcerated in a correctional facility that did not have an adequate legal library. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>June 21, 2000, Root, through his appointed counsel, moved to voluntarily dismiss his appeal, which was granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b66 Root, by his appointed counsel, then filed a second petition for postconviction relief in the District Court on December 4, 2000, again claiming that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial. After ordering the State to respond, the District Court dismissed Root\u2019s second petition, concluding, on the basis of \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-102 and -105, MCA, that the petition was time barred, was barred under provisions governing second or subsequent petitions, and was procedurally barred because Root could have raised his claims in earlier proceedings. Because we find the timeliness issue to be dispositive, we do not address the other grounds upon which the District Court dismissed Root\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, 307 Mont. 349, 42 P.3d 753. Here, the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not challenged, and our review is confined to the correctness of the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b68 Section 46-21-102, MCA, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a petition for the relief referred to in 46-21-101 may be filed at any time within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final. A conviction becomes final for purposes of this chapter when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">(a) the time for appeal to the Montana supreme court expires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">(b) if an appeal is taken to the Montana supreme court, the time for petitioning the United States supreme court for review expires; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">(c) if review is sought in the United States supreme court, on the date that that court issues its final order in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">(2) A claim that alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence that, if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted, may be raised in a petition filed within 1 year of the date on which the conviction becomes final or the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the evidence, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b69 The District Court noted that pursuant to United States Supreme Court Rules, Root had 90 days from the entry of our decision in his appeal, or until November 30,1999, to petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Rule 11, Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States; <em>State v. Abe, </em>2001 MT 260, \u00b6 7, 307 Mont. 233, \u00b6 7, 37 P.3d 77, \u00b6 7. Then, in accordance with \u00a7 46-21-102(l)(b), MCA, which deems convictions to be final when the time expires for petitioning the United States Supreme Court, and pursuant to the one-year limitation period provided in \u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA, the District Court found that Root had until November 30,2000, to file his petition for postconviction relief. The District Court concluded therefrom that Root\u2019s first petition, filed on January 18,2000, was timely, but that his second petition, filed December 4, 2000, was untimely, and therefore barred under the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b610 In Root\u2019s view, the District Court erred in applying the one-year limitation period to his second postconviction petition because the one-year period applies only to an initial or original petition. His brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">The one-year limitations period does not apply to amended petitions or second or successive petitions for relief. These petitions are not mentioned in \u00a746-21-102, MCA, and are addressed in \u00a746-21-105, MCA. This latter statute contains express provisions for the setting of a deadline for filing an amended petition. In short, nothing in the provisions of these statutes suggests, let alone requires, that the one-year limitations period applies to anything other than the initial petition for relief. This does not mean that a petitioner can file petitions <em>ad nauseam. A </em>second or successive petition is subject to the waiver and \u201cgood cause\u201d exception doctrines addressed in \u00a746-21-105, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b611 The provision relied upon by Root, \u00a7 46-21-105(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABl\">(l)(a) All grounds for relief claimed by a petitioner under 46-21-101 must be raised in the original or amended original petition. The original petition may be amended only once. At the request of the state or on its own motion, the court shall set a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>deadline for the filing of an amended original petition. If a hearing will be held, the deadline must be reasonably in advance of the hearing but may not be less than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">(b) The court shall dismiss a second of subsequent petition by a person who has filed an original petition unless the second or subsequent petition raises grounds for relief that could not reasonably have been raised in the original or an amended original petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b612 In his argument quoted above, Root incorrectly lumps amended petitions together with second or subsequent petitions. \u201cAmended\u201d petitions and \u201csubsequent\u201d petitions are different in nature and are governed by different statutory provisions. Amended petitions are governed by \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(a), MCA, which contemplates that a petition may be amended during the course of an ongoing proceeding that was timely initiated. The provision allows a district court to set a deadline for filing an amended petition. These petitions are referenced in \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(b), MCA, as \u201camended original\u201d petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b613 However, Root did not file an amended original petition, and thus, the timeliness of an amended petition is not before the Court here. We therefore do not address whether the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA, would apply to an amended petition filed during the course of a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b614 Root filed a second petition for postconviction relief, which is governed by \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(b), MCA. The provision mandates that a district court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a second or subsequent petition \u201cunless the second or subsequent petition raises grounds for relief that could not reasonably have been raised in the original or an amended original petition.\u201d Root offers the Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, in explanation of this provision\u2019s application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">The object of this section is to eliminate the unnecessary burden placed upon the courts by repetitious or specious petitions. It is highly desirable that a petitioner be required to assert all his claims in one petition. Unless good cause is shown why he did not assert all his claims in the original petition, his failure to so assert them constitutes a waiver. The way is left open, however, for a subsequent petition if the court finds grounds for relief that could not reasonably have been raised in the original petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b615 Root argues that the plain meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-102(1) and -105(2), MCA, restricts application of the one-year limitation period to initial or original petitions. He reasons that second or subsequent petitions are limited only by the need to demonstrate that the claims therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201ccould not reasonably have been raised in the original petition,\u201d under the standards as discussed in the Commission Comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b616  We disagree. A reading of the statutes governing postconviction proceedings in their entirety convinces us that \u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA, applies a one-year period of limitation on the initiation of all postconviction proceedings, including those initiated by second or subsequent petitions. Section 46-21-101, MCA, sets forth the relief available in postconviction proceedings, which necessarily includes second or subsequent proceedings. Section 46-21-102, MCA, states that \u201ca petition for the relief referred to in 46-21-101 may be filed at any time within 1 year\u201d of the conviction becoming final. Section 46-21-103, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he proceeding for relief under 46-21-101 must be commenced by filing a verified petition with the clerk of the appropriate court.\u201d Section 46-21-104, MCA, requires that \u201c[t]he petition for postconviction relief must: . . . (b) identify any previous proceedings that the petitioner may have taken to secure relief from the conviction.\u201d Thus, a proceeding seeking relief available under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, must meet all the requirements set forth in these provisions, including, for purposes here, the filing, in the appropriate court, of a verified petition which identifies all previous postconviction proceedings, within one year of the conviction becoming final. The statutes do not exempt second or subsequent petitions from any of these requirements. Rather, \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, imposes an additional requirement: that a second or subsequent petition, in order to avoid dismissal, must also demonstrate good cause why its claims were not asserted in the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b617 Root\u2019s proffered interpretation would lead to absurd results. If the one-year limitation provision did not apply to subsequent petitions, an original petition filed after expiration of the one-year limitation period would be time barred, but would nonetheless open the door to the filing of a second petition which would be limited only by the need to demonstrate why the claims therein were not raised in the original, time-barred petition. This result, though possible under Root\u2019s interpretation, is clearly not contemplated by the plain wording of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b618  The postconviction statutes do provide a narrow exception to the one-year limitation period. Section 46-21-102(2), MCA, allows a petition which alleges newly discovered evidence to be filed one year after the evidence was discovered, or \u201creasonably should have [been] discovered.\u201d This indicates that the Legislature contemplated the filing of petitions beyond the one-year period following conviction and provided a narrow exception therefor. Here, Root has not alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the time for filing is extended either by this statutory \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d provision, nor the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception premised upon conviction of one who is actually innocent. <em>See State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 33, 294 Mont. 252, \u00b6 33, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6 33. Thus, the statutory provisions as interpreted herein are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s dismissal of the petition is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, TP. A PH ART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> The District Court erred slightly in its calculation of the 90-day period. Ninety days from August 30,1999, is not November 30,1999, but rather November 28,1999. The one-year period for filing a petition for postconviction relief thus ran until November 28,2000. However, this error affects neither the District Court\u2019s decision nor the outcome on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
