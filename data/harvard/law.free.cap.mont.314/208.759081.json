Daniels appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether Daniels was properly charged with theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether Daniels was properly charged and convicted under the definition of the offense in effect at the time he committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">\u00b65 In November of 1999, the State of Montana charged Daniels, a podiatrist practicing in Anaconda, Montana, with felony theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">A person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over any part of any public assistance provided under Title 52 or 53 by a state or county agency, regardless of the original source of assistance, by means of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">(a) a knowingly false statement, representation, or impersonation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">(b) a fraudulent scheme or device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">At Daniels\u2019 October 2000 trial, the State presented evidence that between January of 1996 and June of 1999, Daniels billed a number of his Medicaid-eligible patients for custom orthotic shoe inserts which he did not provide to the patients, but for which he claimed and obtained Medicaid reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">\u00b66 The jury found Daniels guilty of theft and, as part of a special verdict form, that the total amount Medicaid paid for the claims for which Daniels was guilty was over $500. The District Court deferred imposition of sentence for six years and ordered Daniels to pay restitution of $10,587.26 to the Medicaid program and $4,955 to the court for witness costs. Daniels appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b67 Was Daniels properly charged with theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b68 Daniels contends he should have been charged with Medicaid fraud under \u00a7 45-6-313, MCA, instead of theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA. He asserts \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA, applies only to the theft of public assistance by recipients of those government benefits and argues income received by a physician for services and medical items cannot be \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b69 Daniels asserts this issue must be analyzed in accordance with the rules of statutory construction outlined in <em>State ex rel. Holt v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 142, 300 Mont. 35, 3 P.3d 608. We disagree. As the dissent in <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 16, pointed out, the rules of construction outlined in that case are superfluous when statutory language is plain on its face. If the intent of the Legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, courts may not go further and apply other means of construction. <em>Spoonheim v. Norwest Bank Montana, N.A. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 417, 420, 922 P.2d 528, 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b610  Section 45-6-301(4), MCA, defines theft as purposely or knowingly obtaining unauthorized control over \u201cany part of any public assistance provided under Title 52 or 53.\u201d Medicaid funds are part of public assistance provided under Title 53, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53-6-101 through -805, MCA. We conclude the statutory language is broad enough on its face to encompass obtaining or exerting unauthorized control over Medicaid funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b611  Daniels points out that \u00a7 45-6-313, MCA, covers Medicaid fraud. However, when the facts of a case support a possible charge of more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <em>State v. Smaage </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 94, 98, 915 P.2d 192, 194-95. We hold that Daniels was properly charged with theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">\u00b612 Was Daniels properly charged and convicted under the definition of the offense in effect at the time he committed the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u00b613 The 1999 Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 45-6-301(7)(a) and (b), MCA (1999), to increase the threshold amount for felony theft from $500 to $1,000, with an effective date of October 1, 1999. Daniels argues that because the jury found him guilty of theft of over $500 in Medicaid funds, but made no finding that the value exceeded $1,000, he should be sentenced only for a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00b614 The State contends Daniels waived this argument by failing to present it to the District Court and failing to offer an alternative verdict form to the court. Daniels replies that he was not required to submit any verdict form, and his counsel would have done him a disservice by failing to accept the State\u2019s verdict form which he believed allowed only for a misdemeanor conviction. He points out that, at sentencing, he objected to being sentenced for a felony. Under these circumstances, we will consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b615 Daniels relies on <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 34, 926 P.2d 712, in his argument on this issue. In that case, we held that when a sentencing statute is repealed between the date a defendant commits an offense and the date the defendant is sentenced, the effect of the repeal lessens or ameliorates the defendant\u2019s punishment and the repealer contains no savings clause, the defendant is entitled to be sentenced according to the sentencing statute in effect on the date of sentencing. <em>Wilson, </em>279 Mont. at 40, 926 P.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b616 Value is an element of the offense of felony theft, and must be proven to support the charge. <em>See State v. Furlong </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 251, 255-56, 690 P.2d 986, 988. As a result, when the 1999 Legislature increased the value required to support a charge of felony theft, it changed the definition of the offense, not a sentencing statute. Therefore, <em>Wilson </em>does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b617  Persons alleged to have committed criminal offenses must be charged with violating the law in effect at the time the crime was committed. <em>See State v. Cline </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 520, 532, 555 P.2d 724, 732. Furthermore, a change in the definition of an offense does not affect acts committed prior to the effective date. \u201cThe repeal of any law creating a criminal offense does not constitute a bar to an indictment or information and the punishment of an act already committed in violation of the law so repealed unless the intention to bar such indictment or information and punishment is expressly declared in the repealing act.\u201d Section 1-2-205, MCA. Although Daniels argues modification of the definition of felony theft is distinguishable from repeal of the prior felony theft statute, he provides no support for making a distinction between the effects of modification and repeal for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b618  We hold that Daniels was properly charged and convicted under the definition of the offense of felony theft in effect at the time he committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
