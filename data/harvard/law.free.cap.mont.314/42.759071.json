We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights to L.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">\u00b63 L.S. was born in June of 1998. The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) received multiple reports of unsanitary living conditions at the home of L.S. and his parents. A home inspection in June of 1999 by social workers confirmed the home did not meet minimum standards for safety and sanitation and L.S. was removed from his parents\u2019 care. On subsequent occasions, L.S. was returned to his family and again removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">\u00b64 The District Court adjudicated L.S. a youth in need of care in September of 1999. Thereafter, the Department prepared-and the District Court approved-a treatment plan for Father which focused on Father\u2019s parenting skills, chemical dependency, maintenance of adequate housing for L.S., and maintenance of a healthy mental status. After Father allegedly failed to fulfill various aspects of his treatment plan, the Department petitioned for termination of his parental rights to L.S. Following a hearing on November 30,2001, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order terminating Father\u2019s parental rights. Father appeals. L.S.\u2019s mother is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">\u00b65 A decision on whether to terminate parental rights is within the sound discretion of the district court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>In re T.C., </em>2001 MT 264, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 244, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 70, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). In reviewing whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>district court abused its discretion, however, we review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. T.C., \u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b66 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b67  Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, a district court may terminate parental rights when it finds a child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care, an appropriate treatment plan approved by the court has not been complied with by the parent or has not been successful, and the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. In determining whether a parent\u2019s conduct or condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, a court shall consider, among other things, emotional or mental illness, mental deficiency and excessive use of alcohol or drugs. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. In considering these factors, the court \u201cshall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.\u2019\u201d Section 41-3-609(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b68 In the present case, the District Court entered extensive findings, including that Father failed to complete any portion of the treatment plan and that, notwithstanding that addressing chemical dependency issues was a \u201csignificant component\u201d of the treatment plan, Father continued using both alcohol and dangerous drugs. With regard to Father\u2019s mental health issues, the court highlighted testimony that Father does not take his prescribed medications consistently; misses counseling appointments and tends to seek treatment only when in crisis. The court ultimately found that Father\u2019s \u201cability to parent is not likely to change in a reasonable period of time to benefit [L.S.].\u201d\u2019 Father challenges only the court\u2019s finding that the conduct or condition rendering him unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. \u00b69 Father argues his treatment plan was working and his mental health issues were being resolved, relying on testimony of social worker Bob Frye (Frye) that Father was prescribed \u201ccritical\u201d medication which should control his condition. Consequently, he asserts he should have been given more time to change his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">\u00b610  In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings, however, we do not consider whether the evidence could support a different finding; nor do we substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to the evidence. <em>In re T.A.G., </em>2002 MT 4, \u00b6 10, 308 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>89, \u00b6 10, 39 P.3d 686, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Determining whether conduct or a condition rendering a parent unfit is likely to change within a reasonable time requires an assessment of the parent\u2019s past and present conduct. <em>In re M.T., </em>2002 MT 174, \u00b6 34, 310 Mont. 506, \u00b6 34, 51 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 34 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b611 Here, the following matters are both unchallenged by Father and supported by the record. The Department initially removed L.S. from his parents\u2019 home on June 25,1999, because of unsanitary and unsafe conditions. He subsequently was returned to the home, only to be removed again on multiple occasions. The District Court approved a treatment plan for Father on September 9,1999. Over two years later, on December 20, 2001, the court found Father had \u201cfailed to complete the treatment plant,]\u201d a finding not challenged on appeal. Nor does Father dispute the District Court\u2019s finding that he did not enroll in or attend the required Nurturing Fathers program; did not enroll in or complete a nutrition class; continued using chemicals excessively; was noncompliant with his chemical dependency treatment program; did not maintain his home appropriately for a small child; did not consistently take prescribed medications; and missed counseling appointments. The District Court also cited to testimony that Father\u2019s ability to parent had not improved in the past <em>2V% </em>years. These findings regarding Father\u2019s past and present conduct clearly are relevant in determining whether his conduct will change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">\u00b612 With regard to Father\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s finding that his ability to parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, based on Frye\u2019s testimony that a prescribed medication should control his mental health problems, Frye\u2019s overall testimony generally supports the District Court\u2019s finding. When asked whether Father was good about taking the medication prescribed to him, Frye responded, \u201cThat I\u2019m not totally sure on.\u2019\u201d He further testified that he had not seen Father frequently and indicated his knowledge about Father\u2019s condition was based largely on what Father self-reported. Notably, when asked whether Father had been \u201cdedicated to his treatment,\u201d Frye responded that Father had \u201c[b]een somewhat inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b613  Considering the District Court\u2019s unchallenged and sufficiently supported findings regarding Father\u2019s failure to complete any portion of his treatment plan, together with the passage of more than two years between the approval of the treatment plan and the hearing on termination of parental rights, we conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that his ability to parent is not likely to change in a reasonable period of time is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b614 Father also asserts that he requested enrollment in an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>treatment program, but the Department turned him away. He advances no legal authority, however, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., under which the Department was required to enroll him in that program. Therefore, we decline to address this assertion further. <em>See In re </em>B.P., 2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 430, \u00b6 41, 35 P.3d 291, \u00b6 41 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b615 Father also claims he has a strong desire to parent L.S. This may well be true. Children cannot always afford to wait for their parents to be able to parent, however, and Father has not only been unable to change his conduct to achieve his desire during a period well in excess of two years, but the record before us establishes that his conduct is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b616 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
