We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\u00b62 We address the following restated issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury on flight?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by improperly considering Nolan\u2019s poverty and social relationships in determining his sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">\u00b65 On December 9, 1998, the State of Montana charged Nolan by information with the felony offenses of assault on a peace officer and criminal endangerment. The case proceeded to a jury trial at which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>following factual information was elicited through testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b66 During the early morning hours of December 6, 1998, Billings Police Department Officer Shawn Finnegan observed a vehicle traveling 52 miles an hour in a 35 mile-per-hour speed zone. Finnegan activated the overhead lights and siren on his patrol car, but the driver did not pull over. Instead, the driver continued driving at high speed through a residential neighborhood. Finnegan was unable to safely match the other vehicle\u2019s speed because of the ice and snow on the road and the parked cars on both sides of the street. The speeding vehicle proceeded past two stop signs without slowing and eventually crashed into multiple parked vehicles, which brought it to a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b67 Denise Boggio ran from the passenger side of the crashed vehicle, screaming and crying. Her face was bloodied. After tending to Boggio, Finnegan observed that no one else was in the vehicle. Boggio told Finnegan that Nolan was the driver, and described him and his clothing. Nolan and Boggio had argued while driving, he had hit her and she was scared because of his driving, but he had not responded to her requests to be let out of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b68 Cindy Johnson was asleep in her home, located near the crash scene, when she was awakened by the sound of someone coming in her front door. She got out of bed and encountered Nolan-a stranger to her-in her house. He was bleeding and stated that someone was trying to kill him. When Johnson said she was going to call the police, Nolan told her not to do so, saying that he had been trying to sell drugs to the person who tried to kill him. Johnson called the police, but Nolan left the house before officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b69 Shortly thereafter and near the same area, Officer David Dierenfield spotted Nolan and asked to talk to him. Nolan told Dierenfield he was not who they were looking for and asked to be left alone. Dierenfield then told Nolan he was under arrest and asked him to remove his left hand from his coat pocket. Nolan kept his hand in his pocket and began to walk towards Dierenfield. After several orders to show his hands, Nolan continued to walk towards Dierenfield with his hand in his pocket. Dierenfield drew his weapon and moved behind his patrol car for cover. As he continued towards Dierenfield, Nolan said \u201cGo ahead and shoot.\u201d Eventually Nolan removed his empty hand from his pocket. Dierenfield again told Nolan he was under arrest, but Nolan turned and walked away. Dierenfield holstered his weapon and followed Nolan, who began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b610 When Dierenfield caught Nolan, the two men fought, both of them slipping on the ice. Nolan broke free and ran. Dierenfield caught him, and the two fought again. Several other officers arrived and were able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to subdue and handcuff Nolan after pepper-spraying him. During the altercation, Dierenfield received cuts and scrapes to his knuckles and knee, and one of his fingernails was partially torn off.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b611 The jury ultimately convicted Nolan of criminal endangerment, a felony, but could not agree on a verdict on the felony charge of assault on a peace officer. Instead, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the lesser-included misdemeanor offense of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b612 Nolan did not appear at his original sentencing hearing, and the District Court issued a warrant for his arrest. Nolan was arrested several months later in southern California and returned to Montana. On May 8, 2000, the District Court sentenced him to five years in the Montana State Prison on the criminal endangerment conviction and six months in the Yellowstone County Detention Facility on the resisting arrest conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently. The District Court listed numerous reasons for its sentence. Nolan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury on flight?</p>\n<p id=\"A-H\">\u00b614 After Nolan\u2019s trial, we determined in <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 46, 297 Mont. 111Ill, \u00b6 46, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 46, that flight instructions improperly inject argument into a trial court\u2019s instructions and that such comment should be limited to counsel. We concluded that, \u201cin future cases,\u201d even where evidence of flight has been properly admitted, a flight instruction should not be given. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">\u00b615 In the present case, Nolan objected to the State\u2019s proposed flight instruction on the grounds that the instruction was not timely filed and the circumstances did not warrant a flight instruction. The District Court overruled the objections and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">If you are satisfied that the crime charged in the information has been committed by someone, then you may take into consideration any testimony showing, or tending to show, flight by the defendant. This testimony may be considered by the jury as a circumstance tending to prove a consciousness of guilt, but is not sufficient of itself to prove guilt. The weight to be given such circumstance and the significance if any, to be attached to it, are matters for the jury to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Nolan asserts entitlement to the application of <em>Hall </em>to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b616 Our general rule is that an appellant must show that an objection was made at trial on the same basis as the error asserted on appeal. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, \u00b6 38, 300 Mont. 458, \u00b6 38, 5 P.3d 547, \u00b6 38 (citations omitted). Requiring a defendant to raise the issue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>district court through a specific objection gives the prosecution and the trial court the ability to avoid or correct the purported error. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b617 Since <em>Hall, </em>we have rejected-on three occasions-appellants\u2019 arguments against a flight instruction when the proper and specific objection was not made at trial. <em>See Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39; <em>State v. Baker, </em>2000 MT 307, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 302 Mont. 408, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 15 P.3d 379, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; <em>State v. Hatten, </em>1999 MT 298, \u00b6 67, 297 Mont. 127, \u00b6 67, 991 P.2d 939, \u00b6 67. When the defendant does not raise a <em>\u201cHall-type\u201d </em>objection to the flight instruction during the settlement of instructions in district court, appellate review of that claim is waived. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 39. Nolan concedes he did not raise the proper objection at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b618 Here, however, unlike the defendants in <em>Davis, Baker and Hatten, </em>Nolan asserts entitlement to consideration of his <em>Hall-related </em>claim on appeal pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, allows a claim of error based on constitutional rights to be raised on appeal even when not objected to at trial <em>if the </em>appellant establishes the error was prejudicial <em>and </em>\u201cthe right asserted in the claim did not exist at the time of trial and has been determined to be retroactive in its application^]\u201d Nolan contends his constitutional right to a fair trial was violated by the giving of the flight instruction and the error was prejudicial. We need not consider these contentions, however, because \u00a7 46-20-701(2)(a), MCA, applies only where the right asserted \u201chas been determined to be retroactive in its application.\u201d We stated without equivocation in <em>Hall </em>that our ruling that flight instructions should not be given applied only to \u201cfuture trials.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 48. In other words, the ruling was prospective, not retroactive, in its application and Nolan\u2019s trial occurred before that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b619  We conclude that Nolan waived his right to raise a <em>Hall-related </em>objection on appeal under <em>Davis, </em>which requires that the proper objection be made at trial. We further conclude that Nolan has not met the requirements of \u00a7 46-20-701(2)(a), MCA, for raising a claimed constitutional error on appeal to which objection was not made at trial. We hold, therefore, that Nolan has not established error in the District Court\u2019s giving <em>of </em>the flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b620 2. Did the District Court err by improperly considering Nolan\u2019s poverty and social relationships in determining his sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b621 The District Court sentenced Nolan to five years for criminal endangerment and six months for resisting arrest. Under \u00a7 45-5-207(2), MCA, the maximum sentence for criminal endangerment is ten years. Under \u00a7 45-7-301(3), MCA, the maximum sentence for resisting arrest is six months. The sentences are within statutory parameters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Nolan nevertheless contends his sentence violates \u00a7 46-18- 101(3)(c), MCA, and his constitutional due process rights. We address each contention in turn, mindful that we review criminal sentences for legality only, confining our review to whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 27, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 27, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b622 Section 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA, which is part of Montana\u2019s correctional and sentencing policy, provides, \u201cSentencing practices must be neutral with respect to the offender\u2019s race, gender, religion, national origin, or social or economic status.\u201d Nolan contends the record indicates his sentence was based on the prohibited factors of \u201csocial or economic status.\u201d We note that the statute does not define \u201ceconomic status,\u201d nor does either party clearly do so. Nolan apparently equates \u201ceconomic status\u201d to indigency or poverty and, for purposes of this opinion only, we will do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b623 Nolan presented the testimony of three witnesses during the sentencing hearing. The thrust of the testimony was that Nolan needed counseling, not prison. In addition, each of Nolan\u2019s witnesses, including Boggio, testified in some fashion that Nolan is a good father. Neither the State nor the District Court inquired about this subject during Boggio\u2019s testimony. After Nolan\u2019s second witness, Cherise Lynn McArthur, testified that Nolan was a good father, the court inquired how many children Nolan has, and McArthur responded \u201cI believe he has five-four?\u201d On cross-examination, the State also inquired about the number of Nolan\u2019s children. On cross-examination of Nolan\u2019s third witness, Cassandra Vargas, the State asked how many children Nolan has, and Vargas responded \u201cUm, five-six, actually, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Almost immediately thereafter, the State asked Vargas whether Nolan supports any of the children, and she stated \u201cnot that I know of.\u201d The transcript reflects that Vargas then laughed. Nolan also gave a lengthy statement to the court and talked about how much he loves his children and they love him. The court inquired about the extent to which he supports the children and Nolan\u2019s various answers reflect that the support, if any, is sporadic. He also acknowledged a $40,000 hospital debt on which he has paid nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b624 In its written sentencing order, the District Court listed numerous reasons for the sentence imposed, including the violence of the felony offense at issue, Nolan\u2019s 25 traffic-related convictions, 2 prior felony convictions involving violence, and the numerous opportunities previously given Nolan to be a responsible, law-abiding citizen. In addition, the court considered that \u201cwhile employed [Nolan] failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>be responsible towards paying any debts including non-support for the number of dependents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b625  Nolan argues the District Court relied on his poverty as a factor in sentencing in violation of \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA. As set forth above, the record does not support this argument. While the court noted Nolan\u2019s failure to pay his debts, the record does not indicate that poverty was a factor. As a general matter, failure to pay debts does not equal poverty. Moreover, the court\u2019s observation that Nolan did not make payments toward his debts was expressly limited to times when Nolan was employed. We conclude the District Court did not rely on Nolan\u2019s alleged poverty in violation of \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b626 Nolan also contends his sentence violates \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA, because the District Court focused on his \u201csocial status\u201d by inquiring about such things as the number of children he had fathered out of wedlock. His contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b627  First, Nolan did not object to the inquiries at the time they were made, as required by Rule 103(a)(1), M.R.Evid. Second, Nolan opened the door to the court\u2019s inquiries by presenting both witness testimony and his own statement regarding being a good father and loving his children. Having done so, he cannot now complain that the court inquired further into those subjects. Finally, the court\u2019s sentencing order, from which this appeal is taken, does not mention or rely on the number of Nolan\u2019s children. We conclude the District Court did not rely on Nolan\u2019s social status in violation of \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA, in sentencing Nolan.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b628 We next turn to Nolan\u2019s claim that his sentence violates his constitutional due process rights. He first asserts the District Court\u2019s violation of \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA, resulted in a violation of his due process rights. Having determined above that the court did not violate \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(c), MCA, we need not address this contention further. \u00b629 Nolan also makes a broader due process argument, however. Quoting from <em>State v. Farrell </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 483, 497, 676 P.2d 168, 176 (citation omitted), he asserts the court\u2019s consideration of his \u201cfinancial background in setting ... a sentence [was] so arbitrary or unfair as to be a denial of due process.\u201d He also relies on <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 37, where we held that a defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated when the district court record led us to conclude the sentence was based on indigency. <em>Farrell </em>and <em>Pritchett </em>are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b630 In <em>Farrell, </em>the defendant was convicted of theft of public assistance funds and was given the maximum ten-year sentence, all suspended. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 487, 676 P.2d at 171. The sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>court stated that it was imposing the maximum sentence, suspended, because it did not think the defendant could pay the restitution imposed in less than 10 years. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 494, 676 P.2d at 174. The defendant appealed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b631 We stated in <em>Farrell </em>our belief that his due process rights might have been violated because indigency may have been the sentencing criterion, which would infringe on the fundamental fairness protected by due process rights. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 498, 676 P.2d at 177 (citation omitted). \u201cDue process requires only that indigency or poverty not be used as the touchstone for imposing the maximum allowable punishment.\u201d <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 499, 676 P.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b632 In <em>Pritchett, </em>the defendant was convicted of burglary and given the maximum 20-year sentence, all suspended. <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6 26. The record revealed that the person who prepared the presentence investigation report explicitly recommended the sentence \u201c[t]o give the Defendant adequate time to pay off the restitution.\u201d <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6 3. We determined that, while the sentencing court did not expressly state it was doing so, sufficient evidence of record supported a conclusion that the length of the sentence was based on the defendant\u2019s indigency, thus violating his due process rights. <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30, 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b633  In significant contrast to <em>Farrell </em>and <em>Pritchett, </em>Nolan did not receive the maximum sentence for his felony offense and his sentence did not include restitution. Moreover, it was clear in <em>Farrell </em>and <em>Pritchett </em>that those defendants\u2019 indigency was the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for imposing the maximum allowable punishment. Here, the District Court listed numerous reasons for its sentence, including a criminal record of violent felony offenses. Only one of the considerations was that Nolan did not pay his debts \u201cwhile employed\u201d and, as discussed above, failure to pay debts while employed is not equivalent to poverty or indigency. Finally, it is clear in this case that the passing reference to Nolan\u2019s failure to pay his debts was not \u201cthe touchstone\u201d of his sentence. We conclude that Nolan\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b634  Having found no statutory or constitutional violation, we hold the District Court did not err in sentencing Nolan.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
