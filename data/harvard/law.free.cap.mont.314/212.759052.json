(WSI). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to WSI on all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint based on its determination that \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, provides WSI with immunity from suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to WSI on the Saaris\u2019 attractive nuisance claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">\u00b65 On December 4,1998, Jean Saari (Jean) went inner tube sledding with a church youth group at The Big Mountain, a ski resort owned by WSI. The youth group arrived at The Big Mountain when the ski resort had closed its operations for the day. Notwithstanding, the group selected a ski slope and began sledding. It did not pay any fees to WSI to use the sledding hill and did not rent or purchase equipment from WSI. At some point during the evening, the inner tube on which Jean was riding went out of control and crashed into a creek bed. As a result of the accident, Jean suffered injuries from which she eventually died.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00b66 The Saaris subsequently filed a complaint in the District Court against WSI alleging six negligence counts denominated as follows: survival action, wrongful death, negligence, premises liability, attractive nuisance and infliction of emotional distress. WSI answered the complaint. It then moved for summary judgment on all counts, arguing that, pursuant to \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, it owed no duty of care to Jean and, consequently, the Saaris\u2019 claims were precluded. As to the attractive nuisance count, WSI also moved for summary judgment on the basis that the Saaris could not establish the requisite elements of the claim. After briefing by the parties, the District Court entered its order granting summary judgment to WSI on the grounds that all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint were precluded by \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, and that the attractive nuisance count also failed as a matter of law. Judgment was entered accordingly and the Saaris appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by that court. <em>Contreras v. Fitzgerald, </em>2002 MT 208, \u00b6 10, 311 Mont. 257, \u00b6 10, 54 P.3d 983, \u00b6 10. In that regard, summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Once the movant does so, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to present evidence establishing the existence of material issues of fact which preclude summary judgment. <em>Contreras, </em>\u00b6 10. \u201c[T]he opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Walchuk, </em>2002 MT 262, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 240, \u00b6 9, 59 P.3d 377, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b68 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to WSI on all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint based on its determination that \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, provides WSI with immunity from suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b69  Section 70-16-302(1), MCA provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">[a] person who uses property, including property owned or leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>by a public entity, for recreational purposes, with or without permission, does so without any assurance from the landowner that the property is safe for any purpose if the person does not give a valuable consideration to the landowner in exchange for the recreational use of the property. The landowner owes the person no duty of care with respect to the condition of the property, except that the landowner is liable to the person for any injury to person or property for an act or omission that constitutes willful or wanton misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The general purpose of \u00a7 70-16-302(1), MCA, is to encourage landowners to make their property freely available for public use by granting the landowner relief from liability to people gratuitously entering the property for recreational purposes. <em>Simchuk v. Angel Island Community Ass\u2019n </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 221, 226, 833 P.2d 158, 161 (citations omitted). By its terms, however, \u00a7 70-16-302(1), MCA, provides for liability when the recreational user gives valuable consideration to the landowner in exchange for using the property or when the landowner acts in a manner constituting willful or wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b610 In its motion for summary judgment, WSI argued that Jean was using its property for recreational purposes for which she did not give consideration and, as a result, \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, shielded it from liability for her injuries and death. The District Court agreed and granted the motion. The Saaris contend the District Court erred in doing so because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the \u201cconsideration\u201d and \u201cwillful and wanton misconduct\u201d criteria in \u00a7 70-16-302(1), MCA, either of which-if resolved in their favor-would result in WSI losing its immunity from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b611 The Saaris first argue that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether WSI received valuable consideration in exchange for use of the property by Jean and the youth group. As stated above, \u00a7 70-16-302(1), MCA, relieves a landowner from liability for injuries to persons using the landowner\u2019s property for recreational purposes where the landowner does not receive valuable consideration for that use. It is not necessary that the user furnish the consideration, but the consideration must be given by someone to create access to the property for the user. <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 227, 833 P.2d at 162. \u00b612 In support of its motion for summary judgment, WSI submitted the affidavit of its chief executive officer which stated that the youth group neither paid WSI any fees to use the property for sledding nor rented or purchased any equipment from WSI on the night Jean was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>injured. This affidavit establishes the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether WSI received valuable consideration for Jean\u2019s use of its property. WSI having met its initial burden on summary judgment, the Saaris were required to come forward with substantial evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Contreras, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b613 The Saaris concede that Jean and the youth group did not pay any fees to use WSI\u2019s property on the evening of the accident. They argue, however, that WSI still received valuable consideration in exchange for Jean\u2019s use of the property because WSI benefits financially from after-hours sledders. Specifically, the Saaris contend that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[i]t is very likely that people allowed to tube at Big Mountain when it is closed to the public will come back during operating hours. It is also likely that the people tubing after hours would purchase food and equipment from vending machines, restaurants and shops at the ski hill base. WSI directly profits from people spending money at the businesses operated by its lessees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">There are two problems with the Saaris\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b614 First, while it is true that it is not necessary for the ultimate user-in this case, Jean-to be the one who furnishes the valuable consideration to the property owner for the use of the property, it is necessary that the consideration be given \u201cto create access to the premises <em>for </em>the ultimate user.\u201d <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 227, 833 P.2d at 162 (emphasis added). The Saaris present no evidence-indeed, they do not even contend-that anyone gave valuable consideration specifically so that Jean could access WSI\u2019s property on the evening at issue. Moreover, the Saaris advance no legal authority in support of the proposition that the economic benefit received by WSI when it receives valuable consideration from another person for that person\u2019s own recreational use of WSI\u2019s property at a different point in time constitutes valuable consideration given on Jean\u2019s behalf for her use of the property on the night in question. Rule 23 (a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that a party\u2019s arguments be supported with citation to legal authority, and we will not address arguments for which legal authority is not advanced. <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 266, \u00b6 31, 302 Mont. 39, \u00b6 31, 22 P.3d 166, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b615 Second, the Saaris\u2019 remaining assertions regarding WSI\u2019s indirect economic benefit from after-hour inner tube sledders are purely speculative. The Saaris offer no factual basis in the form of affidavits or otherwise for these assertions. As stated above, the party opposing summary judgment \u201cmust present material and substantial evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 9. The Saaris\u2019 statements that certain matters are \u201clikely\u2019 do not constitute material and substantial evidence; indeed, they do not constitute evidence at all.</p>\n<p id=\"A44\">\u00b616 The Saaris point out, however, that they requested business and financial documents from WSI during discovery which would have supported their contentions here, but WSI refused to produce the documents. They argue that WSI\u2019s refusal to provide the requested information, when viewed in the light most favorable to them, establishes the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether WSI received valuable consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b617  On receiving the Saaris\u2019 discovery requests, WSI moved for-and the District Court granted-a protective order. The proper method by which to challenge WSI\u2019s refusal to provide the documents was to appeal the District Court\u2019s protective order. The Saaris have not done so. Moreover, their assertion that WSI\u2019s refusal to provide the documents somehow indicates that it did receive valuable consideration for the use of its property is entirely speculative. An <em>absence </em>of evidence simply cannot-under law or common sense-establish the existence of a genuine issue of material <em>fact. </em>We conclude that the Saaris have failed to establish the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether WSI received valuable consideration for Jean\u2019s use of its property on the evening of her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b618  The Saaris also argue that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether WSI committed willful or wanton misconduct which would make it liable for Jean\u2019s injuries under \u00a7 70-16-302(1), MCA. They contend that WSI\u2019s failure to prevent the youth group from sledding after hours or to supervise the group\u2019s activities constitutes willful or wanton misconduct in light of WSI\u2019s knowledge of the dangers involved and reflects WSI\u2019s gross indifference to human life and safety. Again, however, the Saaris fail to support these conclusory and speculative statements with any substantial evidence. In the absence of such evidence, we conclude that the Saaris have failed to establish the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether WSI acted in a manner constituting willful or wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b619 The Saaris next contend, relying on <em>Simchuk, </em>that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to WSI because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether WSI\u2019s property was open to the public. In <em>Simchuk, </em>the plaintiff was injured while playing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>basketball on property owned by a homeowners\u2019 association. The property was available for use only by dues-paying members of the association and their invited guests, and the plaintiff was a guest of a dues-paying member at the time of his injury. <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 224, 833 P.2d at 160. The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the association, and a subsequent jury trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 224, 833 P.2d at 160. The association moved forjudgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that\u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, precluded any recovery by the plaintiff. The district court granted the motion and the plaintiff appealed. <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 225, 833 P.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b620 In addressing whether \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, shielded the association from liability, we interpreted the statute by reviewing its legislative history, case law from other jurisdictions and the definition of \u201crecreational purposes\u201d set forth in \u00a7 70-16-301, MCA. We concluded that \u201cit is evident that [\u00a7 70-16-302, MCA,] applies to land made available for public use. Therefore, if the land upon which an injury occurs is not available for public use, the landowner does not enjoy the protection of limited liability.\u201d <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 226, 833 P.2d at 161. We went on to determine that, where an injury occurred on property owned by a private homeowners\u2019 association which was available for use only by dues-paying members and their guests-but not the general public-the property was not available for public use. Consequently, we determined \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, did not apply to shield the association from liability. <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 226, 833 P.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b621 The Saaris contend that WSI\u2019s property was not open to the public for use as contemplated by <em>Simchuk, </em>because the ski resort is open only for limited hours and limited purposes, and only if the user purchases ski lift tickets. While the Saaris are correct, we conclude that the <em>Simchuk </em>requirement that the property at issue be \u201cavailable for public use\u201d was manifestly incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b622 When interpreting statutes, our role is \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. In doing so, we must pursue the intent of the Legislature and that intent is determined by interpreting the plain meaning of the language used. <em>In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8. Furthermore, where the language used is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we 'will not employ other means of interpretation. <em>In re R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u00b623  As stated above, \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">[a] person who uses property, including property owned or leased by a public entity, for recreational purposes, with or without permission, does so without any assurance from the landowner that the property is safe for any purpose if the person does not give a valuable consideration to the landowner in exchange for the recreational use of the property. The landowner owes the person no duty of care with respect to the condition of the property, except that the landowner is liable to the person for any injury to person or property for an act or omission that constitutes willful or wanton misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The statute contains no express language requiring that the property at issue be \u201cavailable for public use\u201d before a landowner will be protected from liability. Indeed, \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, expressly provides that a landowner owes a person using property for recreational purposes no duty of care regarding the condition of the property even where the injured person uses the property without permission. Thus, the statute contemplates, by its plain language, circumstances where the property is not open for general public use. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, clearly and unambiguously does not require that property be \u201cavailable for public use\u201d in order for the landowner to be shielded from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b624  In <em>Simchuk, </em>253 Mont. at 226, 833 P.2d at 161, rather than beginning with an examination of the plain language of the statute, we looked to legislative history, case law from other jurisdictions and language from another statute to interpret \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA. In doing so, we ignored our basic rules of statutory interpretation and inserted language into the statute which is not there. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA; <em>In re </em>R.L.S., \u00b6 8. Indeed, the \u201cavailable for public use\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Simchuk </em>essentially negates the \u201cwithout permission\u201d language of the statute and exceeds the statute\u2019s parameters. Consequently, we overrule <em>Simchuk </em>to the extent it requires that the property in question be \u201cavailable for public use\u201d before a landowner is shielded from liability pursuant to \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b625 Finally, the Saaris argue that, even if the District Court correctly determined that \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, applied to shield WSI from liability, the court still erred in granting summary judgment to WSI because WSI owed Jean a separate duty of reasonable care as to its conduct and policies which required it to prohibit or monitor after-hours sledding activities on its property. According to the Saaris, genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether WSI breached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>this separate duty which is not within the purview of \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b626 A review of the record reflects that the Saaris did not argue this separate duty relating to WSI\u2019s \u201cconduct and policies\u201d in the District Court. The entirety of the Saaris\u2019 arguments in the summary judgment proceedings was based on WSI\u2019s general duty of care regarding the management of its property, as set forth in \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA. This is the very duty from which certain landowners are exempt from liability, under certain circumstances, under \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA. We will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal because it is unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it had no opportunity to address. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). Consequently, we decline to address the Saaris\u2019 argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b627  We hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to WSI on all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint based on its determination that \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, provides WSI with immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b628 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to WSI on the Saaris\u2019 attractive nuisance claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b629 In addition to concluding that WSI was entitled to summary judgment on all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint based on \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA, the court also separately determined that WSI was entitled to summary judgment on the Saaris\u2019 attractive nuisance claim. In doing so, the court concluded there were no genuine issues of material fact related to the attractive nuisance claim and, based on the undisputed facts, the claim failed as a matter of law. The Saaris assert that genuine issues of material fact exist which preclude summary judgment on their attractive nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b630  We concluded above that WSI is entitled to summary judgment on all counts of the Saaris\u2019 complaint-including the attractive nuisance claim-based on the immunity from liability provided by \u00a7 70-16-302, MCA. Consequently, there is no need to determine whether WSI is entitled to summary judgment on the attractive nuisance claim on any other basis and we decline to address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
