We reverse the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the State of Montana establish the element \u201cset at liberty by court order\u201d of the Count II bail-jumping charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the prosecutor engage in impermissible cross-examination and submit inadmissible rebuttal evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\u00b65 Nolan failed to appear for a criminal trial against him set for May 4, 1999. He was arrested on a bench warrant later that day, and trial-at which he was convicted of resisting arrest and criminal endangerment-was held two days later. Nolan\u2019s failure to appear for trial on May 4, 1999, is the basis for the Count I bail-jumping charge in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">\u00b66 Nolan then failed to appear for his July 12, 1999, sentencing following his conviction at his May 1999 trial. He was arrested in California five months later on a bench warrant, returned to Montana, and sentenced. (We affirmed his conviction in <em>State v. Nolan, </em>2003 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>13, 314 Mont. 47, 62 P.3d 1118.) In June of 2000, the District Court granted the State leave to amend the Information in this action by adding a second count of bail-jumping, for Nolan\u2019s failure to appear for his July 12,1999, sentencing (Count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b67 The District Court denied Nolan\u2019s motion to sever trial of Counts I and II. Nolan represented himself at his three-day jury trial, at the end of which the jury found him guilty on both counts of bail-jumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b68 Did the State of Montana establish the element \u201cset at liberty by court order\u201d of the Count II bail-jumping charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b69 Due process requires the State to prove all elements of a charged criminal offense. <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 275, 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2080, 124 L.Ed.2d 182, 188. We review the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Granby </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 193, 199, 939 P.2d 1006, 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b610 Bail-jumping is defined at \u00a7 45-7-308, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">A person commits the offense of bail-jumping if, having been set at liberty by court order, with or without security, upon condition that he will subsequently appear at a specified time and place, he purposely fails without lawful excuse to appear at that time and place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Nolan argues that the State did not establish that he was \u201cset at liberty by court order\u201d when he failed to appear for sentencing in July of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b611 The State contends that <em>State v. Snaric </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 62, 862 P.2d 1175, applies. In <em>Snaric, </em>this Court held that the State had proven the elements of bail-jumping in the face of Snaric\u2019s claim that he had not been ordered to appear for a change of plea hearing. The State says that, in the present case, the court\u2019s setting of a sentencing date was a court order to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">\u00b612 The State\u2019s assertion does not address, however, whether Nolan was set at liberty by a court order. The element of \u201cset at liberty by court order\u201d was not at issue in <em>Snaric. </em>In fact, the Information against Snaric stated, in relevant part, that Snaric had \u201cbeen set at liberty by the order of District Court Judge Ed McLean upon condition that he would subsequently appear ....\u201d <em>Snaric, </em>262 Mont. at 66, 862 P.2d at 1178. We conclude that <em>Snaric </em>does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u00b613  At the trial in this matter, the Yellowstone County Clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>District Court testified that, at the conclusion of the verdict in Nolan\u2019s May 1999 trial, the District Court specifically commanded, \u201cThe defendant is remanded to the custody of the Sheriff.\u201d A legal assistant to the Yellowstone County Attorney testified Nolan was mistakenly released from the jail prior to his sentencing, apparently because jail personnel saw that he had earlier posted bond and did not see that a second bond had been imposed on the bench warrant issued when he failed to appear for trial. The District Court did not sign an order setting Nolan at liberty, and Nolan did not post bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b614 We conclude that as to Count II, the State did not establish that Nolan was \u201cset at liberty by court order,\u201d the first element of the offense of bail-jumping, as a matter of law. We conclude, therefore, as a matter of law, that no rational jury could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We reverse Nolan\u2019s conviction on Count II and direct the District Court to dismiss that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b615 Did the prosecutor engage in impermissible cross-examination and submit inadmissible rebuttal evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b616  Evidence of a defendant\u2019s character or character trait generally is not admissible in a criminal case to prove that the defendant acted in conformity with that trait. Rule 404(a), M.R.Evid. If a defendant first opens the door by entering evidence of good character, though, the State may present rebuttal evidence of bad character. <em>See State v. Gowan, </em>2000 MT 277, \u00b6 11, 302 Mont. 127, \u00b6 11, 13 P.3d 376, \u00b6 11. The rebuttal evidence must be legitimate and relevant. <em>State v. Eklund, </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 420, 429, 872 P.2d 323, 329. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b617 In presenting his defense at trial, Nolan testified that the reason he did not appear for his May 4,1999, trial (Count I) was that he was taking prescription medication for pain from a rotten tooth and slept through the time he was to be in court. He testified that he did not appear for sentencing (Count II) because he feared he was facing 120 years in prison, he loved his children and did not want to leave them and he did not want to leave a job he had just accepted as a used car salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b618 On cross-examination, and over Nolan\u2019s objection, the prosecutor asked Nolan to \u201c[t]ell me every one of your odd jobs,\u201d and pursued an extended series of questions attempting to elicit from Nolan every job he had had in addition to car salesman. Nolan answered that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>also had odd jobs including lawn mowing, detailer, drywaller and painter, and did \u201cIjlust about whatever I could just about get my hands into\u201d because he had \u201clittle mouths to feed and bills to do.\u201d The prosecutor inquired as to whether Nolan had done anything illegal to make money, and Nolan testified that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b619 The prosecutor also cross-examined Nolan extensively-again, over Nolan\u2019s objection- about his personal relationships. She began by questioning him about his children. In response to a series of questions, Nolan admitted he has five children under the age of 12 with four different women, none of whom he had married. The prosecutor questioned Nolan about having relationships with several women at one time and that two of the women were pregnant at the same time. Nolan also admitted that he had not paid any child support through the courts, but stated he had not been ordered to pay any and that he had supported his children directly through their mothers. At one point, Nolan objected to questioning about bis relationship with a certain woman on grounds that he had no children with her. The prosecutor replied, \u201cWell, she would be one of the few that hasn\u2019t had one of your kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b620 On rebuttal, over Nolan\u2019s objection, the prosecution presented the testimony of a woman who stated she had worked as a prostitute in 1999 and that Nolan was her pimp. The woman testified that her income while working as a prostitute had been about $500 per night, all of which she turned over to Nolan in exchange for \u201c[p]retty much whatever I wanted.\u201d She had since \u201ccleaned up\u201d and obtained employment in a meat packing plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b621 The State contends Nolan opened the door to the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination and rebuttal by his assertions that he was a decent man and member of the community who cared about his family. It points out that Nolan offered evidence on his character that was broader than the crime charged, citing <em>Michelson v. United States </em>(1948), 335 U.S. 469, 484, 69 S.Ct. 213, 222, 93 L.Ed. 168, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b622 Nolan contends the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and rebuttal evidence forced him to defend his lifestyle choices about the number of women he slept with, the number of children he had, his financial care of his children and the allegation that he worked as a pimp. Nolan states the prosecutor thus impermissibly turned a bail-jumping trial into a trial of his morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b623  On this record, we agree with Nolan. The State\u2019s right to a full cross-examination of a defendant\u2019s character traits, once placed at issue, is not limitless. <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 18. \u201c[T]he accused\u2019s entire life should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>not be searched in an effort to convict him.\u201d <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>State v. Heine </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 25, 29, 544 P.2d 1212, 1214). In this case, the prosecutor went beyond permissible cross-examination and rebuttal and ended up trying Nolan\u2019s character. We conclude the District Court abused its discretion in failing to sustain Nolan\u2019s objections to these lines of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b624 Once error has been established, we conduct a two-step analysis to determine whether the error prejudiced the criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible. The first step in the analysis is an inquiry as to whether the error is categorized as structural error or trial error. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 37, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 37, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 37. Erroneous admission of evidence, such as in this case, is a classic example of trial error. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 48. Trial error is not presumptively prejudicial and therefore not automatically reversible. It is subject to review under our harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b625 The State contends the evidence of both Nolan\u2019s guilt and his lack of credibility was so overwhelming that any error was harmless. However, in <em>Van Kirk, </em>we rejected the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test, noting that this test had \u201ceclipsed the more substantive inquiry of whether the erroneously admitted evidence might have contributed to the conviction,\u201d in favor of a \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34,43. We further explained that in cases where tainted evidence was not introduced as proof of an element of the crime charged, the State must nonetheless demonstrate that, qualitatively, there was no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. Here, the tainted evidence was not introduced in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, but in the cross-examination of Nolan and in rebuttal, ostensibly to refute his character evidence and impeach his credibility. Accordingly, the State\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that the evidence did not reasonably contribute to Nolan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b626  The evidence adduced by the prosecution, over Nolan\u2019s objection, concerning his personal relationships and employment was highly inflammatory and prejudicial. In a trial that hinged on Nolan\u2019s credibility, we are persuaded that a significant possibility exists that the qualitative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper cross-examination and rebuttal testimony contributed to his conviction. We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>reverse Nolan\u2019s conviction on Count I and remand for further proceedings relating to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b627 Because we have reversed Nolan\u2019s conviction on Count II and directed the District Court to dismiss that charge, and also have reversed and remanded Count I for retrial, we need not address the third issue raised by Nolan, concerning whether he was prejudiced by joinder of the two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b628 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
