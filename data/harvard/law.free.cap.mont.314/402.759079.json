She moved to suppress evidence gathered by the State. When the District Court denied Olson\u2019s motion, she pled guilty to an amended charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. However, she appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress. We reverse in part and affirm in part the District Court\u2019s order. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Olson\u2019s motion to</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">suppress the statements she made to Detective Wells?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b64 2. Was the search warrant application supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b65 3. Did a particularized suspicion exist to justify an investigative traffic stop of Olson\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b66 On March 16,2001, Detective Jeff Beecroft received a report from informant Mike Smith regarding a possible methamphetamine laboratory on his wife\u2019s property in Great Falls, Montana. Mike stated that he and his wife, Nora Smith, were separated, and then provided Beecroft with Nora\u2019s address. Mike advised Beecroft that he had entered Nora\u2019s garage to retrieve two camper jacks. Mike further advised Beecroft that while in the garage, he had observed what he believed to be a meth lab. Mike indicated that he had observed tubing, mason jars, and coffee filters connected together, and had smelled the odor of anhydrous ammonia. He informed Beecroft that he had worked in a fertilizer plant for several years and was familiar with the smell of anhydrous ammonia. Mike also told Beecroft that he had observed a man \u201ccooking\u201d methamphetamine in the garage and identified the man as Huston Curran. Finally, he informed Beecroft that he had spoken briefly with Curran, who had stated, \u201cyou\u2019re going to keep this cool, now, right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">\u00b67 Detective Beecroft dispatched Detectives Jim Wells and Michael Grubb to conduct surveillance of Nora\u2019s property. Within an hour after Wells and Grubb began surveillance, individuals on Nora\u2019s property began to remove items from the garage and place them into a vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The vehicle then left Nora\u2019s property. At the request of Wells and Grubb, Sergeant Tito Rodriguez initiated an investigative traffic stop of the vehicle. At the time of the stop, Olson was driving the vehicle and her young son was in the passenger seat. Curran and a man identified as Justin Becker were in the rear seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b68 The vehicle stopped by Sergeant Rodriguez was registered to Olson. After Olson was removed from the vehicle, Detective Wells approached her and advised her of his investigation. Wells informed Olson that he knew a meth lab had been placed in the trunk of her vehicle. Olson initially denied Wells\u2019 allegations. However, after Wells spoke to her about the health risks of a meth lab, Olson admitted that the equipment was located in her vehicle. A warrant was subsequently issued, and the search of Olson\u2019s trunk revealed chemicals, glassware, funnels, tubing, methamphetamine, and other \u201cprecursors\u201d used to manufacture methamphetamine, including red pills labeled Sudafed.</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">\u00b69 On March 29, 2001, the Respondent, State of Montana, filed an information, which charged Olson with criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA (1999), and accountability for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-2-302(3), MCA (1999) and \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA (1999). Olson pled not guilty to both charges on April 12, 2001. On June 22, 2001, Olson filed a motion to suppress evidence, in which she claimed that: (1) the search warrant application did not adequately establish the reliability and credibility of the informant whose statements provided the basis for the warrant request; (2) the search warrant application was legally invalid because it included inaccurate and misleading information; (3) the search warrant application did not establish probable cause; (4) the initial traffic stop was not supported by a particularized suspicion; (5) her statements were obtained in violation of her constitutional rights; and (6) evidence seized as a result of the search of her vehicle must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b610 The District Court conducted hearings on Olson\u2019s motion to suppress on October 24, and October 29,2001. On November 13,2001, the State filed an amended information, which charged Olson with the additional offense of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-107(l)(n), MCA (1999). The District Court denied Olson\u2019s motion to suppress that same day. On November 15, 2001, Olson pled guilty to an amended charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA (1999). The terms of Olson\u2019s plea agreement preserved her right to appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>suppress. The remaining charges against Olson were dismissed. Olson was sentenced by the District Court on January 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b611 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 212, \u00b6 13, 983 P.2d 916, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOF\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it denied Olson\u2019s motion to suppress the statements she made to Detective Wells?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b613 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself. The United States Supreme Court addressed this privilege against self-incrimination in <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. The <em>Miranda </em>Court held that the prosecution may not use statements that stem from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant is warned, prior to questioning, that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612. These \u201cwarnings\u201d are often referred to as <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b614 In this case, Olson alleges that the statements she made to Detective Wells were obtained in violation of her Fifth Amendment and state constitutional rights because she did not receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings before she made the statements. A person is entitled to receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings only if he or she is subject to a custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 27, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 27. This Court has previously concluded that a custodial interrogation occurs when \u201cthere is a significant restriction of personal liberty similar to an arrest.\u201d <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">\u00b615  Olson was not under arrest at the time she conversed with Detective Wells. Wehave repeatedly held that law enforcement officers do not need to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to suspects during brief investigative encounters, even if such encounters are somewhat coercive. <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 35. However, we have also concluded that if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>person has no free right to leave, then the interrogation is custodial. <em>State v. Staat </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 1, 6, 822 P.2d 643, 646. To determine whether or not a custodial interrogation has occurred, this Court examines the following six factors: (1) place of the interrogation; (2) time of the interrogation; (3) persons present during the interrogation; (4) whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were gratuitously given; (5) the length and mood of the interrogation; and (6) whether or not the suspect was arrested following the interrogation. <em>Staat, </em>251 Mont. at 6, 822 P.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b616 In this case, Detective Wells conversed with Olson after she had been removed from her vehicle. Prior to their conversation, Curran and Becker had been removed from Olson\u2019s vehicle and placed in handcuffs. Wells testified that at the time he approached Olson, \u201cthere [were] officers everywhere,\u201d and that he did not \u201cbelieve [that Olson] was ever standing alone.\u201d Wells further testified that he denied Olson\u2019s request to see her son. Finally, Wells testified that although Olson was not restrained or placed under arrest until after she admitted the meth lab was in her vehicle, Olson was not free to leave during their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b617 The District Court found that at the time Olson conversed with Detective Wells her liberty was restricted in a manner similar to an arrest. Consequently, the District Court concluded that Olson\u2019s conversation with Detective Wells was custodial in nature. We agree. However, the District Court also determined that although Olson was in custody, she was not interrogated by Wells. With that finding, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b618  Interrogation has previously been defined by this Court as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>State v. Belgarde, </em>1998 MT 152, \u00b6 26, 289 Mont. 287, \u00b6 26, 962 P.2d 571, \u00b6 26. Here, the District Court concluded that because Detective Wells did not ask Olson any direct questions, Olson had not been interrogated by Wells. However, we have also noted that \u201cinterrogation\u201d in the context of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution, refers not only to express questioning, but also to \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 186, 860 P.2d 89, 92, see also <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297. We have further noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that to determine whether an incriminating response was reasonably likely to be elicited from the suspect, the primary focus of the analysis should be on the perceptions of the suspect, rather than on the intent of the police. <em>Flack, </em>260 Mont. at 186, 860 P.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b619 In this case, Detective Wells testified that when he initiated his conversation with Olson, his goal was to get her away from Curran and Becker. Wells further testified that he told Olson he knew she had a meth lab in her vehicle, and that he had watched the meth lab being loaded into her vehicle. Wells also testified that he spoke to Olson in some detail about the dangers of a meth lab. Finally, Wells testified that he told Olson that he was concerned for her safety, and for the safety of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b620  The statements made by Detective Wells were directed specifically at Olson. No other party was privy to their conversation, and Wells testified that Olson was not free to leave. We conclude that, under the circumstances, Wells should have known that his statements were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Olson. Therefore, we hold that Wells\u2019 statements to Olson constituted an interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution. Accordingly, because Olson did not receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings before she was interrogated by Wells, the statements she made to Wells were obtained in violation of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b621  The District Court erred when it denied Olson\u2019s motion to suppress the statements she made to Detective Wells. This Court has excised Olson\u2019s statements from the search warrant application, and we now review the search warrant application without that information to determine whether it established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b622 Was the search warrant application supported by probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">\u00b623 Detective Beecroffc obtained a warrant to search both Nora\u2019s garage and Olson\u2019s vehicle. Olson contends that the search warrant application was not supported by probable cause. Specifically, Olson asserts that Mike Smith was not a reliable and credible informant.</p>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">\u00b624 An application for a search warrant must state facts sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. <em>State v. Grams, </em>2002 MT 188, \u00b6 14, 311 Mont. 102, \u00b6 14, 53 P.3d 897, \u00b6 14. To determine if probable cause to issue a warrant exists, this Court applies the totality of the circumstances test set forth in <em>Illinois v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed. 2d 527. Pursuant to this test, \u201cthe judge evaluates the facts asserted within the four comers of the [search warrant] application and makes a practical, common-sense decision as to whether there is a fair probability that incriminating items will be found in the place to which entry is sought.\u201d <em>Grams, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b625 In this case, the search warrant application was based largely on the report of informant Mike Smith. This Court adopted a test for determining whether information provided by an informant is sufficient to establish probable cause in <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 27, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 27, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 27. The <em>Reesman </em>test is based on three considerations. First, this Court must ascertain whether or not the informant was anonymous. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 28. Here, Olson concedes that Mike was not an anonymous informant. Therefore, we proceed to the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b626 If an informant is not anonymous, we next determine whether the information provided by the informant was based on his or her own personal observation of the criminal activity. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 29. In this case, Olson concedes that the information provided by Mike was based on his personal observation of the garage on Nora Smith\u2019s property. Therefore, we proceed to the third consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b627 The final part of the <em>Reesman </em>test requires this Court to ascertain whether the informant is a reliable source of information. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 31. In order for an informant to be reliable, he or she must either: (1) be a confidential informant who has provided reliable and accurate information in the past; (2) make an admission against his or her own interest; or (3) be a concerned citizen, motivated by \u201cgood citizenship.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 \u00b6 32-34. In this case, the District Court found that Mike was motivated by \u201cgood citizenship,\u201d because he immediately reported what he had witnessed. That is, the District Court found that even if Mike\u2019s motives were mixed, it is undisputed that he went immediately to the police department after he observed Nora\u2019s garage. Consequently, the District Court concluded that Mike was a reliable informant. The District Court further noted that a citizen informant is presumed to be reliable, and such reliability \u201cis generally shown by the very nature of the circumstances under which the incriminating information became known.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258). Here, Mike informed Detective Beecroft that he entered Nora\u2019s garage to retrieve two camper jacks. Mike also advised Beecroft that, while in Nora\u2019s garage, he observed what he believed to be a meth lab. He reported what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>saw immediately. While there is evidence that Mike and Nora had a strained relationship, that fact, by itself, is not sufficient to overcome the presumption that he acted as a good citizen. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it concluded that Mike was a reliable informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b628 In addition to Mike\u2019s report, the search warrant application also contained the observations of Detectives Wells and Grubb, who conducted surveillance of Nora\u2019s property. The application stated that: \u201cWithin an hour after Detective Wells arrived with Detective Mike Grubb, a man and a woman began transporting numerous garbage bags full of items to a white 1989 Ford Taurus. These two individuals then left the scene in the Ford Taurus.\u201d Although this behavior is not, by itself, illegal, when combined with other information in the search warrant application, it becomes significant. That is, only hours after Mike reported that: (1) he had observed a meth lab in Nora\u2019s garage; and (2) Curran was aware that he had made this observation; individuals began to move items from Nora\u2019s garage into a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"APrp\">\u00b629  We conclude that the above combination of facts provided the Detectives with sufficient probable cause to believe that a meth lab was relocated from Nora\u2019s garage to Olson\u2019s vehicle. We further conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, the search warrant application contained sufficient probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b630 Did a particularized suspicion exist to justify the investigative traffic stop of Olson\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b631 Olson maintains that the investigative traffic stop of her vehicle was not supported by a particularized suspicion on the part of law enforcement. Section 46-5-401, MCA (1999), addresses investigative stops. Section 46-5-401, MCA (1999), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b632 This Court applies a two-part test to determine whether a law enforcement officer had the requisite particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop. <em>Grindeland, v. State, </em>2001 MT 196, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 262, \u00b6 10, 32 P.3d 767, \u00b6 10. First, the State is required to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>objective data from which an experienced officer could make certain inferences. Second, the State must show a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle in question is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Grindeland, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b633 Olson cites <em>State v. Broken Rope </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 427, 925 P.2d 1157, in support of her contention that the officers lacked a particularized suspicion to perform an investigative stop of her vehicle. The defendant in <em>Broken Rope </em>visited a convenience store with a companion. An officer in the area ran a registration check on their vehicle and learned that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of the defendant\u2019s companion. The officer then waited for the two men to exit the convenience store. <em>Broken Rope, </em>278 Mont. at 428-29, 925 P.2d at 1157-58. However, when the men exited the store they noticed the officer, and began to stare at him. The men also moved around the store\u2019s parking lot, put their hands in their pockets, and used the telephone. The officer determined that the men did not intend to get into their vehicle while he was in the area, so he requested assistance. The two officers then initiated an investigative stop of the two men. <em>Broken Rope, 278 </em>Mont. at 429, 925 P.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b634 The District Court in <em>Broken Rope </em>found that the officers possessed a particularized suspicion to justify their investigative stop of the defendant. This Court, however, reversed the District Court, noting that \u201cthere is nothing inherently suspicious about [the defendant] using a pay telephone, moving around in a convenience store parking lot, putting his hands in his pockets or staring at a sheriffs deputy.\u201d <em>Broken Rope, 278 </em>Mont. at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160. We further noted that \u201cmany law-abiding citizens may well be nervous when their activities are being watched by law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Broken Rope, 278 </em>Mont. at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160. Therefore, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions did not create a particularized suspicion that the defendant was, or had been, engaged in criminal activity. <em>Broken Rope, 278 </em>Mont. at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b635 Olson alleges that the facts of this case are similar to those in <em>Broken Rope </em>because, like the officer in <em>Broken Rope, </em>Detectives Wells and Grubb did not observe individuals engaged in criminal activity. <em>Broken Rope, </em>however, is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Broken Rope, </em>the officer\u2019s observation of the defendant in the parking lot was the <em>sole basis </em>for the investigative stop. In this case, Wells and Grubb did not merely observe individuals place items from Nora\u2019s garage into the trunk of a vehicle and drive away. Wells and Grubb were aware of the information contained in Mike\u2019s report at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>they performed the investigative stop of Olson\u2019s vehicle. The existence of particularized suspicion is a question of fact determined by examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigative stop. <em>Grindeland, </em>\u00b6 10. Therefore, while the behavior observed by Wells and Grubb did not, by itself, raise a particularized suspicion of criminal activity, that behavior may have given rise to a particularized suspicion when combined with Mike\u2019s report that he observed a meth lab in Nora\u2019s garage that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b636  This Court has repeatedly held that particularized suspicion is a less stringent standard than probable cause. See <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 14, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 14, 32 P.3d 735, <em>\u00b6 </em>14, and <em>State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 12, 290 Mont. 321, \u00b6 12, 965 P.2d 231, \u00b6 12. Accordingly, we conclude that because probable cause existed to search Olson\u2019s vehicle, it is axiomatic that a particularized suspicion existed to stop that same vehicle. Therefore, we hold that a particularized suspicion existed to justify the investigative traffic stop of Olson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b637 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse that part of the District Court\u2019s order which held that Olson had not been interrogated in violation of her Fifth Amendment rights. However, after deleting her admission from the search warrant application, we conclude that probable cause existed to issue the search warrant for Olson\u2019s vehicle. Therefore, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b432-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AHE\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b638 I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues 2 and 3, and with the holding in this matter. However, I find that the District Court correctly concluded that Olson, though in custody, was not questioned by Officer Wells, and was not subjected to interrogation. Therefore, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Olson\u2019s motion to suppress her statement, and dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion in Issue 1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
