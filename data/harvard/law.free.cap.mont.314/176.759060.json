We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u00b63 (1) Whether the District Court erred by denying Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing concerning Kvislen\u2019s claim that one of his prior convictions was obtained unconstitutionally; and</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">\u00b64 (2) Whether this case should be remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing regarding Kvislen\u2019s claim or, conversely, whether Kvislen\u2019s felony conviction should be reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ANK\">\u00b65 On February 6, 2001, Kvislen was charged with Felony Driving While Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and 61-8-722(4), MCA, the information charged the offense as a felony because Kvislen had been convicted of DUI on three other occasions in 1990,1998, and 2000. Prior to trial in Yellowstone County, Kvislen filed a motion to dismiss the information on grounds that the 1990 DUI conviction in the Billings City Court was entered in derogation of his constitutional rights and could not be used to elevate the 2001 charge to a felony. Kvislen submitted an affidavit in which he averred that he never received notice of his 1990 trial, and that he was not informed of his right to court-appointed counsel during those proceedings. The affidavit provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">I, Michael Kvislen, being first duly sworn, upon oath, depose and say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">3. In 1989, I was charged in Billings City Court with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol... and was convicted after a trial in absentia. I did not receive notice of that trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-16\">4. ... I could not afford an attorney and I was not advised of my right to a court-appointed attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>5.1 did not waive my right to a court-appointed attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">6.1 was convicted without the assistance of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">7.1 was incarcerated as a result of the conviction that I received without an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b66 The State opposed Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss, and argued that Kvislen\u2019s affidavit lacked sufficient detail to rebut the presumption of regularity associated with the 1990 conviction. As an indication that Kvislen was advised of his rights, the State provided the District Court with the City Court docket sheet, which contained a check mark next to the phrase \u201cAdvise of Rights.\u201d The State also noted, in its Brief in Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, that former Billings City Court Judge, Gayle Stewart, who presided over the 1990 proceedings against Kvislen, would testify that she routinely advised all defendants of their constitutional rights. In response to Kvislen\u2019s second claim that he was never notified of the 1990 trial, the State observed that during the arraignment in that case, Kvislen received a notice that the trial was set for April 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b67 Without conducting an evidentiary hearing to weigh Kvislen\u2019s affidavit against the assertions made by the State, the District Court denied the motion to dismiss, and concluded that Kvislen had not sufficiently rebutted the presumption of regularity that attaches to prior convictions. The court cited, as evidence of the validity of the 1990 conviction, the Billings City Court docket sheet, as well as the State\u2019s claim that Kvislen had received notice of the 1990 trial during the arraignment in that case. The court sentenced Kvislen to thirteen months imprisonment followed by four years of probation and stayed the execution of Kvislen\u2019s sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u00b68 We first consider whether the District Court erred by denying Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his 1990 DUI conviction was obtained unconstitutionally. Kvislen argues that he presented to the District Court direct evidence that the 1990 conviction was unconstitutional, and that because the State failed to meet its burden of countering the evidence, the District Court erroneously determined that the conviction was obtained constitutionally. Kvislen maintains that the District Court should have held an evidentiary hearing to weigh Kvislen\u2019s testimony against any evidence the State might have provided showing that the 1990 conviction was constitutionally sound. Kvislen also asserts that because the 1990 conviction was invalid, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>State lacked the requisite three prior DUI convictions to elevate the 2001 DUI offense to felony status. He concludes, therefore, that the 2001 conviction should be reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b69 When we review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, the standard of review is plenary, and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>State v. Rushton </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 248, 254-55, 870 P.2d 1355, 1359; <em>State v. Sage </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 227, 229, 841 P.2d 1142, 1143. When we review a trial court\u2019s findings of fact, the standard of review is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b610 We observe, as we did in <em>State v. Jenni </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 21, 938 P.2d 1318, that (1) a rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to prior convictions; (2) the presumption may be overcome by direct evidence of irregularity; and (3) once direct evidence of irregularity is offered by the defendant, the burden shifts to the State to prove, by direct evidence, that the prior conviction was not obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Jenni, </em>283 Mont. at 25, 938 P.2d at 1320 (citing <em>State v. Okland </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 18, 941 P.2d 431, 436).</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">\u00b611 Pursuant to this procedural framework, we note that Kvislen presented direct evidence in support of his claim that his constitutional rights were violated in a prior proceeding. Kvislen submitted an affidavit which stated that he did not receive notice of his trial and that he was not advised of his right to a court-appointed attorney in the event that he could not afford one. The affidavit is direct evidence of a constitutional infringement in the 1990 proceedings, and is sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity and to shift the burden of proof to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b612 We further note that the State failed to meet this burden. The State countered Kvislen\u2019s motion, and his affidavit, by advising the District Court that the docket sheet contained a check mark next to the phrase \u201cAdvise of Rights,\u201d indicating that Kvislen was, at least, advised of his rights. As we stated in <em>Jenni, </em>a record indicating \u201cin <em>general </em>terms that [a defendant] was informed of the charges filed against him and of his rights, do[es] not delineate the specific rights of which the defendant was advised.\u201d 283 Mont. at 25, 938 P.2d at 1321. Applying this standard, we have held that \u201cin determining whether the State has met its burden of proving the constitutional validity of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, the defendant\u2019s signature on the advisement of rights form and the existence of an acknowledgment of waiver of rights form signed by the defendant are but factors to be considered in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>MT 143, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 5, \u00b6 20, 982 P.2d 1030, \u00b6 20. The docket sheet, here, does not establish that the District Court advised Kvislen of his right to an attorney, or that he waived that right. The State concedes these points in its brief, commenting that Kvislen\u2019s averments met the technical definition of direct evidence and shifted the burden of proof to the State, a burden which the State failed to meet. The State further contends that because it relied on insufficient evidence, the appropriate avenue for assessing Kvislen\u2019s claims was to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b613  In light of the State\u2019s concessions, and based on the record, we conclude that: (1) Kvislen presented direct evidence that he was convicted without the assistance of counsel; (2) the burden shifted to the State to present direct evidence that Kvislen\u2019s prior convictions were not entered in violation of his right to counsel; and (3) the State failed to meet its burden. The evidence before the District Court included Kvislen\u2019s affidavit and the docket sheet notation indicating that Kvislen was advised of his rights. Since the notation did not establish that Kvislen was specifically advised of his right to counsel, it cannot be said that the District Court was presented with any evidence that would warrant a denial of Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss. In light of the State\u2019s reliance on insufficient evidence to meet its burden of proving that the 1990 DUI conviction was not obtained in violation of Kvislen\u2019s rights, we conclude that the District Court erred when it denied Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b614 We next consider whether the case should be remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing regarding Kvislen\u2019s claims or, conversely, whether Kvislen\u2019s felony conviction should be reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b615 The State argues that the District Court erred by denying Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing, and that the case should, therefore, be remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing at which the State intends to offer testimony from Judge Gayle Stewart that she advised Kvislen of his right to counsel during the 1990 proceedings. In support of this argument, the State contends that it is entitled to an opportunity to refute Kvislen\u2019s allegation that he was never advised of his right to court-appointed counsel during the 1990 proceedings. According to the State, Kvislen alleged a constitutional infirmity but never actually proved that his 1990 conviction was invalid. The State concludes that only a hearing will enable the District Court to weigh Kvislen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>affidavit against the testimony of Judge Stewart, and that Kvislen will not be prejudiced by a remand because the District Court stayed the execution of his sentence pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b616 We have, on at least one occasion, remanded a case for further consideration of evidence presented by the State in response to a defendant\u2019s collateral attack against a prior conviction. In <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 19, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 19, we held that the State had presented inconsistent evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel. The State, in <em>Peterson, </em>attempted to defeat the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with testimony from the judge who had presided over the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. On appeal, we determined that this judge\u2019s testimony regarding his routine practice of informing defendants of their right to counsel was inconsistent. Because the trial court failed to address the inconsistency in its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, we remanded the case for a determination of whether the defendant had actually waived his right. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b617 In the present case, the District Court\u2019s premature denial of Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss effectively denied the State an opportunity to prove by direct evidence that Kvislen\u2019s 1990 conviction was not obtained in violation of his rights. The State asserts now, as it did then, that if the presumption of regularity is set aside, it is prepared to refute Kvislen\u2019s affidavit through additional evidence, namely the testimony of Judge Stewart. The State indicated to the District Court that it could produce direct evidence of the constitutional validity of Kivslen\u2019s 1990 conviction if such evidence was requested. This was an implied request for an evidentiary hearing, made conditional upon the District Court\u2019s determination that the burden had shifted to the State to defend the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b618 The dissent contends, that in remanding for an evidentiary hearing, we have rewritten our prior decisions in <em>State v. Okland </em>and <em>State v. Jenni. </em>Our decisions <em>in Jenni </em>and <em>Okland </em>are distinguishable from the present case in that the District Court in those cases correctly determined that the defendant had rebutted the presumption of regularity and that the burden then shifted to the State to prove that the convictions were not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 20, 941 P.2d at 437; <em>Jenni, </em>283 Mont. at 26, 938 P.2d at 1321. In both cases, the court determined that the State failed to meet that burden and thus granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The State then appealed the orders of dismissal. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 12, 941 P.2d at 432; <em>Jenni, </em>283 Mont. 22, 938 P.2d at 1319. Here, in contrast, the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>appealing from a denial of his motion to dismiss and a subsequent conviction. Neither <em>Jenni </em>nor <em>Okland </em>involved a situation where, as here, due to the District Court\u2019s erroneous holding that the burden had not shifted to the State, there was no evidentiary hearing at which the State could present its direct testimony on the question of fact; that is, whether Kvislen waived his right to counsel. In neither <em>Jenni </em>nor <em>Okland </em>was there an argument by the State that it was precluded from presenting its evidence due to lack of an evidentiary hearing. There is nothing in the Rules of Criminal Procedure that requires the State, when opposing a motion to dismiss, to forego an evidentiary hearing and rely solely on affidavits or court records.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b619  In summary we hold that because Kvislen presented direct evidence rebutting the presumption of regularity, the District Court, instead of denying his motion to dismiss, should have shifted the burden to the State to prove that the conviction was not obtained in violation of Kvislen\u2019s constitutional rights. The State is entitled to present the testimony of Judge Steward in its attempt to establish that Kvislen\u2019s 1990 conviction was valid. Accordingly, we remand for a hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b202-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AIG\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b620 I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusions that the Defendant, Michael Kvislen, presented direct evidence that his 1990 conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was constitutionally infirm, that by doing so the burden shifted to the State of Montana to produce direct evidence that Kvislen\u2019s 1990 conviction was not entered in violation of his right to counsel and that because it did not do so, the District Court erred when it denied Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that because the State failed to meet its burden the first time around, this case should be remanded to the District Court so that the State can be given a second opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u00b621 The majority Opinion ignores prior case law, it excuses the fact that no hearing was ever requested by the State in the District Court and gives rise to endless opportunities for parties to prove their cases once it has been determined as a matter of law that they have not initially done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00b622 The majority cites <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 19, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 19, as precedent for further consideration of evidence presented by the State in response to a collateral attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>against a prior conviction. However, the distinction is that in <em>Peterson, </em>we remanded for further consideration of contradictory evidence that had been presented but not resolved by the finder of fact. In this case, the majority has chosen to remand for evidence that has never been presented even though the State had a prior opportunity to do so. That\u2019s a big difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b623 Buying into the State\u2019s meritless argument and Justice Rice\u2019s proposed dissent to the majority\u2019s originally proposed opinion, the current majority Opinion states in \u00b6 17 that the District Court \u201ceffectively denied the State an opportunity to prove by direct evidence that Kvislen\u2019s 1990 conviction was not obtained in violation of his rights.\u201d Nothing could be more incorrect. However, based on that erroneous premise, the majority concludes that because the District Court erred, the burden never shifted to the State to produce any evidence. In doing so, the majority has completely rewritten prior decisions in <em>State v. Okland </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 941 P.2d 431, and <em>State v. Jenni </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 21, 938 P.2d 1318. Based on those decisions and the nearly identical facts in this case, the State\u2019s burden in response to Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss and supporting affidavit was abundantly clear. As a result of this decision, the procedure for resolving motions of this type is now completely obscured.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Okland, </em>we held that an affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss felony DUI charges which established that at the time of a prior conviction, the defendant 1) could not afford to hire an attorney; 2) was not provided a court-appointed attorney; 3) was convicted without the assistance of counsel; and 4) was actually imprisoned for his uncounseled conviction, was direct evidence of the constitutional infirmity of the prior conviction. <em>See Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 19, 941 P.2d at 437. That\u2019s the same evidence produced by Kvislen in support of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b625 Next, in <em>Okland, </em>we held that once a defendant has made such a showing, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the State to produce direct evidence and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. Here, even though the burden clearly shifted to the State to prove that Kvislen\u2019s previous rights had not been violated, it offered no evidence. The county attorney simply submitted a brief which included his own inadmissible representations, in which he argued that Kvislen had not successfully rebutted the presumption of regularity, even though he clearly had, and stated that if the District Court felt otherwise, the State was \u201cable to produce direct evidence that the prior conviction was not entered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>violation of defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d In addition, the State offered a city court record indicating, without explanation, that \u201cadvise of rights\u201d had been checked. At the time the document was submitted, however, we had clearly said four years earlier in <em>Jenni </em>that these types of records \"... do <em>not </em>affirmatively establish that Jenni was advised of his constitutional right to an attorney or that he knowingly and intelligently waived that right.\u201d <em>Jenni, </em>283 Mont. at 25-26, 938 P.2d at 1321. We held that evidence of general advice of rights was insufficient to refute direct evidence that a defendant had not previously been advised of his right to counsel. There was no excuse for the county attorney to think that the same type of evidence was adequate in this case to rebut Kvislen\u2019s direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b626 In the State\u2019s response to Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss, the county attorney alleged that \"... the state can produce direct evidence demonstrating that defendant\u2019s 1990 conviction is not infirm.\u201d However, it did not do so. It was not prevented from doing so. And, it did not request an opportunity to do so by way of an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State clearly did not satisfy the burden clearly established by our decisions in <em>Okland </em>and <em>Jenni </em>and the District Court should have, as the district courts did in those two cases, granted Kvislen\u2019s motion to dismiss. This Court has erred by not simply reversing the District Court\u2019s mistake and ordering that Kvislen\u2019s motion be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b627 In its conclusion, the majority states that once Kvislen rebutted the presumption of regularity, \u201c[t]he District Court ... should have shifted the burden to the State.\u201d Here the majority demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of procedural law. Courts do not create or \u201cshift\u201d the burden of proof-the law does! The law did so in this case just as plainly as it did in <em>Jenni </em>and <em>Okland, </em>notwithstanding the majority\u2019s tap dance around those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b628 The majority\u2019s decision does create a lot of new opportunities for unsuccessful litigants. For example, in response to motions for judgment as a matter of law following submission of the State\u2019s evidence, the State should now have an opportunity to reopen its case in the event the Court concludes that its case has not been proven. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the civil context, if a party moves for summary judgment and supports its motion by affidavit or direct evidence that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the opposing party produces no contradictory evidence but its attorney simply makes conclusory arguments to the contrary, we should no longer decide the issue on appeal based on the record presented. Those cases should in the future all be remanded to the district court to give the unsuccessful litigant another opportunity to produce contradictory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b629 Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the District Court\u2019s premature denial of Kvislen\u2019s motion did not deny the State an opportunity to prove by direct evidence that Kvislen\u2019s 1990 conviction was not obtained in violation of his rights. The State simply chose not to offer the evidence it was required to offer pursuant to our prior decisions and the District Court mistakenly excused its omission. Allowing the State repeated opportunities to satisfy its burden is sloppy practice and bad policy. The District Court should simply be reversed. I dissent from the majority\u2019s refusal to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> In another example of this Court\u2019s recent result-oriented approach to criminal law, the majority concludes that by indicating that it \u201ccould produce direct evidence,\u201d there \u201c[w]as an implied request for an evidentiary hearing made conditional upon the District Court\u2019s determination that the burden had shifted to the State to defend the prior conviction.\u201d This \u201cimplied request\u201d is, of course, created out of whole cloth to achieve the desired result, as is defense counsel\u2019s new and greater responsibilities which were created in <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>2003 MT 26, 314 Mont. 155, 64 P.3d 1013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
