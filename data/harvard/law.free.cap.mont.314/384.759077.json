Harney, Dr. Minott E. Pruyn, and Pruyn Veterinary Hospital in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. Hawkins\u2019 complaint alleged that the Respondents breached their implied contracts as veterinarians by failing to provide competent veterinary services. Hawkins\u2019 complaint further alleged that the Respondents had been negligent in treating her dog Laddie. Finally, the complaint alleged that the Respondents\u2019 treatment of Laddie caused Hawkins to suffer emotional distress. The District Court determined that Hawkins failed to comply with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., and dismissed the case. Hawkins appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Hawkins failed to comply with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b64 2. Were the sanctions imposed by the District Court proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hawkins\u2019 motion to compel discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hawkins\u2019 motion for leave to file a second amended complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it failed to reverse its judgment for costs against Hawkins?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b68 Kristine Hawkins owned a Shetland sheepdog named Laddie. On June 10, 1993, Laddie was struck by a motor vehicle. Hawkins promptly transported Laddie to Pruyn Veterinary Hospital in Missoula, Montana, for treatment. During his stay at Pruyn Veterinary Hospital, Laddie was treated by Dr. Randolph T. Harney and Dr. Minott E. Pruyn. However, after Dr. Pruyn discovered that Laddie had a broken vertebra, he recommended that Hawkins transport Laddie to Washington State University\u2019s School of Veterinary Medicine in Pullman, Washington, for surgery. Hawkins followed Dr. Pruyn\u2019s advice, and veterinarians at Washington State University performed surgery on Laddie\u2019s spine on June 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b69 The injuries to Laddie\u2019s spine left him partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life. On June 10, 1996, Hawkins filed a complaint against Dr. Harney, Dr. Pruyn, and Pruyn Veterinary Hospital (the Respondents). Hawkins also filed her complaint against Washington State University and two of its veterinarians, however the District Court later dismissed these additional defendants from the case. Hawkins\u2019 complaint alleged that the Respondents breached their implied contracts as veterinarians by failing to provide competent veterinary services. The complaint further alleged that the Respondents were negligent in treating Laddie. Finally, the complaint alleged that the Respondents\u2019 treatment of Laddie caused Hawkins to suffer emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b610 On November 20, 1998, Hawkins filed an amended complaint, requesting exemplary and punitive damages. On May 16, 2001, Hawkins filed a motion to compel discovery, in which she asserted that the Respondents neglected to properly respond to her discovery requests. On July 3,2001, the Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that Hawkins had failed to obtain an expert witness to support her claims. The District Court conducted a hearing on the Respondents\u2019 summary judgment motion on September 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>2001. On September 27, 2001, the District Court: (1) denied Hawkins\u2019 motion to compel discovery because it found that the additional discovery materials requested by Hawkins were either irrelevant or confidential; and (2) denied the Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment because it found the motion premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b611 On December 7, 2001, Hawkins filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Hawkins\u2019 second amended complaint sought to add an additional claim for fraud. The District Court denied Hawkins\u2019 motion on January 15,2002, because it determined that the statute of limitations on her fraud claim had expired. On January 15, 2002, the Respondents filed a motion, requesting that the District Court: (1) compel Hawkins to answer their interrogatoiy regarding her expert witness; and (2) impose sanctions on Hawkins for failing to answer their interrogatory. On March 12, 2002, the District Court issued an order, concluding that Hawkins failed to comply with Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P., when she neglected to answer the Respondents\u2019 interrogatory. The District Court then sanctioned Hawkins by barring the testimony of her expert witness and dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b612 On May 20, 2002, Hawkins filed a motion to alter or amend the District Court\u2019s order. On July 18, 2002, the District Court issued a second order, stating that it had incorrectly applied Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P., to the instant case. That is, the District Court found that because Hawkins had in fact answered the Respondents\u2019 interrogatory, Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P, was inapplicable. However, the District Court also noted that Hawkins\u2019 interrogatory answer was deficient. Therefore, the District Court concluded that dismissal of the case was merited, as Hawkins\u2019 deficient answer failed to comply with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P. Accordingly, the District Court denied Hawkins\u2019 motion to alter or amend its March 12, 2002, order. Hawkins appealed the District Court\u2019s orders on July 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b613 On December 5,2002, the Respondents filed a motion to strike the reply brief which Hawkins submitted in support of her appeal before this Court. The Respondents\u2019 motion asserted that Hawkins\u2019 reply brief contained factual material that was not a part of the record in this case. As such, the Respondents requested that Hawkins\u2019 reply brief be stricken from the record in its entirety. In response, Hawkins filed a cross-motion on December 16, 2002. Hawkins\u2019 cross-motion requested that this Court strike several misstatements of fact which appeared in the Respondents\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b614 It is well stated that \u201cparties on appeal are bound by the record and may not add additional matters in briefs or appendices.\u201d <em>Janow v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Conoco Pipe Line </em>Co., 2000 MT 242, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 402, \u00b6 14, 10 P.3d 79, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). We note that although Hawkins\u2019 reply brief contains factual material that is not a part of the record in this case, the brief also contains factual material that is a part of the record. Additionally, Hawkins\u2019 reply brief contains a legal argument. Therefore, this Court declines to strike Hawkins\u2019 reply brief in its entirety. As such, we strike only that portion of Hawkins\u2019 reply brief which contains factual material that is not a part of the record in this case. <em>See Janow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. With regard to Hawkins\u2019 cross-motion, we decline to strike the alleged factual misstatements that appear in the Respondents\u2019 brief. That is, these alleged misstatements are segments of the Respondents\u2019 legal argument, not new facts which do not appear in the record. Accordingly, Hawkins\u2019 cross-motion to strike a portion of the Respondents\u2019 brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b615 This Opinion addresses multiple issues, and as such, the appropriate standard of review for each issue will be set forth immediately preceding discussion of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEa\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it found that Hawkins failed to comply with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u00b617 Our standard of review concerning a district court\u2019s ruling on a discovery matter is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>McKamey v. State </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 137, 145, 885 P.2d 515, 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b618 Hawkins contends that the District Court erred when it found that her supplemental answer to the Respondents\u2019 interrogatory was deficient, and therefore, failed to comply with Rule 26(e), M.R.Civ.P., or Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. The interrogatory at issue in this case is interrogatory number fourteen, which the Respondents initially submitted to Hawkins on August 2, 1999. Interrogatory number fourteen provided, ,in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">Please state the name, telephone number and present address of each person you expect to call as an expert on your behalf at trial in this action. With respect to each expert, please set forth the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">(a) The qualifications of each such expert witness, showing his age, formal education, a chronological history of the occupations or jobs he has held, publications he has authored, and if he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>previously been a witness, the date, name of the jurisdiction and name of the action in which he was last a witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">(b) State in detail, the subject matter on which each such expert is expected to testify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">(c) State in detail, the substance of the facts and opinions to which each such expert is expected to testify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">(d) State in detail a summary of the grounds for each opinion by each expert[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b619 Hawkins answered interrogatory number fourteen with the following phrase: \u201cNot determined at this point.\u201d The Respondents were not satisfied with Hawkins\u2019 answer, and requested that she provide a supplemental answer to interrogatory number fourteen. Hawkins failed to provide a supplemental answer. The District Court then issued a joint scheduling order on November 5, 2001, which required that Hawkins furnish information regarding her expert witnesses to the Respondents no later than December 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b620 On December 28, 2001, Hawkins provided the name and address of a veterinarian in Oklahoma that she intended to use as an expert witness. The Respondents, dissatisfied with the brevity of this information, filed a motion to compel discovery on January 15, 2002. The Respondents also requested that the District Court sanction Hawkins for her failure to comply with their discovery request. On January 23, 2002, Hawkins submitted a supplemental answer to interrogatory number fourteen, which consisted of approximately one page of text. The District Court determined that Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer was deficient, and failed to comply with Rule 26(e), M.R.Civ.P., or Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. The District Court then sanctioned Hawkins by barring the testimony of her expert witness and dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b621 Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P., addresses expert witnesses. Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The underlying policies of Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., are to eliminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses. <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 329, 333, 916 P.2d 91, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u00b622 We examined Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P., in <em>Scott v. E. I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 282, 783 P.2d 938. In <em>Scott, </em>the plaintiff asserted that the defendant failed to adequately answer discovery requests regarding its expert witness. <em>Scott, </em>240 Mont. at 286, 783 P.2d at 941. The answers provided by the defendant were very brief. This Court analyzed the defendant\u2019s answers and noted that \u201c[w]hile the answers were not as complete as they should have been, [the expert] was not a surprise witness.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>240 Mont. at 286, 783 P.2d at 941. We further noted that while \u201cwe do not condone defendant\u2019s failure to provide full and complete answers to interrogatories,\u201d refusing to allow the expert to testify \u201cwould have been an extreme sanction, given that the defendant\u2019s offense was incompleteness in its answers to interrogatories, not failure to answer.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>240 Mont. at 287, 783 P.2d at 941. Therefore, we held that the District Court did not err in permitting the expert witness to testify at trial. <em>Scott, </em>240 Mont. at 287, 783 P.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b623 This Court examined a situation similar to the one in <em>Scott </em>in <em>Montana Power Co. v. Wax </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 108, 796 P.2d 565. In <em>Wax, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to properly answer its interrogatories. Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant failed to provide the basis for the opinions of two of its expert witnesses. <em>Wax, </em>244 Mont. at 110, 796 P.2d at 566. This Court analyzed the defendant\u2019s answers and determined that while the defendant provided information about the identities of his expert witnesses, the \u201cbasis for [their] opinions was not set forth in the answers supplied by [the defendant].\u201d <em>Wax, </em>244 Mont. at 112, 796 P.2d at 567. We further determined that the defendant\u2019s failure to properly answers the plaintiffs interrogatories \u201cseverely limited [the plaintiffs] ability to cross-examine [the defendant\u2019s] witnesses.\u201d <em>Wax, </em>244 Mont. at 112, 796 P.2d at 567. As such, we concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses. <em>Wax, </em>244 Mont. at 112, 796 P.2d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">\u00b624 While the facts from <em>Scott </em>and <em>Wax </em>were similar, this Court reached opposite results when the answers to the interrogatories were examined in light of their compliance with the underlying policies of Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P. Accordingly, we take our cue from <em>Scott </em>and <em>Wax, </em>and analyze Hawkins\u2019 answers to the Respondents\u2019 interrogatories in light of the underlying policies of Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b625 In the instant case, Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer to the Respondents\u2019 discovery request listed one expert, Dr. John Collins. Hawkins\u2019 answer identified Dr. Collins by listing his address, age, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>schooling, and past employment. Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer further stated that the subject matter of Dr. Collins\u2019 testimony would be the manner in which the veterinary medical case was handled. Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer also included approximately twenty lines of text that identified the substance of the facts and opinions to which Dr. Collins was expected to testify. Finally, Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer addressed the grounds for Dr. Collins\u2019 opinions with the following phrase: \u201cstandard veterinary teaching and practice.\u201d \u00b626 As we noted above, the underlying policies of Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., are to eliminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 333, 916 P.2d at 93. While this Court does not condone the brevity of Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer, we conclude that her answer provided the Respondents with a sufficient indication of the substance of Dr. Collins\u2019 testimony so as to eliminate the possibility of surprise and promote effective cross-examination. That is, Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer eliminated the possibility that Dr. Collins would be a surprise witness, and it provided sufficient information regarding Dr. Collins to allow the Respondents to prepare for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b627  We further note that while we do not condone Hawkins\u2019 tardiness in answering the Respondents\u2019 interrogatories, such tardiness did not prejudice the Respondents. At the time the Respondents received Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer, this case had yet to be scheduled for trial. Consequently, the Respondents would have had adequate time to prepare their cross-examination of Dr. Collins. <em>See Scott, </em>240 Mont. at 287, 783 P.2d at 941 (stating that the elapse of time lessens the importance of inadequate answers to discovery requests). Additionally, the Respondents could have elected to depose Dr. Collins at some point prior to trial in order to elicit further information regarding his anticipated testimony. Therefore, we hold that Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer to the Respondents\u2019 interrogatory was sufficient to meet the policies underlying Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., and, as such, we further hold that the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that Hawkins did not provide an adequate response.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b628 Were the sanctions imposed by the District Court proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b629 This Court generally defers to the decision of a trial court regarding sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures because the trial court is in the best position to assess whether parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>are disregarding the rights of opposing parties in the course of litigation and to determine which sanctions for such conduct are most appropriate. <em>Patterson v. State Dept. of Justice, </em>2002 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 381, \u00b6 8, 46 P.3d 642, \u00b6 8. As a result, we review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Patterson, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b630  As we noted above, the District Court sanctioned Hawkins for her failure to comply with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., by barring the testimony of her expert witness, and dismissing the case. However, in light of our above conclusion that Hawkins\u2019 supplemental answer was adequate, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it sanctioned Hawkins and dismissed her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b631 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hawkins\u2019 motion to compel discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b632 As we noted above, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on a discovery matter to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>McKamey, </em>268 Mont. at 145, 885 P.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b633 Hawkins filed a motion to compel discovery on May 16, 2001, in which she asserted that the Respondents failed to properly respond to several of her interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The District Court determined that the additional information requested by Hawkins was either irrelevant or confidential, and denied Hawkins\u2019 motion on September 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b634 On appeal, Hawkins alleges that the Respondents were required to answer her additional discovery requests. However, Hawkins fails to support her allegations with <em>relevant </em>authority. That is, while Hawkins devotes over seven pages to this issue in her opening brief, she fails to cite any authority that is factually relevant to the instant case. This portion of Hawkins\u2019 opening brief is also devoid of citations to the record. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that an appellant provide an argument which contains \u201cthe contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d We have repeatedly held that we \u201cwill not consider unsupported issues or arguments.\u201d <em>In re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6 32, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6 32. Moreover, it is \u201cnot this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>In re B. P., </em>2001 MT 219, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>430, \u00b6 41, 35 P.3d 291, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b635 A district court\u2019s decision is presumed to be correct. <em>Matter of M.

Hawkins has not met her burden with regard to this issue, and, accordingly, we decline to address the District Court\u2019s denial of Hawkins\u2019 motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b636 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Hawkins\u2019 motion for leave to file a second amended complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b637 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional Consultants </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b638 Hawkins contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint which Hawkins sought to file contained an additional claim for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b639 Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., addresses amendments to pleadings. Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in pertinent part, that: <em>\u201cA </em>party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course ... Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d However, while Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., dictates that leave to amend shall be freely granted, this Court has previously held that leave to amend is properly denied when the amendment is futile or legally insufficient to support the requested relief. <em>Hobble-Diamond Cattle v. Triangle Irr. </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 322, 325, 815 P.2d 1153, 1155. We further held that although the merits of a proposed amended claim are generally not to be considered by the court, the merits of a claim <em>are </em>to be considered if the claim is frivolous, meritless, or futile. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>249 Mont. at 326, 815 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b640 In the instant case, the District Court considered the merits of Hawkins\u2019 second amended complaint and found that the statute of limitations on Hawkins\u2019 fraud claim had expired. Therefore, the District Court concluded that Hawkins\u2019 second amended complaint was futile. As a preliminary matter, we note that although Hawkins sought to file her second amended complaint on December 7, 2001, it is the date that Hawkins filed her original complaint which is germane to our analysis of this issue. That is, Rule 15(c), M.R.Civ.P., provides that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d Accordingly, we will analyze Hawkins\u2019 fraud claim with regard to the date she filed her original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b641 Section 27-2-203, MCA (1991), addresses actions for relief on grounds of fraud. Section 27-2-203, MCA (1991), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">The period prescribed for the commencement of an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake is within 2 years, the cause of action in such case not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b642 Additionally, \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA (1991), provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">(3) The period of limitation does not begin on any claim or cause of action for an injury to person or property until the facts constituting the claim have been discovered or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have been discovered by the injured party if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">(a) the facts constituting the claim are by their nature concealed or self-concealing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">(b) before, during, or after the act causing the injury, the defendant has taken action which prevents the injured party from discovering the injury or its cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b643  This Court has interpreted the above two statutes to conclude that: \u201cThe statute of limitations for an action based on fraud begins when the fraud occurs unless the facts which form the basis for the allegation are, by their nature, concealed.\u201d <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assur. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 1, 14, 914 P.2d 976, 985. Here, Hawkins alleges that the Respondents were fraudulent in their treatment of Laddie in June of 1993. Hawkins presents no evidence to indicate that the facts which formed the basis for her fraud claim were concealed. As such, the two-year statute of limitations on Hawkins\u2019 fraud claim began to run in June of 1993. Hawkins filed her original complaint against the Respondents on June 10, 1996. Accordingly, Hawkins\u2019 fraud claim was barred by the statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA (1991). Therefore, because Hawkins\u2019 fraud claim was futile, the District Court did not abuse it discretion when it denied Hawkins\u2019 motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b644 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it failed to reverse its judgment for costs against Hawkins?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b645 We review a district court\u2019s award of costs to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Mularoni v. Bing, </em>2001 MT 215, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 405, \u00b6 22, 34 P.3d 497, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b646  The District Court determined that the Respondents were entitled to recover $822 in costs from Hawkins. However, the Respondents later conceded that because they failed to file a timely Bill of Costs, they were not entitled to recover their costs from Hawkins. In light of the Respondents\u2019 concession, Hawkins asserts that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to reverse its judgment for costs. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b647 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
