Neal (Neal) appeals from the order of the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County, in favor of Respondent State of Montana, denying Neal an award of costs following his successful challenge to the suspension of his driver\u2019s license. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Neal\u2019s request for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b63 On January 18, 2001, after being arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Neal\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for refusing to take a breath test. On February 2, 2001, Neal filed a petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, challenging the suspension of his license under \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, by claiming he did not refuse to take a breath test. After a hearing on March 27, 2001, the District Court ordered that Neal\u2019s license be reinstated, finding he did not refuse to take the breath test. On April 2, 2001, the District Court signed the Order reinstating Neal\u2019s license, which included a provision granting Neal his costs, even though costs were not discussed during the hearing. The State objected to the award of costs, and on May 9,2001, the District Court issued an Order amending its original Order and denying costs. Neal now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b64 This Court reviews issues of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s application or interpretation of the law is correct. <em>MacPheat v. Schauf, </em>2002 MT 23, \u00b6 7, 308 Mont. 215, \u00b6 7, 41 P.3d 895, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err when it denied Neal\u2019s request for costs following his successful challenge to the suspension of his driver\u2019s license?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">\u00b66 Neal argues that as the prevailing plaintiff in a lawsuit, he is entitled to costs under \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA. Section 25-10-101, MCA, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">When costs allowed, of course, to plaintiff. Costs are allowed, of course, to the plaintiff upon a judgment in his favor in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">(1) in an action for the recovery of real property or damages thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">(2) in an action to recover the possession of personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>where the value of the property exceeds $50; such value shall be determined by the jury, court, or referee by whom the action is tried;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">(3) in an action for the recovery of money or damages, exclusive of interest, when plaintiff recovers over $50;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">(4) in a special proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(5) in an action which involves the title or possession or right of possession of real estate; or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll, or municipal fine; or quo warranto proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(6) in an action to foreclose a lien or pledge, to prevent or abate a nuisance, or for an injunction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(7) in an action for property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle if he is entitled to attome/s fees under 25-10-303.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\u00b67 Section 25-10-101, MCA, allows the award of costs as a matter \u201cof course\u201d to a plaintiff who prevails in one of the seven enumerated causes. Neal argues that a driver\u2019s license is personal property with a value exceeding $50, which would allow recovery of his costs under \u00a7 25-10-101(2), MCA, or, alternatively, that a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license is a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d which would allow recovery of his costs under \u00a7 25-10-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">\u00b68 The State argues that this Court has previously held that a prevailing party is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs against the State, only if the requirements of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, are satisfied, citing <em>Armstrong v. State </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 468, 820 P.2d 1273, and <em>Jones v. City of Billings </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 341, 927 P.2d 9. Section 25-10-711, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">Award of costs against governmental entity when suit or defense is frivolous or pursued in bad faith. (1) In any civil action brought by or against the state, a political subdivision, or any agency of the state or a political subdivision, the opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">(a) he prevails against the state, political subdivision, or agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">(b) the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, political subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Relying on <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the State claims that Neal failed to establish that the State\u2019s defense in this matter was frivolous or pursued in bad faith, or even to raise the issue in the District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and thus, is not eligible for an award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b69 In <em>Armstrong, </em>we determined it is necessary for the record to disclose a finding that the defense of the State was frivolous or pursued in bad faith before an award of attorney fees and costs can be made pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. <em>Armstrong, </em>250 Mont. at 470, 820 P.2d at 1274. We were faced with a claim for attorney fees in <em>Jones, </em>wherein we again analyzed the legitimacy of the defense for purposes of this statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings relating to the City\u2019s defense are supported by substantial evidence and are not otherwise clearly erroneous. Here, the City presented substantial evidence in support of its bona fide differences of opinion with Jones regarding the substantial issues of whose negligence caused the accident and the amount of Jones\u2019 damages. See <em>Armstrong, 820 P.2d at 1274. </em>Therefore, we further conclude, under the <em>Armstrong </em>test, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the City\u2019s defense was not frivolous or in bad faith pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, and, on that basis denying Jones\u2019 motion for attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\"><em>Jones, </em>279 Mont. at 347, 927 P.2d at 12-13. The State asserts that by failing to make an argument before the District Court that the State\u2019s revocation of Neal\u2019s driver\u2019s license was frivolous or done in bad faith, the statutory requirements of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, were not met, and Neal is prevented from recovering attorney fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b610  The State is correct in its assertion that in order to recover attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, Neal must be the prevailing party and must prove the State brought or defended the suit in bad faith or frivolously. Further, the State correctly notes that Neal did not make such an argument in the District Court. However, Neal is not claiming any attorney fees, nor making any claim pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, and never has. He is claiming only that he is entitled to costs under \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">\u00b611 The State attempts to block the application of \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA, by arguing that \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, applies over \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA. Relying on \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it,\u201d the State asserts that the particular language of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, is controlling over the general language of \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA, and therefore, the latter provision has no application here. \u00b612 It is this Court\u2019s duty to construe the law as it finds it. <em>State ex rel., Palmer v. Hart </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 526, 530, 655 P.2d 965, 967. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous, and certain, the statute speaks for itself.\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>201 Mont. at 530, 655 P.2d at 967. The function of this Court is to ascertain and state what in terms or substance is contained within a statute. <em>Palmer, </em>201 Mont. at 530, 655 P.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b613 We find no inconsistency in the plain language of the two statutes at issue. Section 25-10-711, MCA, applies to actions in which a party prevails against a government entity and can establish that the government\u2019s claim or defense was frivolous or pursued in bad faith. In such cases, the prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees and costs. However, a finding that a claim or defense was frivolous or in bad faith need not be made for recovery of costs under \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA, which provides that costs are awarded \u201cof course\u201d to the plaintiff who prevails in one of the causes enumerated therein. It is under this provision that Neal has sought recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b614 Neal advances that he is entitled to recovery under either of two subsections of \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA. He first contends that his driver\u2019s license is worth more than fifty dollars, and therefore, he is entitled to his costs under \u00a7 25-10-101(2), MCA, as the prevailing plaintiff \u201cin an action to recovery the possession of personal property where the value exceeds $50.\u201d However, this subsection requires that \u201csuch value shall be determined by the jury, court, or referee by whom the action is tried.\u201d There is no evidence in the record regarding the \u201cvalue\u201d of the license, and even if a value exceeding fifty dollars could be assumed, no determination was made by the court in that regard, as required by the statute. Without addressing whether this provision would be otherwise applicable, we find these reasons alone sufficient to render the provision inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b615 Secondly, Neal argues that a petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license is a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d and that he is entitled to recover his costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-101(4), MCA. Various statutory provisions address \u201cspecial proceedings.\u201d Section 27-1-102, MCA, references both actions and special proceedings, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">Actions and special proceedings defined. (1) These remedies are divided into two classes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">(a) actions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">(b) special proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">(2) An action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense. Every other remedy is a special proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>An action is further defined in \u00a7 27-1-103, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">Civil and criminal actions. (1) Actions are of two kinds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">(a) civil; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">(b) criminal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">(2) A civil action is prosecuted by one party against another for the enforcement or protection of a right or the redress or prevention of a wrong. Titles 45 and 46 define and provide for the prosecution of a criminal action. When the violation of a right admits of both a civil and criminal remedy, the right to prosecute the one is not merged in the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">According to these provisions, an action in the civil context is brought to enforce a right or redress a wrong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure note that a civil action is initiated by the filing of a complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">Rule 2. One form of action. There shall be one form of action to be known as \u201cCivil Action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">Rule 3. Commencement of action. A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\u00b616 A license reinstatement proceeding is governed by \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, and states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">Right to appeal to court. (1) Within 30 days after notice of the right to a hearing has been given by a peace officer, a person may file a petition to challenge the license suspension or revocation in the district court in the county where the arrest was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">(2) The court has jurisdiction and shall set the matter for hearing. The court shall give at least 10 days\u2019 written notice of the hearing to the county attorney ... [or] ... to the city attorney....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">In contrast to the provisions defining a single form of action governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, including initiation by complaint and the procedural time frame which follows, Neal\u2019s challenge to the suspension of his license was maintained by the filing of a petition which invoked a specific statutory procedure and time frame distinct from that provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure. We thus conclude that a challenge to a license suspension or revocation under \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, is a special proceeding as contemplated under \u00a7 27-1-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u00b617 Previously, we determined that \u201ca temporary guardianship proceeding qualifies as a special proceeding under \u00a7 27-1-102(2), MCA.\u201d <em>In re the Matter of Klos </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 197, 201, 943 P.2d 1277, 1279. We have also concluded that a proceeding to establish a trust pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 82-1-302 through 305, MCA, is a special proceeding, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">Section 27-1-102, MCA, defines the words \u201cactions\u201d and \u201cspecial proceedings\u201d. An \u201caction is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement o[r] protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong ... Every other remedy is a special proceeding.\u201d Under that provision we determine that the requirements of sections 82-1-302 and 82-1-305, MCA, are \u201cspecial proceedings\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><em>In the Matter of Montana Pacific Oil and Gas Co. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 11, 19, 614 P.2d 1045, 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b618 Other state courts have determined that driver\u2019s license revocation or suspension proceedings are special proceedings under their statutory schemes. In <em>In the Matter of the Suspension of Driver\u2019s License of Metcalf, </em>1972 OK 119, 501 P.2d 208, the Oklahoma Supreme Court concluded that an appeal from the administrative suspension of a driver\u2019s license to the district court was a special proceeding. Similarly, in <em>State of Nebraska v. Hansen </em>(1996), 249 Neb. 177, 542 N.W.2d 424, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined a challenge to the revocation of a driver\u2019s license is a special proceeding, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEg\">This court has construed the phrase \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d to mean every civil statutory remedy which is not encompassed in chapter 25 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes [governing civil procedure]. The ... authority to revoke Hansen\u2019s license does not derive from chapter 25. Rather, the authority is derived from chapter 60. Thus, we are dealing with a special proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\"><em>Hansen, </em>542 N.W.2d at 429 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b619  Having determined that a petition to reinstate a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license is a special proceeding under \u00a7 27-1-102(2), MCA, we hold that Neal, as the prevailing party therein, is entitled to costs as a matter of course under \u00a7 25-10-101(4), MCA. The District Court thus erred in concluding that Neal was not entitled to costs. \u00b620 We reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for entry of an order granting Neal his appropriate costs herein.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-15\"> Sections 25-1-101 and 25-1-102, MCA, also offer a similar definition of \u201ccivil action,\u201d but limit the application thereof to that section of the Code.
