We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b62 The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court erred in ruling that Spolar\u2019s legal malpractice claim was barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u00b64 Spolar brought a legal malpractice action against the Defendants and Respondents, Milton Datsopoulos and Datsopoulos, MacDonald &amp; Lind, P.C., alleging that Datsopoulos was professionally negligent and had breached an implied contract while representing Spolar in the division of his marital estate. According to Spolar, Datsopoulos had failed to fully and fairly ascertain the actual value of the estate, and that, because of this error, the division of the assets benefitted Spolar\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\u00b65 Spolar and his wife divorced in 1987, but elected to keep their marital estate intact, holding their assets in partnership until 1995 when they decided to divide the estate. At that time Spolar was serving a five-year prison term in connection with a 1993 federal drug trafficking conviction. Datsopoulos had represented Spolar in the criminal case and agreed to continue representing Spolar in the asset division proceedings. During Spolar\u2019s incarceration, he and Datsopoulos communicated about the case by telephone and written correspondence. According to Datsopoulos, they discussed, at length, the value of the marital estate to be divided, and specifically the development of Spolar\u2019s asset list which Datsopoulos would later submit to Judge Purcell in the form of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. In creating this asset list, Datsopoulos used a valuation method that he claims Spolar had authorized and which included appraisals prepared by Spolar\u2019s accountant, Boyd Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">\u00b66 Judge Purcell set a hearing in the matter for October 16, 1995. Before the hearing, Datsopoulos submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the court, and forwarded a copy to Spolar, who later acknowledged receiving both that document and a subsequent memorandum, also prepared by Datsopoulos, which included a description of Spolar\u2019s real property. Although it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that Spolar originally approved Datsopoulos\u2019 valuation method, he began to complain about its reliability sometime before the hearing. Depositions of Spolar and his Idaho attorney, Lance Nalder, indicate that Spolar voiced objections to the valuation method as early as October 1995, when Spolar was incarcerated in a federal prison in Safford, Arizona. On December 9,1996, a year after the hearing, Judge Purcell entered his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, dividing Spolar\u2019s marital estate. According to Judge Purcell, the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by Datsopoulos and Spolar\u2019s wife indicated that both parties had agreed on the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b67 Spolar received a copy of the order on December 23, one day before his release from prison. He brought this action against Datsopoulos on December 17, 1999. Datsopoulos moved for summary judgment and, on January 24,2002, the Second Judicial District Court granted the motion, dismissing Spolar\u2019s claim as barred by the statute of limitations. Spolar then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b68 The determinative issue of this appeal is whether the District Court erred in ruling that Spolar\u2019s cause of action against Datsopoulos was barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. Spolar argues that the statute of limitations began to run on December 23, 1996, when he received the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order issued by Judge Purcell. Specifically, Spolar contends that even if the cause of action accrued when the Judge entered his findings of fact and conclusions of law on December 9, 1996, the statute of limitations was tolled until December 23, when he received a copy of the Judge\u2019s order. According to Spolar, a party is not charged with actual knowledge of a court order until he or she receives a copy of the ruling. On this basis, Spolar concludes that he did not receive actual knowledge of any damages sustained as a result of the order until December 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b69 In response, Datsopoulos argues that Spolar\u2019s cause of action accrued on October 16,1995, the hearing date in Spolar\u2019s asset division proceedings. According to Datsopoulos, a cause of action for legal malpractice accrues when the plaintiff has knowledge of the facts essential to a claim. Datsopoulos maintains that Spolar\u2019s cause of action accrued when he became aware of, and began objecting to, the valuation method used for purposes of preparing the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, Datsopoulos contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Spolar\u2019s cause of action accrued in October 1995, more than four years before Spolar filed his legal malpractice suit. Alternatively, Datsopoulos argues that, at the very latest, Spolar\u2019s claim accrued when Judge Purcell entered his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on December 9,1996. Datsopoulos notes that, even with this accrual date, Spolar\u2019s legal malpractice suit, which was filed on December 17,1999, exceeds the three-year statute of limitations period by eight days.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b610 In granting Datsopoulos\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that the statute of limitations in Spolar1 s legal malpractice suit began to run when Judge Purcell entered his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and that by December 17,1999, the date on which Spolar filed the suit, the statute of limitations had expired. The District Court identified December 9,1996, as the accrual date for Spolar\u2019s cause of action because Spolar \u201cdiscovered or should have, through reasonable diligence, discovered Datsopoulos\u2019 alleged act, error or omission ...\u201d on that date. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b611 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is de novo; and we follow the same criteria applied by the District Court pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact as well as entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Once this has been accomplished, the burden shifts to the opposing party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. <em>Stockman Bank of Montana v. Potts, </em>2002 MT 178, \u00b6 3, 311 Mont. 12, \u00b6 3, 52 P.3d 920, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b612 Section 27-2-206, MCA, provides that an action against an attorney for legal malpractice must be commenced within three years after the \u201cplaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, or omission, whichever occurs last ....\u201d Under \u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA, \u201c[a] claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b613 We have discussed, in some detail, the appropriate standard for determining when a cause of action for legal malpractice accrues and when the statute of limitations begins to run. In <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 594, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>Peschel v. Jones </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 516, 525, 760 P.2d 51, 56), we noted that \u201c[w]hen the statute of limitations issue involves the time at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the plaintiff, through the use of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the facts, \u2018[t]he test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation\u2019.\u201d The plaintiff, in <em>Johnson, </em>argued that he did not discover the facts underlying his claim for malpractice against his attorney until he received a transcript of the hearing in which his attorney allegedly submitted improper jury instructions to the trial court. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. Applying \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, we rejected this argument and concluded that the plaintiffs legal malpractice suit accrued when the attorney discussed the instructions with the plaintiff before submitting the instructions to the trial court. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b614 <em>In Schneider v. Leaphart </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 483, 743 P.2d 613, and <em>Uhler v. Doak </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 191, 885 P.2d 1297, we addressed, specifically, the theory, now offered by Spolar, that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff learns of his or her damages. In <em>Schneider, </em>the plaintiff argued that a cause of action against his attorney, for legal malpractice, did not accrue until he allegedly discovered that a property settlement agreement with his wife, which was drafted by the attorney and entered as part of a dissolution decree, provided for payment of maintenance over a period of time which was longer than necessary. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 486-87, 743 P.2d at 616. The plaintiff identified this discovery of the alleged error as the appropriate starting point for the limitations period, asserting that only then did he have knowledge of all the elements of a claim for legal malpractice against the attorney. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 486-87, 743 P.2d at 616. We noted that although this \u201cdamage rule\u201d had been recognized by other states, the plaintiffs application of the rule failed for two reasons. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 487, 743 P.2d at 616. First, the requirement that a legal malpractice statute of limitations will be tolled until a party discovers his or her damages is absent from the Montana code. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 487, 743 P.2d at 616. Second, the issuance of the dissolution decree by the trial court effectively charged the plaintiff with, at least, constructive notice of what was contained in the settlement agreement with his wife, including the nature of the maintenance payments and the effect of that obligation on his property. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 487, 743 P.2d at 616. In short, we concluded that the plaintiffs damages, if any, were sustained when the trial court entered the dissolution decree, and that the statute of limitations began to run on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Uhler, </em>we affirmed this rejection of the \u201cdamage rule.\u201d The plaintiff, in that case, had signed a resignation letter and termination agreement on the advice of his attorney. <em>Uhler, </em>268 Mont. at 196, 885 P.2d at 1300. Under the termination agreement, the plaintiff waived his right to receive bonuses and to exercise an option to repurchase stock. As a result, the plaintiff was exposed to substantial monetary loss and, accordingly, he filed a complaint against the attorney, alleging legal malpractice. <em>Uhler, </em>268 Mont. at 196, 885 P.2d at 1300. In response to the attorney\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations for the action had expired, the plaintiff argued that the limitation period was tolled until he discovered his damages when the termination agreement was executed. <em>Uhler, </em>268 Mont. at 196, 885 P.2d at 1300. The trial court rejected this theory, stating that the discovery of damages is not a prerequisite to the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Uhler, </em>268 Mont. at 195, 885 P.2d at 1299-1300. Although we reversed the trial court on other grounds, we upheld this specific determination and affirmed the language of <em>Schneider </em>that the \u201cdamage rule\u201d is not the recognized standard in Montana. <em>Uhler, </em>268 Mont. at 197, 885 P.2d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b616 Taken together, <em>Johnson, Schneider, </em>and <em>Uhler </em>provide a road map, of sorts, for our analysis in the present case. Spolar\u2019s cause of action against Datsopoulos accrued when Judge Purcell issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law on December 9, 1996. On that date, Spolar\u2019s damages occurred and all the elements of his claim against Datsopoulos existed. Accordingly, with December 9,1996 as a starting point, the three-year statute of limitations expired on December 9, 1999, eight days before Spolar filed his Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b617  We reject Spolar\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations started to run on December 23, 1996, under the \u201cdamage rule.\u201d Like the plaintiff in <em>Johnson, </em>Spolar urges that even if his cause of action accrued on December 9,1996, the statute of limitations was tolled until he learned of Judge Purcell\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law when he received a copy on December 23. We have twice declined to recognize this argument, stating in <em>Schneider </em>and <em>Uhler </em>that under Montana\u2019s codified statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions, the time for filing is not tolled by a plaintiffs failure to discover damages. In light of these prior rulings, Spolar\u2019s urging of a \u201cdamage rule\u201d is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b618  Because the statute of limitations for Spolar\u2019s cause of action began running on December 9,1996, his complaint, which was filed on December 17, 1999, was beyond the three-year limitations period. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting Datsopoulos\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
