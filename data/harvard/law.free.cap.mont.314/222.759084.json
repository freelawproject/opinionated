Fisher appeals from the sentence imposed by the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Beaverhead County. He contends that the sentence is illegal in that, contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 46-18-403, MCA, it does not credit his time spent in jail prior to conviction against the fine imposed by the court. We determine that there is merit to Fisher\u2019s appeal, and we reverse and remand for new sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b62 The issue presented for review is whether \u00a7 46-18-403, MCA, requires that a sentencing court give a defendant credit for time incarcerated prior to conviction against both his jail sentence and any fine imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b63 In April 2002, Fisher was charged with felony DUI (fifth offense) and with two misdemeanors, driving without liability insurance and driving while his driving privileges had been suspended as a result of earlier DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b64 Fisher pled guilty to the DUI charge and to driving with a suspended license in exchange for the State\u2019s agreement to dismiss the other misdemeanor. In addition, the State agreed to recommend a thirteen-month commitment to the Department of Corrections, followed by three years probation, in addition to several fines, costs, fees and surcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b65 Upon accepting Fisher\u2019s pleas, the District Court imposed sentence on May 13, 2002, committing Fisher to the DOC for thirteen months, followed by five years probation. On the misdemeanor offense, the court ordered Fisher to serve thirty days in the county jail, to ran concurrently. In the sentence, the court gave Fisher thirty-seven days credit for time served in the county jail from the date of his arrest to the date of sentencing. Further, the court imposed fines, as follows: $1,000 fine for the felony DUI, $450 reimbursement for public defender costs, $40 surcharge, $50 victim/witness fee, $10 technology fee, and $20 probationary supervision fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\u00b66 On August 5,2002, Fisher filed a Motion to Amend the Judgment and Sentence. In his motion, Fisher requested that the court modify the judgment so as to give him thirty-one days credit toward his fine obligation at a rate of $47 per day, which would discharge his fine obligation entirely. He further asked that the remaining six days credit be applied toward his DOC commitment. Concluding that it lacked authority to amend the sentence, the District Court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b67 Fisher then filed a pro se petition to vacate fines with this Court. We construed the petition as a timely notice of appeal and asked the State to respond, which it has.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b68 Fisher cites our decision in <em>City of Billings v. Layzell </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 145, 789 P.2d 221, for the proposition that a defendant must be given credit for time served against any fine imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b69 The State contends that the District Court correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to modify the sentence imposed. Section 46-18-116(3), MCA, provides that a court can correct a factually erroneous sentence at any time, but that illegal sentences must be dealt with through appeal or postconviction relief. The State contends that this statute does not apply since Fisher did not allege that the sentence was factually erroneous or that there was a conflict between the oral sentence and the written judgment. In the State\u2019s view, the court imposed a legal sentence when it committed Fisher to the DOC for thirteen months, imposed a fine and gave him credit for time served against his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA. It is the State\u2019s position that, whether the court credits the time served against the sentence pursuant to subsection (1) or against the fine pursuant to subsection (2) is a matter of discretion. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b610 Section 46-18-403, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">Credit for incarceration prior to conviction. (1) Any person incarcerated on a bailable offense and against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction, except that the time allowed as a credit may not exceed the term of the prison sentence rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">(2) Any person incarcerated on a bailable offense who does not supply bail and against whom a fine is levied on conviction of the offense must be allowed a credit for each day of incarceration prior to conviction, except that the amount allowed or credited may not exceed the amount of the fine. The daily rate of credit for incarceration must be established annually by the board of county commissioners by resolution. The daily rate must be equal to the actual cost incurred by the detention facility for which the rate is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u00b611 We have interpreted the provisions of subsection (2) in <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Billings v. Layzell. </em>Layzell argued that the district court\u2019s failure to credit his thirty days of pretrial incarceration against his $200 fine was a violation of his constitutional rights. We concluded that it was unnecessary to address his constitutional arguments since the district court\u2019s failure to comply with Montana\u2019s statutory mandate was sufficient to reverse the sentence. Referring to the language in \u00a7 46-18-403(2), MCA (1987), we held: \u201cThe statutory language is mandatory. It requires the District Court to give credit for pretrial detention accrued because the defendant did not make bail. Layzell\u2019s thirty-day pretrial detention is more than sufficient to discharge his fine.\u201d <em>Layzell, </em>242 Mont. at 154, 789 P.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b612 The question presented by the instant case is whether the sentencing court has discretion to choose between giving credit against the sentence or giving credit against the fine. We determine that the statute is not discretionary. As we pointed out in <em>Layzell, </em>subsection (2) of the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mandates that credit \u201cshall\u201d be allowed against the fine. The language of subsection (1) is mandatory as well. It provides that a defendant \u201cmust be allowed credit\u201d against his sentence for all incarceration prior to or after conviction. The subsections are not worded in the disjunctive. They are independent and mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b613  We hold that a sentencing court has no discretion in applying \u00a7 46-18-403, MCA. It must employ both subsections and give the defendant credit for each day of incarceration against both the sentence and any fine imposed. Once a valid sentence has been pronounced, the sentencing court has no jurisdiction to modify it except to correct factual errors. Section 46-18-116(3), MCA; <em>Brown v. State, </em>2002 MT 209N, \u00b6 12. However, a sentence which does not comply with Montana statutory law is illegal and must be addressed in the manner provided by law for appeal and postconviction relief. Section 46-18-116(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b614 As we did in <em>Layzell, </em>we reverse and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> In contrast to the \u201cshall\u201d language of the 1987 statute, the 1995 statute provides that the defendant \u201cmust be allowed credit.\u201d Further, in lieu of a flat rate of $10 per day, the 1995 version provides that the daily rate of credit must be established annually by the Board of County Commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
