Plaintiffs cross-appeal, contending the jury should not have allocated fault to the United States Navy in calculating defendant\u2019s proportionate share of fault. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Taylor served in the Navy as a machinist mate from 1962 to 1971 and again from 1973 to 1976. He worked for the Union Pacific Railroad for approximately six months in the period between his Navy enlistments. He was in the naval reserve from 1976 through 1986. He stopped working in February 2001 because of ill health. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma and the same month was told his life expectancy was a matter of weeks or months.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">A. <em>Taylor\u2019s Work in the Navy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Taylor testified at trial that, among his other duties as a machinist mate on Navy submarines and surface ships, he performed maintenance on valves (which regulate the flow of steam and fluids through pipes) and flanges (the joints between pipe sections). His work on valves included removing and installing the asbestos-containing packing that was used as a sealant to prevent steam from leaking out of the valve. In doing this work, at times he had to brush debris from the packing gland and blow into the valve to remove the debris; some of the dust that was generated would blow back into his face. His work on flanges included installing and removing the spiral-wound and sheet gaskets that seal the pipe joints. During the course of this work, he had to remove debris from the flange, sometimes with a wire brush. Some of the valves and flanges were above his head as he worked, and debris fell on him. He cleaned up the debris by sweeping it up with a broom and dustpan. He did not wear protective gear during this work.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Products</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Defendant manufactures sealing devices, including valve packing. Some of its packing products contain asbestos. During the period 1963 to 1984, defendant sold both asbestos-containing and nonasbestos-containing packing to the Navy. During the same time period, defendant also sold asbestos-containing gasket material, which had been manufactured elsewhere but contained defendant\u2019s logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">During Taylor\u2019s time in the Navy, he worked with defendant\u2019s products. The evidence at trial indicated that Taylor also worked with parts made by other manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>C. <em>The Present Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Taylor and his wife brought this action in San Francisco Superior Court on April 5, 2001, naming John Crane Inc. (defendant), and multiple other defendants. Trial proceeded against defendant, and on December 14, 2001, the jury returned a special verdict in favor of plaintiffs. The jury found Taylor\u2019s economic damages to be $1,010,849, his noneconomic damages to be $1,790,000, and Susan Taylor\u2019s noneconomic damages to be $229,000. Defendant was found to be 31 percent responsible for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries; the Navy, which was not a party to the action, was found to be 16 percent responsible. The remainder of the responsibility was allocated to other entities that also were not parties to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Judgment was entered on December 20, 2001, and amended on December 24, 2001. Defendant moved for a new trial. The motion was denied on March I, 2002. On March 4, 2002, defendant appealed the December 20, 2001, judgment and the December 24, 2001, amended judgment (appeal No. A098044). On March 26, plaintiffs cross-appealed to the extent the judgments reduced their damages by the fault allocated to the United States Navy. A second amended judgment on the special verdict was filed on April II, 2002. Defendant appealed from the order denying a new trial and from the second amended judgment on April 17, 2002 (appeal No. A098587). The appeals were consolidated on July 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">A.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">E. <em>Cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Plaintiffs argue on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to allocate fault to the Navy. The verdict form asked, \u201cAssuming the combined negligence and fault of the defendant and of all other persons, companies and entities whose negligence and fault contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injury to be 100 %, what percentage of such combined negligence and fault is attributable to the defendant and to such other persons, companies or entities whose negligence and fault was a cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d One of the lines on the form allowed the jury to attribute fault to the Navy. The jury allocated 31 percent fault to defendant, 16 percent to the Navy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>the remaining amount to other entities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on this allocation, the second amended judgment awarded plaintiffs 31 percent of their total noneconomic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Plaintiffs contend the Navy was immune from liability and, as a result, it was error to allocate fault to the Navy for purposes of calculating defendant\u2019s proportionate share of their noneconomic damages. They ask us to modify the judgment to eliminate the fault or negligence allocated to the Navy and to increase that allocated to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">1. <em>Immunity of Navy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Plaintiffs rely on two theories of immunity. First, plaintiffs cite the discretionary function immunity, an exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that bars claims \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a).) This exception has been held to bar actions based on the former Veteran\u2019s Administration\u2019s negligent failure to inspect a house for asbestos before sale <em>(Kane </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(8th Cir. 1994) 15 F.3d 87, 88-89); the government\u2019s negligence in failing to warn of the risk of asbestos on ships <em>(Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>U.S.A. </em>(3d Cir. 1990) 919 F.2d 888, 892-893); the government\u2019s alleged negligence in constructing, operating, and maintaining asbestos-containing ships <em>(Gordon v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1988) 835 F.2d 96, 99-100 <em>(Gordon)); </em>and the government\u2019s lack of due care in promulgating a policy for asbestos safety in shipyards or in having no policy or program at all on the issue <em>(Shuman v. United States </em>(1st Cir. 1985) 765 F.2d 283, 290).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Plaintiffs also contend the doctrine announced in <em>Feres v. United States </em>(1950) 340 U.S. 135 [95 L.Ed. 152, 71 S.Ct. 153] <em>(Feres) </em>and <em>Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 666 [52 L.Ed.2d 665, 97 S.Ct. 2054] <em>(Stencel) </em>confers immunity on the Navy. In <em>Feres, supra, </em>340 U.S. at page 146, the United States Supreme Court declared: \u201c[T]he Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d The Supreme Court extended the reach of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine in <em>Stencel </em>to conclude that a third party indemnity cross-claim against the government for injuries the plaintiff had suffered during military service was barred. <em>(Stencel, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 667, 673.) In doing so, the court explained the factors that underlie the <em>Feres </em>doctrine: the need for a uniform system of compensation for members of the armed services; the fact that the Veterans\u2019 Benefit Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>establishes, \u201cas a substitute for tort liability, a statutory \u2018no fault\u2019 compensation scheme which provides generous pensions to injured servicemen, without regard to any negligence attributable to the Government\u201d; and the disciplinary problems that would result if soldiers could sue their superiors for negligent orders or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty. (Stencel, at pp. 671-672, citing <em>Feres, supra, </em>340 U.S. at p. 143 and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 110, 112 [99 L.Ed. 139, 75 S.Ct. 141].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Defendant disputes plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Navy was immune under either the discretionary immunity exception or the <em>Feres/Stencel </em>rule. We do not decide the issue because we conclude that, even assuming the Navy was immune, the trial court properly allowed the fault of the Navy to be taken into account in allocating responsibility for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">2. <em>Allocation of Fault Under Proposition 51</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Several cases have considered the allocation of responsibility for noneconomic damages to an absent party in light of Proposition 51 (Civ. Code,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7 1431.2 and amended \u00a7 1431). Section 1431.2, subdivision (a) provides that, in actions for wrongful death, personal injury, or property damage based on comparative fault, \u201cthe liability of each defendant for non-economic damages shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.\u201d (See <em>DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 600 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140] <em>(DaFonte).) </em>Our Supreme Court has explained the purpose of this rule: \u201c \u2018[T]he measure quite clearly is simply intended to limit the potential liability of an individual defendant for noneconomic damages to a proportion commensurate with that defendant\u2019s personal share of fault.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 603, quoting <em>Evangelatos v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1204 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The plaintiff in <em>DaFonte </em>was injured by equipment while on the job; he successfully sought damages from the manufacturer of the equipment. In the trial court, the award of noneconomic damages against the manufacturer was reduced by 45 percent, the amount attributable to the fault of the employer, which was immune from liability for work-related injuries under California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>(DaFonte, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 596-598.) The Supreme Court agreed this procedure was proper, concluding that Proposition 51 \u201celiminates a third party defendant\u2019s joint and several liability to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>injured employee for unpaid noneconomic damages attributable to the fault of the employer, who is statutorily immune from suit.\u201d (DaFonte, at p. 596.) There was no exception for damages <em>\u201cattributable to the fault of persons who are immune from liability </em>and have no mutual joint obligation to pay missing shares. [Italics added.] On the contrary, section 1431.2 expressly affords relief to every tortfeasor who <em>is </em>a liable \u2018defendant,\u2019 and who formerly <em>would </em>have had full joint liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 601.) Therefore, the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Proposition 51 did not permit apportionment of fault to absent or immune tortfeasors, concluding instead that \u201cthe only reasonable construction of section 1431.2 is that a \u2018defendant\u2019s]\u2019 liability for noneconomic damages cannot exceed his or her proportionate share of fault <em>as compared with all fault responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, </em>not merely that of \u2018defendant^]\u2019 present in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>(DaFonte, </em>at p. 603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that it is not <em>DaFonte </em>but <em>Richards v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 985 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 103, 928 P.2d 1181] <em>(Richards) </em>that controls here. In <em>Richards, </em>the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the interplay between Proposition 51 and a different \u201cimmunity\u201d statute, section 1714.45. <em>(Richards, </em>at p. 989.) That statute provided that \u201ca manufacturer or seller \u2018shall not be hable\u2019 in a \u2018product liability action\u2019 for harm caused by the ingestion of a \u2018common consumer product intended for personal consumption, such as . . . tobacco\u2019 which is \u2018inherently unsafe\u2019 and consumed with \u2018ordinary [community] knowledge\u2019 of its danger.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 988.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">__\u25a0\u25a0__,</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Richards, a smoker, sued Owens-Illinois* for asbestos-related injuries. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 989-990.) Relying on <em>DaFonte, </em>Owens-Illinois argued \u201ceven if the tobacco companies are themselves immune from liability for their products\u2019 contribution to plaintiff\u2019s lung disease, these companies\u2019 proportionate responsibility for the injury\u2014i.e., their comparative \u2018fault\u2019\u2014necessarily reduces Owen-Illinois\u2019s own degree of \u2018fault\u2019 for the same injury.\u201d <em>(Richards, </em>at p. 997, italics omitted.) Therefore, the defendant argued, the comparative fault of the tobacco companies should diminish the defendant\u2019s proportionate share of liability for noneconomic damages under Proposition 51. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The court in <em>Richards </em>began its analysis by scrutinizing the immunity statute. It concluded that section 1714.45 did not merely confer immunity from <em>liability </em>for tortious conduct, but constituted a determination by the Legislature that a company supplying tobacco does not engage in tortious conduct because it <em>breaches no duty </em>to consumers. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 1000.) \u201cIn other words, under the conditions described by section 1714.45, a tobacco supplier simply commits no tort against knowing and voluntary smokers by making cigarettes available for their use.\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 837 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 40, 50 P.3d 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Having ascertained the meaning of section 1714.45, the court distinguished <em>DaFonte, </em>reasoning as follows: Under Proposition 51 the defendant\u2019s fault must be compared to all other fault. Because an employer\u2019s tort immunity under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme \u201cdoes not imply any absence of legal \u2018fault\u2019 or tortious responsibility in an employer whose act or omission contributed to the harm,\u201d the immune employer\u2019s share of responsibility for a plaintiff\u2019s injury is included in ascertaining comparative <em>fault. (Richards, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 998 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 103, 928 P.2d 1181].) In contrast, the tobacco companies\u2019 immunity \u201carises from a premise which is . . . inconsistent with the allocation of legal \u2018fault\u2019 to such entities under Proposition 51, as contemplated in DaFonte.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, no \u201c \u2018fault\u2019 \u201d can be assigned to any acts of the tobacco companies that contributed to plaintiff\u2019s harm. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Plaintiffs do not address the <em>Richards </em>rationale. They assert only that the result in <em>Richards </em>applies here and the result in <em>DaFonte </em>does not. Plaintiffs contend that <em>DaFonte </em>is \u201cunique\u201d in that it \u201crested on prior Supreme Court decisions holding \u2018in essence, that an employee\u2019s damage judgment against third parties must be reduced by an amount attributable to the employer\u2019s proportionate share of fault, up to the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid. . . . [T]hird party defendants remained jointly and severally liable to the injured employee for all damages attributable to the employer\u2019s fault which were not covered by workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u2019 <em>DaFonte, </em>2 Cal.4th at 599 . . . .\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs argue, the Navy cannot be assigned a portion of the fault in this case because defendant has failed to show that \u201cunder <em>Feres/Stencel </em>a third party defendant [may] reduce its liability by the federal government\u2019s share of fault, up to the amount of veteran\u2019s benefits paid to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of <em>DaFonte </em>is simply wrong. The quoted passage does not constitute the underpinning for the court\u2019s holding. It is, rather, part of a recital of the <em>history </em>of contributory and comparative fault, commencing with <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226], and continuing to the passage of Proposition 51 in 1986. <em>(DaFonte, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 597-600.) The next paragraph in <em>DaFonte </em>makes this crystal clear: \u201cIn sum, by 1986 the courts had eliminated certain inequities of the former tort recovery system, but so-called \u2018deep pocket\u2019 defendants whose fault was slight could still be saddled with large damage awards mainly attributable to the greater fault of others who were able to escape their full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>proportionate contribution. [Citation.] <em>Proposition 51 sought to modify this system of </em>recovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 599, italics added.) The court went on to conclude that under Proposition 51 \u201cthe plaintiff alone now assumes the risk that a proportionate contribution cannot be obtained from each person responsible for the injury.\u201d <em>(DaFonte, </em>at p. 600.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Akin to plaintiffs\u2019 argument here, the plaintiff in <em>DaFonte </em>contended that, absent an exception to Proposition 51 for third party suits by injured workers, \u201cthe \u2018delicate\u2019 preexisting balance among the rights of employee, employer, and third party tortfeasor\u201d will be destroyed. <em>(DaFonte, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 603.) But as the court decisively noted, \u201c[this] principal effect is <em>precisely that intended by the initiative: </em>defendants no longer have to pay an injured employee\u2019s noneconomic damages caused by the fault of another, and the employee, like any other tort victim, bears the resulting risk of loss. No substantial reason is asserted, let alone a \u2018compelling\u2019 one, why Proposition 51\u2019s manifest policy should not apply in this particular situation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 603-604, italics added, fn omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>Richards </em>and <em>DaFonte </em>establish that under Proposition 51, fault will be allocated to an entity that is immune from <em>paying for </em>its tortious acts, but will not be allocated to an entity that is not a tortfeasor, that is, one whose actions have been declared not to be tortious. We are aware of no declaration stating the government breaches no duty to military personnel when it exercises its discretion or when a serviceman is injured in the course of military service. Indeed, the cases make clear the government is immune from claims based on such conduct <em>even if it has been negligent. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Stencel, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 668-672; <em>Gordon, supra, </em>835 F.2d at p. 100.) Accordingly, whatever the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 position that the Navy was immune under either the discretionary immunity exception or the <em>Feres/Stencel </em>doctrine, we conclude the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to allocate fault to the Navy for purposes of determining defendant\u2019s proportionate share of responsibility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">HI.
