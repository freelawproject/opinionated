The question presented in this appeal is whether such a lump sum settlement award received <em>before </em>separation is the injured spouse\u2019s separate property. We hold that the portion of such an award attributable to disability or pension payments owed during the marriage or medical expenses paid with community funds is community property, but the remainder of the award is the injured spouse\u2019s separate property. The trial court in this case found the entire lump sum award received by defendant and appellant June S. Bloomfield (wife) was community property despite evidence that most of the award was attributable to postseparation disability and life pension payments and future medical expenses. Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the judgment ordering wife to pay one-half of her lump sum award to plaintiff and respondent Gilmore E. Raphael (husband) and remand this matter to the trial court to determine what portion, if any, of wife\u2019s lump sum award is community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Wife and husband were married in May 1994 and separated in August 2000. Both spouses suffered work-related injuries during their marriage and applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Husband settled his workers\u2019 compensation claim and received a lump sum payment of $45,000 in October 2000, two months after he and wife separated. Wife, who was determined to be 90.1 percent permanently disabled, settled her workers\u2019 compensation claim and received a lump sum payment of $311,859.04 in February 2000, six months before she and husband separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Husband petitioned for dissolution of the marriage in February 2001. At trial, the only contested issue was whether the workers\u2019 compensation awards each spouse received were community property. Relying upon Family Code section 760 (section 760)\u2014which raises a rebuttable presumption that property acquired during the marriage is community property (see <em>In re Marriage of Haines </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 277, 289-290 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 673])\u2014 husband argued that wife\u2019s award was community property because she received it before separation, but husband\u2019s award was his separate property because he received it after separation. Wife contended at trial that both awards were separate property because she and husband entered into an oral agreement before the marriage to treat property acquired by each spouse as that spouse\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The trial court found that husband\u2019s award was his separate property, but that wife\u2019s award was community property\u2014thereby impliedly finding that there was no binding oral agreement. The court ordered wife to pay husband $155,929.52, i.e., one-half of wife\u2019s lump sum award. Represented by new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>counsel, wife filed a motion for reconsideration or for a new trial, on the ground that the court\u2019s finding that wife\u2019s award was community property was contrary to law. One of the documents attached to that motion was the declaration of wife\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation attorney, which explained that part of wife\u2019s award was attributable to future payments of disability benefits and pension, and the remainder of the award was attributable to future medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The trial court denied wife\u2019s motion, finding there was no error of law because the court did not have evidence before it at trial to rebut the section 760 presumption of community property. Wife timely appealed from the judgment and order denying her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">A. <em>Can This Court Consider a Theory That Was Not Raised at Trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">On appeal, wife contends that her workers\u2019 compensation award was not community property because it represents future payments to compensate her for her diminished earning capacity and for her future medical expenses. Wife did not advance this argument during the trial in this case (although she did make the argument in her posttrial motion for reconsideration or for a new trial). As noted above, wife asserted at trial that her workers\u2019 compensation award was her separate property based upon an alleged oral agreement between wife and husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Ordinarily, \u201c[t]he theory upon which a case was tried in the court below must be followed on appeal.\u201d <em>(Strasberg v. Odyssey Group, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 906, 920 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 474].) Nevertheless, a reviewing court may consider points not raised at trial when important issues of public policy are involved <em>(Frink v. Prod </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 170 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476]; accord, <em>In re Marriage of Weaver </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 478, 488 [273 Cal.Rptr. 696]) or when a contention newly made on appeal presents a question of law based upon undisputed facts <em>(Seeley v. Seymour </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 844, 856 [237 Cal.Rptr. 282]). Because wife\u2019s appeal raises a question of law involving an important issue of public policy not previously addressed in California case law, we consider her contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">B. <em>Is a Lump Sum Workers\u2019 Compensation Award Received During a Marriage Community Property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Although no published California case has addressed the precise issue in this case\u2014i.e., whether a workers\u2019 compensation lump sum award received prior to marital separation is community property\u2014the California Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Court and the courts of appeal have addressed related issues, such as whether postdissolution military disability pay is community property <em>(In re Marriage of Jones </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 457 [119 Cal.Rptr. 108, 531 P.2d 420] <em>(Jones); </em>see also <em>In re Marriage of Stenquist </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 779 [148 Cal.Rptr. 9, 582 P.2d 96]) and whether a postseparation workers\u2019 compensation lump sum award is community property <em>(McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 509; see also <em>In re Marriage of Fisk </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1698 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 95] <em>(Fisk); </em>1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed. 1995) Permanent Disability Benefits \u00a7 808[5], pp. 8-53). In each of those cases, the court examined the purpose of the disability payments to determine whether the compensation received by the injured spouse was community property. The approach taken by the courts in these cases is the same as that taken by courts in a majority of community property states. (See Annot., Divorce and Separation: Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits as Marital Property Subject to Distribution (1995) 30 A.L.R.5th 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In <em>Jones, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 457, one spouse was injured while serving in the military. The injured spouse was \u201cretired for disability\u201d and received monthly disability pay. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 459.) When the noninjured spouse filed suit for dissolution of the marriage, she asserted that the injured spouse\u2019s right to disability pay was a community asset. The Supreme Court disagreed. It explained that disability payments \u201cserve to compensate the disabled veteran for the loss of military pay caused by his premature retirement and for his diminished ability to compete for civilian employment. [Citation.] So long as the marriage subsists, the veteran\u2019s reduced earnings works a loss to the community. But such community loss does not continue after dissolution; at that point the earnings or accumulations of each party are the separate property of such party. [Citation.] Then any diminution in earning capacity becomes the separate loss of the disabled spouse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 462.) The court concluded, \u201cSince disability pay serves primarily to compensate the disabled serviceman for current suffering and lost earning capacity, we conclude that only such payments as are received during the marriage constitute a community asset. The veteran\u2019s right to payments subsequent to dissolution is his separate and personal right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Court of Appeal in <em>McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 509, came to the same conclusion with regard to workers\u2019 compensation permanent disability pay. The court noted that in <em>Northwestern Redwood Co. v. Industrial Acc. Commission of California </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 484 [194 P. 31] <em>(Northwestern), </em>the California Supreme Court held that the wife of an industrially injured spouse could recover workers\u2019 compensation permanent disability benefits owed to her spouse after he deserted her and was never heard from again, under a statute that allowed a lien on workers\u2019 compensation benefits where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the injured employee had deserted or was neglecting the employee\u2019s family,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that those benefits constituted community property. But according to the court in <em>McDonald, Northwestern's </em>statement that workers\u2019 compensation payments are community property did not control the case before the <em>McDonald </em>court because <em>Northwestern </em>\u201c \u2018dealt with benefits received during the marriage. No decisions have determined whether an employee\u2019s right to future workers\u2019] compensation benefits constitutes a community asset subject to division upon dissolution of the marriage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d at p. 511, quoting <em>Jones, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 464, fn. 7.) The court in <em>McDonald </em>concluded that a workers\u2019 compensation permanent disability award is like the military disability pay at issue in <em>Jones, </em>in that both are based on disability and serve to compensate the injured party for his or her diminished earning capacity. Therefore, relying upon <em>Jones, </em>the court held that a workers\u2019 compensation permanent disability award received after separation is the injured spouse\u2019s separate property. <em>(McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d at p. 513; accord, <em>Fisk, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 1705.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This same reasoning leads us to conclude that, notwithstanding the section 760 community property presumption, a lump sum permanent disability award received <em>prior to </em>separation is the injured spouse\u2019s separate property to the extent it is meant to compensate for the injured spouse\u2019s diminished earning capacity (and/or medical expenses) <em>after </em>separation. The Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Northwestern, supra, </em>184 Cal. at page 486, that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are community property does not govern because later authorities have limited the effect of <em>Northwestern </em>and its peculiar facts to benefits owed and received during the parties\u2019 marriage. <em>(McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d at p. 511.) Here, at least a portion of the lump sum award received during the marriage represented future benefits, and therefore some of the benefits were not owed during the marriage. Moreover, the result in <em>Northwestern </em>and our holding here are consistent with the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme, which expressly allows a lien against workers\u2019 compensation benefits in favor of a deserted spouse but disallows liens other than those enumerated in Labor Code section 4903.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Ogdon </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 192, 196-197 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>[113 Cal.Rptr. 206, 520 P.2d 1022] [\u201cThese two sections [Labor Code sections 4901 and 4903] indicate a clear legislative intent to remove [workers\u2019 compensation] awards from the operation of the usual remedies available to creditors, to limit and regulate the kinds of debts which may be allowed, <em>and to insure that the award is made available to the injured employee for his recovery and rehabilitation in accordance with the purposes of the act'' </em>(italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">There is no logical reason to treat a lump sum workers\u2019 compensation award differently based upon whether it is received before or after separation, because the timing of the receipt is unrelated to the purpose of the award. An injured spouse who receives a lump sum award the day before a marital separation has the same diminished earning capacity, and the same need for compensation to offset that diminished earning capacity, as he or she would have if the award were received the day after the separation. Yet were we to hold that the award is community property if it is received the day before the separation, the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation award would be thwarted because the injured spouse would not be compensated adequately for his or her diminished future earning capacity. Moreover, if an award received the day before separation were to be deemed community property, the noninjured spouse would receive a windfall because only a portion, if any, of the award is intended to compensate for a loss to the community.  Therefore, we hold that only that portion of a workers\u2019 compensation permanent disability award received before a marital separation that is intended to compensate for the injured spouse\u2019s reduced earnings <em>during the marriage </em>(before separation), or for injury-related expenses paid with community funds, constitutes community property. The remainder of any such award is the separate property of the injured spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">C. <em>Was There Evidence Admitted at Trial That Any Portion of Wife's Award Was Attributable to Postseparation Payments or Expenses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">A question remains regarding whether there was evidence admitted at trial in this case that establishes that the lump sum award wife received was attributable to future disability payments and future medical expenses. At the hearing on wife\u2019s motion for reconsideration or a new trial, the trial court stated that there was no such evidence admitted at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was, however, evidence admitted at trial that shows the nature of the award, from which the court could have determined the portion of the lump sum award not subject to division as community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>There was some confusion regarding exactly what documentary evidence was admitted. At the start of the trial, the parties stipulated to admit into evidence what is referred to as \u201cthe compromise and release order\u201d (related to wife\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation settlement) that both parties had attached to their trial briefs. During the attorneys\u2019 and court\u2019s discussion regarding the stipulation, the court and attorneys refer to Exhibit B to wife\u2019s trial brief and Exhibit 1 to husband\u2019s trial brief as admitted evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Exhibit 1 to husband\u2019s trial brief consisted of seven pages. The first page of the exhibit is a document entitled \u201cJoint Order Approving Compromise &amp; Release,\u201d which appears to have attached a two-page document entitled \u201cCompromise and Release,\u201d which in turn attaches several exhibits. One of the exhibits attached to the Compromise and Release is a document entitled \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Commutation Worksheet,\u201d which shows the computation of the present value of wife\u2019s disability life pension.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Compromise and Release states, among other things, that (1) wife has been paid for all periods of temporary disability, and has received $58,354.90 in permanent disability payments (through January 28, 2000); (2) all medical expenses incurred through the date of approval of the Compromise and Release would be paid by the insurance carrier, and all future medical expenses would be paid by wife; (3) attorney fees would be deducted from the $400,000 workers\u2019 compensation lump sum settlement payment; and (4) the insurance carrier would take credit from the settlement for the $58,354.90 permanent disability payments already paid. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commutation Worksheet shows that wife\u2019s permanent disability benefit rate was $230.00 per week, that she would receive that weekly benefit for 11.2633 years, that she had a life pension rate of $115.96 per week, and that the pension had a commuted value of $61,413.81. This evidence shows that only a small fraction of the $400,000 settlement represented disability payments that otherwise would have been paid before wife and husband separated (from January 28, 2000 through August 2000); the remainder of the settlement, therefore, represented postseparation payments and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Although there was no testimony at trial that would have clarified the meaning of the documents, the documents suggest that most, if not all, of the workers\u2019 compensation award was to compensate wife for <em>future </em>medical expenses and disability and pension payments. Moreover, it appears that husband\u2019s attorney and the trial court believed that the exhibits admitted into evidence by stipulation adequately demonstrated how much of the award was allocated to future disability and pension payments and to future medical expenses. When wife\u2019s attorney attempted to question wife regarding those allocations, the court interrupted to ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t this evidence already, per the stipulation?\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney then agreed that this evidence had been admitted under the stipulation. Given the parties\u2019 stipulation to admit husband\u2019s Exhibit 1 into evidence and husband\u2019s attorney\u2019s concession that the documentary evidence demonstrated the allocation of the award, we conclude there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to establish that at least a portion of wife\u2019s lump sum award was her separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Although there was evidence that <em>some </em>of the award was wife\u2019s separate property, we reject wife\u2019s contention that she necessarily is entitled to the <em>entire </em>lump sum award as her separate property.  To the extent a portion of the lump sum award represented benefits that, in the absence of wife\u2019s settlement, would have been paid prior to the parties\u2019 separation (i.e., the weekly disability payments she would have received from the time of the settlement until separation), those payments would be community property under <em>Northwestern, supra, </em>184 Cal. at page 486, as later interpreted by <em>McDonald, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Wife was found to be 90.1 percent permanently disabled as a result of job-related injuries, and therefore presumably will be unable to support herself through employment for the rest of her life. The purpose of workers\u2019 compensation insurance generally, and the purpose of wife\u2019s lump sum award specifically, is to provide that support. Under husband\u2019s theory, however, he is entitled to half of that award. Neither the law nor the equities justify such a cruel result. There can be no dispute that at least part\u2014and no doubt most\u2014of the lump sum award wife received six months before the marital separation represented payments intended to support wife postseparation. By distributing half of wife\u2019s award to husband, the trial court not only gave a windfall to husband, it took away wife\u2019s primary means of support, contravening the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. The law should not and does not condone the use of the theory of trial doctrine to perpetuate that result. Under these circumstances, reversal of the judgment is neither unfair to the trial court nor unjust to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court to determine what portion, if any, of wife\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation lump sum award was attributable to disability and life pension payments owed before the marital separation or to medical expenses paid with community funds. That portion shall be distributable as community property, and the remainder of the lump sum award shall be deemed wife\u2019s separate property.

I also have grave concerns about the propriety of the majority\u2019s conclusion that certain documents may have been received into evidence, and therefore may be relied on to support the majority\u2019s opinion, when the trial court expressly stated the documents had not been received into evidence. I will, however, leave these concerns for another case in which the issues are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">I dissent on the ground that the entire case, including trial, proceeded on one theory, and the theory relied on by the majority to reverse the judgment of the family law court relies on an entirely different theory, not raised by Wife until posttrial motions. In my view, the theory of trial doctrine should be applied to restrain us from addressing Wife\u2019s new theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u201cThe theory upon which a case was tried in the court below must be followed on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Strasberg v.

To permit a change in either of these on appeal would, in most cases, be highly prejudicial and accordingly is not permitted.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Appeal, \u00a7 405, p. 456.) Thus, in actions between former spouses relating to property issues, the appellant may not adopt a new theory on appeal as to the nature of the property in question. <em>(Baskett v.

A new legal theory is more likely to be considered on appeal if an important issue of public policy is involved. <em>(In re Marriage of Freeman </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1450 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 439]; <em>In re Marriage of Weaver </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 478, 488 [273 Cal.Rptr. 696].) In exercising its discretion as to the application of this exception, the appellate court should consider whether the party raising the new theory waived the right to assert the new theory. <em>(In re Marriage of Weaver, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Wife\u2019s theory of the trial was that there was an unequivocal oral agreement and pattern of behavior between the parties from the date of marriage to the time of physical separation that the earnings of the parties would be their separate property. Wife argued that Husband should be equitably estopped from asserting his community property interest in her workers\u2019 compensation award by the preexisting oral agreement. The case was tried on this theory and all of the evidence and argument presented by the parties related to this theory. The family law court found that the workers\u2019 compensation award received during the marriage was community property. In a motion for reconsideration or new trial, for the first time Wife argued that the workers\u2019 compensation award was not community property. The family law court rejected this theory on the ground that it had not been timely raised and the documents supporting the argument had not been received into evidence. The family law court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Wife raises this same new theory on appeal. The majority concludes it is purely a legal issue. It is not. As indicated by the majority, the entirety of the workers\u2019 compensation award paid to Wife is not separate property under any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>legal theory. Some factual apportionment must be undertaken. The majority further concludes the relevant facts are undisputed. They are not. Not all of the relevant facts were even received into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent some facts are undisputed, that may be because those facts were not at issue under Wife\u2019s theory of the case. Wife chose to present her case on the theory of equitable estoppel. This decision may have been tactical, based on the fact that there was no authority for the proposition that workers\u2019 compensation awards received during the marriage are separate property. Husband presented his case with Wife\u2019s theory of the case in mind. Wife lost and does not argue the family law court erred under the theory upon which the case was tried. Under these circumstances, it is \u201cunfair\u201d to the family law court, and \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d to Husband to reverse the judgment on the basis of a new theory affirmatively waived by Wife in the family law court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\"> The theory of trial doctrine is not to be confused with the related but separate doctrine of points not properly raised in the trial court.
