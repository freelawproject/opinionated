We agree and shall reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">A dependency petition was filed in July 2001 concerning R. T. and D. T, ages one and two respectively, after their father was arrested on a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">\n<em>ICWA Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">On forms entitled \u201cDESIGNATION OF AMERICAN INDIAN STATUS,\u201d appellant and the minors\u2019 father indicated Indian heritage through the Cherokee tribe. The father indicated, more specifically, that his tribal affiliation was \u201cCherokee (Tennessee).\u201d At the detention hearing, the juvenile court inquired whether the parents knew the particular tribe. The father\u2019s attorney replied \u201cTennessee for the father,\u201d while appellant\u2019s attorney stated that appellant \u201c[wa]s not sure\u201d but she would try to get the information and provide it to the social worker. The juvenile court ordered that notice be provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and \u201cthe Cherokee Nation.\u201d The court sustained the petition as amended and continued the matter for a dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">In the social worker\u2019s report for the dispositional hearing, under a section entitled \u201cINDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT STATUS,\u201d it was reported: \u201cNotices have been sent. SEE NOTICES.\u201d The record contains notices on form \u201cSOC 319\u201d to the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes and the BIA. (65 Fed.Reg. 13298 (Mar. 13, 2000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">At a subsequent hearing, the juvenile court inquired whether there had been any response from \u201cthe Cherokee Nation.\u201d The social worker said she had \u201creceived nothing back on the father.\u201d As to appellant, the social worker reported \u201cit says that they have insufficient information.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s question as to what information was needed, the attorney for the social services agency responded: \u201cIt is important in most cases to be able to trace back to 1900 with names, birth dates, and birth places of ancestors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney said appellant did not have any of this information but she was attempting to get it from her father, whom she had been unable to contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">At the dispositional hearing, the attorney for the social services agency reported that a response had been received from the BIA \u201cindicating that the child is not considered an Indian child, either one of them.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s query whether \u201c[t]hey [we]re declining to be involved in these proceedings,\u201d the attorney responded \u201cit says, \u2018Is not registered nor eligible to register as a member of this tribe.\u2019 \u201d The court found the \u201cCherokee Indian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>Nation has been noticed, they have responded, and . . . they are declining to participate in these proceedings.\u201d All subsequent reports from the social services agency stated the ICWA did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">At the six-month review hearing, the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a hearing to select a permanent plan for the minors pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because neither parent had complied with the case plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">After the section 366.26 hearing, the juvenile court found the minors adoptable and terminated parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">\n<em>Adoptability Issues</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\"><em>Appellant has Waived her Challenge to the Finding of </em>Adoptability'</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">\n<em>The Juvenile Court Failed to Obtain Sufficient Information to Comply with the ICWA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">Appellant contends the juvenile court erred by failing to ensure compliance with the notice provisions of the ICWA. We agree that the notice provided was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-15\">In 1978, Congress passed the ICWA, which is designed \u201cto promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of Indian children from their families and placement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>such children \u2018in . . . homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture----\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Levi U. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 191, 195 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 648]; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902; <em>Mississippi Choctaw </em>v. <em>Holy field </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 30 [104 L.Ed.2d 29, 109 S.Ct. 1597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Among the procedural safeguards included in the ICWA is a provision for notice, which states in part: \u201cIn any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">In addition, ICWA notice must include the following information, if known: the name of the child; the child\u2019s birth date and birthplace; the name of the tribe in which the child is enrolled or may be eligible for enrollment; names of the child\u2019s mother, father, grandparents and great grandparents or Indian custodians, including maiden, married and former names or aliases, as well as their birth dates, places of birth and death, tribal enrollment numbers, and current and former addresses; and a copy of the petition. (25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11(a) &amp; (d) (2003); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">\u201cDetermination of tribal membership or eligibility for membership is made exclusively by the tribe.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1439(g).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   The Indian status of a child need not be certain or conclusive to trigger the ICWA\u2019s notice requirements. <em>(In re Desiree F. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 460, 471 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].) In the present matter, under a section entitled \u201cINDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT STATUS,\u201d the social worker\u2019s report stated: \u201cNotices have been sent. SEE NOTICES.\u201d The record contains notices to the BIA and the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes on form \u201cSOC 319.\u201d There are no other ICWA notices in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">Although the notice forms included notification of the pendency of the proceedings and an advisement of the right to intervene, they provided scant information to assist the BIA and the tribes in making a determination as to whether the minors were Indian children. In fact, other than the names, birth dates, and birthplaces of the minors and their parents, no information was provided to assist the tribes in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">We are cognizant that appellant informed the juvenile court she did not have information going \u201cback to 1900 with names, birth dates, and birth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>places of ancestors.\u201d However, the notices failed to include information already known to the social worker, such as appellant\u2019s married name, the parents\u2019 current addresses, the names of the minors\u2019 grandparents, and that the claimed tribal affiliation was Cherokee. All of this information was contained in the social worker\u2019s dispositional report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Moreover, the social worker\u2019s affirmative duty to inquire whether the minors might be Indian children mandated, at a minimum, that she make some inquiry regarding the additional information required to be included in the ICWA notice. (See rule 1439(d).) The record does not disclose any inquiry of the father after he informed the court at the detention hearing that he had Cherokee heritage. And it cannot be implied from the fact that appellant could not trace her ancestors back to 1900 that she could provide no additional information about her parents or grandparents. Although the court instructed the parents to provide the social worker with \u201cany and all information that you have or can reasonably give\u201d regarding Indian ancestry, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the parents were ever told, specifically, what information was relevant to this inquiry. The father\u2019s attorney stated as much when he informed the juvenile court: \u201cI don\u2019t know what information the social worker needs for the father . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">\u201c[Ojne of the primary purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable the tribe to determine whether the child involved in the proceedings is an Indian child. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Desiree F., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 470.)  Notice is meaningless if no information is provided to assist the tribes and the BIA in making this determination. With only the names, birth dates and birthplaces of the minors and the parents, it is little wonder the responses received were that the information was insufficient to make a determination or that the minors were not registered or eligible to register. Consequently, we conclude the notice provided was insufficient. As the tribes and the BIA were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to determine whether the minors were Indian children, the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">\n<em>Other ICWA Issues</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The order terminating parental rights is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to order the social services agency to make proper inquiry and to comply with the notice provisions of the ICWA. If after proper inquiry and notice, the BIA or a tribe determines that the minors are Indian children as defined by the ICWA, the juvenile court is ordered to conduct a new section 366.26 hearing in conformity with all provisions of the ICWA. If, on the other hand, no response is received or the tribes and the BIA determine that the minors are not Indian children, all previous findings and orders shall be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">In all other respects, the orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">Scotland, P. J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 25, 2003.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1159-12\"> In the unpublished portion of this opinion we conclude that appellant has waived her contention that the juvenile court\u2019s finding of adoptability was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1161-16\"> All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1161-17\">See footnote *, <em>ante, </em>page 1449.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1162-13\"> All further rule references are to the California Rules of Court unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">See footnote *, ante, page 1449.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
