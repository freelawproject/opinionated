Nearly 30 years later, it came to light that the map filed in connection with the property division apparently merged each neighbor\u2019s property holdings. That revelation prompted the affected neighbors to bring this proceeding to exclude their property from the subdivision. Following a three-day hearing, the trial court denied the petition for exclusion. One of the petitioners brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">As we explain below, we conclude that the trial court should have granted the petition for exclusion from the subdivision map. We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">In 1970, John R. Weis sought permission from Santa Clara County (County) to divide his 10-acre property in San Martin. Weis initially applied to divide his property into two lots, but later modified his application to seek a division into three parcels. Weis planned to keep one parcel, about three-and-a-half acres in size, on which he and his wife had a home. He planned to sell the other two parcels to two adjoining neighbors, one to the northwest and one to the northeast. At the time, the zoning permitted one-acre minimum lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>In early April 1970, Weis signed a contract with his neighbors to the northwest, John W. Pereira and Edwin A. Vargas (collectively, Pereira/Vargas). At that time, Pereira and Vargas, partners in the dairy business, each owned undivided interests in two adjoining parcels, which together comprised nearly 12 acres. One of their preexisting parcels was approximately 5.3 acres in size, while the other comprised about 6.3 acres. Only one of the two preexisting Pereira/Vargas parcels shared a boundary with Weis\u2019s property. The contract between Pereira/Vargas and Weis called for the purchase of about 3.9 acres of additional land.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Two weeks later, Weis signed a similar contract with his neighbor to the northeast, Frank B. Pacheco. Like Pereira and Vargas, Pacheco was a dairy farmer who then owned two adjoining parcels, one comprising 10 acres and the other three-quarters of an acre. Both of Pacheco\u2019s preexisting parcels shared a boundary with Weis\u2019s property. Pacheco\u2019s contract with Weis called for the sale of an estimated 2.8 acres of additional land. The contract further states: \u201cSeller to provide Buyer with record of survey and complete lot split procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Weis submitted his land division application as an exemption request. At the time of the application, a provision of the Santa Clara County Ordinance Code authorized the County\u2019s Land Development Committee (Committee) to exempt from local regulation certain land divisions involving four or fewer parcels. The ordinance set forth standards for the Committee\u2019s grant of both discretionary and mandatory exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">As part of his application for a land division, Weis submitted a plot plan showing his 10-acre property alone, divided into three parcels. The County stamped the plot plan \u201cTentative Map.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">On April 21, 1970, Weis appeared at a hearing before the Land Development Committee in connection with his application. Neither Pereira nor Vargas nor Pacheco knew of the hearing, and none of them attended. The Committee conditionally approved Weis\u2019s application at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several days later, the Committee formally confirmed its grant of the exemption request, subject to a survey of parcels and the recording of a parcel map.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">As part of the approval process, the tentative map was stamped \u201cConditionally approved by the Land Development Committee on April 21, 1970.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In contrast to the tentative map submitted by Weis, the conditionally approved tentative map includes \u201ctie-in marks\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014added in pencil\u2014connecting the parcels that Weis planned to sell with the existing properties owned by Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco. There was no direct evidence at trial of when the penciled tie-in marks were added or by whom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The 1970 Land Development Committee subdivision file contains a land development check sheet that includes this handwritten comment, dated April 21, 1970: \u201cParcel Map to include gross area of all 3 related parcels\u2014to Henke.\u201d Henke was an employee of Westfall Engineers, the survey firm hired by Weis to prepare the parcel map. Consistent with the County\u2019s apparent instruction, the parcel map prepared by Westfall Engineers included not only Weis\u2019s land, but also the land already belonging to Pereira/Vargas and to Pacheco, with new gross acreages appearing for each. As noted above, at the time the parcel map was prepared, Weis owned a single 10-acre parcel, which he proposed to divide into three; Pereira/Vargas owned two parcels totaling some 12 acres; and Pacheco owned two parcels totaling 10.75 acres. Nevertheless, only three numbered parcels appear on the parcel map: Parcel 1, which shows Weis\u2019s land as a single, smaller parcel; Parcel 2, which shows Pereira/Vargas\u2019s land as a single, larger parcel containing their two existing parcels plus the land they proposed to buy from Weis, all connected by tie-in marks; and Parcel 3, which similarly shows Pacheco\u2019s land as a single, larger parcel containing his two existing parcels plus the land he proposed to buy from Weis, all connected by tie-in marks. Apparently, none of the affected neighbors ever saw the parcel map either before its recordation or for many years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On June 17, 1970, the county surveyor certified the parcel map. On June 18, 1970, the parcel map was filed in the County\u2019s records, in Book 269 of Maps at page 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">On June 19, 1970, grant deeds were recorded for Weis\u2019s conveyances to Pereira/Vargas and to Pacheco. The deed to Pereira/Vargas contains a metes and bounds description of the portion of Weis\u2019s property that they purchased from him. The deed to Pacheco likewise contains a metes and bounds description of the property that he purchased from Weis, which it identifies as \u201cParcel One.\u201d In addition, the Pacheco deed identifies a \u201cParcel Two,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>described as a 30-foot wide easement for ingress and egress, apparently over the larger of the two parcels that Pacheco already owned. Neither the Pereira/Vargas deed nor the Pacheco deed contains any reference to the parcel map. Weis financed both sales, in each case taking a promissory note secured by a deed of trust encumbering the real property separately described in each grant deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The lots that Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco acquired from Weis each received a separate tax assessment and a separate assessor\u2019s parcel number. In addition, at least one of the two lots acquired in 1970 was the subject of a separate Williamson Act contract (an agreement with the county to restrict the property to agricultural use). Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco each fenced off their newly acquired land, using it for many years to pasture yearling cows.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Nearly three decades passed. During that time, both Weis and Pacheco died. Zoning for the area also changed, from one-acre to 20-acre minimum lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In 1999, appellant Richard van\u2019t Rood (van\u2019t Rood) entered a contract to purchase the Pacheco property. The property was marketed as two separate parcels, one being Pacheco\u2019s original 10.75 acres and the other being the two-plus acres acquired from Weis in 1970. After receiving a separate title report on each parcel, van\u2019t Rood surmised that the original 10.75-acre property itself might consist of two legal lots, thereby giving him a total of three separate parcels under contract. In late 1999, prior to completing the property purchase, van\u2019t Rood submitted a \u201cpre-application\u201d to the County for a lot line adjustment to alter the boundaries of the three legal lots he thought he was purchasing. Based on the information available at the pre-application meeting, it appeared that the Pacheco property consisted of three legal, nonconforming lots. Appellant then completed his purchase of the property. The grant deed from Pacheco\u2019s trust to van\u2019t Rood was recorded in December 1999; it describes three parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In January 2000, van\u2019t Rood formally applied for a three-lot lot line adjustment. In the course of evaluating the application, the County discovered the 1970 parcel map, which showed van\u2019t Rood\u2019s property as a single merged parcel. The County then informed van\u2019t Rood of its conclusion that he had only one parcel, not three. In the ensuing months, van\u2019t Rood sought to confirm that he had three parcels by applying to the County for certificates of compliance. He later withdrew that application when he became convinced that it was \u201cpointless\u201d to proceed in the face of the County.\u2019s insistence on the validity of the 1970 parcel map showing his parcels as merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">This legal action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">This proceeding was brought pursuant to provisions of the Subdivision Map Act that authorize landowners to petition to exclude their property from a subdivision map.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66499.21-66499.29.) The statute provides that the court \u201cmay\u201d grant such a petition if \u201cthe petitioners produce to the court satisfactory evidence of the necessity of the exclusion of the real property\u201d and \u201cthat there is no reasonable objection to making such exclusion.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Van\u2019t Rood and Pereira initiated this proceeding in June 2000, seeking exclusion from the 1970 parcel map or a declaration that the map was invalid. The County objected to the initial petition, partly on the procedural ground that it was not signed and verified by owners of at least two-thirds of the affected property interests as required by statute. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.22.) In August 2000, an amended petition was filed by van\u2019t Rood, Pereira, and Vargas (collectively, petitioners). The County then objected to the amended petition. Among its objections were these: that petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; that the petition was time barred; that the 1970 parcel map is valid; that petitioners had constructive notice of the 1970 parcel map; that the consent of petitioners or their predecessors to the 1970 parcel map was not required by the then-governing statute; that the issuance of title insurance on the separately described property purchased in 1970 is irrelevant to the number of parcels in the subdivision; and that the separate property tax assessment of the 1970 lots is also irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In May 2001, the trial court conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing on the petition, which consumed three court days. Among the witnesses were petitioners Pereira, Vargas, and van\u2019t Rood, as well as Susan Reggiardo (Pereira\u2019s daughter and Vargas\u2019s niece) and Nancy Pacheco Thompson (Pacheco\u2019s daughter). Various current and former County employees also testified, including Zachary Carter, planning department technician; Michael Lopez, planning department coordinator; Carolyn T. Walsh, principal planner; James F. Sirr, civil engineer; Martin Marcott, county surveyor; and Arthur J. Pi\u00f3n, a former employee of the County Planning Department. There was also expert testimony from attorney Robert Merritt, from surveyor Earl Cross, and from surveyor and engineer Warren McDowell. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court announced its decision denying the petition. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>court directed the County to prepare a statement of decision, which it did. Petitioners objected to the proposed statement of decision, a hearing was held, and the court directed petitioners\u2019 attorney to prepare a revised statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In July 2000, the court filed its statement of decision, approved as to form by counsel for both sides. The statement of decision recites the court\u2019s legal conclusions, including these: that Weis was the actual agent of Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco; that Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco authorized Weis to do whatever was reasonably necessary to obtain the County\u2019s approval so that they could acquire additional land from him; that petitioners\u2019 preexisting parcels were merged as a result of the 1970 parcel map; that there is no necessity to exclude the petitioners\u2019 property from the 1970 parcel map; and that the County\u2019s objections to exclusion are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In September 2000, the court entered its formal judgment denying the petition. Van\u2019t Rood then moved for a new trial, asserting that the judgment was unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law, and also urging surprise as a ground. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657.) The trial court denied the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">This timely appeal ensued, brought by van\u2019t Rood alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">At the outset, the County raises two appealability issues, though it does not frame them as such. The threshold issues are critical \u201csince the question of appealability goes to our jurisdiction .... [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Olson v. Cory </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 398 [197 Cal.Rptr. 843, 673 P.2d 720]; accord, <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074].) The County cites two separate grounds in support of its request that we \u201cdeny\u201d this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">First, the County asserts that van\u2019t Rood cannot prosecute this appeal independently of Pereira/Vargas, because he does not own two-thirds of the property to be excluded from the map.  Under the statute, participation by owners of two-thirds of the affected property is a requirement for initiating the exclusion proceeding. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.22.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But there is no suggestion in the statute that the participation requirement carries through to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>We therefore apply the usual rule of appellate standing, which provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved may appeal in the cases prescribed in this title.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902.) \u201cOne is considered, \u2018aggrieved\u2019 whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(County of Alameda v. Carleson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 737 [97 Cal.Rptr. 385, 488 P.2d 953].) As we have previously observed, appellate standing \u201cshould be \u2018liberally construed,\u2019 with \u2018any doubts resolved in favor of the right to appeal.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ajida Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roos Instruments, Inc. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 534, 540 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 686].) Under those standards, van\u2019t Rood clearly is an aggrieved party entitled to prosecute this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Second, the County urges that we \u201cdeny\u201d the appeal based on legislative changes at the local and state level occurring after trial. The County first cites the adoption of a local ordinance in February 2002, which rezoned \u201cmany parcels to bring them into conformity with the General Plan.\u201d One effect of the ordinance was to reduce the minimum lot size of van\u2019t Rood\u2019s property from 20 acres to five. The County also mentions state legislation, effective January 2002, which requires that lot line adjustments comply with the General Plan. According to the County, the legislation effectively precludes van\u2019t Rood from using the lot line adjustment process to obtain three parcels, since the five-acre zoning allows only two lots on his 13.4-acre property.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cExcept in rare cases where events subsequent to the ruling under review have rendered the case totally moot, we do not, and may not, consider subsequent events.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Jacobs </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 832, 835 [179 Cal.Rptr. 169].) A case is moot when the decision of the reviewing court \u201ccan have no practical impact or provide the parties effectual relief. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Woodward Park Homeowners Assn. v. Garreks, Inc. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 880, 888 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 268]. Accord, <em>In re Jessica K. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1315-1316 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 798].) Subsequent legislation can render a pending appeal moot. <em>(Equi </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 140, 141-142 [56 P.2d 590].) Here, however, the County concedes that the legislation does not \u201cautomatically\u201d moot van\u2019t Rood\u2019s appeal. Nevertheless, the County argues, \u201cthe recent legislation makes it possible for him to apply for a subdivision of his property into two parcels and also would make it illegal for him to obtain the lot line adjustment he was seeking to allow three lots . . . .\u201d Given these new opportunities and restrictions, the County asserts, van\u2019t Rood cannot now demonstrate the requisite necessity to exclude his property from the 1970 parcel map.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We disagree with the County\u2019s view.  In essence, the County contends that the later-enacted zoning ordinance gives van\u2019t Rood an alternative remedy to exclusion\u2014applying for a new subdivision of his property into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>two lots. But the existence of an alternative remedy does not preclude us from granting van\u2019t Rood effective relief with respect to the remedy he pursued in this proceeding. That being so, the appeal is not moot. <em>(Woodward Park Homeowners Assn. v. Garreks, Inc., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 888.) Furthermore, we question whether the subsequent legislation even applies to this controversy. As we have previously observed, \u201cthere is a long-standing and well-established presumption against the retroactive application of statutes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Petropoulos </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 161, 171 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 111].) Thus, \u201c \u2018in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary statutory enactments apply prospectively.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Furthermore, even in the face of a clear legislative signal, \u201cwe may not give a statute retroactive effect if doing so offends constitutional principles. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In short, we reject both of the County\u2019s asserted grounds for dismissal. We conclude that van\u2019t Rood\u2019s appeal should be heard on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">I. <em>Validity of the Parcel Map</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Van\u2019t Rood\u2019s principal attack on the validity of the map rests on his contention that parcel maps are conveyances. He argues that the 1970 map is invalid because it failed to comply with the law governing real estate conveyances. He further argues that the 1970 map is a \u201cwild\u201d conveyance outside the chain of title that failed to afford him constructive notice and that therefore does not bind him as a bona fide purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Van\u2019t Rood also challenges the map\u2019s validity on constitutional grounds, asserting that the involuntary merger of his separate parcels of land violates due process, because it constitutes a taking of his property without adequate notice or the opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">II. <em>Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Van\u2019t Rood contends that there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201coral agency.\u201d He further contends that the court\u2019s resolution of the case on the basis of agency constituted undue surprise, which required the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">III. <em>Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Ultimately, the question presented by this appeal is whether petitioners met the statutory requirements for exclusion from the 1970 parcel map by demonstrating both necessity and the lack of any reasonable objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We independently review the judgment to the extent it presents questions of law. The interpretation of statutes is a question of law. (See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Petropoulos, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 169.).  The interpretation of documents likewise presents a question of law in cases such as this one, where no conflicting extrinsic evidence has been admitted to explain an instrument\u2019s meaning. <em>(WYDA Associates </em>v. <em>Merner </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1710 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Agency is generally a question of fact. <em>(Brokaw v. Black-Foxe Military Institute </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 274, 278 [231 P.2d 816]; <em>Violette </em>v. <em>Shoup </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 611, 619 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 358].) Where conflicting evidence of agency is presented, we review the trial court\u2019s determinations for substantial evidence. <em>(Associated Creditors\u2019 Agency </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 374, 383 [118 Cal.Rptr. 772, 530 P.2d 1084].) Here, however, the facts are essentially undisputed, as the County\u2019s counsel acknowledged during his closing argument at trial. \u201cWhen the essential facts are not in conflict and the evidence is susceptible to a single inference, the agency determination is a matter of law for the court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Emery v. Visa Internal Service Assn. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 952, 960 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 25], See also, e.g., <em>Magnecomp Corp. </em>v. <em>Athene Co. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 526, 536 [257 Cal.Rptr. 278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">I. <em>Validity of the Parcel Map</em></p>\n<p id=\"Apl\">A. <em>The Map as a Conveyance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Much of van\u2019t Rood\u2019s attack on the 1970 parcel map relies on his argument that it constitutes an invalid conveyance. It has been said that a subdivision map \u201crecorded locally in the chain of title . . . partakes of the qualifications of a conveyance. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(John Taft Corp. v. Advisory Agency </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 749, 756 [207 Cal.Rptr. 840]; cf., <em>Stearns v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 162, 169 [95 Cal.Rptr. 682] [record of survey is not a conveyance]; see, Civ. Code, \u00a7 1215 [defining conveyance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">But as we explain below, our analysis of the map\u2019s validity does not depend on its characterization as a real estate conveyance. For that reason, we need not and do not decide whether parcel maps are subject to real estate conveyancing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>B. <em>Subdivision Map Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Instead, our assessment of the validity of the 1970 parcel map logically starts with the Subdivision Map Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66410-66499.37.) We begin by reviewing the Act\u2019s history, purposes, and significance. Next, we discuss the specific provisions of the Act\u2014both current and former\u2014that pertain to the questions presented here. We then apply those provisions to the undisputed facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">1. <em>History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The Subdivision Map Act has regulated the division of land in California since the nineteenth century. \u201cThe first Subdivision Map Act was enacted in 1893. Subsequent versions of the Act were enacted in 1907, 1929, 1937 and 1943. The modem latest version of the Act was enacted as part of the Government Code in 1974.\u201d (Longtin, Cal.

The Act therefore defines \u201csubdivision.\u201d It also provides a mechanism for determining the legality of a previously established subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The Act currently defines \u201csubdivision\u201d as \u201cthe division, by any subdivider, of any unit or units of improved or unimproved land, or any portion thereof, shown on the latest equalized county assessment roll as a unit or as contiguous units, for the purpose of sale, lease or financing, whether immediate or future.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66424.) \u201cSubdivision\u201d thus generally refers to a <em>division </em>of land for sale, lease, or financing. (Cf., <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>City of Mountain View </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 425, 432 [134 Cal.Rptr. 519] [consolidation of six parcels into a single, larger lot could constitute a subdivision of land, for purposes of imposing subdivision fees, given landowners\u2019 goal of increased density through consolidation].)  The Act\u2019s current definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d is not based on the number of parcels resulting from the land division; a division into as few as two parcels now constitutes a subdivision under the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Prior to 1974, by contrast, the statutory definition of a subdivision expressly applied only to divisions that resulted in five or more parcels. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7 11535, subd. (a), added by Stats. 1943, ch. 128, \u00a7 1, p. 867; <em>Stell v.

The prior Subdivision Map Act thus did not cover land divisions that created four or fewer parcels. <em>(Stell v. Jay Hales Development Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1224.) But those smaller divisions nevertheless were subject to regulation by local ordinance. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7 11540.1, as enacted by Stats. 1949, ch. 1100, \u00a7 1, p. 2001; <em>Stell </em>v. <em>Jay Hales Development Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In this case, under then current law, Weis\u2019s 1970 three-parcel land division was not subject to the Subdivision Map Act. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7 11535, subd. (a).) But it was subject to a local ordinance, Santa . Clara County Ordinance Code, former section 12.2.3. As noted above, that local provision allowed certain land divisions involving four or fewer parcels to be exempt from regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In order to be valid, a subdivision must be \u201cin compliance with or exempt from\u201d any applicable subdivision law or ordinance \u201cin effect at the time the subdivision was established.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.30, subd. (d).) A certificate of compliance establishes the validity of a prior land division. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.35; <em>Stell v. Jay Hales Development Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227; see also, e.g., <em>Lakeview Meadows Ranch v.

In this case, van\u2019t Rood submitted an application for a certificate of compliance, which he later withdrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">b. <em>Merger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u201cMerger refers to the combination of two lots in common ownership (9 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2001) Subdivisions, \u00a7 25:149, p. 367.) In this case, the trial court concluded that petitioners\u2019 preexisting parcels were merged as a result of the 1970 parcel map. In reaching that conclusion, the court relied on the tie-in marks shown on the map and on the fact that the map shows only three parcels.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To determine whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>court erred in concluding that the properties were merged, we first consider the Subdivision Map Act\u2019s merger provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Subdivision Map Act has contained express merger provisions since 1976. <em>(Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 752; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.10 et seq.) According to one commentator: \u201cThe subject of merger and anti-merger has had a tortuous history of successive statutes . . . .\u201d (9 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:149, p. 367.) Under the original 1976 merger provision, merger of substandard parcels was automatic. <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 755, discussing Gov. Code, former \u00a7 66424.2, Stats. 1976, ch. 928, \u00a7 4, p. 2120.) \u201cThe 1977 amendment replaced the provision for automatic merger with one authorizing local agencies to adopt the merger provisions by ordinance. The ordinance could also deem any automatically merged parcels to be unmerged. (Stats. 1977, ch. 234, \u00a7 5, p. 1034.) In 1980, all parcels merged by operation of law (under the 1976 statute) and not deemed merged by ordinance were automatically deemed unmerged. (Stats. 1980, ch. 402, \u00a7 2, p. 788; <em>id., </em>ch. 1217, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3, p. 4127.)\u201d <em>(Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 755.) The current merger provisions were enacted in 1983 and amended over the next three years. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The legislation enacted in the 1980\u2019s operated to \u201cclarify and \u2018unmerge\u2019 contiguous parcels where local agencies had not elected to pursue the notice and hearing option previously provided by the Act.\u201d <em>(Stell v. Jay Hales Development Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The Act\u2019s current merger provisions \u201cappear to reflect two overall concerns. First, they provide landowners with elaborate procedural safeguards of notice and opportunity to be heard before their lots can be involuntarily merged.\u201d <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 752.) Second, they reveal \u201ca <em>state concern over local regulation of parcel merger for purposes of </em>development\u201d as well as for purposes of sale, lease, or financing. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\n<em>Automatic Merger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Under the Act\u2019s merger provisions, \u201ccontiguous parcels of land are not automatically merged by virtue of being held by the same owner.\u201d <em>(Morehart v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 731; accord, <em>Lakeview Meadows Ranch v. County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 600; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.10.) Prior to the Legislature\u2019s first adoption of merger provisions in 1976, there was no statutory authority for merger by operation of law through common ownership. <em>(Stell v. Jay Hales Development Co., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1224-1225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\n<em>Involuntary Merger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The \u201cconcept of the involuntary merger of contiguous parcels in common ownership . . . originated with a 1973 opinion of the California Attorney General (56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 509 (1973)) . . . .\u201d <em>(Gomes v. County of Mendocino, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 987-988, fn. omitted.) The Attorney General\u2019s opinion in turn relied on a decision of the California Supreme Court, <em>Hill </em>v. <em>City of Manhattan Beach </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 279 [98 Cal.Rptr. 785, 491 P.2d 369]. <em>(Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 753.) The Legislature responded to those authorities by enacting and later amending various parcel merger provisions. <em>(Gomes v. County of Mendocino, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 988.) \u201cAll of that legislation begins with a general negation of automatic parcel merger by virtue of common ownership, followed by a delineation of particular circumstances and conditions under which merger <em>will </em>take place.\u201d <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Act now provides a mechanism for involuntary mergers, which may be initiated by local governments under specified circumstances. For example, one provision permits the involuntary merger of parcels that were created in violation of subdivision laws and ordinances applicable at the time of their creation. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.11, subd. (b)(2); <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 761.) Another provision permits local governments to compel involuntary mergers under specified circumstances when at least one of the parcels is substandard under the local zoning ordinance. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.11, subd. (a); <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Such involuntary mergers may be accomplished \u201conly in accordance with the authority and procedures\u201d prescribed in the Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.10, subd. (b).) \u201cUnder the Act, a merger of parcels is initiated by recorded notice to the owner of an intention to determine status.\u201d <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 757; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.12.) In addition to notice, another key safeguard under the statute is the opportunity to be heard. <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 757; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 66451.14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\n<em>Voluntary Merger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Of course, a landowner may seek to voluntarily merge its parcels. (See, e.g., <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 751.) According to County, the merger effected by the 1970 parcel map was a voluntary one, initiated and accomplished by Weis on behalf of himself and his neighbors. For his part, van\u2019t Rood complains that the affected neighbors did not consent to the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">To the extent a landowner\u2019s voluntary merger application affects other property owners, their acknowledgement and consent is required. In the current version of the Subdivision Map Act, the consent requirement applies both to final maps and to parcel maps. According to the statute: \u201cNo final map or parcel map required by this chapter or local ordinance which creates a subdivision shall be filed with the local agency without the written consent of all parties having any record title interest in the real property proposed to be subdivided, except as otherwise provided in this division.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66430.) This is the County\u2019s current local practice as well, according to testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In 1970, however, the consent requirement applied only to final maps. According to the statute then in place: \u201cA certificate, signed and acknowledged by all parties having any record title interest in the land subdivided, consenting to the preparation and recordation of the final map is required.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7 11589, added by Stats. 1943, ch. 128, \u00a7 1, p. 872; see also, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7 11625, added by Stats. 1943, ch. 128, \u00a7 1, p. 876 [requiring the subdivider to present evidence of consent as a prerequisite to recording final map].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The County\u2019s position is that the 1970 parcel map is valid because it complied with the then current statutory requirements for consent. But as the County acknowledges, even absent statutory compulsion, there are constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">C. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">\u201cDue process principles require reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before governmental deprivation of a significant property interest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Horn v. County of Ventura </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612 [156 Cal.Rptr. 718, 596 P.2d 1134].) These requirements \u201care not rooted in statute but are compelled by the stronger force of constitutional principle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 616.) Thus, \u201ceven though notice and hearing requirements for parcel maps are not specifically set forth in the Map Act, such constitutional prerequisites must be followed. [Citation.]\u201d (Curtin &amp; Merritt, Subdivision Map Act Manual, <em>supra, </em>p. 69, citing <em>Horn v.

Thus, \u201cwhenever approval of a tentative subdivision map will constitute a substantial or significant deprivation of the property rights of other landowners, the affected persons are entitled to a reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before the approval occurs.\u201d <em>(Horn v. County of Ventura, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">According to the County, \u201cWeis had ample procedural due process in the parcel map process\u201d and \u201cthe constitutionally sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard provided to Weis was imputed as a matter of law to [Pereira/Vargas] and Pacheco.\u201d That is so, the County asserts, because \u201c[Pereira/Vargas] and Pacheco gave \u2018actual authority\u2019 to Weis as their agent to take whatever steps were necessary to complete the County\u2019s land division procedure, including filing the parcel map.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">To evaluate that assertion, we consider whether the record supports the trial court\u2019s agency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">II. <em>Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">We begin by setting forth the relevant principles of agency law.

Where the agreement to create an agency is express, it \u201cmay be oral, except where the agency is to enter into a contract required by law to be in writing, in which case the authorization must be in writing under the \u2018equal dignities rule.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (2 Witkin, Summary of Cal.

(Civ. Code, \u00a7 2316.) Ostensible authority is such as a principal, intentionally or by want of ordinary care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2317.) An agent will normally have the authority to do everything necessary or proper and usual in the ordinary course of business for effecting the purpose of his agency. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2319.) Authority may be granted to an agent either by a precedent authorization or a subsequent ratification. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2307.)\u201d <em>(Ripani v.

A principal cannot be held when an actual agent acts beyond the scope of his actual or ostensible authority. <em>(Ernst v. Searle, supra, </em>218 Cal. at p. 238; cf., <em>Chartered Bank of London </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 755, 763 [171 Cal.Rptr. 748] [purported agent had no actual or ostensible authority to sell boat until purchase price was paid]; see generally, 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal.

With respect to the scope of Weis\u2019s authority, the court concluded that Weis had authority from Pereira/Vargas and from Pacheco to do whatever was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to obtain the County\u2019s approval so that they could purchase additional land from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">2. <em>Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The evidence of Weis\u2019s relationship with each of his neighbors is different. For that reason, we separately examine the evidence of agency and authority as it relates to each neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">a. <em>Pacheco</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The only evidence of an agency relationship between Weis and Pacheco is in their 1970 real estate sales contract, which provides that Weis is \u201cto . . . complete lot split procedure.\u201d With Weis and Pacheco both dead, there was no testimony at trial concerning any oral communications between them. And apart from the contract itself, there is no evidence of any conduct by Pacheco indicating that he conferred any authority on Weis to deal with his property. The written contract thus stands alone as the only evidence of the existence and scope of any agency relationship between Weis and Pacheco.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">For purposes of our analysis here, we assume (without deciding) that the parties\u2019 agreement that Weis would \u201ccomplete [the] lot split procedure\u201d created an actual agency, and we turn to the question of the scope of Weis\u2019s authority. We interpret the express authority granted by the parties\u2019 1970 agreement by resort to the usual rules for contract interpretation. (2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Agency &amp; Employment, \u00a7 79, p. 81.) Because no conflicting extrinsic evidence was admitted to explain the contract\u2019s meaning, its interpretation presents a question of law for our independent review. <em>(WYDA Associates </em>v. <em>Merner, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">First, we discern no factual basis for finding actual authority. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 2316 [\u201cActual authority is such as a principal intentionally confers upon the agent, or intentionally, or by want of ordinary care, allows the agent to believe himself to possess\u201d].)  In our view, nothing in the 1970 contract provision directing Weis to complete the \u201clot split procedure\u201d can be construed as a grant of authority to effect a merger of Pacheco\u2019s preexisting parcels or to deal with those properties in any other fashion. (See <em>Ernst v. Searle, supra, </em>218 Cal. at p. 240 [real estate agent, who had actual authority to negotiate a property exchange, did not have actual authority to convey the property]; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Mazel </em>(1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 769, 773 [187 P.2d 98] [real estate agent, who had \u201cexclusive right to sell\u201d property, did not have actual authority to enter binding contract for sale].) Moreover, we find nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>that provision that would warrant Weis in believing he had such authority. (See <em>Mannion </em>v. <em>Campbell Soup Co. </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 317, 323 [52 Cal.Rptr. 246].) In short, there is no evidence of'actual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Second, we find no proof of ostensible authority. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 2317 [\u201cOstensible authority is such as a principal, intentionally or by want of ordinary care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess\u201d].) There is no evidence of conduct on Pacheco\u2019s part that would justify a belief on the County\u2019s part that Weis was authorized to merge or otherwise affect Pacheco\u2019s preexisting property. (See <em>Ernst v. Searle, supra, </em>218 Cal. at p. 240 [real estate agent, who had actual authority to negotiate a property exchange, did not have ostensible authority to convey the property].)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In sum, even assuming an actual agency relationship between Weis and Pacheco, there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Weis\u2019s authority extended to land that Pacheco already owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">b. <em>PereiraA/'argas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Unlike the Pacheco contract, Weis\u2019s 1970 real estate sales contract with Pereira/Vargas did not expressly provide that he would complete the lot split. Thus, there is no documentary evidence of an actual agency relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The only proof of actual agency was the trial testimony of both Pereira and Vargas concerning oral communications between Weis and them. Vargas testified only to his understanding that Weis \u201cwould take care of the paperwork\u201d for the land division.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pereira testified that he never had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>conversation with Weis about his dealings with the County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nothing in the testimony of Pereira or Vargas suggests either that they assented to representation by Weis or that they had any right to control his activities with the County.  Both assent and control are necessary predicates to establishing an actual agency relationship. <em>(Edwards v. Freeman, supra, </em>34 Cal.2d at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In short, there is no evidence in the record to support a finding of actual agency between Weis and Pereira/Vargas.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Weis lacked the authority to deal with land that Pacheco and Pereira/Vargas already owned. He thus lacked authority to bind them to the merger of their properties apparently effected by the 1970 parcel map.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Given Weis\u2019s lack of authority, the 1970 parcel map is not valid as voluntary merger. As explained above, the map likewise is not valid as an involuntary merger, because Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco were not afforded constitutionally required procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">IH. <em>Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">That brings us to the ultimate question to be resolved, whether petitioners met the statutory requirements for exclusion of their property from the 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>map. Those requirements are that \u201cthe petitioners produce to the court satisfactory evidence of the necessity of the exclusion of the real property\u201d and \u201cthat there is no reasonable objection to making such exclusion.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.25.) In this case, the trial court concluded that petitioners failed to meet either prong of the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">A. <em>Necessity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The court found no necessity to exclude, observing: \u201cPetitioners have valid title to the property they purchased, and enjoy property ownership which is consistent with the legally filed and recorded 1970 parcel map.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We disagree. First, petitioners have asserted an impairment of their property rights. While it is true that they have title to the property they purchased in 1970, the parcel map stripped petitioners of the benefits of owning that land as a separate parcel; it also merged their preexisting properties, with the same effect\u2014loss of potential development rights. (See, e.g., <em>Nollan </em>v. <em>California Coastal Comm\u2019n </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 825, 833, fn. 2 [97 L.Ed.2d 677, 107 S.Ct. 3141] [right to develop property, subject to legitimate permitting requirements]; cf., <em>HFH, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 508, 514, 518 [125 Cal.Rptr. 365, 542 P.2d 237] [recognizing potential diminution in value as a result of zoning, but rejecting argument that it constitutes an impermissible taking].) Second, the 1970 parcel is not valid. The map cannot legally effect either a voluntary merger (because of the lack of Weis\u2019s authority to bind his neighbors) or an involuntary merger (because of the lack of due process). Petitioners apparently have no other remedy for releasing their property from the operation of the invalid map, which has impaired their property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">We conclude that petitioners have demonstrated the requisite necessity for exclusion from the map.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">B. <em>No Reasonable Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The trial court found the County\u2019s objections to exclusion reasonable, \u201cbecause granting the petition for exclusion would be in violation of the current zoning regulations and in violation of the 1970 parcel map.\u201d The court also cited the County\u2019s general authority to control orderly development, adding: \u201cTo rule in favor of petitioners would be disruptive of the entirety of the zoning plan that the community has enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Again, we disagree.  First, the fact that granting the petition for exclusion would violate the 1970 parcel map is not a reasonable basis for objection, given our determination that the map is invalid to the extent it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>purports to merge petitioners\u2019 properties. We also observe that whenever relief is granted under this statute, it necessarily will be \u201cin violation\u201d of the map from which exclusion is sought. Second, as to the zoning issue, we acknowledge that orderly community development is an important goal of the Subdivision Map Act. (See, e.g., Curtin &amp; Merritt, Subdivision Map Act Manual, <em>supra, </em>p. 1.) But the protection of individual real estate buyers, such as petitioners, is another important statutory goal. <em>(Ibid.) </em> More importantly, the impact on zoning and community development must be measured against the ordinances, standards, and policies in effect at time of the land division, rather than against current regulations and standards. (Cf., Gov. Code, \u00a7 66474.2, subd. (a) [only existing policies apply to tentative map approvals]; <em>Bright Development v. City of Tracy </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 783, 800 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 618] [city could not apply policy that was not in effect at the time tentative map application was deemed complete]; <em>Robertson v. Nichols </em>(1949) 92 Cal.App.2d 201, 205 [206 P.2d 898] [validity of restrictions assessed in light of conditions at the time they were imposed].) The zoning at the time of the 1970 land division was one-acre minimum. Changes in zoning since that time do not constitute a reasonable basis for objection to exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Under the circumstances presented here, and on this record, there is no reasonable objection to exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The 1970 parcel is invalid to the extent it purports to merge properties belonging to petitioners. The map cannot legally effect a voluntary merger, because Weis lacked authority to bind his neighbors. It cannot legally effect an involuntary merger, because of the lack of due process afforded Pereira/Vargas and Pacheco.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Given the map\u2019s invalidity and the other circumstances of this case, this record demonstrates both the requisite necessity for exclusion from the map and the lack of any reasonable objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">We reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to grant the petition to exclude the petitioners\u2019 properties from the 1970 parcel map. This decision applies to Pereira and Vargas as well as van\u2019t Rood, notwithstanding the fact that they did not join in appealing the judgment. <em>(Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 841 [122 Cal. Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874].) Appellant, van\u2019t Rood, shall have his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Premo, Acting P.

Weis indicated that he was selling the northwesterly portion of his land to the northwesterly owner and the northeasterly portion of his land to the northeasterly owner and was retaining a three acre site containing his home. All departments made recommendations. The application for exemption was conditionally approved on a motion by Bristow, seconded by Roetttger. The vote: 5 Ayes, 0 Noes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> The marks, in the shape of an elongated Z, also were referred to at times during trial as \u201ccrow\u2019s feet\u201d or \u201chooked lines.\u201d According to two expert trial witnesses, attorney Robert Merritt and surveyor Earl Cross, the marks signify common property ownership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> One witness, James Sirr, a longtime county employee, answered affirmatively when asked if that was \u201csomething that would have been done at the Land Development Committee.\u201d Another witness, Arthur Pi\u00f3n, a longtime former county employee, testified concerning similar tie-in marks shown on another copy of the map, saying: \u201cMore than likely, they would have been put there by Engineering Services [county] staff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> Apparently, exclusion proceedings are rare. (See Curtin &amp; Merritt, Cal. Subdivision Map Act and the Development Process (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2003) \u00a7 12.10, p. 325 [exclusion procedure \u201cis rarely used\u201d].) The witnesses in this matter included planning professionals with many decades of collective experience, yet only one of them had ever encountered such a petition previously\u2014and then only once. Nor have we found any published cases interpreting any of the provisions that govern the exclusion proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> That provision reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cA proceeding for exclusion shall be initiated by filing a petition therefor in the offices of the county surveyor and clerk of the board of supervisors of the county in which the subdivision or the portion thereof sought to be excluded is situated. . . . The petition shall be signed and verified by the owners of at least two-thirds of the total area of the real property sought to be excluded.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66499.22.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> Although the statutory definition no longer distinguishes between subdivisions based on their size, other provisions of the Map Act do. Among other things, as a general rule, \u201ca subdivision of five or more parcels requires a tentative and a final map; a subdivision of four or fewer requires just a parcel map.\u201d (Curtin &amp; Merritt, Subdivision Map Act Manual, <em>supra, </em>p.5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> According to some of the witnesses in this case, the tie-in marks signify only common ownership. For example, attorney Robert Merritt testified that such marks on subdivision and parcel maps generally mean that \u201cthe parcels are in common ownership.\u201d Surveyor and engineer Warren McDowell testified that \u201ca hook would be used ... to show the [existing] ownership.\u201d And surveyor Earl Cross testified \u201cthat, in the surveying and engineering world,\u201d tie-in marks are \u201cdrafting symbols that show common ownership.\u201d Cross added that \u201cthey don\u2019t serve any purpose as to the result of the parcel map itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaV2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>But other witnesses testified that the tie-in marks demonstrate merger, when taken in the context of the parcel map. According to County planning department employee Zachary Carter: \u201cThe Subdivision Map Act says there must be intent to merge. And with the crow\u2019s feet and the total acreage and the total area called as parcel two, I would have to say that would then be intent to merge.\u201d And former County planning department employee Arthur Pion testified: \u201cThose we consider tie lines. And what the message is that the adjoiners are to be a part of the parcels that are shown. And so they tie, well, the adjoining parcels, and leave a message that was really what the final map was to look like.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\"> As the trial court explained in its statement of decision: \u201cThe court finds that WEIS was the actual agent of PACHECO and [PEREIRA/]VARGAS and that PACHECO and [PEREIRA/]VARGAS authorized WEIS to do what was reasonably necessary to obtain approval from the COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA to be able to convey the respective parcels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to them to increase their pasture land. Therefore, knowledge of the 1970 parcel map is imputed to PACHECO and [PEREIRA/]VARGAS as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The trial court previously made a tentative determination of ostensible agency, which it apparently abandoned after objection by van\u2019t Rood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> Vargas testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">\u201cQ: Did you enter into a contract to purchase this parcel, the three and a half acres, from Mr. Weis?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">\u201cA. Yes, we did.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Weis inform you that he was processing some sort of approval through the County of Santa Clara for that lot?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">\u201cA. Said he would take care of the paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">\u201cQ. Now, let me go back over that. Is that a quote that you just gave us, that he would take care of the paperwork?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">\u201cA. Well, we assumed he would take care of the paperwork.

Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\u201cQ. When you bought the property from Mr. Weis in 1970, it\u2019s accurate that you never had a discussion about whether it was going to be separate property or combined property specifically at the time; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">\u201cA. We were buying it as a separate parcel. I mean, no, there was never any discussion as far as combining or anything, no.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b468-14\"> Pereira testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">\u201cQ: Mr. Pereira, when you agreed to buy the property, did you talk to Mr. Weis at all about going down to the county with him to do whatever was necessary to effect the property division?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">\u201cA: I don\u2019t think we ever had a conversation about going to the county for anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">\u201cQ: Did Mr. Weis ever mention to you that he was going down there to accomplish the land division that he needed to do to sell you the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">\u201cA: Never did talk about anything like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-19\">\u201cQ: Was it your assumption that he would do whatever was necessary to sell off the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">\u201cA. Just took it for granted everything was fine. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">\u201cQ. And did you trust Mr. Weis to do whatever was necessary to carry out the property transaction?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">\u201cA. I always though he was a real honest man.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b468-23\"> Because we conclude that the evidence does not support a finding of agency, we need not and do not reach the question of whether any such agency would require a writing under the \u201c \u2018equal dignities rule.\u2019 \u201d (Cf., <em>Clifton Cattle Co. v.
