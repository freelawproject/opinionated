Code, \u00a7\u00a7 366.26, 395.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant contends the juvenile court erroneously denied him a contested 366.26 hearing. He also contends he was prejudiced by the juvenile court\u2019s failure to follow the statutory procedures for determining paternity. Appellant is mistaken. His right to assert a position regarding his paternal status did not entitle him to a contested 366.26 hearing. And because the minor\u2019s paternity had already been established by a voluntary declaration of paternity, the court did not have to give appellant the notice and form provided for in section 316.2. We will affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A dependency petition was filed in February 2002 concerning the newborn minor, alleging that the minor tested positive for \u201cTHC/marijuana\u201d at birth, the mother had tested positive for cocaine during her pregnancy, and the mother had failed to reunify with five other children as a result of her substance abuse. The mother named Roger D. as the minor\u2019s father, and he was named as such in the petition. Roger D. informed the social worker that he was present at the minor\u2019s birth and had signed a declaration of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Shortly after the detention hearing, appellant informed the social worker that he was possibly the minor\u2019s father. According to appellant, \u201che had . . . sexual relations with the mother on two occasions,\u201d and he \u201cfound out about the baby in September.\u201d Regarding the allegations in the petition, appellant made the following statements: \u201c T think that kid needs to be placed somewhere. I can\u2019t really comment on that. . . . I\u2019m in a big old mess. . . . [][] ... I feel that she should have never had no kids. If she wasn\u2019t able to take care of them [ric]. I\u2019m not knowing what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m really here because her mother said go get my son.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Appellant appeared at the next court hearing in the matter. The juvenile court directed that appellant and Roger D. be provided \u201cwith packets to assist them in establishing paternity.\u201d The matter was continued approximately one week for a pretrial hearing, with a jurisdictional hearing scheduled one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">By the next hearing, a declaration of paternity, which was executed the day after the minor\u2019s birth, had been filed with the juvenile court. Based thereon, the court found Roger D. to be the minor\u2019s presumed father. Appellant was not present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The jurisdictional hearing was continued numerous times. In July 2002, the juvenile court sustained the petition. A contested dispositional hearing occurred in August and September 2002, at which the juvenile court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>reunification services and set a hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for the minor pursuant to section 366.26. Appellant did not appear at any of these hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The minor was placed with two siblings in a prospective adoptive home, and the social worker opined that the likelihood of adoption was \u201cexcellent\u201d if parental rights were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In November 2002, appellant filed a petition for modification requesting an order for paternity testing and, if he was determined to be the father, that the minor be placed with him. (\u00a7 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The hearing on appellant\u2019s petition for modification was set on the same date as the section 366.26 hearing. At the hearing, the juvenile court denied appellant an evidentiary hearing on his petition. The court noted that the issue of paternity had been raised 10 months earlier and was resolved by the declaration of paternity signed by the mother and Roger D.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The juvenile court then proceeded to the section 366.26 hearing. The court noted appellant\u2019s objection to the termination of his parental rights and found that, although appellant had a right to notice and to attend the hearing, he was not entitled to a contested hearing. Finding the minor was likely to be adopted, the juvenile court terminated parental rights and ordered a permanent plan of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Appellant claims his due process rights were violated when the juvenile court denied his request for a contested section 366.26 hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">\u201cThe extent to which a father may participate in dependency proceedings and his rights in those proceedings are dependent on his paternal status.\u201d <em>(In re Paul H. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 753, 760 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 1], italics omitted.) \u201cAn alleged biological father in dependency proceedings is a man who may be the father of a child, but whose biological paternity has not been established.\u201d <em>(In re Joseph G. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 712, 715 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 915].) \u201cAlleged fathers have less rights in dependency proceedings than biological and presumed fathers. [Citation.] An alleged father does not have a current interest in a child because his paternity has not yet been established. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re O. S. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1406 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 571].) Thus, for example, \u201can alleged father is not entitled to appointed counsel or reunification services. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Paul H., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>supra, </em>111 Cal.App. 4th at p. 760.) Due process for an alleged father requires only that he \u201cbe given notice and \u2018an opportunity to appear and assert a position and attempt to change his paternity status. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Appellant\u2019s right to assert a position did not entitle him to a contested section 366.26 hearing. Unless and until appellant was able to elevate his status to that of a biological or presumed father, the only issues on which he was entitled to assert a position concerned his paternal status and his intent and desires regarding the minor if his paternal status became more than just a potentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">However, \u201cthe sole purpose of the section 366.26 hearing is to select and implement one of the listed permanent plans.\u201d <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 304 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) As an alleged father, appellant did \u201cnot have a current interest\u201d in the issues that were before the juvenile court at that hearing\u2014whether the minor was adoptable and whether any exceptions to adoption applied. <em>(In re O. S., supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1406.) Neither reunification nor paternity is an issue before the juvenile court at the section 366.26 hearing. <em>(In re Marilyn H., supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 304; <em>In re Ninfa S. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 808, 811 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Appellant claims he had \u201cfundamental liberty interests ... at stake\u201d at the hearing, implicating his due process rights. However, even a <em>biological </em>father\u2019s \u201cdesire to establish a personal relationship with a child, without more, is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.\u201d <em>(In re Kiana A. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1114 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 669].) \u201c \u2018Parental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child. They require relationships more enduring.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lehr v. Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248, 260 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 103 S.Ct. 2985], italics omitted.) Even less compelling is the liberty interest of an <em>alleged </em>father who has made no effort to establish a relationship with the subject child.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In support of his contention, appellant cites cases involving the denial of a contested hearing to the mother <em>(In re Stacy T </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1415 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 319]; <em>In re Tamika T. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1114 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 873]) or to a father whose paternity was not disputed <em>(In re Dolly D. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 440 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 691]; <em>In re Nemis M. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1344 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 324]; <em>In re Jeanette V. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 811 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 534]). Needless to say, the due process rights of parents whose connection to a child has been established are distinguishable from those of an individual whose connection remains only a possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Appellant also complains he was entitled to receive the social worker\u2019s section 366.26 report 10 days before the hearing and that, because he did not receive the report in a timely fashion, he was unable to prepare to cross-examine the social worker. Appellant was provided a copy of the report at the section 366.26 hearing. After receiving the report, appellant did not object to the lack of timeliness, thereby waiving the issue. (See <em>In re Christopher B. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 551, 558 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 43].) Furthermore, our conclusion that appellant was not entitled to a contested hearing leads to the related conclusion that he was not prejudiced by his inability to prepare to cross-examine the social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Next, appellant claims the juvenile court failed to comply with the statutory procedures for determining paternity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention rests on the provisions of section 316.2. Subdivision (a) of that section requires the juvenile court to conduct an inquiry \u201cas to the identity and address of all presumed or alleged fathers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>juvenile court\u2019s duty in this regard arises only <em>\u201cif [parentage </em>has] <em>not otherwise [been\\ </em>determined.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413(a), italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>A voluntary declaration of paternity \u201cshall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of paternity by a court.\u201d (Rule 1413(c); Fam. Code, \u00a7 7573.) In addition to other requirements, a voluntary declaration must contain a statement by the mother that the man signing the declaration is the only possible father, as well as a statement by the father that he is the biological father. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7574, subd. (b)(5), (6).) A voluntary declaration of paternity entitles the man who signs it to presumed father status. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The voluntary declaration of paternity executed by Roger D. and the minor\u2019s mother contained the statutorily required statements concerning Roger D.\u2019s biological paternity. Thus, the issue of the minor\u2019s paternity was resolved by the declaration before appellant appeared at the jurisdiction hearing. Based on that declaration, the juvenile court declared Roger D. to be the minor\u2019s presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Nonetheless, appellant claims that, under subdivision (b) of section 316.2, the juvenile court was required to serve him, as an alleged father, with Judicial Council form JV-505, which would have allowed him to compel the court to determine whether he was the minor\u2019s biological father. (Rule 1413(h).) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The words of a statute must be read \u201c \u2018 \u201cin context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute . . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(People v. Hammer </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 756, 763 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 590, 69 P.3d 436].)  Rule 1413(a) clarifies that the juvenile court has a duty to determine parentage only if it has not otherwise been determined. As the issue of paternity had already been resolved by the voluntary declaration of paternity, the need to further pursue the issue through the procedures outlined in section 316.2 was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Our analysis of section 316.2 is consistent with the statutory scheme in the Family Code concerning the effect of a voluntary declaration of paternity. A voluntary declaration of paternity may be rescinded by either parent within 60 days of the date of execution (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7575, subd. (a)); it also may be set aside based on genetic testing. However, with limited exceptions not applicable here, a motion for testing may be brought only by a child support agency, the child\u2019s mother, or the man who signed the voluntary declaration. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7575, subd. (b).) Only if the child\u2019s mother consents to the relinquishment of the child for adoption can an alleged father bring an action to declare himself the natural father of a child who has a presumed father. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7631.) There is no other statutory provision permitting an alleged father to request genetic testing to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Appellant cites <em>In re Paul H, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th 753, in which this court remanded a matter to the juvenile court because the record failed to reflect that an alleged father had been given the opportunity afforded by section 316.2 to request court-ordered paternity testing. However, that case did not involve a competing interest in the child by another man who had been declared to be the child\u2019s presumed father and whose paternity had been established by a voluntary declaration of paternity. Consequently, appellant\u2019s reliance on that case is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the provisions of section 316.2 for inquiring about paternity and providing notice to alleged fathers did not apply after paternity was established by the valid execution of a voluntary declaration of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s order is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKo\">Sims, Acting P.
