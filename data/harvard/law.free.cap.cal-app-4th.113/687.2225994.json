Although the complaint is long, with numerous allegations, dozens of paragraphs, and more than 100 plaintiffs, the gist of the complaint is the following: Accountants BDO Seidman, LLP, and Logan, Throop &amp; Company intentionally or negligently overstated their client\u2019s assets in financial statements they prepared. Appellants relied on those financial statements when they invested in the accountants\u2019 client and in another company in the process of merging with the client, and relied on those statements in approving the merger. Appellants lost their investments when the merged company went bankrupt, and the company\u2019s assets were revealed as grossly overstated. Because the foregoing tells, if true, a story of accounting misfeasance, with few exceptions the court erred in dismissing the complaint at the pleading stage. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Because this is an appeal from a sustained dem\u00fcrrer, we rely on the facts alleged in appellants\u2019 complaint without judging their veracity. In November 1995, respondent accounting firm Logan, Throop &amp; Company (Logan) prepared a financial statement for World Interactive Networks, Inc. (WIN), a non-publicly-traded corporation, for the period ending in August 1995. The statement misrepresented the value of various WIN assets, claiming they were worth $145 million when in fact they amounted to only $30 million. Logan also claimed the financial statement complied with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) when it did not. In February 1996, Logan repeated essentially the same misrepresentations in its auditors\u2019 report of WIN\u2019s 1995 balance sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The same month that Logan released its auditors\u2019 report, respondent accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP (Seidman), issued WIN\u2019s audited financial statement for 1995. In the statement, Seidman misrepresented the value of WIN\u2019s assets, claiming they were worth slightly more than $121 million, when they were truly worth only $6.9 million. In addition, Seidman misrepresented WIN\u2019s shareholder equity as $88 million, when the company was worthless. Several months later, Seidman repeated essentially the same misrepresentations when it released its review of WIN\u2019s quarterly balance sheet for the period ending March 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Strothers Industries', Inc. (Strothers), was a publicly traded corporation. In 1995, WIN and Strothers agreed to a reverse merger, subject to shareholder approval, in which WIN would sell its assets to Strothers in return for Strothers stock, following which Strothers would become WIN\u2019s subsidiary. While the proposed merger was pending, Seidman prepared a pro forma financial statement of Strothers and WIN as a combined entity, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>substantially repeated, from Seidman\u2019s earlier audit of WIN, the same false asset values and misrepresentations about complying with GAAP. In January 1997, Seidman sent the pro forma statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC told Strothers the pro forma statement did not comply with GAAP because it did not properly account for the inherent uncertainty of the proposed merger. Seidman did not tell appellants, all of whom either owned or later bought WIN or Strothers stock, about the SEC\u2019s rejection of Seidman\u2019s accounting for the proposed merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In March 1998, WIN and Strothers filed for bankruptcy, and appellants, who allege they relied on Seidman\u2019s and Logan\u2019s financial statements to buy stock in the companies, lost their investments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, appellants sued both accounting firms, alleging causes of action for negligent and intentional misrepresentation. In addition, appellants alleged a cause of action for violation of California Corporations Code section 25400, subdivision (d), which outlaws assisting the sale of a security by false or misleading statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Respondents demurred to the complaint four times on multiple grounds. The trial court sustained each demurrer with leave to amend. Eventually, appellants filed a corrected fifth amended complaint, the broad outlines of which we have already described, leaving its particulars to our discussion below. Respondents demurred to the fifth amended complaint (hereafter the complaint) on several grounds, arguing it failed for a number of reasons to state a cause of action and pleaded fraud with insufficient detail. The court adopted respondents\u2019 arguments and sustained both demurrers without leave to amend. Its minute order added that \u201cThe complaint remains scrambled . . . and lacks essential information, i.e., Who said what to whom? When? What was the reliance?\u201d The court entered judgment for respondents. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">\u201c \u2018We treat [a] demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the [appellant].\u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">I. <em>Fraud Pleaded with Sufficient Detail</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Respondents correctly note that plaintiffs who allege fraud must plead their allegations with more detail than other causes of action. \u201cIn California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations.] \u2018Thus \u201c \u2018the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not ordinarily be invoked . . . .\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] [][] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading <em>facts </em>which \u201cshow how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Lazar v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981], quoting <em>Stansfield </em>v. <em>Starkey </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73 [269 Cal.Rptr. 337].) Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges respondents prepared fraudulent financial statements that intentionally overstated the value of WIN\u2019s assets and deliberately misstated that those values complied with GAAP. According to respondents, the allegations are not specific enough. (See <em>Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams &amp; Russell </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1331 [231 Cal.Rptr. 355].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our review of the complaint convinces us otherwise. Appellants allege Seidman\u2019s audited 1995 financial statement for WIN falsely stated it complied with GAAP, when it did not. The complaint also alleges the statement valued WIN\u2019s assets at $121,274,018, when the assets were worth only $6,951,667. Contributing particularly to WIN\u2019s inflated asset value were the following misrepresentations:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\u2014Seidman valued WIN\u2019s broadcast licenses as worth $79,048,589, when they were actually worth less than $1 million under GAAP unless, and until, WIN and Struthers successfully merged and Struthers successfully assumed the licenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\u2014Seidman valued WIN\u2019s real estate holdings as worth $28,431,335, when their value was much less unless, and until, WIN and Struthers successfully merged; and</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">\u2014Seidman stated WIN owned annuities worth $6,643,427, when no such annuities existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The complaint also alleges the financial statement said WIN\u2019s shareholder equity was $88,190,327, although the company\u2019s liabilities exceeded its assets, making it worthless. Finally, the complaint alleges Seidman repeated substantially the same misrepresentations in its review of WIN\u2019s March 1996 quarterly balance sheet and in the pro forma filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">As for Logan, the complaint alleges Logan misrepresented WIN\u2019s assets in its review of WIN\u2019s August 1995 balance sheet as $145,187,871, when they were worth only $30,737,209. The review particularly misstated:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u2014The value of WIN\u2019s broadcast licenses as $53,915,464, when they were worth less than $1 million unless, and until, the merger was completed;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u2014The value of WIN\u2019s real estate as $31,735,198, when it had no value under GAAP unless, and until, the merger was completed;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\u2014The value of WIN\u2019s intellectual property rights as $28,800,000, when they were worth far less and were perhaps even worthless; and</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">\u2014That WIN owned $5,785,000 in annuities, when no such annuities existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Finally, the complaint alleges Logan repeated substantially the same misrepresentations in its October 1995 accountants\u2019 report of WIN\u2019s August 1995 balance sheet and its February 1996 auditors\u2019 report of WIN\u2019s December 1995 balance sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">The complaint thus provides enough information for respondents to know what purported falsehoods they must defend against. <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660] [one purpose of specificity requirement is to inform defendant about the charges that must be met] <em>(Children\u2019s Television).) </em>Demanding that appellants provide even more detail risks making an already long complaint\u201460 pages supported by 258 pages of exhibits\u2014even longer. For a lengthy complaint, \u201cperfect compliance with the specificity requirement ... as a practical matter . . . [may] provide less effective notice and be less useful in framing the issues than would a shorter, more generalized version.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 217.) Appellants\u2019 complaint is bumping up against that principle. No more detail is needed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>II. <em>Respondents\u2019 Duty to Appellants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Respondents assert that their liability for any inaccuracies in the financial statements was only to their clients, WIN and Struthers, not to third parties. Accordingly, respondents contend appellants cannot state a cause of action for negligent or intentional misrepresentation because they owed no duty to appellants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In <em>Bily </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745] <em>(Bily), </em>our Supreme Court formulated a hierarchy of duty for accountants who prepare inaccurate financial statements. Casting an ever-widening circle of obligation, <em>Bily </em>established that the more egregious the misstatement, the broader the duty:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\u2014For <em>ordinary negligence, </em>an auditor owes a duty only to its client. As <em>Bily </em>explained, \u201c[A]n auditor\u2019s liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client financial statements is confined to the client, i.e., the person who contracts for or engages the audit services. Other persons may not recover on a pure negligence theory.\u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\u2022\u2014For <em>negligent misrepresentation, </em>the duty expands to specifically intended beneficiaries of the report who are substantially likely to receive the misinformation. <em>Bily </em>defined such beneficiaries as \u201cpersons who, although not clients, may reasonably come to receive and rely on an audit report and whose existence constitutes a risk of audit reporting that may fairly be imposed on the auditor. Such persons are specifically intended beneficiaries of the audit report who are known to the auditor and for whose benefit it renders the audit report.\u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 406-407.) Liability arises toward such plaintiffs when the representation was made \u201cwith the intent to induce plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, to act in reliance upon the representation in a specific transaction, or a specific type of transaction, that defendant intended to influence. Defendant is deemed to have intended to influence [its client\u2019s] transaction with plaintiff whenever defendant knows with <em>substantial certainty </em>that plaintiff, or the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, will rely on the representation in the course of the transaction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 414, italics added; cf. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1086, 1095 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 29] [auditor not liable for negligent misrepresentation to client\u2019s creditor where no evidence auditor knew client intended to use financial statement to get credit] <em>(Industrial Indemnity).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u2014For <em>intentional misrepresentation, </em>the duty expands yet further to include anyone whom the auditor should have reasonably foreseen would rely on the misrepresentations. <em>Bily </em>explained, \u201cThe representation must have been made with the intent to defraud plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, whom defendant intended or <em>reasonably should have foreseen </em>would rely upon the representation. One who makes a representation with intent to defraud the public or a particular class of persons is deemed to have intended to defraud every individual in that category who is actually misled thereby.\u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 415, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>Bily </em>can thus be briefly summarized as follows: (1) ordinary negli<em>gence\u2014no duty </em>to third parties; (2) negligent misrepresentation\u2014duty to third parties who would be known with <em>substantial certainty </em>to rely on the misrepresentation; and (3) intentional misrepresentation\u2014duty to third parties who could be <em>reasonably foreseen </em>to rely on the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Respondents note <em>Bily </em>intended to limit an auditor\u2019s liability to less than the world at large by requiring plaintiffs to show more than that respondents could have anticipated unknown parties might rely on the financial statements they prepared. For liability to attach, appellants must instead identify particular people and specific transactions, or well-defined types of transactions, that respondents intended to influence. <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 408-409; <em>Industrial Indemnity, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1094\u20141095 &amp; fn. 8.) As <em>Bily </em>explained, \u201cIf competent evidence does not permit a reasonable inference that the auditor supplied its report with knowledge of the existence of a specific transaction or a well-defined type of transaction which the report was intended to influence, the auditor is not placed on notice of the risks of the audit engagement.\u201d <em>(Bily, </em>at p. 414; see also <em>Industrial Indemnity, </em>at p. 1097 [auditor liable only to those third parties the auditor \u201cknows is likely to rely on it in a transaction that has sufficiently specific economic parameters to permit the [auditor] to assess the risk of moving forward\u201d].) Relying on <em>Bily, </em>respondents contend the complaint fails to state a cause of action because, first, it does not allege respondents knew that appellants planned to invest in WIN or Struthers and, second, it fails to allege respondents intended to influence such investment decisions. We conclude respondents misread the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">1. Appellants Allege the Duty for Negligent Misrepresentation. The complaint alleges WIN and Struthers hired respondents to prepare various financial statements that appellants relied upon in buying WIN or Struthers stock and in approving their merger. The complaint also alleges respondents knew WIN or Struthers would distribute the statements to existing and potential shareholders for such purposes. A representative allegation is the following: \u201cSeidman was hired by WIN to prepare certified audited statements and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>financial statements of WIN for the purpose of influencing and inducing (a) investors to purchase and/or retain WIN and Struthers securities, (b) Struthers to approve the combination of WIN and Struthers and (c) WIN and/or Struthers securities holders to approve the combination of WIN and Struthers. . . . Seidman knew that its financial statements, audit reports, and review reports would be used to influence and induce [appellants] to purchase or retain WIN and Struthers securities and to approve the combination of WIN and Struthers.\u201d Such an allegation, and similar allegations targeted at Logan, satisfy <em>Bily\u2019s </em>criteria for negligent misrepresentation: respondents knew with substantial certainty that potential investors such as appellants would rely on the misstatements. <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414.) The complaint therefore states a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">2. Appellants Allege the Duty for Intentional Misrepresentation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleges respondents either intentionally or recklessly misstated the value of WIN\u2019s assets and shareholder equity. It further alleges respondents should have foreseen that current and future investors in WIN and Struthers would rely on the misstated values in deciding whether to invest in those companies and to approve their merger. A representative allegation is the following: \u201cSeidman\u2019s misrepresentations [of asset and equity values and compliance with GAAP] were made recklessly, without Seidman knowing whether they were true or false, [f] . . . [][] Seidmah should have foreseen that the class of people and entities to whom or which [appellants] belong would rely on the Seidman misrepresentations. ...[][] Seidman should reasonably have foreseen that WIN stockholders or potential stockholders who read [the financial statements] would tell other people and the press the contents of these financial statements, particularly in light of the interest being expressed in WIN and Struthers and the announced merger of WIN and Struthers. Seidman should also have reasonably foreseen that the other people would rely upon its misrepresentations in the financial statements . . . and in so doing be misled into purchasing WIN or Struthers stock.\u201d Such allegations, and similar allegations targeted at Logan, satisfy <em>Bily\u2019s </em>criteria for intentional misrepresentation: respondents could reasonably foresee that others such as appellants would rely on the misstatements. <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 415.) The complaint therefore states a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>3. Appellants Who Bought Struthers Stock Allege Causes of Action. Some appellants bought only Struthers stock.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondents note that Struthers hired Seidman, but not Logan, to prepare its financial statements. According to respondents, Struthers appellants therefore cannot state a cause of action against Logan because Struthers was not Logan\u2019s client and thus owed no duty to Struthers\u2019 shareholders for any misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>Bily </em>imposes on respondents a duty to more than just their clients. Respondents owed a duty to anyone whom they (1) should have reasonably foreseen would rely on their intentional misrepresentations, or (2) knew with substantial certainty would rely on their negligent misrepresentations. <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 413-415.) The complaint alleges respondents knew the proposed merger of WIN and Struthers would induce investors in Struthers to rely on financial statements about WIN in anticipation of the two companies becoming one. In addition, the complaint alleges respondents knew Struthers investors would rely on WTN\u2019s financial statements in deciding whether to approve the merger itself. The complaint therefore alleges a duty from respondents to Struthers\u2019 shareholders, making respondents liable to those shareholders for their misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">III. <em>Reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">1. Sufficient Detail. Logan contends the complaint does not describe appellants\u2019 reliance on Logan\u2019s alleged misrepresentations with enough detail. According to Logan, appellants must identify the \u201cwhen, where, and how\u201d of their reliance. Our review finds most appellants describe their reliance on WIN\u2019s inflated assets with enough specificity, often including the precise date they bought stock in the company and the amount paid, to permit respondents to prepare a defense. <em>(Children\u2019s Television, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 216.) Set forth below is a summary of their alleged reliance. Although our lengthy summary borders on tedious, we undertake it to highlight the amount of detail appellants did in fact allege\u2014and which respondents and the trial court apparently ignored\u2014as appellants struggled to balance the complaint\u2019s specificity against its unwieldiness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Children\u2019s Television, </em>at p. 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u2014Marcia Beach: Alleges she bought Strothers stock between March 1996 and January 1997 based on what someone else told her about the Logan reports.

Forbearance Is Reliance. A number of appellants, whom we identify in Appendix 2, bought WIN or Strothers stock before Logan and Seidman issued their first reports, and thereafter relied on respondents\u2019 rosy misstatements in deciding not to sell their stock.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Respondents contend that holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>onto stock, in contrast to selling or buying it, is not actionable reliance. Thus, according to respondents, the court correctly dismissed \u201cholding\u201d appellants for failing to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">After briefing ended in this appeal, our Supreme Court held in <em>Small </em>v. <em>Fritz Companies, Inc. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 65 P.3d 1255] <em>(Small) </em>that holding stock can be actionable reliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 170-171.) Thus, those appellants who held WIN or Struthers stock in reliance on respondents\u2019 misstatements can allege a cause of action. The trial court therefore erred to the extent it dismissed \u201cholding\u201d appellants for not having alleged reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>Small\u2019s New Pleading Rule: </em>In addition to holding forbearance can be reliance, the <em>Small </em>court announced that plaintiffs who rely on a forbearance theory must plead how many shares they would have sold and when they would have sold them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Small, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 184.) Because such requirements were new, the <em>Small </em>court directed the trial court to grant the plaintiff there leave to amend her complaint to add such allegations. Following Small\u2019s guidance here, we direct the trial court to grant the \u201cholding\u201d appellants leave to amend the complaint to specify how many shares they would have sold and when they would have sold them.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">3. \u201cGrapevine\u201d Plaintiffs. Some appellants did not read or otherwise directly rely on the Logan or Seidman financial statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, they relied on what others told them the statements said. Respondents argue such indirect reliance by those appellants, whom they call \u201cgrapevine plaintiffs,\u201d does not constitute legal reliance and is thus not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The law is otherwise. Indirect reliance is actionable if Logan or Seidman had reason to know others would convey their misrepresentations to appellants. Under <em>Bily, </em>respondents are liable for (1) negligent misrepresentation if they knew it was substantially certain that appellants would receive the misstatements and (2) intentional misrepresentation if it was reasonably foreseeable appellants would receive the statements. Thus, nothing in <em>Bily\u2019s </em>formulation of negligent or intentional misrepresentation precludes indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>reliance. (See also <em>Mirkin </em>v. <em>Wasserman </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1082, 1095-1097 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 858 P.2d 568] [allows indirect liability for misrepresentations if defendant had reason to know misrepresentation will be forwarded] (Mirkin).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the \u201cgrapevine\u201d appellants state claims for negligent and intentional misrepresentation notwithstanding their indirect reliance on Logan\u2019s and Seidman\u2019s misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Respondents\u2019 contention is well-taken, however, as to certain appellants who do not expressly allege relying on any Logan or Seidman misstatement, whether directly or indirectly. Because they do not allege reliance, the trial court properly dismissed them for failing to state a claim for negligent or intentional misrepresentation. Those appellants are: Michael Benkert; Daniel, Ethel, Patrick and Wence DiBala; Jason Edwards; Donna Kincaid; Deanna Polani; Steven Schulman; and Heather Ann Ueunten.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">4. Reasonableness of Reliance. Logan argues reliance on any of its misstatements was unreasonable for several reasons. None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">a. <em>Logan\u2019s </em>disclaimers: Logan attached several qualifications to its statements about WIN and Strothers. According to Logan, these qualifications should have alerted appellants that 'Logan\u2019s reports might be inaccurate, making appellants\u2019 reliance on the statements unreasonable. Logan\u2019s first qualification was a \u201cgoing concern\u201d disclaimer contained in Logan\u2019s February 9, 1996, independent auditors\u2019 report. It warned Logan had \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about WIN\u2019s ability to stay in business if its proposed merger with Strothers failed. Logan cites authority that a going concern disclaimer is a conspicuous red flag of a company\u2019s financial shakiness and an investment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>riskiness. Based on that authority, Logan argues it was unreasonable for appellants to rely on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Logan\u2019s argument misses the mark, however, because Logan was obligated to be truthful in its statements regardless of the precariousness of WIN\u2019s finances. Logan\u2019s February report stated that the values it assigned to WIN\u2019s assets complied with generally accepted accounting principles, which appellants allege was false. Logan\u2019s going concern qualification does not address that assertion, nor the reasonableness of appellant\u2019s reliance on.it.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Logan\u2019s second qualification rested on the difference between an accountant\u2019s review and an audit. Logan argues a review is less searching than an audit, rendering appellants\u2019 reliance on any statements in a review unreasonable as a matter of law. For example, Logan notes its November 24, 1995, review stated, \u201cAll information included in these financial statements is the representation of the management of World Interactive Network, Inc.,\u201d and Logan did not express \u201can opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.\u201d In addition, its October 12, 1995, independent accountants\u2019 report similarly expressed no \u201copinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Again, Logan\u2019s argument misses the mark. Appellants allege Logan falsely stated the financial statements complied with generally accepted accounting principles. An accountant may not issue an intentionally false document of whatever type, whether styled as a review or audit. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, \u00a7 58 [\u201cLicensees engaged in the practice of public accountancy shall comply with all applicable professional standards, including but not limited to generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards\u201d].) Thus, even if reviews are less rigorous than audits, the relaxed standards were not a license to misrepresent, and Logan was therefore still obligated to be truthful whatever the nature of its report. <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 383; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, \u00a7 58.3 [accountant may not issue report on unaudited financial statements to client or others without complying with professional standards].) Therefore, the fact that some of Logan\u2019s reports were reviews, not audits, has no bearing on the reasonableness of appellants\u2019 reliance on Logan\u2019s assertion that the reports complied with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">b. <em>Duty to investigate: </em>Logan argues appellants had a duty to investigate Logan\u2019s statements. As Logan notes, investors cannot turn a blind eye to a known risk involving a company. <em>(Atari Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Whinney </em>(1992) 981 F.2d 1025, 1030-1031.) In support, Logan cites language in <em>Bily </em>noting that \u201cInvestment and credit decisions are by their nature complex and multifaceted. Although an audit report might play a role in such decisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>reasonable and prudent investors and lenders will dig far deeper in their \u2018due diligence\u2019 investigations than the surface level of an auditor\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 400-401 [11 Cal. Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745].) Logan\u2019s contention is unavailing, however, because regardless of whether investors <em>should </em>rely <em>solely </em>on an auditor\u2019s report when investing, it seems unassailable that they may assume an auditor\u2019s statements are truthful. Logan\u2019s argument thus amounts to the claim that if appellants had looked more closely into WIN\u2019s finances, appellants would have discovered that Logan\u2019s statements were false. To state such a proposition is to reveal its unsoundness.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">c. <em>Statute of frauds: </em>Logan argues the statute of frauds barred appellants from relying on what anyone, including Logan, said about WIN\u2019s financial statements. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1974.) In pertinent part, the statute refers to statements about someone else\u2019s creditworthiness. As such, it applies only to claims by creditors. (See <em>Grant v. U.S. Electronics Corp. </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 193, 198 [270 P.2d 64] [\u201cSection 1974 is applicable only when the primary object of the representations is to induce the procurement of credit to a third person\u201d]; <em>Bank of America v. Western Constructors </em>(1952) 110 Cal.App.2d 166, 169 [242 P.2d 365] [\u201cA test, if not the sole test, for determining whether a misrepresentation is within the statute, is whether the representation induced the recipient thereof to enter into a transaction which resulted in a debt due to him from the third person\u201d].) Having bought stock in WIN and Strothers, appellants were investors in the companies, not creditors. Accordingly, the statute does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">IV. <em>Appellants Fail to State a Corporations Code Section 25400 Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Corporations Code section 25400 prohibits making false or misleading statements to assist the sale of a security. (\u00a7 25400, subd. (d).) Appellants allege respondents\u2019 financial statements violated that statute. Appellants cannot, however, state a cause of action for that violation because the statute\u2019s language limits liability to actual sellers or buyers of, or someone who offers to buy or sell, a security. (\u00a7 25400 [applies to \u201ca broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase\u201d a security]; <em>Kamen v. Lindly </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 197, 206 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 127] <em>(Kamen).) </em>Because respondents did not buy or sell WIN or Strothers stock, or offer to do so, the statute does not apply to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Appellants argue the statutory limitation is bad public policy and decisions such as <em>Kamen </em>that impose such a limit are wrongly decided. In appellants\u2019 view, liability under Corporations Code section 25400 should extend to anyone who makes a misrepresentation. In support of a \u201cno sale\u201d requirement, they cite <em>Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1048 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539], but it is inapposite. That case addressed whether section 25400 applied only to sales of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>securities inside California, or also covered sales outside the state. In its discussion, the court in passing mentioned that an actual sale need not have occurred\u2014which is true, because the statute also covers <em>offers </em>to sell. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1047-1048.) The court\u2019s comment cannot be understood, however, to have overridden the statutory language limiting liability to someone who is an actual, or potential, buyer or seller. (See <em>StorMedia Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 456-463 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 976 P.2d 214] [statute applies to someone who sells or offers to sell a security]; <em>Reiger v. Altris Software, Inc. </em>(S.D.Cal. Apr. 3, 1999, No. 98-CV-528 TW) 1999 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 7949 [Fed.Sec.L.Rep. 90,491, pp. 92353-92354] [\u201cstatute was not intended to reach defendants [such as independent auditors] who did not directly participate in the sale of securities or some other \u2018market activity\u2019 \u201d].) Accordingly, the trial court properly sustained respondents\u2019 demurrers that appellants could not state a cause of action under section 25400.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">V. <em>No Bankruptcy Bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Logan contends appellants\u2019 failure to assert claims in WIN\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings bars the complaint. In support, Logan relies on <em>Federated Management Company v. Latham &amp; Watkins </em>(2000) 742 N.E.2d 684 [138 OhioApp.3d 815], a solitary out-of-state decision by an intermediate appellate court holding that creditors suing lawyers of a bankrupt company for fraud and misrepresentations were obligated to pursue their claims in bankruptcy court. Such a case does not establish any such proposition binding in California, nor does Logan advance any argument how the Ohio court\u2019s analysis or holding applies here. We therefore pass on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part. The trial court is directed to enter a new and different order:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend to appellants\u2019 cause of action for violation of Corporations Code section 25400;</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend for failing to allege reliance by Michael Benkert; Daniel, Ethel, Patrick and Wence DiBala; Jason Edwards; Donna Kincaid; Deanna Polani; Steven Schulman; and Heather Ann Ueunten;</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend for failing to allege reliance with sufficient detail by Robert Boy ter, Branch Investment Group LLC, Salvatore Federico, Walter Forsyth, and Stephen Hyden; and</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Overruling the demurrers in all other respects as to all other appellants, except for those appellants who allege they continued to hold their stock in reliance on respondents\u2019 misrepresentations.

These financial statements conveyed to Plaintiffs Robert E. and Elza Burton the firm impression that the Company and its subsidiaries were strong with a lot of assets and had a great chance of success, and that investments in the Company and/or its subsidiaries were likely to be highly profitable. The financial statements also disclosed the proposed merger between WIN and Struthers. On this basis, the various purchases were made by Plaintiffs Robert E. and Elza Burton. The strong financial statements are also the reason that Plaintiffs Robert E. and Elza Burton did not sell any of the stock that they had purchased. Plaintiffs Robert E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>and Elza Burton bought the following amount of Strothers\u2019 stock on the specified dates: 2/20/96\u2014 $10,728.00; 2/23/96\u2014$10,103.00; 1/14/97\u2014$3,563.50; 1/17/97\u2014$5,511.50; 1/27/97\u2014$10,123; and 4/15/97\u2014$2,658.00.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\"> Respondents misidentify a number of appellants as doing no more than not selling their stock in reliance on respondents\u2019 misstatements.

Under that doctrine, a plaintiff need not prove direct reliance on a misstatement; instead, the plaintiff need only show the misstatement affected the stock\u2019s trading price on the open market. <em>(Mirkin, </em>at p. 1089; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 1108-1109 (cone. opn. of Kennard, J.).) The advent of <em>Small </em>appears to foretell a policy shift eyeing a dawning awareness that all is not right with the securities markets and the accountants who are supposed to police them. As <em>Small </em>observed, \u201cThe last few years have seen repeated reports of false financial statements and accounting fraud, demonstrating that many charges of corporate fraud were neither speculative nor attempts to extort settlement money, but were based on actual misconduct. \u2018To open the newspaper today is to receive a daily dose of scandal, from Adelphia to Enron and beyond. Sadly, each of us knows that these newly publicized instances of accounting-related securities fraud are no longer out of the ordinary, save perhaps in scale alone.\u2019 [Citation.] The victims of the reported frauds, moreover, are often persons who were induced to hold corporate stock by rosy but false financial reports, while others who knew the true state of affairs exercised stock options and sold at inflated prices. [Citation.] Eliminating barriers that deny redress to actual victims of fraud now assumes an importance equal to that of deterring nonmeritorious suits.\u201d <em>(Small, </em>at p. 181.) Although it is for our Supreme Court, not us, to decide the question, recent events support revisiting the fraud-on-the-market doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\"> We acknowledge that some appellants do not prevail on appeal and thus would ordinarily not be entitled to recover their costs.
