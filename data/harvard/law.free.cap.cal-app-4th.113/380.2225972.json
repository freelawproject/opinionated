In this case, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of an employer after determining that the employee\u2019s claim under section 6310 was collaterally estopped by a labor arbitrator\u2019s decision that the employee was terminated for good cause. This was error, because the CBA was never presented to the court and there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>no evidence that it clearly and unmistakably provided for arbitration of the employee\u2019s statutory claim. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Plaintiff and appellant Walter H. Taylor (Taylor) was employed by defendant and respondent Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) as a rocket engine mechanic. He was a member of the International Association of Machinists, Local No. 2786. The union had a CBA with Lockheed that provided for the arbitration of employment grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Taylor worked at Lockheed\u2019s facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base for almost 15 years, until he was disciplined for an incident in which he allegedly threatened two fellow employees after a forklift he was driving hit the surface of a missile. He was placed on unpaid leave and informed that he would not be allowed to return to work unless he obtained counseling. Taylor declined to do so and was eventually terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Taylor believed his termination was racially motivated and was in retaliation for an earlier complaint that he had filed with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the State Department of Industrial Relations (Cal/OSHA). He filed suit in state court alleging four causes of action against Lockheed: (1) wrongful termination in violation of the public policy found in sections 1102.5 and 6310;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) retaliatory discharge in violation of sections 1102.5 and 6310; (3) race discrimination in employment in violation of Government Code section 12940; and (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy under the California Constitution, article I, section 8 (prohibiting race discrimination). Lockheed filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Taylor\u2019s state law claims were barred because they arose on a federal enclave; i.e., an area within a state over which the federal government exercises legislative jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>This court reversed in part a superior court order granting summary judgment in favor of Lockheed. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 472 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 873].) We concluded that Taylor\u2019s claims arose exclusively on the federal enclave of Vandenberg Air Force Base and that consequently, his suit was governed by the law of that enclave. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 479-481.) The law of a federal enclave includes federal law, state law that was in effect when the state ceded power to the federal government and which is not inconsistent with federal law, and subsequently enacted state law that has been expressly extended to the enclave by an act of Congress. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 481-482.) Taylor\u2019s claims for race discrimination under Government Code section 12940 and for wrongful termination in violation of public policy did not fall into any of these categories, making summary judgment appropriate on three of his four causes of action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 482, 486.) But we held that Taylor could pursue his remaining statutory claim for retaliatory discharge under the Labor Code, because section 6310 was part of the Cal/OSHA regulatory scheme and Congress had passed legislation expressly permitting California to enforce its worker safety laws when, as here, the federal government did not actively exercise that jurisdiction. <em>(Taylor, </em>at pp. 483\u2014486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Meanwhile, Taylor had filed a grievance with his union, which represented him in an arbitration under the CBA. In a decision filed March 28, 2000, the arbitrator ruled that Taylor had been terminated for just cause. Taylor brought a separate action for violation of the CBA under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a)), but voluntarily dismissed that claim before a final judgment was obtained. Lockheed moved for summary judgment in the instant case on Taylor\u2019s remaining state law claim for retaliatory discharge, arguing that the labor arbitrator\u2019s finding of \u201cjust cause\u201d was binding through the doctrine of collateral estoppel and precluded Taylor from arguing that he had been terminated for improper retaliatory reasons. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment in Lockheed\u2019s favor. We review this ruling de novo. <em>(Johnson v. City of Loma Linda </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 67-68 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 5 P.3d 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Taylor was denied relief in his arbitration under the CBA because the arbitrator found, among other things, that just cause supported his termination. The trial court in this case ruled that the prior finding of \u201cjust cause\u201d required judgment in favor of Lockheed because the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevented Taylor from arguing that he was terminated in retaliation for his Cal/OSHA complaint. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the arbitrator\u2019s prior finding would defeat Taylor\u2019s current statutory claim <em>if </em>the arbitration were given preclusive effect. But we disagree that collateral estoppel was properly applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is an aspect of the doctrine of res judicata. <em>(Vandenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 828 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229].) Where applicable, it prevents a party or that party\u2019s privy from relitigating in a second proceeding an issue that was already litigated and determined in a prior proceeding. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Most applications of collateral estoppel involve issues that were resolved in previous lawsuits, but the doctrine may also extend to findings made in prior nonjudicial proceedings such as administrative hearings or arbitrations. <em>(Kelly v. Vons Companies, Inc. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1329, 1335-1337 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">When the prior findings at issue have been made during a labor arbitration under a CBA, courts have placed limits on the extent to which collateral estoppel applies. In a series of cases, the United States Supreme Court has held that findings made during a labor arbitration are not binding in an employee lawsuit asserting federal statutory causes of action designed to protect workers: a discrimination claim under title VII of the Civil Rights Act in <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 36, 44-56 [39 L.Ed.2d 147, 94 S.Ct. 1011] <em>(Alexander), </em>a minimum wage violation under the Fair Labor Standards Act in <em>Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc. </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 728, 738-741 [67 L.Ed.2d 641, 101 S.Ct. 1437] <em>(Barrentine), </em>and a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>West Branch </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 284, 289-291 [80 L.Ed.2d 302, 104 S.Ct. 1799] <em>(McDonald).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In these three cases, the court gave several reasons for limiting the preclusive effect of a labor arbitration under a CBA. It noted that Congress had given the federal courts plenary power over each of the statutory claims at issue and there was no indication in any of the statutes that a prior arbitration divested the courts of the jurisdiction to hear the claim. <em>(Alexander, supra, </em>415 U.S. at p. 45; <em>Barrentine, supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 737; <em>McDonald, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 291.) It characterized a union arbitrator\u2019s expertise as \u201cthe law of the shop, not the law of the land\u201d and explained that because the arbitrator\u2019s power derives solely from the CBA, he or she has the duty to follow the CBA rather than federal law in case of a conflict between the two. <em>(Alexander, </em>at p. 57; <em>Barrentine, </em>at pp. 744-745; <em>McDonald, </em>at p. 291.) The court also observed that the union\u2019s interests will not always be aligned with the individual employee\u2019s. <em>(Alexander, </em>at p. 53; <em>Barrentine, </em>at p. 742; <em>McDonald, </em>at p. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In <em>Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp. </em>(1998) 525 U.S 70 [142 L.Ed.2d 361, 119 S.Ct. 391], the Supreme Court reaffirmed the <em>AlexanderBarrentine-McDonald </em>line of cases while acknowledging there was \u201csome tension\u201d between the rule denying preclusive effect to labor arbitrations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>language in a more recent decision that upheld an individual employee\u2019s agreement to arbitrate a statutory employment discrimination claim. <em>(Wright, </em>at p. 76, citing <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 20 [114 L.Ed.2d 26, 111 S.Ct. 1647].) Although the court did not decide whether a union can ever waive the statutory employment discrimination claims of its members through a CBA provision, it held that a mandatory arbitration provision in a CBA cannot be enforceable when there is no \u201c \u2018clear and unmistakable\u2019 \u201d waiver of the right to file suit. (Wright, at p. 80 [119 S.Ct. 391].) \u201c[T]he right to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected against less-than-explicit union waiver in a CBA.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Under <em>Wright, </em>the basic rule of <em>Alexander, Barrentine </em>and <em>McDonald </em>remains intact, and a labor arbitration can have preclusive effect on a subsequent statutory claim only if the CBA contained a clear and unmistakable waiver of the employee\u2019s right to file a lawsuit on the statutory claim. <em>(Camargo v. California Portland Cement Co. </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 995, 1013-1014 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 841].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Application of this rule requires reversal of the summary judgment in this case.  Lockheed did not submit the CBA negotiated by Taylor\u2019s union as part of its motion for summary judgment and there is simply no evidence that the CBA contained a clear and unmistakable waiver of a union members\u2019 individual right to sue for retaliatory discharge under section 6310.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Lockheed argues that we are not bound by the federal rule of <em>Alexander, Barrentine </em>and <em>McDonald </em>when considering Taylor\u2019s state law claim. Strictly speaking, Taylor\u2019s claim is one made under the law of the federal enclave, which in this case happens to include provisions of the state Labor Code. But assuming that collateral estoppel is a procedural issue to which state law applies (see <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 212, 230 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 668]), we have given the federal cases our \u201c \u2018 \u201crespectful consideration\u201d \u2019 \u201d and find them persuasive. (See <em>Kelly v. Vons Companies, Inc., supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1337-1338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This result is consistent with the Third Appellate District\u2019s recent decision in <em>Camargo v. California Portland Cement Co., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at page 999, which applied the <em>Alexander-Barrentine-McDonald </em>analysis to a state discrimination claim under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). <em>Camargo </em>concluded that a prior labor arbitration should not be given collateral estoppel effect absent a clear and unmistakable waiver of the employee\u2019s right to sue. <em>(Camargo, </em>at p. 999; see also <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 430, 434-436 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 294] [mandatory arbitration clause in CBA not binding as to statutory discrimination claims absent clear and unmistakable waiver].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>We reach the same conclusion with respect to Taylor\u2019s cause of action under section 6310, subdivision (b).  Like FEHA, section 6310 authorizes an individual discrimination claim, albeit one that arises from retaliation against a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d rather than discrimination based on a personal characteristic such as race, gender or ethnicity. The statute is part of the state\u2019s scheme for occupational safety and like the federal statutes at issue in <em>Alexander, Barrentine </em>and McDonald, it establishes an individual cause of action for a right that is not necessarily coextensive with the terms of a CBA. The policy reasons for limiting the preclusive effect of a labor arbitration on statutory discrimination claims are as pertinent to claims under section 6310 as they are to claims under the federal statutes considered by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Alexander, Barrentine </em>and <em>McDonald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Lockheed urges us to follow our decision in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Vons Companies, Inc., supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th 1329, in which we held that an adverse finding in a labor arbitration was binding as to the employees\u2019 common law tort claims in a subsequent lawsuit against their employer. The decision in <em>Kelly </em>is inapposite because it did not involve a statutory discrimination claim such as Taylor\u2019s. <em>Kelly </em>specifically distinguished the <em>Alexander-Barrentine-McDonald </em>line of cases on this basis. <em>(Kelly, </em>at pp. 1337-1339 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 763]; contrast also <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Dart Transportation Service </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 320, 322 [135 CaLRptr. 259] [labor arbitration given collateral estoppel effect on state common law claims].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Nor are we persuaded by Lockheed\u2019s reliance on <em>Castillo v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th <em>All </em>[111 Cal.Rptr.2d 870], <em>Castillo </em>held that collateral estoppel barred the plaintiff\u2019s FEHA claim due to an adverse finding in a hearing before the Los Angeles Civil Service Commission and a subsequent administrative mandamus proceeding. The case did not involve a prior labor arbitration under a CBA and the concerns expressed in the <em>Alexander, Barrentine </em>and <em>McDonald </em>cases are simply inapplicable to prior findings made in an administrative proceeding brought directly by an aggrieved employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Lockheed suggests that Taylor waived his right to pursue his statutory retaliation claim when he voluntarily submitted his grievance to his union. A similar argument was rejected in <em>Camargo, </em>which noted that the United States Supreme Court had refused to apply collateral estoppel to the plaintiff\u2019s statutory claim in <em>Alexander </em>even though the plaintiff in that case had submitted his grievance to arbitration. <em>(Camargo </em>v. <em>California Portland Cement Co., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1020, citing <em>Alexander, supra, </em>415 U.S. at pp. 42-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The judgment is reversed.
