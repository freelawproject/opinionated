Notwithstanding his plea agreement\u2019s waiver of appellate rights to challenge the conviction on grounds other than the Fifth and Second Amendments, we vacate and remand because the record clearly reflects and the district court found that the predicate court order was <em>not </em>\u201cissued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice\u201d as required by section 922(g)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Spruill was charged in a two count indictment with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Each count charged that Spruill on July 20, 1998 \u201cdid knowingly possess in and affecting commerce firearms[sic], to wit: a Largo, 9mm semi-automatic pistol, manufactured by Star, which had been shipped and transported in interstate commerce.\u201d Count one alleged that this possession violated section 922(g)(8) in that at the time Spruill was subject to a February 11,1998 order of the County Court at Law of Midland County, Texas, issued after a hearing of which Spruill had notice and an opportunity to participate, which restrained him from harassing, stalking and threatening his intimate partner and her child and by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, and threatened use of physical force against his intimate partner and her child. Count two alleged that this possession violated section 922(g)(3) in that Spruill \u201cis an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Spruill filed a motion, and a second motion, to dismiss each count of the indictment on various grounds. The second motion was predicated on the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>USA v. Emerson, </em>46 F.Supp.2d 598 (N.D.Tex.1999) (which this court subsequently reversed, <em>USA v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir.2001)), and urged that sections 922(g)(8) and 922(g)(3) violated the Second and Fifth Amendments. The supporting memorandum filed with the second motion to dismiss attached a copy of the February 11, 1998 order and alleged, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">\u201cAlthough the boilerplate order issued under these circumstances was signed by Judge Royal Hart, there was no evi-dentiary hearing about the circumstances leading to the issuance of said order and Defendant never appeared before said judge. Defendant was not represented by counsel and could not read the Protective Order presented to him. Mr. Sprufll appeared before Assistant District Attorney David Watson, who represented the interest of the Petitioner in that matter, but, who nevertheless, explained the purpose of the Protective Order and at least some of its requirements to the Defendant. No mention about Defendant\u2019s ability to own, possess or lawfully use a weapon was made at that time and said Protective Order, while admonishing the Defendant about other prohibitions required by state law, does not mention any prohibition of weapon possession of any kind. The issuance of the Protective Order was a precursor to the filing of a Petition for Divorce in the state court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">\u201c... the party potentially subject to the order may agree to be bound by said order without a hearing of record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>a Judge, and without representation by an attorney. In the present ease, there is no question that there was not a hearing before Judge Hart, that the defendant was not admonished with regard to his ability to possess a gun. Mr. Spruill appeared Pro Se, and was presented with a form order provided by the Midland County District Attorneys office where he was told \u2018where to sign,\u2019 if he did not oppose the motion by the State, (see Protective Order attached as exhibit \u2018B\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The district court held a hearing on the motions to dismiss on May 7, 1999, and overruled them \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d stating \u201cI\u2019m going to give full consideration to the motion, but I\u2019m going to do it only after a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The case was subsequently set for a bench trial June 10, 1999. On that date the parties appeared before the court and defense counsel announced \u201csubject to your approval, we have entered into this conditional plea and we would like to perfect the record by adducing evidence ... we would like then to reurge the last Motion to Dismiss that we previously presented to the Court after we present that evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Evidence was then presented. Assistant District Attorney Watson testified that his office handled protective orders for indigents (see Tex. Family Code \u00a7 82.002(d)(1)), and he had been the person assigned to do so for the previous two years. He brought with him the file in the Spruill protective order and \u201csomewhat\u201d remembered it. He stated that \u201cSpruill came to the District Attorney\u2019s office, but I don\u2019t believe we ever entered a courtroom.\u201d He said he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d Spruill \u201cmentioned to me that he couldn\u2019t read,\u201d and indicated \u201che was going to agree to the protective order.\u201d The practice of the District Attorney\u2019s Office was that the form order was prepared by the \u201cstaff;\u201d \u201c[i]f they\u2019re going to agree to it, discuss it with their attorney or with them, then we\u2019ll strike out certain things in the canned protective orders in the computer and add whether or not its agreed or contested or if there was pro se or whether or not an attorney was present.\u201d Spruill \u201cagreed with this.\u201d As far as Watson knew, Spruill did so without \u201cthe benefit of a lawyer.\u201d Watson \u201cread parts of it to him and explained what it meant and what the implications of the order would be.\u201d Watson \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he \u201cemphasized the fact that the only person that could allow him to go within 200 yards of the residence, its in the protective order, or go against any of the orders or protective order was the judge ... that Ms. Spruill couldn\u2019t give him authority to come to the home or whatever\u201d, and stated \u201cI believe I emphasized that. I recall sitting and talking with Mr. Spruill.\u201d Watson did not mention any other part of the order read or explained to Spruill. He further stated \u201cI do recall Mr. Spruill, speaking with him, and the fact that he couldn\u2019t read was one thing that reminded me of it and I do attempt whenever there\u2019s an agreed pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tective order with a pro se individual to explain the protective order fairly thoroughly.\u201d Watson agreed that if one in Spruill\u2019s position had said he didn\u2019t want to sign or agree to the order, or wanted to see a lawyer or go see the judge about it \u201cthey would have been provided an opportunity for that hearing.\u201d He also stated that \u201cwhenever I deal with a pro se respondent, I list the options they have available, representing themselves, hiring an attorney, agreeing to an order or default.\u201d Watson also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">\u201cI have a handwritten note in the file stating that we had contacted him and he was going to agree to the order, some of the conditions, to prepare the agreed order, and Mr. Spruill would come in and speak to me. When he came in exactly I don\u2019t recall the time or the exact date, but in routine practice whenever an agreed order is gone over, it\u2019s presented right then to the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Spruill then testified. He responded \u201cno, sir\u201d when asked \u201ccan you read the English language well\u201d, and \u201cyes, sir\u201d when asked \u201cyou just can\u2019t read. Is that correct.\u201d He testified that before his wife filed for divorce he was called by the District Attorney\u2019s office and they \u201ctold me that they had a paper for me to come down ... it was going to be a filing of a protective order on me,\u201d and \u201cI told them I would come down and take care of that.\u201d He went to the District Attorney\u2019s office, talked with Watson there and \u201ctold him I would just like to go ahead and sign the order and get it over with.\u201d When asked if Watson told him that his signing the protective order would give up certain of his rights, Spruill responded \u201cYes, sir. He told me that-well, basically what he told me was that I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in so close of her or the school or her mother\u2019s house where she would be staying.\u201d He testified that he did not ever appear before a judge and that he did not then have an attorney. Spruill further testified that Watson never told him, and he was unaware, that by virtue of the protective order he could not possess a handgun or weapon or that he needed to check federal statutes in that respect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The court was presented with the written plea agreement and attached written \u201cFactual Basis\u201d for it. The plea agreement provides Spruill would plead guilty to the section 922(g)(8) count (count one) and the remaining count (count two, section 922(g)(3)) would be dismissed, that the Government would not oppose maximum points for acceptance of responsibility or move for upward departure, and that Spruill waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201cexcept for the following two matters that were raised via pre-trial motion and overruled by the Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the Defendant may appeal the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8), taking into account the Protective Order at issue in this case (a true copy of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>part of the attached Factual Basis as Exhibit A thereto), violates the Second Amendment and other provisions of the United States Constitution as set forth in <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>1999 WL 181663, No. 6:98-CR-103-C (N.D.Tex. March 30,1998). Second, the Defendant may appeal the issue of whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8), given the Government\u2019s stipulation (set forth in the Factual Basis) that it cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant was aware that he could not legally possess a weapon, violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aax\">The Factual Basis states that the February 11, 1998 order was entered that date and was still in effect on July 20, 1998, it attaches and incorporates a true copy of the entire order, and also summarizes some of its provisions. It goes on to recite that on July 20, 1998 Spruill, in the parking lot of a restaurant in Midland, Texas, got out of his car and carried the 9mm Largo semi-automatic pistol, which was unloaded, from his car to the car of a \u201creporting individual,\u201d and was then arrested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is stated that this pistol \u201cwas manufactured in Spain, and so necessarily would have had to have been shipped or transported in interstate and foreign commerce to have arrived in Texas,\u201d and that \u201cDPS tests indicate that this weapon was operational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">With respect to how the protective order came about, the Factual Basis recites</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeJX\">\u201cDefendant appeared before the Court when this Protective Order was issued, and had the opportunity to be heard on the matter. Indeed, Defendant signed the Protective Order acknowledging his receipt of it, and agreed to its terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Based on the earlier testimony at the hearing, the Government and defense counsel agreed, and stated in open court, that the first sentence in the above quoted passage would be changed to read (after \u201cDefendant\u201d) \u201ccame to the District Attorney\u2019s office and agreed to the order and he had the opportunity to be heard on this matter had he chosen to.\u201d Later in the hearing the district court ascertained from Spruill that he agreed to this change, the court explaining it to him as follows: \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a change in the factual basis and the change is that you didn\u2019t go to court before a judge, that you just signed the protective order in Mr. Watson\u2019s presence and then left.\u201d After going over the plea agreement and factual basis and questioning and advising Spruill and counsel pursuant to Rule 11, Fed. R.Crim. Pro., the district court accepted the plea and found Spruill guilty of the offense \u201csubject to my final decision on the issue of constitutionality.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">On August 13, 1999, the district court issued its opinion and order overruling Spruill\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>U.S. v. Spruill, </em>61 F.Supp.2d 587 (W.D.Tex.1999). Concerning the protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tive order, the opinion states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cThe Defendant informed the ADA that he would agree to the entry of the order. Based on that representation, the ADA printed a standard restraining order and invited the Defendant to come sign that order. The Defendant came in to the ADA\u2019s office for that purpose. The Defendant informed the ADA that he could not read. The ADA explained the restraining order to the Defendant. In particular, the ADA informed the Defendant that he could not go within a set distance of his spouse, children or mother-in-law\u2019s home. The ADA did not inform the Defendant that, upon entry of the order, the Defendant would not be able to possess a firearm. The ADA was not aware of this federal law and has never heard a party admonished to that effect in over one hundred protective orders he has handled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The ADA also explained to the Defendant that he could choose to hire counsel, object to the entry of the order, and appear before a state court judge. The Defendant stated that he would agree to the order, signed the order, and left. Although the language in this protective order states that the Defendant appeared in person, the <em>Defendant never appeared before a judge, nor was a hearing (at least as this Court would define one) apparently ever held. </em>Despite this, the order purported to find that family violence had occurred. This language, however, was contained in the proposed order which the Defendant signed without protest and the Defendant did have the <em>opportunity </em>to participate in a hearing, thus satisfying any procedural due process concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The district court subsequently sentenced Spruill to twenty-one months\u2019 confinement and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Spruill timely brought this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In his initial brief as appellant Spruill urged that the application to him of section 922(g)(8) violated his rights under the Fifth and Second Amendments, relying on the district court opinion in <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>46 F.Supp.2d 598 (N.D.Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>1999). The Government in appellee\u2019s brief urged that section 922(g)(8) was constitutional facially and as applied. We held Spruill\u2019s appeal in abeyance pending our resolution of the Government\u2019s appeal in <em>Emerson. </em>After issuance of our decision in that appeal, <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir.2001), we requested the parties to each file a supplemental brief addressing the following questions, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c(1) Does the evidence at the Rule 11 hearing, as well as the facts found by the district court in its order dated August 13, 1999, reflect that the predicate state court order alleged in count one of the indictment was not \u2018issued after a hearing\u2019 as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8)(A):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">(2) If so, did the district court err in accepting the plea of guilty to count one, and should this court vacate the conviction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In his supplemental brief, Spruill contends that each such question should be answered in the affirmative, and that his conviction should accordingly be vacated. The Government argues that as Spruill had, but waived, an opportunity to appear before the state judge and present evidence, any \u201chearing\u201d requirement of section 922(g)(8) was satisfied, and that in any event that issue is not within any exception to the waiver of appeal in Spruill\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AOt\">We turn to the issues addressed in the supplemental briefing, namely: (1) whether the evidence at the Rule 11 hearing and the facts found by the district court reflect that the predicate February 11, 1998 order was without the scope of section 922(g)(8) because it was not \u201cissued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice\u201d as required by section 922(g)(8)(A);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) if so, whether the trial court erred by accepting Spruill\u2019s guilty plea and whether this court should accordingly vacate his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AqG2\">1. Initially addressing the second issue, it is undisputed that <em>if </em>the February 11, 1998 order is not within the class of orders embraced in paragraph (A) of section 922(g)(8) that Spruill\u2019s possession of the firearm did not constitute a violation of section 922(g)(8). Accordingly, <em>if </em>the facts as shown at the Rule 11 hearing, and as found by the district court, do not reflect that the order was within the scope of paragraph (A) of section 922(g)(8), then it is clear the district court should not have accepted the guilty plea. As we said in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>194 F.3d 657, 659 (5th Cir.1999), <em>vacated and remanded, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>530 U.S. 1201, 120 S.Ct. 2193, 147 L.Ed.2d 230 (2000), <em>prior opinion reinstated with modification, </em>246 F.3d 749 (5th Cir.2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-5\">\u201cA trial court cannot enter judgment on a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f). \u2018The purpose underlying this rule is to protect a defendant who may plead with an understanding of the nature of the charge, but \u201cwithout realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the definition of the crime charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Oberski, </em>734 F.2d 1030, 1031 (5th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>546 F.2d 1225, 1226-27 (5th Cir.1977)). This factual basis must appear in the record and must be sufficiently specific to allow the court to determine that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u2018within the ambit of that defined as criminal.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The fact that Spruill\u2019s guilty plea reserved only the constitutional issues, and not whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an offense under the statute, neither lessens the foregoing Rule 11(f) requirement nor precludes reversal on appeal for failure to meet it. Thus, in <em>Johnson, </em>although we opined that the defendant, charged with arson under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), had, by unconditionally pleading guilty, \u201cwaived his as-applied constitutional challenge to \u00a7 844(i)\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 659, we nevertheless vacated the conviction \u201c[b]e-cause the factual basis presented to the district court fails to establish the interstate commerce element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662-63. We reaffirmed our opinion and holding in this respect on remand from the Supreme Court and also held that vacation was additionally required because \u201cthe factual basis for the plea as shown by the record likewise does not suffice\u201d to establish that the burned \u201cbuilding was being actively employed for commercial purposes so as to be within the terms of section 844(f).\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>246 F.3d at 752. <em>See also United States v. White, </em>258 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cnotwithstanding an unconditional plea of guilty, we will reverse on direct appeal where the factual basis for the plea as shown of record fails to establish an element of the offense of conviction\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Nor do we conclude that review at this stage is barred by the waiver of appeal provisions in Spruill\u2019s plea agreement. In <em>White </em>we noted that a similar appeal waiver-as here, of issues not raised in this motion to dismiss the indictment-was \u201cinsufficient to accomplish an intellig\u00e9nt waiver of the right not to prosecuted (and imprisoned) for conduct that does not violate the law\u201d and \u201c[w]e rejected] the government\u2019s waiver argument, especially since failure to do so risks depriving a person of his liberty for conduct that does not constitute an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. We are cited to no opinion of this court which has enforced such an appeal waiver in analogous circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">2. Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to rule on the first issue presented in the supplemental briefing, essentially whether the predicate February 11, 1998 order was not \u201cissued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice\u201d, and was hence not within the scope of section 922(g)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">As the government recognizes, \u201c[t]he term \u2018hearing\u2019 in its legal context undoubtedly has a host of meanings.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>States v. Florida East Coast Railway Company, </em>410 U.S. 224, 93 S.Ct. 810, 818, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973). The same general thought is reflected in <em>United States v. Tannehill, </em>49 F.3d 1049, 1053 (5th Cir.1995), where, addressing the meaning of the term \u201chearing\u201d in the Speedy Trial Act, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cThe Act does not define what constitutes a \u2018hearing\u2019, ... In other contexts, \u2018hearing\u2019 has been defined in various ways. <em>See, e.g., Buxton v. Lynaugh, </em>879 F.2d 140, 144-45 (5th Cir.1989) (\u2018hearing\u2019, as used in habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), \u2018does not necessarily require an evidentiary hearing and ... factfinding based on a record can in some circumstances be adequate\u2019), <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1032, 110 S.Ct. 3295, 111 L.Ed.2d 803 (1990); <em>State v. Orris, </em>26 Ohio App.2d 87, 269 N.E.2d 623, 624 (1971) (the term \u2018hearing\u2019 suggests \u2018to \u201cgive audience to\u201d \u2019); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>721 (6th ed.1990) (defining \u2018hearing\u2019 as \u2018[a] proceeding of relative formality (though generally less formal than a trial), generally public, with definite issues of fact or law to be tried, in which witnesses are heard and evidence presented\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Similarly, \u201chearing\u201d is not defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (defining terms for purposes of chapter 44) or in chapter 1 of Title 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">It is evident from the record, the district court\u2019s findings and the \u201cAgreed Order\u201d recitals in the protective order (see note 1 <em>supra), </em>that that order was issued as an \u201cAgreed Order\u201d pursuant to section 85.005 of the Texas Family Code,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> without process having been issued or served, without any time or place for hearing having previously been set, and, thus necessarily, without any notice of hearing having been issued or been received by Spruill, without Spruill ever appearing before the judge, without any presentation of evidence to the judge and without any hearing. The special procedure contemplated by section 85.005 is in contrast to those required in the Texas Family Code provisions for other protective orders, which require issuance and service of notice of the application, sections 82.042, 82.043, that the court set a date and time for hearing, section 84.001, that the notice of application show the date, time and place of the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>section 82.041, that \u201c[a]t the close of a hearing\u201d the court \u201cshall\u201d make findings as to whether family violence had occurred and is likely to occur in the future and, if so, \u201cshall render a protective order,\u201d section 85.001, and that a protective order may be issued \u201con a respondent who does not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the application and notice of the hearing.\u201d Section 85.006.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here no hearing was ever set and Spruill received no notice of any hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Significantly, the court\u2019s approval of the order agreed to out of court by Spruill under section 85.005 \u201cto facilitate settlement\u201d clearly does not carry with it the same degree of assurance that the issuing court itself determined that such an order was necessary to prevent family violence as would an order issued after an actual hearing. In <em>Emerson </em>we noted Second Amendment concerns respecting section 922(g)(8), but concluded that where the state law and procedures were such that the order should not issue unless the issuing court actually concluded that absent the order there was a realistic threat of imminent physical injury to the protected party, such concerns were not controlling, for \u201c[i]n such a case, we conclude that the nexus between firearm possession by the party so enjoined and the threat of lawless violence, is sufficient, though likely barely so, to support the deprivation, while the order remains in effect, of the enjoined party\u2019s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264. Where the court, without any setting or hearing and without the parties being before it, merely approves and issues an order because the parties have agreed to it \u201cto facilitate settlement\u201d and it \u201cis in the best interest of the applicant, the family or household, or a member of the family or household\u201d (section 85.005), there would be a real question as to whether the requisite nexus has been established. As the court explained in <em>Janus Films Inc. v. Miller, </em>801 F.2d 578, 583 (2d Cir.1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201c... With a true \u2018consent judgment\u2019 all of the relief to be provided by the judgment and all of the wording to effectuate that relief is agreed to by the parties. <em>The court makes no determination of the merits of the controversy or of the relief to be awarded. With a \u2018settlement judgment\u2019 </em>the parties have agreed on the components of a judgment, including the basis aspects of relief, but have not agreed on all the details or the wording of the judgment. The components of the agreement are usually reported to the court on the record. As <em>with a consent judgment, the judge makes no determination of the merits of the controversy. </em>With respect to relief, however, the judge\u2019s role in a settlement judgment is slightly broader. Since the parties have agreed only upon the basic aspect of relief, the judge is obliged to determine the detailed terms of the relief and the wording of the judgment. In determining the details of relief, the judge may not award whatever relief would have been appropriate after an adjudication on the merits, but only those precise forms of relief that are either agreed to by the parties ... or fairly implied by their agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>In deciding whether to approve agreements calling for entry of either a consent judgment or a settlement judgment, <em>a court normally has only a limited role </em>so long as the dispute affects only private interests. <em>See United States v. City of Miami, </em>614 F.2d 1322, 1330 (5th Cir.1980). <em>Though the judge does not \u2018merely sign on the line,\u2019 United States v. City of Miami, </em>664 F.2d 435, 440 (5th Cir.1981), <em>he or she normally makes only the minimal determination of whether the agreement is appropriate to be accorded the status of a judicially enforceable decree.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em>531 Pa. 272, 612 A.2d 426, 429 (1992), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cWe have held in the past, and we do so again, that a hearing intends a judgment bench attended by judges or officials sitting in a judicial capacity, prepared to listen to both sides of the dispute and to <em>consider deeply, </em>reflect broadly, and decide impartially, and <em>the mere consideration of a report moving across one\u2019s desk, is not a hearing.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. supra, </em>724 A.2d at 1113-14 (announcement of zoning appeal settlement at pretrial conferences before court, with court ascertaining that all agreed, and subsequent enforcement evidentiary hearing, did not meet requirement of a statute requiring that court action on zoning appeal be \u201cafter a hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The district court held that the entry of the February 11, 1998 order did not deny Spruill procedural due process because he did not have to sign and consent to it and had he not done so a hearing would have been set and he would have had notice thereof and an opportunity to participate and present evidence. 61 F.Supp. at 588.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the issue we address is not whether the state court order was itself valid or its terms enforceable against Spruill \u2014 that order does not address firearm possession by Spruill and his possession of the firearm did not violate the order. Rather, the relevant issue is whether the protective order here \u2014 issued under section 85.005 without any prior setting or hearing and without the parties being before it \u2014 is within the scope of section 922(g)(8)(A)\u2019s requirement that the order have been \u201cissued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice.\u201d Obviously, the mere fact that the protective order may itself be enforced without violating the respondent\u2019s procedural due process rights does not mean that it is within the scope of section 922(g)(8)(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>For example, <em>once </em>a respondent receives proper notice of a temporary protective order against him that has been issued without prior notice to him, <em>that </em>order can, consistent with due process, thereafter be enforced against him even though he had no notice prior to its entry. Yet such an order is plainly <em>outside </em>the scope of section 922(g)(8)(A). We believe that section 922(g)(8)(A) is best understood as not directed only to procedural due process concerns but as well to the concept that federal legislation should not affix to state court domestic relation protective orders the collateral effect of imposing serious federal felony penalties for conduct not violative of the order itself or otherwise illegal, <em>unless </em>a judge has conscientiously indeed concluded, after an actual hearing, that such was reasonably necessary to prevent otherwise likely conduct as described in section 922(g)(8)(B) and (C), <em>as opposed </em>to the judge merely approving without an actual hearing an order agreed to by parties out of court \u201cto facilitate settlement,\u201d a process in which, as stated in <em>Janus Films, supra, </em>the judge \u201cnormally has only a limited role,\u201d generally \u201cmakes no determination of the merits,\u201d and \u201cnormally makes only the minimal determination of whether the agreement is appropriate to be accorded the status of a judicially enforceable decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The government urges that \u201chearing\u201d as used in section 922(g)(8)(A) means \u201can opportunity to be heard, to present one\u2019s side of the case, or to be generally known or appreciated,\u201d one of the definitions given in <em>Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>535 (10th ed.1996).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>adopt this definition. For the reasons stated, and particularly as applied in this case, it would not address the hearing concerns which we believe are implicit in section 922(g)(8)(A), and might well raise serious Second Amendment issues. Moreover, the government\u2019s proffered definition is obviously not directed primarily at judicial (or even quasi-judicial) proceedings but extends as much to purely social or other non-governmental situations (e.g., \u201cto be generally known or appreciated\u201d). In <em>Florida East Coast Railway </em>the Supreme Court gave \u201ca broad definition of the term \u2018hearing\u2019 \u201d, which did not include the right to present evidence orally, cross-examine witnesses or present oral argument, because \u201cthe term was used in granting authority to the Commission to make rules and regulations of a prospective nature\u201d <em>(id. </em>93 S.Ct. at 818-19) which were of a general character applicable to numerous parties <em>(id. </em>at 820). The Court there specifically distinguished other of its decisions as to what constituted a \u201chearing\u201d on the basis that they involved \u201c \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819, 820. Here, section 922(g)(8)(A) is plainly directed to judicial proceedings, pointing to a narrower, rather than a broader, meaning of \u201chearing.\u201d Further, the government\u2019s suggested definition of hearing would in essence have section 922(g)(8)(A) say that an opportunity for a noticed hearing must have been afforded, or that the order be one that was issued after the person had been afforded the opportunity to be heard on actual notice with right to participate. But, that is not what section 922(g)(8)(A) says. What section 922(g)(8)(A) <em>actually </em>says is that the order must be one \u201cissued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had an opportunity to participate.\u201d The ordinary, natural meaning of this is that there must have been an actual hearing-as we said in <em>Emerson, </em>270 F.3d at 261, and as the district court stated here (\u201c[defendant never appeared before a judge, nor was a hearing (at least as this court would define one) apparently ever held,\u201d 61 F.Supp.2d at 588). <em>See also Willimantic Car Wash, Inc., </em>724 A.2d at 1110, as to the \u201ccommon, generally understood meaning\u201d of \u201chearing\u201d (quoted in note 11 supra). Moreover, the wording of section 922(g)(8)(A) likewise expressly requires that the defendant have \u201creceived actual notice\u201d of the hearing, which necessarily means that the hearing must have been set for a particular time and place and the defendant must have received notice of that and thereafter the hearing must have been held at that time and place. None of these things occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In construing section 922(g)(8)(A) we are likewise influenced by two other considerations to give it a narrower rather than a broader scope. First, the scope of a criminal statute, unless it is clear and unambiguous (an attribute the government does not claim for section 922(g)(8)(A)), is to be strictly, and not expansively, construed. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 1912, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A narrower, rather than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>broader, construction of section 922(g)(8)(A) is likewise indicated because that enactment affixes to state court domestic relations orders the collateral effect of imposing serious federal felony penalties for conduct not violative of the order itself or otherwise illegal (indeed even for conduct which the order might expressly authorize), and hence intrudes into the regulation of domestic relations and court orders related thereto that are paradigmatic areas of state concern and control, all with only the most remote and attenuated relation to interstate commerce. To avoid expanding that intrusion the class of orders covered by section 922(g)(8)(A) should be narrowly, not broadly, construed under the principle that \u201cunless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). <em>See also Jones </em>at 1912 (quoting <em>Bass </em>in this respect).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the February 11, 1998 order was not one entered \u201cafter a hearing of which\u201d Spruill \u201creceived actual notice\u201d and accordingly was not within the scope of section 922(g)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The judgment of conviction is therefore vacated and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\">.

Falzone, </em>1998 WL 351471 (D.Conn.1998), a \u00a7 922(g)(8) prosecution in which the defendant did <em>not </em>claim that the predicate state court order was issued without a hearing, or that he did not have adequate notice of the hearing, but rather that \"he did not receive an opportunity to participate in the state court hearing at the conclusion of which the protection order was issued against him.\u201d The defendant appeared in person and with his lawyer at the hearing, and his lawyer \"had the opportunity to raise objections to the entry of the protective order.\u201d The only contention in the federal prosecution was that defendant had had inadequate time to consult with his lawyer prior to the latter's \u201c 'snap' decision not to contest the entry of the protective order.\u201d It is evident that no request for a recess or continuance was made in the state proceedings, and the district court found that the lawyer's action \"was certainly reasonable.\u201d It concluded that the protective order hearing was one \"at which\u201d the defendant \"had an opportunity to participate\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 922(g)(8)(A), and that the entry of the protective order did not violate defendant's procedural due process rights.

This definition is cited in <em>United States v.

Wilson, the defendant in that case, also contended that he was entitled to acquittal \"because the hearing he was given [on the protective order] did not meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause,\u201d but the Seventh Circuit rejected that contention. <em>Id. </em>at 289-90. Its recital of the facts reflects that Wilson's wife (or former wife) had obtained an ex parte emergency protective order against Wilson and this was served on Wilson, the order stating that a hearing would be held on a plenary protection order on September 1, at 1 p.m., and thereafter Wilson, his wife and her attorney appeared in court on that day and time. Wilson, <em>pro se, </em>then filed a motion to vacate a default dissolution of marriage previously entered by the judge, Hill, and a motion for Judge Hill to recuse himself. Both motions were granted \"and Judge David Correll took over the case. Wilson, Thomas [the wife\u2019s lawyer] and Judge Correll then retired to Judge Correll's chambers for the scheduled hearing on the entry of a plenary order of protection ... against Wilson while Angela [the wife] and Wilson's mother ... waited outside.\u201d The \"meeting in Judge Correll's chambers lasted no more than ten minutes. During the meeting, Judge Correll explained the proposed order of protection to Wilson, who indicated he did not have a problem with any of its terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. In rejecting the \"Due Process\u201d challenge to the order, the Seventh Circuit stated that \u201cWilson had notice of the hearing that took place on September 1,\u201d that he was afforded an \"opportunity at the hearing\u201d before Judge Correll to present reasons why the order should not issue, and \"that Wilson, although proceeding <em>pro se </em>at the time, had successfully persuaded another judge to vacate a default divorce that had been entered and then recuse himself from the case. Wilson was thus competent to lodge an objection to the protective order, and he was given the ability to do so.
