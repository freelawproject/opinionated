L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, applies to provisional promotions or is limited to original provisional appointments only. The plaintiff argues that the veterans\u2019 preference is a lifelong entitlement, which continues throughout an employee\u2019s State service and applies to both original provisional appointments and provisional promotions. The Civil Service Commission (commission) argues that the benefit is limited to original provisional appointments, and does not extend to provisional promotions. We agree with the commission and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">The facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, a veteran, was provisionally employed by the Department of Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Protection (DEP) in the position of Environmental Analyst I. After receiving the benefit of the veterans\u2019 preference under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, to obtain this position, he applied for the positions of Environmental Analyst II and III, and again sought the benefit of veterans\u2019 preference. The DEP declined to grant him the preference, and he was not promoted. Pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 2(6), he then appealed to the commission, which also ruled against him on the basis that the veterans\u2019 preference applied only to provisional appointments and not to provisional promotions. He sought review in the Superior Court, which affirmed the commission. He now appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Original and promotional appointments under the civil service system are made from a list of persons who have met the requirements for eligibility. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 6-8. When there are no eligible persons available for a position, the statute provides for provisional appointments, which are \u201c \u2018permitted only in what are supposed to be exceptional instances\u2019 which will end when a list of eligibles becomes available. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14.\u201d <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, Local 526, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 649, 651-652 (1989), quoting from <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>304 Mass. 27, 29 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The veterans\u2019 preference is a legislatively created mechanism under which veterans receive a preference over non-veterans in certain types of civil service employment. See generally <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>192 Mass. 299, 304 (1906). Section 26, as inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a711, governing the veterans\u2019 preference, provides, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cThe names of persons who pass examinations for original appointment to any position in the official service shall be placed on eligible lists in the following order: (1) disabled veterans, in the order of their respective standings; (2) veterans, in the order of their respective standings; (3) widows or widowed mothers of veterans who were killed in action or died from a service connected disability incurred in wartime service, in the order of their respective standings; (4) all others, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>order of their respective standings. Upon receipt of a requisition, names shall be certified from such lists according to the method of certification prescribed by the rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cAn appointing authority shall appoint a veteran in making a provisional appointment under section twelve, unless such appointing authority shall have obtained from the administrator a list of all veterans who, within the twelve months next preceding, have filed applications for the kind of work called for by such provisional appointment, shall have mailed a notice of the position vacancy to each of such veterans and shall have determined that none of such veterans is qualified for or is willing to accept the appointment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Both promotions which the plaintiff sought were provisional.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The plaintiff argues that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, the sole source of civil service preference for veterans, does not limit the veterans\u2019 preference to original entry into the civil service system. He argues that \u00a7 12, to which \u00a7 26 refers, is not limited to original entry appointments, and that, therefore, \u00a7 26 cannot be so limited. The plaintiff further submits that the judge erred in failing to determine whether he was qualified for the position he sought. We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Applying the principles of statutory interpretation, see, e.g., G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423, 428 (1974); <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>393 Mass. 490, 497 (1984), we construe the language of \u00a7 26 to limit the veterans\u2019 preference to original appointments. The opening sentence of the section explicitly refers to \u201cpersons who pass examinations for <em>original </em>appointment\u201d (emphasis added). The second paragraph of \u00a7 26 refers to the \u201cpreference provided for in this section,\u201d referencing the express language of the first paragraph. The fifth paragraph of \u00a7 26, quoted <em>supra, </em>provides for appointment of a veteran in provisional \u201cappointment [s] under section twelve,\u201d i.e., ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>pointments made when a suitable list of eligible persons who have passed a civil service examination for the position does not exist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nothing in \u00a7 26 refers to a veterans\u2019 preference in promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Because \u00a7 26 makes no reference to promotions, the well-known maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another, applies. See, e.g., <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Hous. Authy., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975); <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of </em>Boston, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 663, 666 n.12 (1987). The use of the term \u201coriginal appointment\u201d without any reference to \u201cpromotion\u201d implies the exclusion of the latter. We do not employ this principle, however, if its application frustrates the general purposes of the legislation. <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc., </em>368 Mass, at 432. Here, the application of the maxim is in harmony with the purpose of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, which is to provide a preference to veterans who pass examinations and are otherwise eligible for appointment to the civil service. <em>Ransom </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>192 Mass, at 304. This construction is consistent with a policy that prefers veterans in hiring, but does not favor them once they have obtained civil service employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Nevertheless, the plaintiff maintains that he was seeking a provisional appointment, not a provisional promotion. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cappointment\u201d is \u201c[t]he act of appointing or designating for an office or position\u201d; \u201cpromotion\u201d is commonly defined as an \u201cadvancement in rank or responsibility.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary (3d ed. 1992). When we apply the common definitions of the terms, it is clear that the plaintiff was seeking a promotion, not an original appointment. The very titles of the positions are also instructive. The plaintiff occupied the position of Environmental Analyst I and sought the position of Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Analyst II or III. All three positions are part of the \u201cEnvironmental Analyst Series,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which includes positions of Environmental Analyst from levels I-VI. There are duties common to all levels in the series, with increasing responsibilities given to the higher level jobs. There was an attendant increase in salary. In light of these factors, we conclude that the position the plaintiff sought was an advancement in both rank and responsibility, and consequently, a promotion. From our review of G. L. c. 31, the veterans\u2019 preference does not extend to provisionally employed veterans seeking provisional promotions to higher positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Section 12 is similarly silent on the issue of provisional promotions. Moreover, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 15, as inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, which permits an appointing authority to \u201cmake a provisional promotion of a civil service employee in one title to the next higher title in the same departmental unit\u201d makes no reference to veterans\u2019 preference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> A \u201cseries\u201d is defined by the civil service statute as a \u201cvertical grouping of related titles so that they form a career ladder.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, as inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
