As nothing has been made to appear that would cause us to depart from the settled principle that, \u201c[ajbsent fraud, errors of law or fact are not sufficient grounds to set aside an award\u201d <em>(Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 [1990]), we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>We summarize the pertinent facts, which are undisputed. The association represents \u201call employees of [Peabody\u2019s] Police Department who hold the rank of patrolman, sergeant, lieutenant, and captain.\u201d In 1972, the city and the association agreed that all officers working the Sunday day shift should have a one-hour lunch period. In 1982, the association negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement. Article XIX, \u00a7 1, of that agreement provided in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cPresent policy and practice as to employees having lunch and dinner and taking reliefs shall continue in force and effect, subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c(a) Effective November 21, 1982, employees working days, and on the Police Department payroll as of said date, shall work an additional one-half (Vi) hour per day, and shall be paid overtime therefor, and take a one-half (Vi) hour lunch period as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c(ii) Each such employee shall receive a one-half (Vi) hour lunch period between the hours of 12 noon and 1:30 P.M.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Notwithstanding the contract language, the officers who worked the Sunday day shift continued to enjoy a one-hour Sunday lunch until 1988 when the city and the police chief discontinued the practice. The association then filed a grievance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that its employees were entitled to a one-hour lunch period on Sundays.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Based on the agreement\u2019s preservation of past practice and the police department\u2019s long standing one-hour Sunday lunch practice, an American Arbitration Association arbitrator to whom the grievance was submitted concluded that the \u201cpar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ties intended the day shift\u2019s one-hour Sunday lunch to be a practice that would continue with the one-half hour lunch period applying to Monday through Saturday.\u201d He therefore ruled that discontinuing one-hour Sunday lunches violated the collective bargaining agreement and ordered the city to restore the one-hour Sunday lunches and grant officers denied those lunches compensatory time off. The city petitioned the Superior Court to vacate the award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *; the association counterclaimed to confirm. Judgment was entered confirming the award. The city then appealed, arguing that, in reinstating one-hour Sunday lunches based on departmental past practice, the arbitrator impermissibly exceeded the boundaries of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The city relies for its position on <em>Grobet File Co. of America </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 134-135 (1988).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That case, however, contradicts the city\u2019s position and provides supportive legal framework for our acceptance of the arbitrator\u2019s determinations. \u201cAlthough that case recognizes that an arbitrator may not [make an] award . . . beyond a limit clearly established by the contract, \u2018the limiting boundaries . . . must be set forth with clarity, and the limiting words must be plain. If there is room for doubt or interpretation on the question, then the issue properly lies within the broad authority conferred upon arbitrators of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>disputes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass, at 1008, quoting from <em>Grobet File Co. of America </em>v. <em>RFC Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 135. \u201cOnce in the arena of arbitration, the powers of the arbitrator concerning the issue are wide and the scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings is narrow.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If it were \u201cotherwise [, the court] would [be] under min [ing] the predictability, certainty, and effectiveness of the arbitral forum that has been voluntarily chosen by the parties.\u201d <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Tagaris, </em>395 Mass. 397, 400 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is well known that a \u201clabor arbitrator\u2019s source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law \u2014 the practices of the industry and the shop \u2014 is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 581-582 (1960).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It thus follows that an arbitrator may rely on past practice to clarify ambiguous contract provisions, see <em>Boise Cascade Corp. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers, AFL-CIO, Local Union No. 7001, </em>588 F.2d 127, 128-130 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>International Bhd. of Elec. Wkrs., Local Union No. 199 </em>v. <em>United Tel. Co., </em>738 F.2d 1564 (11th Cir. 1984); to resolve contractual silence, see <em>Fairview Southdale Hosp. </em>v. <em>Minnesota Nurses Assn., </em>943 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1991); or to close gaps in general contract provisions, see <em>Cape Cod Gas Co. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers, Local 13507, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 260-261 (1975). In the circumstances presented here, \u201c[t]he interpretation of the contract was for the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass, at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Here, as in the <em>Grobet File Co. </em>case, the boundaries of the contract were not plain or distinct. Article XIX appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>subject police employees\u2019 existing lunch practices (presumably including the traditional one-hour Sunday lunch) to the provisions of subsection (a)(ii), expressly limiting each working day\u2019s lunch period to one-half hour. Article XXIII, \u00a7 2, however, provided that preexisting \u201cbenefits, privileges [and] working conditions ... not specifically covered by this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d Although the subject of lunches was covered by the agreement, the one-hour Sunday lunch practice for day shift employees was not specifically mentioned. An ambiguity consequently existed in the agreement which, under the <em>Grobet File Co. </em>case and a long line of precedents,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we think an arbitrator permissibly could resolve by interpreting the ambiguous contract language in the light of past practice. See and compare <em>Lenox Educ. Assn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>393 Mass. 276, 283 (1984); Elkouri &amp; Elkouri, How Arbitration Works 451-454, 454-455 (4th ed. 1985). Contrast <em>Detroit Coil Co. </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Wkrs., Lodge No. 82, </em>594 F.2d 575, 580-581 (6th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The parties\u2019 agreement here did not purport to withdraw the power of interpretation from the arbitrator but rather prohibited the arbitrator from issuing any award that wofild \u201calter, amend, add to or subtract from the express provisions\u201d of the agreement.\u201d Recognizing and acting within that limitation, the arbitrator viewed his award as enforcing the express provisions of Article XXIII preserving past practices not specifically covered elsewhere in the agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In short, the arbitrator\u2019s award and opinion were \u201csquarely within the reference which raised the issue whether the [city] violated [Article XXIII, \u00a7 2] of the collective bargaining agreement. The award was entirely responsive to that issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>finding a violation.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Assn., </em>398 Mass. 703, 706 (1986). The arbitrator\u2019s award and opinion show that he \u201cwas faithful to his obligations, even if he may have been in error in his interpretation of the . . . agreement. His conclusion is not so implausible as to justify our overturning it.\u201d <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>392 Mass. 184, 188 (1984). Deciding as we do, we have no occasion to discuss whether the award is saved because the arbitrator could have found that the parties modified or waived the half-hour lunch provision. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass, at 1007-1008; <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers, Local 8751, AFL-CIO, CLC, 29 </em>Mass.
