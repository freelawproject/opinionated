The judge also found that the defendant unlawfully interfered with the plaintiff and awarded similar loss of profit damages. Those damages were doubled pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and emotional distress damages in the amount of $10,000 were added resulting in the entry of a judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $768,644 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Judgment was also entered for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for unpaid rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The judge found that the defendant had violated an express lease provision by unreasonably withholding his consent to the plaintiffs assignment of his leasehold interest to a potential purchaser of the plaintiffs restaurant business. He also concluded that the defendant had violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, by a course of conduct which, in totality, constituted a \u201clarger plan to avoid his contractual obligations and to undermine [the plaintiffs] desperate efforts to sell the restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">1. <em>The G. L. c. 93A claim. </em>We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that, in the circumstances of the pleadings and trial of this case, the judge erred in basing liability under c. 93A on a totality of conduct analysis. The plaintiff in his original complaint had sought a declaration of his right to assign his leasehold interest (Count I), and he had alleged breach of contract (Count II) and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage (Count III). The request for declaratory relief was later waived. The plaintiffs c. 93A claim (Count IV) was first disclosed in an amended complaint in which he alleged that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct in filing meritless Default Notices and a Notice of Termination of [the plaintiffs] tenancy subsequent to and in direct retaliation for [the plaintiffs] commencement of this lawsuit constitute unfair and deceptive acts and practices, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the provisions of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his opening statement, plaintiffs counsel repeatedly referred to the c. 93A claim as being related to the retaliatory acts of the defendant which occurred after the plaintiff filed suit. In requests for findings filed at the commencement of the trial, he defined the c. 93A violations in terms of the defendant\u2019s retaliatory actions. The first articulation of a totality of conduct claim, encompassing acts which occurred both before and after the filing of suit, surfaced during the plaintiff\u2019s closing arguments and in his supplemental requests for findings filed after the close of evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The issue is whether the defendant received adequate notice of the totality of conduct claim, and that question must be examined in light of the objectives of c. 93A. Among the prime goals of the statute is the \u201cpromotion of reasonable settlement offers.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 857 (1983). \u201cIndeed, the conduct proscribed by the statute is as much the failure to make a reasonable settlement offer as it is the substantive violation of c. 93A.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Section 11, the provision invoked by the plaintiff in his c. 93A claim, permits a party responding to a complaint to avoid penalty damages by tendering a reasonable settlement offer <em>with his answer.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Given the high stakes connotations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>c. 93A allegations, see <em>Cassano </em>v. <em>Gogos, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351 (1985), and the fact that a damage-limiting tender of settlement ordinarily must be filed before meaningful discovery can be obtained, it is imperative, if a defendant is not to be placed at an unfair disadvantage, that the complaint, the first statutorily required identification of unlawful activity under \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> give fair notice of the precise nature of the plaintiffs allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Here, the plaintiff chose essentially to limit his c. 93A count and his response to discovery concerning the amended complaint to a claim that the defendant retaliated against the bringing of the instant action by filing default and eviction notices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant, knowing that he had not pursued the threat to evict, reasonably may have been lulled into treating the articulated c. 93A claim lightly since no injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property or pocketbook, attributable to the notices, was apparent, and, therefore, no award of significant penalty damages or attorney\u2019s fees was likely. Consequently, he had little reason to tender an offer of settlement with his answer. Moreover, while pretrial discovery and the plaintiff\u2019s evidence may have supported a theory of an unlawful \u201clarger plan\u201d on the part of the defendant, that information and proof was also consistent with the claims of lease violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and unlawful interference and, therefore, was unlikely to alert a reasonable defendant to the presence of a broader c. 93A attack than that specified in the complaint. The defendant\u2019s failure to object to such otherwise relevant evidence does not support a concept of implied consent to a totality of conduct claim under c. 93A. See <em>Christianson </em>v. <em>Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 814-815 (1988). It would be fundamentally unfair, in the circumstances, to impose upon the defendant a result which was not foretold by the pleadings or the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Messina </em>v. <em>Scheft, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 945, 946 (1985); <em>Harrington-McGill </em>v. <em>Old Mother Hubbard Dog Food Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 966, 968 (1986). Consequently, the award of double damages and attorney\u2019s fees must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">While the judge could well find that the retaliatory actions of the defendant constituted a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, there is no need to remand the case for further findings in view of the absence of evidence required by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, that the plaintiff suffered \u201cany loss of money or property.\u201d The plaintiff was never evicted from the leased premises. The only evidence of any effect caused by the defendant\u2019s default and eviction notices was that the plaintiff engaged in an investigation of the charges made and drafted and mailed two letters in response to them. In <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33 (1975), the Supreme Judicial Court, strictly interpreting a similar \u201closs of money or property\u201d requirement in \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> stated that \u201c \u2018money\u2019 means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>money, not time, and that \u2018property\u2019 means the kind of property that is purchased or leased, not such intangibles as a right to a sense of security, to peace of mind, or to personal liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45. This court has utilized the <em>Baldassari </em>definition in \u00a7 11 cases. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Bendetson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 566-567 (1978); <em>Homsi </em>v. <em>C. H. Babb Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 474, 480-481 (1980); <em>Bump </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 312 (1987). Focusing on the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of \u00a7 11, the court in <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 718 (1989), stated: \u201cUnder \u00a7 11, a plaintiff must be entitled to relief in some other respect in order to be entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. ... A plaintiff suing under \u00a7 11, however, cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees for merely identifying an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under \u00a7 11, that unfair or deceptive conduct must have had some adverse effect upon the plaintiff, even if it is not quantifiable in dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3Y\">Notwithstanding that the defendant\u2019s retaliatory tactics may have constituted a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, the plaintiff has not shown any entitlement to relief under \u00a711. He brought no proof of loss of money or property, as those terms are defined in <em>Baldassari, </em>before the court. The most that the judge could determine, on remand, is that the plaintiff expended some of his own time in reaction to the threat of eviction. Since the conduct complained of and found wanting in <em>Baldassari </em>included \u201cthreats of legal actions never subsequently commenced\u201d which caused emotional, distress and a loss of time to the plaintiff, <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass, at 35, 45, the plaintiffs similar loss must be construed as something less than the \u201cadverse effect\u201d contemplated by <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass, at 718.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We acknowledge, as did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>court in <em>Baldassari, </em>that such narrow interpretation of the words \u201closs of money or property\u201d is \u201cnot entirely satisfactory.\u201d See <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>410 Mass. 855, 864 (1991), citing <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, supra </em>at 44-46. As was demonstrated with respect to \u00a7 9, however, an appropriate expansion of available remedies readily can be accomplished by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">2. <em>The contract, tort, and rent claims. </em>We reject the contention that the judge applied an erroneous standard in ruling that the defendant unreasonably withheld his consent to an assignment of the lease. The judge\u2019s findings reflect that he properly and carefully took into account the lease\u2019s use restrictions in determining whether the defendant violated the provision that his written consent to an assignment would \u201cnot be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\u201d He appropriately tested the defendant\u2019s conduct against the \u201cusual standards of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Nassif </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>340 Mass. 557, 565 (1960), correctly considered objective factors relating to the defendant\u2019s interest in the property and the lease, <em>Worcester-Tatnuck Square CVS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503-504 (1992), and interpreted the consent clause in the light of the other lease provisions, <em>Mutual Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Hoague-Sprague Corp., </em>297 Mass. 294, 301 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The judge properly articulated and applied the correct legal standard for the tort of interference with an advantageous relationship. <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11, 19 (1982), and authorities cited. His findings that the defendant\u2019s \u201cadamant and intentional conduct\u201d in refusing to consent to an assignment \u201ctranscended a mere breach of contract,\u201d \u201cwas wrongful and without justification and therefore malicious,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and was part of a plan to undermine the plaintiffs efforts to sell his restaurant fulfilled the requirements of that standard and were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Given the defendant\u2019s unreasonable withholding of consent to an assignment of the lease, the plaintiff was relieved of his obligations to pay rent thereafter. <em>Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northeast Realty Corp., </em>361 Mass. 552, 557 (1972). <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Agnastopoulos, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 672, 681 (1986). We, therefore, affirm the judgment for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for unpaid rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">3. <em>Damages. </em>In his \u201cRulings of Law\u201d on the count for unlawful interference, the judge awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $10,000 for emotional distress. His decision contains no discussion or findings concerning the nature of the distress, the conduct which caused it, see <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976), or the basis upon which he concluded that the plaintiff had carried \u201cthe difficult burden of proof applicable to all intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.\u201d <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>410 Mass, at 869. The plaintiffs damages, therefore, must be reduced by the $10,000 awarded for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The damages awarded for loss of profits ($379,322) are supported in the record by the testimony of an accountant who was called by the plaintiff. While it is arguable that his computation of loss of profits was puzzling, we cannot state that the judge\u2019s acceptance of his uncontradicted testimony involved an abuse of discretion. <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 43 (1944). <em>Homsi </em>v. <em>C. H. Babb Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">4. <em>Disposition. </em>We affirm the judgment for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and so much of the judgment as awards to the plaintiff damages in the amount of $379,322 on Counts II and III and vacate the award of double damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and the award of damages for emotional distress. We remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion, together with statutory interest and costs. The request for fees and costs of appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This complaint more appropriately should have been styled a supplemental pleading.

App. Ct. 348 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The plaintiff indulges in an unacceptably strained reading of his amended complaint by arguing that a prefatory and routine incorporation by reference of the background and damage paragraphs of his contract and tort counts, repeated from his original complaint, served to notify the defendant that the c. 93A count encompassed more than the retaliatory threats of eviction. An attempt by the plaintiff to claim notice of a broader attack based on an answer to an interrogatory which similarly incorporates the entire complaint and contains a single ambiguous reference to the defendant\u2019s refusal to consent to a lease assignment also falls well short of establishing full and fair identification of a totality of conduct theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The record discloses no attempt by the plaintiff to further amend his complaint to conform to the evidence of a broader c. 93A theory than originally pleaded.

If such an amendment was not determined to be unfairly tardy, see <em>BBF, Inc. </em>v. <em>Germanium Power Devices Corp., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 166, 178 (1982), the defendant would have had an opportunity to amend his answer, Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), and tender a damage-limiting offer of settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b339-13\">By St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 1, the Legislature, apparently in reaction to the holding in <em>Baldassari, </em>see <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 158 (1985), deleted the \u201closs of money or property\u201d requirement in \u00a7 9 and replaced it with a much broader \u201c[a]ny person . . . who has been injured\u201d provision.

That reference may well be an indication that nominal property damage or financial loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>may serve as a fulcrum for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.
