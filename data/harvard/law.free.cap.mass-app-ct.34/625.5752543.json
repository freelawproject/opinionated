He suffered disabling injuries while per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>forming his duties, and pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the town placed him on leave and paid him his full salary, but only to the last day of the term of his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">A Superior Court judge granted Paparo\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment ordering the town to continue to pay Paparo until he was capable of returning to work, and the town appealed. We must resolve the question which the court left open in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 260 n.9 (1978) \u2014 whether a town may discontinue payment of \u00a7 11 IF benefits to an incapacitated police officer upon the expiration of the term of his appointment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2019 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that the town may not discontinue benefits, and we affirm th\u00e9 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Section 11 IF \u201cfilled a gap in the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act,\u201d <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 664 n.5 (1975); it was \u201cdesigned to do for police officers what c. 152 does for industrial workers who incur job related injuries,\u201d <em>DiGloria </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Methuen, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 512 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The section states that the benefits provided by that section continue \u201cfor the period of . . . incapacity,\u201d but they may not be paid after the officer has been retired or pensioned, nor after a town-designated physician determines that the officer is no longer incapacitated. These latter conditions, which do not exhaust all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>possible reasons for terminating \u00a7 11 IF benefits, see <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>388 Mass. 219, 225-226 (1983), express the legislative intent to prevent a police officer from receiving \u201cdouble benefits\u201d (e.g., pension plus full pay for disability) or a \u201cwindfall\u201d (e.g., full pay benefits plus capability to hold another job). <em>Id. </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Circumstances other than those just described have been held to disqualify an officer\u2019s claim to \u00a7 11 IF benefits \u2014 when an officer voluntarily resigned his position, as in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass, at 260, or when an officer was engaged in illegal conduct, as in <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>388 Mass at 226.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Jones, </em>the officer effectively waived his right to \u00a7 11 IF benefits; in <em>Hennessey, </em>the offiqer forfeited any claim to the continuation of wages. In both instances the termination of benefits did not frustrate any of the purposes served by \u00a7 11 IF. See <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, supra </em>at 225-226. These purposes include a legislative design to \u201cafford some protection to a disabled officer pending recovery,\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, supra </em>at 260. But, here, the police officer did not waive or forfeit his claim to benefits, and so long as he is disabled he is not in a position to obtain double pay or a windfall.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>342 Mass. 552, 556-557 (1961), the court held that the town could not terminate a disabled officer\u2019s \u00a7 11 IF benefits by terminating his probationary period even though the termination of the probationary period was within the town\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D. The court explained that the \u00a7 20D notice of termination \u201ccannot cut off an accrued right to a leave of absence with pay under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557. Even though <em>Thibeault </em>is described in <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridge-water, </em>388 Mass, at 225, as a \u201cholding [which] precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the city from using the officer\u2019s incapacity and resultant absence as reasons, under one statute [G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 20D], to withhold benefits provided by another statute [G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF,] to compensate for that very incapacity,\u201d that characterization does not diminish the principle that, absent some overriding disqualification such as waiver, forfeiture, pension, retirement, or termination of incapacity, rights to disability benefits, once accrued to the benefit of the disabled officer, cannot be cut off by the expiration of the period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We know of no sound reason to construe \u00a7 11 IF so as to permit the town to terminate benefits merely upon the expiration of a term of appointment where those benefits are otherwise payable by reason of an incapacity suffered because of an injury sustained in the performance of the officer\u2019s duties. The section itself contains no such express limitation. It is true, as the town argues, that it is not contemplated that the plaintiff will return to duty beyond the period of his appointment, see <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>388 Mass, at 226, but it is also true that the termination of disability benefits to an injured police officer before recovery and without manifest justification will work a very substantial discouragement to any person considering a time-limited appointment as a police officer \u2014 a result that the Legislature is not likely to have intended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The town is correct, however, in pointing out that the final judgment ordering the continuation of payments to the plaintiff \u201cuntil [he] can return to work\u201d does not take account of the possibility that the town may retire or pension the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff\u2019s incapacity may be found either by the town or by the town-designated physician to have terminated. Further, the rate of benefits to which the plaintiff is entitled should be specified, namely, the same rate of pay he was receiving when injured in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The judgment is vacated and a new judgment is to enter which (1) dismisses the complaint as to the board of selectmen and Elizabeth Steele and (2) is in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The relevant portion of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 149, provides: \u201cWhenever a police officer . . . of a city [or] town ... is incapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault \u00f3f his own, ... he shall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity; provided, that no such leave shall be granted for any period after such police officer . . . has been retired or pensioned in accordance with law or for any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers ... in such city [or] town . . . determines that such incapacity no longer exists.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The <em>Jones </em>case was decided on the basis of the plaintiffs voluntary resignation as a special police officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The fact that Paparo was a police officer for a term of months does not disqualify him from receiving \u00a7 11 IF benefits. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, supra </em>at 255-256.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">Police officers are not eligible to receive benefits provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\">See also <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Lunenburg, ante </em>606 (1993). <em>Dyer </em>arose under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 85H, but the operative language of \u00a7 85H and that of \u00a7 11 IF, so far as here material, are nearly identical. In <em>Dyer </em>the town, but not the town-designated physician, established that the call fire fighter was no longer incapacitated. The termination of benefits was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Under the provisions of \u00a7 11 IF, the town retains the right to designate a physician who may examine the plaintiff for the purpose of determining whether his incapacity continues to exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The town also argues that the civil service law does not permit the continuation of the plaintiff\u2019s employment without compliance with the numerous provisions of G. L. c. 31. The argument has no merit; the only issue before us is the interpretation to be given to \u00a7 111F.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
