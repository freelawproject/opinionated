The award was confirmed in the Superior Court, and the plaintiffs, defendants in counterclaim (the Barletta party), appealed, claiming principally that the arbitrators exceeded their powers. See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a)(3). We affirm in part and in part reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. In September, 1979, Leonard S. French, as trustee of the French Realty Trust,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sold a one-half interest in a substantial tract of undeveloped land in Norwood (the land) to Carmen A. Barletta, as trustee of the Barletta Realty Trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paragraph eight of the purchase and sale agreement (the 1979 agreement) stated that the parties have entered into a joint enterprise to develop the land into an industrial park, sharing expenses and profits equally. Barletta, the buyer, had the right \u201cto construct buildings for leasing at competitive prices, net profit not to exceed five (5%) per cent.\u201d The work of construction was to be undertaken by C.A. Barletta, Inc., a construction company owned by the buyer or such other company as the buyer may select with the approval of the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">After the land in Norwood was subdivided, a series of joint venture agreements was executed for the purpose of owning (through a \u201cnominee\u201d trust), constructing, leasing, and managing the subdivisions \u201cas an investment for the production of income.\u201d The first joint venture agreement was executed in September, 1981, and included the following arbitration clause: \u201cAll controversies, disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association . . . and judgment may be entered on any award rendered by the arbitrators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Four additional joint venture agreements, all containing substantially the same arbitration clause, were executed in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 1986. Four of the joint venture agreements relate to subdivisions of the Norwood property; one relates to property in Franklin. The five agreements contain virtually identical provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Each of the five agreements identifies the numerous signatories as belonging either to the French party or to the Barletta party; each party owned fifty percent of the profits and losses; each individual member within each party is assigned an ownership interest expressed as a portion of 100%; and each member could be called upon to make additional capital contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The compositions of the French party and the Barletta party are not identical for each of the five joint venture agreements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The number of participants in the Barletta party ranged from three members to six members; the number of participants in the French party ranged from four members to seven members.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The record also includes five, fixed-price construction agreements, each of which is between a nominee for each joint venture and First Norwood Corporation (FNC) as contractor. The record is silent on the point, but we assume, consistently with the 1979 agreement, that FNC was selected by Carmen Barletta and approved by Leonard French. The record is also silent as to the ownership of FNC, although we note that each construction contract was signed by either Carmen Barletta or J. Kenneth Barletta.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The joint ventures prospered in the 1980\u2019s but fell on hard times in 1989, and in November, 1989, six members of the Barletta party filed suit against five members of the French party to compel additional capital contributions in order to cover operating losses. The complaint refers only to the first three joint venture agreements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The French party responded by filing a motion to compel arbitration which, in the absence of an opposition by the Barletta party, was allowed. Five of the six members of the Barletta party who were named plaintiffs in the Superior Court action thereupon filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association with regard to; the same three joint venture agreements described in the complaint, naming as respondents four of the five members of the French party who were named as defendants in the Superior Court action, and adding one member of the French party who was not a defendant in the lawsuit. The claims asserted by the Barletta party were essentially the same as those expressed in their lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The members of the French party who were named as respondents in the first demand for arbitration filed an answer and a counterclaim with the arbitrators on March 19, 1990; they denied that there were any monies due the complainants, and their counterclaim alleged that the Barletta party, through entities owned or controlled by them, had paid themselves excessive sums and were \u201cskimming off\u201d funds of the joint venture otherwise available for operations of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">On April 4, 1990, the five members of the French party who were named as respondents in the first demand for arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tration filed their own separate demand for arbitration against eleven members of the Barletta party, including two persons as respondents who appear as part of the French party on one of the five joint venture agreements. This second demand for arbitration refers the reader to \u201cattachments\u201d for a description of the nature of the dispute and the claim or relief sought. The attachments, however, were not included in the record appendix, and we have no way of determining which joint venture agreements were put in issue, nor can we determine the issues to be arbitrated or the individuals involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In January of 1991, the panel of three arbitrators published their award. The award, which appears as an appendix to this opinion, recites that the arbitrators were designated in accordance with an arbitration agreement dated March 19, 1990, but no such agreement appears in the record appendix, and we lack information with regard to the parties to the agreement and the issues they agreed to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The arbitrators\u2019 award recites that it is issued in respect of the two arbitration cases which had been created in response to the two demands for arbitration. The award referred to fourteen \u2014 not five \u2014 joint venture agreements, and described the \u201cclaimants\u201d as \u201cCarmen A. Barletta, et al.,\u201d and the \u201crespondents\u201d as \u201cLeonard S. French, et al.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The arbitrators awarded $698,931 to the Barletta party with regard to fourteen joint venture agreements (separate amounts are set out for each of the agreements), and they awarded $1,033,613 to the French party, with the explanation that \u201cParagraph Eight of the 1979 purchase and sale agreement applies to construction. Share of excess profits <em>due French </em>- $1,033,613.\u201d The result of the award was a net amount of $334,682 due the French party, \u201cplus legal interest (12%) from July 31, 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The French party (consisting only of the defendants in the original Superior Court action) then filed an answer and counterclaim in the Superior Court action. Ignoring the undoubted discrepancy between (i) the parties whose interests were affected by the award of the arbitrators and (ii) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>parties to the Superior Court action, the French party set up the award of the arbitrators as the basis for their counterclaim and referred to thirteen joint venture agreements identified in the award of the arbitrators. The record is silent as to the ownership interests in eight of the thirteen joint venture agreements. On the same day they also filed in the same action a motion to confirm the award and for the entry of judgment. The plaintiffs moved to vacate, modify, or correct the award of the arbitrators. A judge of the Superior Court, after a hearing, confirmed the award and entered judgment in the amount of $334,682 in favor of the original five members of the French party, with joint and several liability of the six members of the Barletta party, and with interest from January 22, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We consider first the claims made by the six members of the Barletta party with regard to the confirmation of the award, mindful of the rule that \u201c[a] matter submitted to arbitration is subject to a very narrow scope of review.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. J. <em>Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">1. <em>The validity of the award of the arbitrators. </em>The Barletta party argues that the arbitrators exceeded their powers, see G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a)(3), for several reasons. They point to items three and four of the award, both of which refer to the work of construction. Item three refers to required repairs to the floor of the building owned by the second joint venture agreement; item four refers to \u201cexcess profits\u201d taken during the work of constructing the buildings for the joint enterprise, the amount of the excess profits having been determined by reference to paragraph eight of the 1979 agreement which imposed a five percent profit limitation on the contractor. In respect of both items, the Barletta party points to the fact that it was FNC who did all the work of construction for the joint ventures<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that FNC is not a party to the arbitration proceedings because it was not named as a party in any demand for arbitration or in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>response to such demand. Thus, say the Barletta party, the arbitrators have established a liability of a nonparty and improperly fastened it upon the Barletta party when the arbitrators had the power to do neither. See <em>Computer Corp. of America </em>v. Zarecor, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 459-460 (1983) (arbitration may proceed only as to those parties who agree to arbitrate). Moreover, say the Barletta party, there is not even an agreement to arbitrate in the 1979 agreement \u2014 the agreement which authorized the work of construction to be undertaken by a Barletta-controlled entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">There is no merit to any of these arguments. The issue is not whether FNC was a party to the arbitration proceedings between the French and Barletta parties, nor whether the 1979 agreement contained an arbitration clause; the only question is whether the French and Barletta parties agreed to submit to binding arbitration the issues the arbitrators decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">. We note, preliminarily, that the arbitration clause in all the joint venture agreements<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was in the most general terms (\u201cAll controversies . . . arising out of or relating to this Agreement . . . \u201d), and we have previously said, quoting from <em>Carter, Moore, &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>345 Mass. 672, 676 (1963), that a broad agreement to arbitrate \u201cshould be construed as broadly as it was intended.\u201d <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>Wexler Constr. Co., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163 (1981). We have also said that, \u201c[o]nce in the arena of arbitration, the powers of the arbitrator [s] concerning the issue [before them] are wide and the scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings is narrow.\u201d <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135 (1988). See also <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28-29 (1980) (\u201cIf the arbitrators in assessing damages commit an error of law or fact, but do not overstep the limits of the issues submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>them, a court may not substitute its judgment on the matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Because the construction of buildings was stated in the joint venture agreements to be a purpose of the joint enterprise, it follows that a dispute concerning the work of construction (see award of the arbitrators, item 3) \u201carose out of or is related to\u201d the joint venture agreement. The same is true for the claim that entities owned and controlled by Barletta, by charging excessive fees, \u201cskimmed off\u201d funds available for the business and profit of the joint enterprise (see award of the arbitrators, item 4), for that is a claim which has to do with the fiduciary obligations that \u201cjoint adventurers, like partners, owe to one another. . . .\u201d <em>Mendelsohn </em>v. <em>Leather Mfg. Corp., </em>326 Mass. 226, 233 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In undertaking the task of assessing that claim, the arbitrators might reasonably look to the standards agreed upon in the 1979 agreement. That agreement states in paragraph eight that Barletta and French \u201chave entered into a joint enterprise as tenants in common to develop the premises into an industrial park, sharing the expenses and the profits equally.\u201d The same paragraph gave Carmen Barletta the <em>right </em>to construct buildings for the joint enterprise through companies in which he had a personal interest, but subject to the five percent profit limitation. The 1979 agreement expressly contemplated the creation of specific joint venture projects for the purpose of developing an industrial park, and it provided the contractual foundation for the fourteen joint venture agreements executed later. Even if the arbitrators were in error in adopting the five percent standard established in the 1979 agreement, their award will not be set aside. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass, at 1007 (\u201cerrors of law or fact are not sufficient grounds to set aside an award . . . [and \u2018t]he question of interpretation of the agreement is for the arbitrator\u2019 \u201d); <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Granger Bros., Inc., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 379, 387-388 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The claim of the French party for the recovery of excess profits was clearly asserted by them in response to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>demand for arbitration,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that claim appears to have been fully tried before the arbitrators. Nowhere does the Barletta party assert that the issue was tried over their timely objections. Absent clear evidence that the arbitrators, over the objections of the Barletta party, decided issues outside the \u201carena of arbitration\u201d \u2014 and there is no such evidence here \u2014 the award of the arbitrators is binding upon the parties. <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 135. We are aided in the result we reach by the \u201clegal presumption . . . that arbitrators pursue the submission and decide only the matters therein contained, and also that they decide all matters submitted to them. And it is incumbent on a party who seeks to impeach an award, on the ground that the arbitrators have not so done, to show that they have not.\u201d <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Granger Bros., Inc., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 386, quoting from <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., </em>347 Mass. 254, 257 (1967), quoting from <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>4 Allen 17, 19-20 (1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">It is noteworthy that in this case the arbitrators stated clearly what they believe they had accomplished; they concluded their award with the following statement: \u201cThis award is in full settlement of all claims and/or counterclaims submitted to this arbitration.\u201d The issues of claim of the Barletta party for capital contributions by the French party, the French party claim for floor repairs, and the French party claim for construction profits earned by FNC in excess of the permitted five percent ceiling are deemed to have been properly submitted to and decided by the arbitrators.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>We conclude that the judge correctly confirmed the award of the arbitrators, but only as to the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">2. <em>The judgment to be entered on the award. </em>The award of the arbitrators, which refers to the parties merely as \u201cCarmen A, Barletta et al.,\u201d and Leonard S. French et al.,\u201d does not identify all the individual owners of the fourteen joint ventures to which the award refers, nor does it allocate among such persons (who participated in the joint enterprise in varying proportions, see note 5, <em>supra) </em>either the benefits or the burdens of the award. The problem is compounded by a record appendix which is seriously deficient. The arbitration agreement dated March 19, 1990, to which the award refers, and which presumably identifies the parties to the arbitration proceedings, is omitted from the record appendix. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the French party, and the judge as well, appear to have ignored the discrepancy between (i) the individuals who are parties to the Superior Court action (six members of the Barletta party and five members of the French party) and (ii) the individuals who were named as parties to the demand for arbitration filed by the French party (eleven members of the Barletta party and five members of the French party, one of whom is not a party to the Superior Court action), or, if different, the individuals named in the arbitration agreement dated March 19, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We conclude that there is no basis in the record before us ' for the allocation of the benefit of the final award of $334,682 equally among five members of the French party named in the original Superior Court action. Similarly, there is no basis in the record before us for the allocation of the burden of the final award equally among six members of the Barletta party without the award of the arbitrators allocating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>liability for FNC\u2019s excess profits among those of the Barletta party who owned FNC, or benefited from the excess profits it received. We conclude that \u201cthe award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.\u201d G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 13(a)(3), as inserted by St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In accordance with G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 13(6), the Superior Court judge should have granted the application of the Barletta party to \u201cmodify and correct the award so as to effect its intent and . . . confirm the award as so modified and corrected. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>This case is remanded to the Superior Court solely to modify and correct the award of the arbitrators by allocating the benefits and burdens of the award on the basis of the principles set forth in note 13 to this opinion.

Those omissions provide no help to the Barletta party; it was their duty as appellants to prepare the content of the appendix.

The claim with regard to the refusal of the arbitrators to accept additional evidence was included in the Barletta party\u2019s motion to the arbitrators for the modification of their award.

The underlying difficulty is that the parties to the Superior Court action are not all the parties to the joint venture agreements or to the demands for arbitration. The principal item to be allocated is the excess profits award of $1,033,613. This amount, plus interest, must first be distributed among the joint ventures by an allocation based upon the excess fees charged to and paid by each joint venture construction project. Each member of the Barletta party and each member of the French party having ownership interests in each of the ventures will then share the burdens and benefits, respectively, of the allocated portion of the award in the same proportion as their ownership interests in the joint venture. However, one or more members of the Barletta party (such as the appellant Joseph N. Verna) may claim that he or she never had an ownership interest in FNC, the recipient of the \u201cexcess profits,\u201d or that the ownership interest did not exist when the excess fees were taken. In such circumstances, members such as Verna may be entitled to be indemnified by other members of the Barletta party who participated in, and benefited by FNC\u2019s wrongful receipt of excess fees. See <em>Elias </em>v. <em>Unisys Corp., </em>410 Mass. 479, 482 (1991) (\u201cIndemnity . . . allows someone who is without fault, compelled by operation of law to defend himself against the wrongful act of another, to recover from the wrongdoer the entire amount of his loss, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). Essentially the same principles apply with regard to the award for additional capital contributions required of the French party. Here, the arbitrators identified and quantified the required capital contribution for each joint venture; there remains only the need to allocate the burdens and benefits among the individual members of each joint venture. All the parties necessary to the entry of a final judgment will have to be joined as parties plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be. Many, if not all, of the foregoing issues are capable of resolution by counsel to the parties on undisputed facts, and we assume that counsel to the parties will, in good faith, undertake that effort. The final judgment entered in the Superior Court provided for the joint and several liability of the Barletta party. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>issue, which was not fully briefed in this court, must be considered anew in the Superior Court, after taking into account the principles set forth in this note. The same is true as to the matter of interest which may be due the parties. What we have written here disposes of the separate appeal of Joseph N. Verna, as he conceded in his brief filed in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
