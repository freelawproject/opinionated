The case raises the question whether a minor who had previously asserted and settled a medical malpractice claim, through a parent acting as next friend, is barred from bringing a subsequent and related action be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>cause of the three-year limitation period that begins to run from the appointment of a \u201cguardian, or other representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, as in effect prior to St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7 23,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cany claim by a minor against a health care provider . . . based on an alleged act, omission or neglect shall be commenced within three years . . . [from the date of accrual] except that a minor under the full age of six years shall have until his ninth birthday . . . and <em>provided further, that any such claim by a minor shall be commenced within three years after the appointment of his administrator, executor, guardian, or other representative by which the action may be commenced'''1 </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">According to the uncontested facts presented to the motion judge, the plaintiff, Angelique Baker, through her father and next friend, commenced an earlier, related malpractice action on January 18, 1982, against another physician who, according to the complaint, negligently treated Angelique in 1979 and caused her serious bodily injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *That matter proceeded to trial in 1987. After the judge declared a mistrial, settlement occurred. On May 7, 1987, after a release of all claims against that defendant was executed, the instant action was commenced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants contend that, by instituting the 1982 suit, Angelique\u2019s father was automatically appointed her next friend. See <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>155 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>108, 109 (1891); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Parke, </em>155 Mass. 433, 435 (1892) (\u201calthough the next friend is presumed in theory of law to have been appointed by the court, no actual appointment is necessary\u201d). Their argument concludes that, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, the three-year limitation period began with the commencement of the first suit and expired as to her present claims in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">To avoid the strictures of the three-year limitation period, the plaintiff reads the word \u201cappointment\u201d contained in the statute according to its dictionary definition, that is, as \u201c[the] act of appointing or designating for an office or position\u201d (see the American Heritage Dictionary 89 [3d ed. 1992]). As the plaintiffs father, when he undertook to bring the first action, had not been designated by any court as her guardian (see G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 34, providing for appointments of guardians ad litem and next friends for minors), the plaintiff argues that the three-year limitation period was never previously triggered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Legislative History.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We begin with the familiar notion that \u201c[we] must consider the entire statutory arrangement to determine the legislative intent.\u201d <em>County Commrs. of Franklin </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Worcester, </em>383 Mass. 323, 325 (1981). Many States, including Massachusetts, responded to the concern about malpractice insurance costs of the early and mid-1970\u2019s by enacting legislation which created special requirements and restrictions not applicable to other tort claims. The relevant statute in effect prior to 1976 provided that the three-year period of limitation applicable to medical malpractice actions did not begin to run against a minor until the minor reached the age of majority. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7; <em>Cioffi </em>v. <em>Guenther, </em>374 Mass. 1, 2 (1977). Effective January 1, 1976, the time within which minors\u2019 medical malpractice claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>might be brought was shortened to \u201cthree years from the date the cause of action accrued\u201d except that a minor under the full age of six years was given until that child\u2019s ninth birthday to commence his action. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, as amended by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5. An apparent purpose of the shortened limitation period was to discourage frivolous or stale claims which would be difficult to defend with the passage of an unreasonable amount of time and would cause increased premium charges for medical malpractice insurance. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 655 n.4 (1977); Annual Report of the Special Commission Relative to Medical Professional Liability Insurance and the Nature and Consequences of Medical Malpractice, 1978 House Doc. No. 5631. In 1979, a part of \u00a7 60D was again amended by inserting the last exception clause at issue. St. 1979, c. 502. What underlay this revision, added as an emergency measure, was the need to afford sufficient time to the representatives of minors, after their appointments, to commence their suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">If we were to accept the plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 60D, in the circumstances presented here, it would frustrate the purpose of the legislation because next friends of minor plaintiffs, who were not formally appointed by the court, would have a more expansive period to assert malpractice claims than is granted to others. We are of opinion that the limitation period allowed to the \u201cadministrator, executor, guardian or other representative\u201d of those within the age of majority was carefully designed as to its purpose and it may not be construed in a manner which renders any of the statutory language meaningless or superfluous. See <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., 392 </em>Mass. 811, 813 (1984); <em>Devaney </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 928 (1982). The handiwork of the Legislature would unravel if, as the plaintiff suggests, the lack of a formal appointment by the court in 1982 permitted the clock not to run on her related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Our view assigning a more elastic meaning to the word \u201cappointment,\u201d as used in the second exception clause of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, is reinforced by the last catchall phrase \u201cor other representative by which the action may be commenced.\u201d Since G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 34 (appointment of guardian ad litem for minors), had been in effect for a considerable period of time prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, the catchall phrase would have no meaning if we were to adopt the interpretation urged by the plaintiff, because the words would have added nothing to the list of persons authorized by law to commence timely suits on behalf of minors. By adding a more generic class of persons, we may assume that the Legislature determined that \u201cthe interest of minors will be protected by their guardians, or [equally] by others who are near to them.\u201d <em>Cioffi </em>v. <em>Guenther, 374 </em>Mass. 1, 4 (1977), quoting from <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>186 Mass. 79, 82 (1904). There is no reason to conclude that the Legislature, by its 1979 amendment, intended that the measurement of the limitation period would vary depending upon the prpcedural process by which appointments are made. \u201cIt is a familiar principle of statutory construction that mere verbal changes in the revision of a statute do not alter its meaning and are construed as a continuation of the previous law.\u201d <em>Arthur A. Johnson Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 347, 353 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Our interpretation is supported by the settled case law which makes clear that specific and explicit judicial approval is not a requirement for parents to act on behalf of minor children. \u201c[T]he rule now is that the [next friend] ... is to be admitted without any other appointment or record than a recital in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Winchester Home for Aged Women, </em>216 Mass. 567, 569 (1914). See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Parke, </em>155 Mass. 433, 435 (1892). We also take as an indicator of conscious policy that the Legislature is presumed to be aware of the process by which next friends are appointed, as that procedure has evolved in case law over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The plaintiff also contends that her father\u2019s automatic appointment as her next friend should not be binding because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the settlement of her earlier action was not expressly approved by a judge. In the absence of special circumstances, such as fraud, bad faith, or conscious disregard of a minor\u2019s interests, a settlement for a minor will not be set aside because it was the product of the parties\u2019 agreement rather than a court\u2019s determination. <em>Nagle </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>337 Mass. 80, 81 (1958). Nothing in the record suggests that the settlement made on Angelique\u2019s behalf was inadequate or was made with conscious disregard of her best interest. Cf. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>194 Mass. 328, 333 (1907) (validating settlement on behalf of a minor because it was a \u201creasonable settlement fairly made\u201d and \u201cwas such a one as the court would have approved had the matter been brought to the court\u2019s attention at the time\u201d). The lack of formal court approval of the settlement does not defeat the father\u2019s automatic appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Lastly, the plaintiff argues that her father\u2019s appointment as her next friend in the 1982 action should not bar the present action because the defendants in the instant case were not parties to the earlier case. Statutes of limitation \u201cpromote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs\u201d and \u201cencourage plaintiffs to bring actions within prescribed deadlines when evidence is fresh and available.\u201d <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., </em>388 Mass. 171, 175 (1983), quoting from <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 618 (1980). The deposition testimony of Angelique\u2019s mother reveals that she initially contacted her attorneys in February of 1980 about bringing a lawsuit against the defendants. In short, we conclude that those who have had the opportunity to bring known claims on grounds fully appreciated by them at the time of the occurrence should not later be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The 1986 amendment to the statute is not relevant to this case as it applies only to claims arising from acts which occurred on or after November 1, 1986. St. 1986, c. 351, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">On the day of her birth, November 11, 1979, the plaintiff had symptoms and physical signs suggestive of some type of newborn intestinal obstruction. In the first action brought only against the attending pediatrician, she claimed negligence in his failure to treat her condition (intestinal malrotation) which negligence resulted in surgical removal of a significant amount of her small intestine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\">In her present complaint, Angelique alleged that Baystate Medical Center was negligent in supervising its employees during the period following her birth, and that a pediatric resident negligently failed to diagnose her condition. Another discrete claim, which alleged negligent postoperative administration of an intravenous feeding tube by a staff nurse, was dismissed because of the plaintiffs failure to post a bond in accordance with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">If the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation were correct, only the first exception contained in \u00a7 60D (\u201cthat a minor under the full age of six years shall have until [her] ninth birthday\u201d to commence an action) would here apply. In that case, the limitation period would extend to November 11, 1988, her ninth birthday, and the present action would not be barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
