Immediately after the assault (Gillen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>punched both women squarely in the face knocking each one to the ground, leaving Guest with serious head and facial injuries and Kirby with minor injuries<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), Gillen and his companions fled the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It further appears that the plaintiffs spent the evening of November 19, 1987, at the defendant\u2019s caf\u00e9 (Chevy\u2019s) with friends eating, drinking beer, and celebrating the birthdays of the two plaintiffs. Their car was parked in the parking garage just mentioned; it was across the street from Chevy\u2019s. Gillen and his friends arrived at Chevy\u2019s at around 10:30 p.m. They, too, had parked their car in the same parking garage. When the plaintiffs and their friends left Chevy\u2019s after midnight, Gillen and his friends followed them into the garage, and the assault began.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In his deposition testimony Gillen admitted to drinking \u201cseven to ten beers \u2014 maybe twelve,\u201d at Chevy\u2019s, with his \u201cbest estimate\u201d being eight beers. He also testified that when he left Chevy\u2019s he was \u201cprobably legally\u201d drunk, by which he meant that his \u201cblood alcohol level might have been over point one.\u201d Prior to being at Chevy\u2019s, Gillen was at another establishment where he had drunk two beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">While conceding that \u201cthere isn\u2019t any direct testimony on the issue of Gillen\u2019s condition while drinking at Chevy\u2019s,\u201d and relying solely on the facts we have stated, the plaintiffs argue that a jury should be permitted to infer that \u201cGillen had outwardly manifested symptoms of intoxication while he was drinking at Chevy\u2019s which an experienced bartender would have recognized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The plaintiffs have no cognizable claim against Chevy\u2019s. It is true that a tavern keeper\u2019s service of alcohol to a person already intoxicated may be some evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence because it violates G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 69. <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 327 (1982). But \u00a7 69 (a provision prohibiting the sale of liquor to intoxicated persons) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>does not grant an independent ground for civil liability. The liability of the defendant \u201cmust be grounded in the common law of negligence.\u201d <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 355, 358 (1990). The applicable rule is that \u201ca tavern keeper does not owe a duty to refuse to serve liquor to an intoxicated patron unless the tavern keeper knows or reasonably should have known that the patron is intoxicated . . . [T]he plaintiff (must) introduce some evidence showing the defendant was on notice that it was serving alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated patron.\u201d <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., supra </em>at 327-328).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The few facts presented by the plaintiffs in their opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which we have described above, do not present sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendant was put on notice that it was serving alcohol to an intoxicated person. There is no evidence at all that Gillen\u2019s conduct in Chevy\u2019s was aggressive, troublesome or even loud and vulgar, as in <em>Cimino, supra. </em>Gillen\u2019s later conduct in the parking garage, however revealing of his violent nature, is not evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that his outward conduct when he was served his last drinks inside Chevy\u2019s was that of a person already drunk,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his acknowledgment later still that he was \u201cprobably legally\u201d drunk fails for the same reason. The consumption of approximately eight beers over a period of about two hours, absent any other evidence of Gillen\u2019s conduct while in Chevy\u2019s, is too far removed from <em>O\u2019Hanley </em>v. <em>Ninety-Nine, Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 64, 65 (1981), where the consumption of \u201cat least fifteen Heineken beers and six martinis\u201d was sufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude that the plaintiff would have displayed \u201csome outward manifestation of intoxication.\u201d Also contrast <em>Cimino, supra </em>at 328, where the court found that loud and vulgar conduct or the service of six or more \u201cWhite Rus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>sians\u201d (vodka and coffee-brandy liquor) was each sufficient to put the tavern keeper on notice that it was serving a patron \u201cwho could potentially endanger others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In his answers to interrogatories, Gillen stated that he was subsequently charged with assault and battery, in consequence of which he received a suspended sentence with probation and an order of restitution to Guest in the amount of approximately $15,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Contrast <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New Yorker, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 450, 453 (1969) (serving hard liquor to one already drunk \u201cmay well make the individual unreasonably aggressive, and enhance a condition in which it is foreseeable that almost any irrational act is foreseeable\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
