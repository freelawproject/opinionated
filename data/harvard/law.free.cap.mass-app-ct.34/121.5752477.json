We conclude that it is not, except possibly when it is being used on a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The material facts are not in dispute. On January 13, 1990, Larry Vynorious, a resident of Massachusetts, was standing on a snowmobile trail in Maine when he was struck by a snowmobile being driven by a person who carried no liability insurance covering the operation of that vehicle. Vynorious had purchased a standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy from Arbella Mutual Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>(Arbella), which was in effect at the time of the accident. The policy, approved by the Division of Insurance, provided coverage for accidents caused by \u201cuninsured . . . autos.\u201d The term \u201cauto\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201ca land motor vehicle . . . but does <em>not </em>include: A. Any vehicle operated on rails or crawler treads . . . [or] C. A farm tractor or other equipment designed for use principally off public roads [unless it. is being used on public roads].\u201d Vynorious filed a claim under the policy to recover for the injuries he received as a result of the accident, and, in accordance with the policy, he sought arbitration. Arbella brought this action seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the policy did not cover accidents involving snowmobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A Superior Court judge ordered entry of summary judgment in favor of Vynorious. As snowmobiles operate on crawler treads and are \u201cdesigned for use principally off public roads,\u201d she determined, correctly, that the language of the policy excluded coverage for snowmobile accidents. She concluded, however, that the policy language could not be given effect because it provided coverage less comprehensive than that required by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, which governed compulsory uninsured motorist coverage. See <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 173 (1981); <em>Heroux </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 925, 926 (1984); <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1989). We do not think that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, generally requires uninsured motorist coverage for accidents involving snowmobiles, and, therefore, we vacate the judgment in favor of Vynorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L, requires that coverage be provided in certain minimal amounts for accidents caused by \u201cuninsured motor vehicles.\u201d General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34A, which sets out definitions for compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance purposes, refers to the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1984, c. 77, \u00a7 2. That section defines \u201c[mjotor vehicles,\u201d with cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tain specified exceptions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as \u201call vehicles constructed and designed for propulsion by power other than muscular power.\u201d The judge concluded, and we agree, that snowmobiles do not fall within any of the specified exceptions. See <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>361 Mass. 1, 4 (1972). Considering the overall statutory scheme and the aim of the Legislature in enacting mandatory uninsured motorist coverage, however, we disagree that the term \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d to which the exceptions relate, was intended to be construed so broadly as to include snowmobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">General Laws c. 90, by requiring, among other things, licensing of motorists, registration, inspections, and insurance, provides for the regulation, usually by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, of the use of motor vehicles on the highways in Massachusetts. None of those requirements apply to snowmobiles. A separate chapter, G. L. c. 90B, dealing with motorboats and recreational vehicles, regulates \u201csnow vehicles,\u201d or snowmobiles. They are required to be registered, see G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 21, but with the director of the division of law enforcement of the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement, not the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. Licensing, see G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 26, and insurance are not required. Of most significance is G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 25, as inserted by St. 1970, c. 589, \u00a7 2, which prohibits the use of snowmobiles on any public way in Massachusetts, except in very specific limited circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201c[Statutory words are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning considered in light of the aim to be accomplished by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass, at 177. The usual and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d would not necessarily include such motorized vehicles as boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles, not designed for highway use. Looking to the legislative purpose behind the enactment of compulsory uninsured motorist protection, we find support for the more limited definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d \u201cThe aim of the uninsured motorist statute is to minimize the catastrophic financial loss for victims of automobile accidents caused by the negligence of uninsured tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass, at 177. See <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>394 Mass. 450, 454 (1985); <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 285 (1991). See also 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1030, in which it is stated, at 7: \u201c[Uninsured motorist coverage] is the type of coverage which we feel all our people should have in order to minimize the possibility of their subjection to catastrophic financial loss as victims of an automobile accident.\u201d Use of the term \u201cautomobile\u201d in the cases and the legislative history indicates concern about accidents caused by vehicles of the kind ordinarily used on highways. Thus, in <em>Hein-Werner Corp. </em>v. <em>Jackson Indus., Inc., </em>364 Mass. 523, 529 (1974), the court, although in a different context, stated that \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d used in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, \u201cincludes only the vehicles which are designed for regular use in the transportation of persons and property on the traveled part of public highways. Just as clearly, many kinds of special vehicles ... are excluded.\u201d Snowmobiles, being vehicles not designed for regular use on public highways, do not fall within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although not conclusive, it is at least of some significance that the Commissioner of Insurance, exercising his authority under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, approved the policy language excluding coverage for snowmobile accidents, presumably finding compliance with the requirements of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L. See <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>320 Mass. 6, 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>11 (1946); <em>Heroux </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 926. Vynorious argues, and the motion judge reasoned, on the other hand, that the definition of \u201csnow vehicle\u201d (snowmobile) in G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 20, as \u201ca motor vehicle designed to travel over ice or snow . . .\u201d supports their interpretation that snowmobiles are \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d Most likely, the Legislature did not consider what the implications might be when it used the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in the context of defining snow vehicle. We do not think the use of the term in that definition is convincing evidence of a legislative intent to bring snowmobiles within the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, or within the category of vehicles to which compulsory uninsured coverage applies. On the contrary, we assume that the Legislature, in the interest of controlling automobile insurance rates, would have sought to limit insurers\u2019 liability for losses occurring in situations such as snowmobile accidents, in which the availability of insurance coverage is unlikely. Compare <em>Heinrich-Grundy </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 810, 814 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We need not decide in this case whether an accident <em>on a public way </em>involving a snowmobile operated by an uninsured person would be within the compulsory coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment entered for Vynorious and enter judgment for Arbella declaring that the insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>anee policy does not provide coverage for injuries received in the snowmobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The exceptions are: \u201crailroad and railway cars, vehicles operated by the system known as trolley motor or trackless trolley . . . vehicles running only upon rails or tracks, vehicles used for other purposes than the transportation of property and incapable of being driven at a speed exceeding twelve miles per hour and which are used exclusively for the building, repair and maintenance of highways or designed especially for use elsewhere than on the travelled part of ways, wheelchairs owned and operated by invalids and vehicles which are operated or guided by a person on foot. . . .

Many other State courts have concluded that accidents involving snowmobiles do not fall within compulsory uninsured motorist coverage when they occur off the public ways. See <em>Keely </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>835 P.2d 584 (Colo. App. 1992); <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Ex. </em>v. <em>Spafford, </em>76 Mich. App. 85 (1977); <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Ex., </em>94 Mich. App. 448 (1979); <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Cas. Ins. Co., </em>328 Pa. Super. 267 (1984). See also <em>Chase </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>131 Ariz. 461 (Ct. App. 1982) (golf cart). Other State courts have concluded that snowmobiles are not motor vehicles for insurance purposes. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>159 Mich. App. 699 (1987); <em>State Auto. &amp; Cas. Underwriters </em>v. <em>Runia, </em>363 N.W. 2d 818 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985); <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins.
