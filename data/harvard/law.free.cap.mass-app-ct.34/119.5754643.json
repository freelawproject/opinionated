Simply stated, the plaintiffs are holders of certain notes guaranteed by the defendants. The linchpin of the defendants\u2019 argument on appeal is a claim of fraudulent inducement. The appeal is totally lacking in merit and counsel for the defendants (appellants) had to be aware that the appeal was foredoomed for the reason, if no other, that they failed to allege fraud affirmatively, let alone with the requi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>site particularity, in the pleadings.

See also Mass.R.A.P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979). The plaintiffs may submit such a petition for attorney\u2019s fees to this court in the manner prescribed in <em>Yorke Mgmt., supra </em>at 20, as soon as practicable. The defendants are to have twenty calendar days from the date of said filing to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with double costs of the appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
