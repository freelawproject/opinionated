The defendant, George Lopes, was convicted of armed assault with intent to murder, assault and battery by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>means of a dangerous weapon, and unlawfully carrying a firearm. At trial, the defendant presented evidence that the defendant was at a bar at the time of the shooting and not at the scene of the assault. He also elicited testimony that the victim\u2019s assailant was shorter and darker skinned than the defendant. Although two witnesses testified that they saw the defendant shoot the victim, the victim testified that he did not know who shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The main thrust of the defendant\u2019s appeal is that the judge erroneously permitted the prosecutor to question the defendant and two defense witnesses, Louis Silva and Jay DeRosa, regarding their respective failures to provide exculpatory information to the police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant also claims that opinion evidence of the victim\u2019s mother and a prior \u201cinconsistent\u201d statement of the victim were erroneously admitted in evidence. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">1. <em>Prosecution\u2019s questioning of Silva. </em>After the Commonwealth rested, Louis Silva was called as a defense witness. He testified that at the time of the shooting he was in an automobile near the victim\u2019s home. He claimed that he saw in his rearview mirror the fleeing assailant. When asked whether it was the defendant, he answered, \u201cNo, [the person] was darker . . . [and] shorter\u201d than the defendant. The prosecutor, apparently to suggest recent contrivance, questioned Silva as to whether he had, before his testimony at trial, ever told anybody about what he had seen. He answered that he had told Mike (the victim) and \u201c[t] hat\u2019s about it.\u201d He said he was never asked by the police at the time of the shooting whether he had seen the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 296-297 (1981), the defendant claims that the prosecutor did not, as required, \u201clay a foundation for this type of cross-examination by first establishing that the witness knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of the pending charges in sufficient detail to realize that he possessed exculpatory information, that the witness had reason to make the information available, that he was familiar with the means of reporting it to the proper authorities, and that the defendant or his lawyer, or both, did not ask the witness to refrain from doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We think, in the circumstances, that a sufficient foundation for the questioning had been laid under <em>Brown, </em>and that the \u201cjury could have concluded that it would have been natural for [Silva] to go to the police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahan, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 744 (1984). Silva, who was twenty-one, had known the defendant since eighth grade, and had socialized with him. He had been present at the scene of the shooting, thought he had seen the assailant, and was a friend of the victim as well as of the defendant. Concerned about what had happened, he had gone to the victim\u2019s house and had been present when the police arrived. He knew how to get in contact with the police and had informed the victim of what he had seen. In view of Silva\u2019s friendship with the victim and his long acquaintance with the defendant, the jury could infer that Silva, who was a student getting a degree in law enforcement, had learned from either the victim or the defendant that charges concerning the shooting had been brought against the defendant. Silva also admitted that no one advised him not to talk to the police. Although he stated that he thought the matter was none of his business, the jury were free to disbelieve him. They could draw the inference that a person working toward a degree in law enforcement could reasonably be expected to provide police with information concerning the shooting of a friend when another friend, or at least a long-time acquaintance, was charged with the shooting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 58 &amp; n.4 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>401 Mass. 437, 445 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Moreover, if this suggestion of recent contrivance played any role in the jury\u2019s disbelief of Silva\u2019s assertion that the assailant was not the defendant, it was insignificant in light of the subsequent, more damaging impeachment testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Detective Gomes. Gomes, a Commonwealth witness, was the detective who had investigated the crime. He was recalled as a witness by the Commonwealth on the day after Silva\u2019s testimony. Gomes testified that he had interviewed Silva on the preceding day prior to Silva\u2019s testimony in court. Gomes testified that he and Silva had discussed the incident and that Silva had told him that, while he was sitting in his car, \u201ca blur ran by\u201d and that he was unable to tell whether the person fleeing was or was not the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Holland, 410 Mass. 248, 260 (1991) (questioned evidence overshadowed by much stronger evidence to the same effect). Thus, even if the foundation for the questioning of Silva was not properly laid, the defendant has not sustained \u201cthe burden of showing an abuse of discretion and <em>resulting </em>prejudice\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 507-508 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">2. <em>Prosecution\u2019s questioning of Jay DeRosa. </em>DeRosa, the defendant\u2019s half brother, testified that he was with the defendant at a bar until it was dark. Evidence had been presented that the victim had been shot in the early evening when it was still light. The prosecutor questioned DeRosa whether he had given this alibi evidence to the police before trial. He acknowledged that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The only claim made by the defendant on appeal is that it was not established that he (Lopes) or his lawyer had not told DeRosa to refrain from going to the police. The claim is refuted by DeRosa\u2019s testimony, specifically acknowledging that he was not told \u201cnot to say anything about it,\u201d and that nobody told him not to go to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">3. <em>Prosecution\u2019s questioning of the defendant. </em>The prosecution cross-examined the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">Q. \u201cRight after the time you got arrested, when you realized you were accused of shooting Michael Starks [the victim], you didn\u2019t speak with your half brother about this, did you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>A. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Q. \u201cYou did?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">A. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Q. \u201cAnd that was the point when you urged him to go to the police, isn\u2019t that fair to say?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">A. \u201cNo. We went to the probable cause to identify me and no one identified me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Q. \u201cDid you tell your half brother, with this urgent information, to go tell the police, help me out?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">A. \u201cThat\u2019s what the court was for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">Q. \u201cDid you go?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">A. \u201cWouldn\u2019t make no difference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">Q. \u201cDid you go?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">A. \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">Q. \u201cDid you ask him to go?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">A. \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-17\">Q. \u201cDid he voluntarily go do it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-18\">A. \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-19\">Q. \u201cDid he say, \u2018I\u2019ve got some important information. I was with you. You couldn\u2019t have done it?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-20\">A. \u201cThat\u2019s my reason to come to court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-21\">Q. \u201cSo what you are telling us now is that within the week or so after the time that the shooting occurred 99</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>A. \u201cI was in jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Q. \u201cYou and your cousin or half brother talked about him being there, is that right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">A. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t there. How can I say? I was in jail all day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The defendant registered no objection at trial to this interrogation. He urges that this was improper postarrest questioning, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass, at 59 n.5, and created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We conclude the argument fails. The primary thrust of the questioning was directed at showing that it would have been natural for the defendant to discuss with his half brother DeRosa that they had been together at the bar at the time of the shooting, and, if that had been the case, the defendant undoubtedly would have asked DeRosa to inform the authorities of that fact. What the defendant told DeRosa to do was a proper subject for cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass, at 62 n.6 (\u201cdefendant\u2019s failure to report certain facts to someone other than the police would be an appropriate subject for cross-examination where it would have been natural for the defendant to report those facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">To the extent that the defendant was asked whether he, himself, had gone to the police, this was improper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 559 (1977), <em>S.C., </em>398 Mass. 806 (1986). <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610 (1976). In the context of the trial as a whole, however, there was not a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Far more fleeting than the questions concerning the defendant\u2019s discussion with DeRosa, the question as to the defendant\u2019s failure to go to the police was \u201cnot likely to influence, or even to seize the attention of the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 989, 992 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 223-224 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>More important, the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case was such that there was scant likelihood that the questioning could have made a difference. There was evidence from three witnesses that the defendant had \u201cwords\u201d with the victim earlier in the day on April 16, 1990, about an event the night before. The defendant was said to have asked the victim why he had hit the defendant with a chair, and one witness testified that the defendant had told the victim, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you in the face.\u201d Later in the early evening, two witnesses, the victim\u2019s sister and a neighbor, saw the defendant, whom they both knew, pull out a silver gun and point it at the victim, who then ran toward his house. The defendant gave chase and fired two shots. After the second shot hit the victim in \u201cthe rump,\u201d the defendant ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The victim\u2019s testimony that he did not know who had shot him was severely impeached by his statement to Detective Gomes when he was taken to the hospital. Gomes testified that the victim had told him that George (no last name), a black man, was his assailant and that when George pointed a gun at him and threatened to shoot him in the face, he had fled and then was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendant\u2019s case as elicited from Silva, DeRosa, and the defendant had significant shortcomings. Silva\u2019s testimony was impeached by his earlier statement to Detective Gomes that he could not tell who was or was not the assailant. DeRosa\u2019s testimony placing the defendant elsewhere at certain times during the day of the incident was not consistent with his testimony that it was dark when they had separated. DeRosa and the defendant also had different versions as to whether a third person had accompanied them on a second trip to the bar that afternoon. In light of the Commonwealth\u2019s strong case, the very brief questioning of the defendant as to whether he had gone to the police does not require a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">4. <em>Detective Gomes\u2019s testimony. </em>As indicated earlier, Gomes had testified as to what the victim had told him in the hospital. His testimony was admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection for impeachment purposes only. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>claims this was error because the victim\u2019s hospital statement to Gomes was not inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony and should not have been admitted for impeachment purposes. The victim testified that he did not know who shot him, did not see the defendant, and did not tell Gomes that a black male known as George had approached him before he was shot. The defendant argues there was no inconsistency because the victim did not consider the defendant to be black and, moreover, the victim knew the defendant\u2019s last name.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no abuse of discretion in considering the statements inconsistent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>386 Mass. 234, 242 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">5. <em>Testimony of victim\u2019s mother. </em>The defendant argues that the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that the defendant had a gun because of the way he kept his hand in his pocket should have been struck upon the defendant\u2019s objection. The evidence was not offered as opinion evidence and was elicited after the witness testified that the defendant had a gun. When asked about having seen a gun, she mentioned that the defendant had held his hand in his pocket in a certain way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if her statement is viewed as an opinion, it was a conclusion, \u201cnot requiring special learning or experiment,\u201d and hence is admissible as a statement of \u201cobserved facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>357 Mass. 559, 563 (1970), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>349 Mass. 87, 95-96 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1022 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The transcript originally provided to this court was deficient in that significant pages were omitted and certain pages appeared in multiple copies but were given different numbers. The panel requested that the Commonwealth provide a more accurate copy of Volume I. Our discussion of the evidence is taken from the copy provided by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">It is also not altogether clear that the defendant made a proper objection to the cross-examination of Silva now challenged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">At a bench conference the judge said he would allow Gomes to testify as to the victim\u2019s statements in the hospital and indicated that he, the judge, considered the defendant to be a \u201clight skinned Negro or Hispanic.\u201d The defendant is a Cape Verdian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We note that the defendant in cross-examination elicited more explicitly the reason for the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
