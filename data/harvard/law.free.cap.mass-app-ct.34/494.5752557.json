See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Shelley, 381 Mass. 340, 353-354 n.12 (1980). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1717-1719 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1993). In seeking reversal of his convictions and a new trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant does not rely on special extraneous influences based on the record, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass. 52, 56 (1987), but rather urges that individual voir dire be required in all homosexual rape cases where a defendant contends that the complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>consented. Because of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s reluctance to limit the discretion of trial judges in these matters, and because the few limitations it has imposed on such discretion are based on its supervisory power, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 398 (1987), we do not consider this the rare case where we can \u201cfill the interstices.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 364 n.l (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has followed a \u201ccautious\u201d approach, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 398 n.8 (1987), in extending the principles of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>383 Mass. 637 (1981),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> even in interracial cases, the one area in which it has, \u201cin a limited class\u201d of cases, restricted judicial discretion under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>405 Mass. 269, 274 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, </em>410 Mass. 586, 588, 589 (1991). Thus, the court refused to extend the <em>Sanders </em>principle in <em>De La Cruz </em>to include Hispanic persons as a race for jury empanelment purposes and, in <em>Grice, </em>to cases involving interracial armed robbery. Clearly concerned with the imposition of an additional burden on the court system by a blanket requirement of individual voir dire in a category of cases, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass, at 398 n.8, the court has assiduously refused to expand the <em>Sanders </em>rule \u201cin the absence of demonstrated necessity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>405 Mass, at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In addition, the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>400 Mass, at 56, suggests denial of the defendant\u2019s claim in this case. There, the defendant sought individual examination of jurors, requesting the posing of several questions relating to homosexuality, including the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The defendant in <em>Boyer </em>was convicted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as a \u201ccommon night walker,\u201d that is, \u201csomeone who is abroad at night and solicits others to engage in illicit sexual acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53 n.l. For purposes of its decision, the court accepted the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge did not inform the jurors \u201cthat the defendant was a homosexual male who the evidence might show traveled at night as a transvestite\u201d and did not ask collectively the jurors \u201cif any juror would have difficulty sitting on such a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. While recognizing the possibility of bias against homosexuals, the court upheld the trial judge\u2019s refusal to engage in individual voir dire, concluding that there was no basis in the record to require the judge to determine that there was a substantial risk of extraneous influences on the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 56. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass, at 352.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cThe defendant in this case is a homosexual. Do you have feelings about homosexuals that might make it difficult for you to be impartial in deciding this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The narrow range of <em>Sanders </em>and the decision in <em>Boyer </em>lead us to conclude that the judge did not err in refusing to question the jurors individually. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>528 A.2d 890, 892 (Me. 1987). Our failure to find a requirement in the statute or an abuse of discretion by the trial judge is not, however, to be taken as disapproval of individual voir dire in cases involving sexual acts between persons of the same sex where the defendant requests such questioning. There is obviously a potential for prejudice in such cases. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 34 (\u201cabominable and detestable crime against nature\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass, at 353 n.11, where the court suggests that \u201chomosexuals might constitute a class\u201d under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. See generally Developments in the Law \u2014 Sexual Orientation and the Law, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1508, 1511-1519, 1551-1553 (1989). As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 364, \u201cappellate decisions have consistently encouraged trial judges to respond generously to motions that they question jurors individually about possible prejudice.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>405 Mass, at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-16\">The second paragraph of that section, as amended by St. 1975, c. 335, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining whether a juror stands indifferent in the case, if it appears that, as a result of the impact of considerations which may cause a decision or decisions to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the case, including, but not limited to, community attitudes, possible exposure to potentially prejudicial material or possible preconceived opinions toward the credibility of certain classes of persons, the juror may not stand indifferent, the court shall, or the parties or their attorneys may, with the permission and under the direction of the court, examine the juror specifically with respect to such considerations, attitudes, exposure, opinions or any other matters which may, as aforesaid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>cause a decision or decisions to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the issues in the case. Such examination may include a brief statement of the facts of the case, to the extent the facts are appropriate and relevant to the issue of such examination, and shall be conducted individually and outside the presence of other persons about to be called as jurors or already called.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The judge told potential jurors (they apparently had been previously assigned to panels) that the case would involve evidence of a graphic nature indicating sexual activities between two males including evidence of oral and anal sex. He asked them collectively whether evidence of that nature would \u201cinterfere in any way with your being able to reach a fair and conscientious verdict that is based solely upon the law and the evidence in the trial?\u201d Three jurors answered \u201cyes\u201d and were excused. The judge then asked a similar question, and nine potential jurors rose and were excused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The questions requested by the defendant, relevant to our inquiry are:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201c4. Do you believe that you will be unable to fairly and impartially weigh the evidence in view of the fact that the alleged offenses involve sexual activities, including oral sex and anal sex between two adult males, and in view of the fact that there may be considerable detailed testimony regarding said sexual activities?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\u201c5. Do any of you believe that you are predisposed to find the defendant guilty in view of the fact that he has been accused of raping another male?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u201c6. Do you think that your own feelings will make it difficult to fairly weigh the evidence in this case?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\">In any event, the defendant would not be entitled to a new trial. In those cases, not constitutionally mandated, when the rule requiring individual voir dire has been extended, the rule is only prospective. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>383 Mass. 637, 640 (1981). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 873 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 398 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 466 (1983).
