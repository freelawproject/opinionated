Noone, a Superior Court probation officer, was denied his 1985 application for accidental disability retirement benefits under the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1). Section 7(1) requires that the applicant be totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>and permanently incapacitated for further duty by reason of an injury sustained as a result of the performance of the applicant\u2019s duties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The qualifying injuries identified by Noone were myocardiac infarction, for which he was hospitalized in 1983, hypertension with elevated blood pressure, and endocarditis, for which he was hospitalized in November, 1984. We conclude that the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) was in error, and we remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">1. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>In response to Noone\u2019s application, the regional medical panel required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> examined Noone, his hospital records, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>report of Noone\u2019s physician, Dr. Lawrence Baker. The board certified that Noone was totally and permanently incapacitated to perform his duties as a probation officer by reason of \u201ccoronary heart disease, history of degenerative disc disease, and chronic anxiety state.\u201d In response to the third question required to be answered by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a) \u2014 whether the disability was \u201csuch as <em>might be </em>the natural and proximate result of the personal injury sustained or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed\u201d (emphasis added)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 the panel answered, \u201cno; predisposed to coronary heart disease by multiple risk factors; myocardial infarction was not work-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The certificate of the panel was submitted to the State Board of Retirement (the State board) on March 29, 1989.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is the State or local board which makes the initial determination of causation based on medical and nonmedical facts. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass. 611, 614 (1961). The State board denied Noone\u2019s application, and Noone appealed the adverse decision to CRAB. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>CRAB, as required by \u00a7 16(4), assigned the appeal to the division of administrative law appeals for a hearing by an administrative magistrate. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H. Noone testified on his own behalf and submitted the medical report of two physicians, Dr. Schwartzreich, whose report was not before the medical panel, and Dr. Baker, whose report was considered by the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On the basis of Noone\u2019s testimony and hospital records, the medical reports of his physicians, and the certificate of the medical panel, the magistrate made extensive findings of fact. In brief, the magistrate found that in the 1980\u2019s Noone was pursued by a person who at one time was obliged to report to Noone as his probation officer. The probationer later accused Noone of attempted extortion, but Noone was found innocent of all charges. Later still, while subsequently incarcerated, the probationer made it known that Noone was on his \u201chit list\u201d upon his release from State prison. On May 19, 1983, approximately one month after the receipt of this threat, Noone, while at work, reached for his briefcase, which weighed approximately twenty to thirty pounds, and pulled it up to his desk. Severe pain in his chest, left arm and jaw, followed, and he was taken to the Salem Hospital emergency room. The diagnosis was \u201cacute posterior myocardial infarction.\u201d Noone returned to work about October 1, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On November 27, 1984, Noone was hospitalized with endocarditis. The magistrate found that the panel concluded that this event was unrelated to Noone\u2019s previous myocardial infarction. The magistrate also found, however, that Dr. Baker had opined that the myocardial infarction had left Noone with a deficiency in \u201ccardiac reserve\u201d and thus bore a direct relationship to the subsequent work-related endocarditis. Noone returned to work in January, 1985. He last worked in July, 1986, when he fell down a flight of stairs while visiting a probationer and sustained an acute herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The magistrate described what she regarded as defects in the certificate of the medical panel: (i) the panel, in concluding that the myocardial infarction was not work-related, relied on risk factors even though risk factors are merely markers to alert physicians to the possible increased risks of the development of coronary heart disease, (ii) the panel was in error on the facts of Noone\u2019s risk factors; contrary to the finding of the panel, Noone\u2019s father did not die of heart disease; that error made a valid assessment of Noone\u2019s risk factors impossible, and (iii) the panel did not have and did not consider the detailed medical report of Dr. Schwartzreich, which concluded that Noone should stop work because of the danger of another cardiovascular event caused by stress on the job, including the threats to his life by the former probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">According to the magistrate, the report of the panel, and its focus on risk factors, left unanswered two questions: could the physical stress on Noone produced by lifting a heavy briefcase on May 19, 1983 \u2014 the event that immediately preceded Noone\u2019s hospitalization for myocardial infarction \u2014 be sufficient to amount to a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d caused by the performance of his duties? Did the myocardial infarction leave Noone with a diminution of coronary reserve as Dr. Baker had opined?</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The magistrate concluded that Noone had been \u201cdeprived of a proper medical panel evaluation in accordance with G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3),\u201d and recommended that the application be remanded to a new medical panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">CRAB\u2019s decision, after reciting the adoption of all the findings of fact of the magistrate, and after stating that an affirmative certificate of the medical panel is a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to an award of benefits, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cIn this case, the members of the medical panel unanimously certified that [Noone] was totally and permanently incapacitated from performing his duties but further certified that there was not a medical possibility of a causal relationship between the disability and a personal injury or hazard undergone while in the perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>anee of duties. Upon the facts as found and the reasonable inferences to be drawn [, i]t is this board\u2019s finding that [Noone] has not sustained his burden of showing a causal relationship between his disability and a personal injury or hazard undergone while in the performance of his duties. The decision of the [State board] is, therefore, affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Noone filed a complaint in the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, seeking judicial review of the CRAB decision, and a judge of the Superior Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The panel\u2019s certificate was in error in two respects. Of primary importance is the fact that the medical panel did not satisfactorily answer the third question assigned to it by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(a):<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> whether, in the opinion of the panel, the total and permanent disability of Noone \u201cis such as <em>might be </em>the natural and proximate result\u201d of a work-related injury (emphasis added). In block \u201cK\u201d of the form of certificate provided by the Commonwealth, the panel answered \u201cNo\u201d to the third issue. But the form also called upon the panel to state \u201cthe medical basis for your conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was in response to that instruction that the panel answered: \u201cpredisposed to coronary heart disease by multiple risk factors; myocardial infarction was not work-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The response of the panel is not without some ambiguity. Nevertheless, we take the effect of their certificate to be this: rather than stating whether Noone\u2019s disability \u201cmight be\u201d a work-related injury, as required by the statute, the panel gave an unqualified certificate that it was \u201cnot work-related.\u201d This construction is confirmed by the text of an accompanying letter to the State board from the chairman of the medical panel. The letter, which recapitulates the work and findings of the panel, concludes that \u201c[t]he panel carefully considered the multiple risk factors which he [Noone] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>was predisposed to coronary heart disease [\u00ed/c] and the panel concluded acute myocardial infarction was not work-related. The panel has therefore answered unanimously no to question three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The panel has no statutory authority to express an unqualified negative opinion as to causation, and such an opinion, if expressed, is a nullity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass, at 614-616. This is because the local board is entitled to know whether, in the opinion of the panel, there is a medical <em>possibility </em>that the causal relation exists; absent such information, the local board lacks medical information that, with nonmedical facts presented to the board, provides the basis for the decision of the local board on the question of causation. As noted above, the statute gives to the local board, not to the panel, the determination whether, on the relevant evidence, the causal relationship exists. As <em>Kelley, supra </em>at 616, points out, where \u201cthe certificate states only the conclusion that there is no causal connection, the local board does not know whether the opinion of the physicians on the possibility of causal connection is such that the board may proceed with the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">A second, and independent, ground for the legal insufficiency of the panel\u2019s certificate is the fact that the panel\u2019s reliance on \u201crisk factors\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> does not explain or justify its negative answer on causation. The issue, as the Supreme Judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>cial Court has pointed out, is whether the disability of the applicant was caused by the gradual deterioration of his cardiac organs \u2014 and thus not work-related \u2014 or whether his or her disability \u201cwas accelerated by a strain or exertion attributable to his work. . . .\u201d <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 116 (1951). See <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Brookline, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 264 (1987). Contrast <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 594-595 (1982) (distinguishing between compensable injuries arising from a specific injury at work and \u201cwear and tear\u201d injuries). It is not necessary that the work which caused the strain be heavy or unusual. <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 115. <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 485 n.4 (1985). The substantive issue that the statute assigns to the medical panel \u2014 whether Noone\u2019s total and permanent disability was such as \u201cmight be\u201d work-related \u2014 is not answered by reference to risk factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">CRAB\u2019s underlying error is that it mistakes the nature of the hearing before the board when a negative certificate of the medical panel is in evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Laws c. 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u00a7 16(4), gives \u201cany person . . . aggrieved\u201d by a decision of a retirement board the right to appeal to CRAB, and <em>Kelley </em>holds that \u201can applicant ... [is not] foreclosed by a plainly wrong medical certificate, or by a certificate made without conforming to the required procedure or physical examination and review of all the pertinent facts. It follows that [CRAB] may not affirm the decision of the local board on a negative certificate without giving the applicant an opportunity to show such wrong or illegal action. . . .\u201d 341 Mass, at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We conclude that the CRAB decision, resting entirely, as it does, on the erroneous opinion of the medical panel, is itself erroneous as matter of law, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), and its decision must be vacated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The case is to be remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment ordering a remand to CRAB for further proceedings. See <em>Kelley, supra </em>at 618. There should be a certificate by the medical panel as to whether Noone\u2019s disability resulted from an injury such as \u201cmight be the natural and proximate result\u201d of the performance of his duties. <em>Id. </em>at 616. See <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 462 n.9 (1985). The medical panel may seek and consider additional facts and opinions on the issue of causation. The certificate of the medical panel, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>with Noone\u2019s application, may then proceed to the State board for a decision on Noone\u2019s application.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), as amended through St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 18, provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cAny member in service classified in Group 1, Group 2 or Group 4, or any member in service classified in Group 3 to whom the provisions of subdivision (2) of section twenty-six are not applicable, <em>who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for further duty before attaining the maximum age for his group by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties </em>at some definite place and at some definite time . . . upon his written application on a prescribed form filed with the board . . . shall be retired for accidental disability ....

App. Ct. 420 (1973), upon which CRAB relies, does not control this case. In <em>Malden, </em>unlike the case before us, the panel\u2019s certificate <em>complied </em>with G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3)(ti), the principal issue there being simply whether CRAB could substitute its opinion for that of the majority of the panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">CRAB\u2019s brief acknowledges that the basis for the panel\u2019s determination that the myocardial infarction was not work-related was the panel\u2019s finding that Noone was \u201cpredisposed to coronary heart disease by multiple risk factors.\u201d The risk factors to which the panel referred were smoking, family history of heart disease (father and brother), obesity, and elevated cholesterol. The magistrate found that Noone\u2019s father did not die of a heart attack and that his mother died of diabetes. Further, in 1988, Noone\u2019s physician, after a physical examination, reported that Noone was five feet, eleven inches tall, and weighed 218 pounds. The Salem hospital record from 1983 states that Noone is \u201cslightly obese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Two prior CRAB decisions involve a panel\u2019s reliance on risk factors. See Humphrey v. Boston Retirement Bd., CR-87-464 (1988); O\u2019Connor v. Boston Retirement Bd., CR-9630 (1988). The magistrate in both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>cited cases pointed out that risk factors alone are not causes of disease. In Humphrey CRAB reversed the negative finding of causation by the medical panel. In O\u2019Connor CRAB remanded the case to the medical panel to determine whether the applicant\u2019s heart condition was work-related. (Both cases involved the so-called heart law presumption provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94 \u2014 a presumption not available to probation officers.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The precise contours of a hearing before CRAB are not easily described.

App. Ct. 456, 462 n.8 (1985), with the statements in <em>Kelley, supra </em>at 617 (an applicant does not have the opportunity \u201cfor a retrial of the medical facts\u201d where the medical panel has applied proper procedures and correct principles of law) and the statement in <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 462 n.9, that the panel\u2019s certificate, when not tainted by error of law, has \u201cindependent legal significance.\u201d Further, CRAB has the power under \u00a7 16(4) to \u201cemploy a registered physician to advise them in the determination of an appeal.\u201d But, as we have previously written, this is a \u201cdifficult area of the law,\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass.
