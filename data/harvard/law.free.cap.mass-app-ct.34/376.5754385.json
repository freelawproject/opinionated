L. c. 175. More particularly, the question before us is whether a life insurance policy, issued without previous medical examination, is defeated by a misrepresentation which increases the risk of loss to the insurer but is not found to be wilfully false, fraudulent, or misleading. A judge of the Superior Court held that the life insurance policy issued to the plaintiff\u2019s husband may not be so defeated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">On April 18, 1986, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, Erickson Torres (Torres), assisted by an insurance broker, completed an application for life insurance with the defendant, naming the plaintiff as primary beneficiary. The broker filled out the application by asking Torres a series of questions and filling in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>or checking off his answers; thereafter Torres signed the application. A policy was issued by the defendant without a medical examination. On January 27, 1987, Torres died while the policy was in full force. Relying on G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 186, see note 2, <em>infra, </em>the defendant denied coverage, alleging that Torres had made material misrepresentations of fact in the application which resulted in an increased risk of loss to the company. The judge, while finding that Torres\u2019s failure to disclose a history of Hepatitis B symptoms and liver problems had increased the risk of loss to the insurer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ruled that \u00a7 124, see note 3, <em>infra, </em>was controlling and that the insurer had failed in sustaining its burden under that statute of proving that the statements were wilfully false, fraudulent, or misleading. He thus concluded that \u00a7 124, which specifically deals with life insurance without a medical examination, is the governing statute and that \u00a7 186, which pertains to all types of policies, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Section 186, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adopted in 1878, and applicable to all insurance policies, provides that a misrepresentation is not material unless it is made with actual intent to deceive or unless it increases the risk of loss. Section 124, a later provision, adopted in 1892, also set out in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that where a life insurance policy is issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>without a previous medical examination, the statements in the application are binding on the insurer unless it proves such statements were wilfully false, fraudulent, or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">As the judge pointed out, if \u00a7 186 also applies to life insurance policies issued without medical examination, \u00a7 124 would be virtually meaningless. Under the defendant\u2019s construction, \u00a7 124 would apply only in those limited circumstances, if any, in which the words \u201cwilfully false, fraudulent or misleading\u201d (\u00a7 124) were found to have a broader scope than a \u201cmisrepresentation . . . made with actual intent to deceive.\u201d (\u00a7 186) \u201cSuch [an ineffective] result ought not to be imputed to the Legislature in enacting a statute unless no other result can be reached reasonably.\u201d <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R. </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>252 Mass. 432, 436 (1925). \u201cIt must be presumed that the Legislature intended to accomplish something substantial by the enactment of the later statute. It must be presumed also in this connection that the Legislature was aware of [\u00a7 186].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Moreover, where two provisions are in conflict,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *if a specific provision (life insurance policy issued without medical examination) is enacted subsequent to a more general rule, the specific and not the general provision applies. 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02, at 121 (5th ed. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Our interpretation of the statutory scheme is also confirmed by the legislative history of \u00a7 124. Under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 17, the Commissioner of Insurance is required to report annually to the Legislature. His Thirty-third Annual Report (1888), Part 2 at vii, discussed industrial insurance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>then a new and growing branch of the business of life insurance, and specifically recommended that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">\u201cif . . . risks are taken without a medical examination, alleged misrepresentation by the applicant \u2014 who in a large number of these cases is made to understand next to nothing of the statement he is asked to sign \u2014 as to his physical condition, ought not to be permitted as a bar when a claim arises. Misrepresentation by the agent and misunderstanding by the assured now lead, under the methods thus pursued, to almost innumerable cases of hardship and injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The Commissioner repeated this recommendation in his Thirty-fourth Annual Report, Part 2 at vii, in 1889, and again in his Thirty-sixth Report, Part 2, in 1891, when he wrote, at viii, that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cwould repeat and emphasize the suggestion, twice before made in these reports, that when any company effects insurance upon a life, without medical examination, it should be forbidden from setting up, as a bar to any claim, alleged misrepresentation by the insured as to his family history or his physical condition at the time the policy was issued . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Since \u00a7 186, see St. 1878 c. 157, \u00a7 1, see also St. 1887, c. 214, \u00a7 21, was already on the books when the Commissioner made his recommendation, it is evident that the Legislative intent, based on the Commissioner\u2019s report, in enacting \u00a7 124 was to preclude the insurer from raising any defenses not contained in \u00a7 124. See also Taylor, The Life Insurance Law of Massachusetts, 19 B.U.L. Rev. 53, 112 (1939), where the author, an associate counsel of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201cThe later statute [\u00a7 124] in effect carves an exception out of the earlier one [\u00a7 186] and renders it inapplicable to cases within the ambit of the later one. Both statutes made a fraudulent statement a defence, but the later one makes no reference to an increase in the risk of loss . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Based on our analysis, we hold that the defenses of \u00a7 186 are not available to the insurer and, since it did not sustain its burden under \u00a7 124,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The judge also noted that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that the liver condition contributed to the cause of death. The defendant died suddenly in a motel room in Hadley, Massachusetts. The autopsy disclosed presence of cocaine in the body.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 186, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u201cNo oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, <em>or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of </em>loss\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 124, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u201cIn any claim arising under a policy issued in the commonwealth <em>by any life company, without previous medical examination, </em>or without the knowledge and consent of the insured, or, if said insured is a minor, without the consent of the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of said minor, the statements made in the application as to the age, physical condition and family history of the insured shall be held to be valid and binding on the company; but the company shall not be debarred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>from providing as a defense to such claim that said statements were wilfully false, fraudulent or misleading\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The provisions may be considered conflicting because \u00a7 124 binds the insurance company to statements of physical condition in the application and only permits the insurer a single defense. Section 186, on the other hand, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>allows the insurer an additional defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\">We recognize that holders of industrial insurance, a form of insurance designed to furnish a burial fund on the deaths of children and adults where small sums are paid weekly as premiums (see Twenty-seventh Annual Report [1882] at vii), may deserve more protection than other holders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of life insurance policies. Nevertheless, as enacted in 1892, \u00a7 124 was made applicable to all life insurance policies issued without medical examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We reject as without merit the insurer\u2019s claim that Torres\u2019s statements in the application were not statements relating to physical condition. The application asked: \u201cWithin the past 10 years, has any person proposed to be insured had any known indication of or been treated for . . . any disorder or disease of the . . . liver?\u201d The answer was \u201cno.\u201d The judge found that Torres\u2019s medical records, among other things, indicated that his \u201cliver function tests were significantly elevated\u201d in 1984, that there was \u201cevidence of hepatitis B core antibody,\u201d and that Torres \u201cwas advised on May 17, 1984 to return to recheck his hepatitis B surface antigen in one month.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
