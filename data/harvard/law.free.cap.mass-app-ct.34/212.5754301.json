L. c. 32, \u00a7 9(1), appeals from a judgment affirming the adverse decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (board). The plaintiffs husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Raymond Burke, was a Lowell police officer until he retired for disability on September 29, 1978. He suffered at that time from a disabling lower back condition that was the result of two discrete traumatic episodes in the course of his official duties. He also suffered at that time from advanced cardiovascular disease. In his application for accidental disability retirement, Burke identified the first back injury as the \u201cpersonal injury sustained or hazard undergone by reason of which [he] claim[ed] to be incapacitated.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regional medical panel called for by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3), as in effect prior to St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 17, reported by independent certifications<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Burke was incapacitated for duty as a police officer, that the disability was likely to be permanent, and that said \u201cdisability [was] such as might be the natural and proximate result of the accident or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three physicians identified the back condition as the disabling condition; one also listed hypertension and vascular disease as disabling conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In 1982, Burke died of a heart attack, and the plaintiff sought accidental death benefits as a surviving spouse under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9(1) and (2)(a). If Burke had been in active service at the time of his death, the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for accidental death benefits would turn on whether Burke \u201cdied as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties\u201d (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9[1], as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Burke was not a member in service at the time of his death, the provisions of \u00a7 9(1) apply \u201calthough such member had previously been retired for accidental disability if the board [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] finds that such death was the natural and proximate result of the injury or hazard on account of which such member was retired.\u201d The record offers no support for the plaintiff\u2019s position that her husband was in fact retired on disability <em>both </em>for the back condition <em>and </em>for his cardiovascular disease. The board reached the only conclusion possible on the record: that the plaintiff\u2019s husband had in fact been retired for disability due only to his back condition. At most, only one of the three physicians whose certifications were necessary for retirement on accidental disability so certified with respect to Officer Burke\u2019s cardiovascular disease. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>341 Mass. 611, 615-617 (1961); <em>Malden Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 423-425 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Nothing in <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456 (1985), was meant to undermine the statutory requirement that accidental death benefits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>available for survivors of employees previously retired for accidental disability only where both the disability and the death stem from the same personal injury or hazard. In the case of Dr. Namay, a prison physician, the same injury, a beating by a prison inmate, which caused the disabling heart attack and led to the doctor\u2019s retirement on accidental disability was alleged to have been the cause of his brain tumor and subsequent death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case Dr. Sanella\u2019s opinion constituted evidence, analogous to that in <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>that Officer Burke\u2019s back injuries which precipitated his retirement also aggravated his preexisting cardiovascular disease and bore a causal relationship to his death. The board rejected this evidence, relying instead on the opinion of Dr. TifFt to the contrary. As the medical evidence was in conflict (contrast <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 639-641 [1985]), the board,-as the finder of fact, could properly reject the evidence of the requisite causal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">There is no question on the record that Officer Burke suffered from serious cardiovascular disease at the time of his retirement. Had his application for accidental disability retirement been predicated on cardiovascular disease, the retirement board would have had to determine whether the cardiovascular disease was work related. It was not called upon to do so, however, because Officer Burke was retired instead for an unrelated, disabling condition. The heart attack came when Officer Burke was no longer in active service. Accidental death benefits are normally afforded only to survivors of employees who, at the time of death, were in active service. By the last sentence of \u00a7 9(1),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> accidental death benefits are also extended to survivors of those retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>for accidental disability, in the single situation where the disability and the later death result from the same personal injury or hazard. Where, as here, that is found not to be the fact, survivors of an inactive employee (e.g., one previously retired due to age or non-job-related disability) are ineligible for accidental death benefits, even if they establish a causal connection between the condition causing death and the employee\u2019s prior work. Such survivors are remitted instead to the less generous benefits generally afforded to survivors of retired employees under the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">For the reasons stated by the judge, there was no error in the board\u2019s engagement of Dr. Tifft under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), third par., or in accepting his opinion over that of Dr. Sanella. Nothing in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 640, required the board to articulate reasons for preferring one medical opinion over another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The answer was, \u201cBack injury - Totman Road - Day Shift - Lowell, Mass. - 7-29-75.\u201d On that day he fell through a window, catching his foot and twisting his back.

The certificate of Dr. Denis King mentioned only the back condition. On a separate form (\u201cPhysician\u2019s report\u201d), however, Dr. King listed, in addition to the back condition, hypertension and arteriosclerosis as \u201csubjective and objective symptoms of which said person [i.e., Burke] complains,\u201d and stated that he was incapacitated \u201cby reason of the above-described conditions.\u201d Dr. King added the \u201cs\u201d at the end of \u201ccondition\u201d; the physician\u2019s report form employs the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Section 9(1) goes on to state, \u201cat some definite place and at some definite time\u201d; but, in keeping with the apparent intention of the Legislature when, by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, it changed \u201caccident\u201d to \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 7(1) and 9(1), the latter section is held not to exclude injuries of a progressive or cumulative nature caused by conditions at work.
