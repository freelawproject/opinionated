[Case No. 12,483a.]\u2019 The questions in the ease were interesting in themselves, and were rendered yet more so by a subsequent decision rendered by Judge Hall, in the Northern district of this state, in which the question of the rights of mortgagees upon vessels came up, and in which Judge Hall expressed different views from those held by Judge Betts on the subject.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b749-3\">Mr. Cutting, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b749-4\">E.

This course seemed best to all concerned, and a decree was entered affirming the decree of the district court, dismissing the libel, with costs. An order was also made directing that the fund in question, being one-half of the proceeds of the ship, be brought up from the district court, and invested by the clerk of the circuit court in the United States Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">[On appeal to the supreme court, the decree of this court was affirmed. 19 How.
