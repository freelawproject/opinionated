This action [by Vincenzio Salzobel and others against the brig Rolling Wave, and W. W. Collins, her master] was brought to recover damages for breach of a charter party.

The answer denied that allegations of the libel constitute any cause for action against the vessel, and set up other matters, which, not being supported by proofs, cannot be considered by the court.
