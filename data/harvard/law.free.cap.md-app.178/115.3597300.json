Appellant, Carol MacPhail, requested under the MPIA that appellee, the Comptroller of Maryland (\u201cComptroller\u201d), disclose a copy of the Maryland tax return that was filed by her late mother\u2019s estate. The Comptroller denied the request, stating that the MPIA has a mandatory exception to its disclosure policy for those records that other Maryland statutes protect from disclosure. Included among those statutes is Maryland Code (1988, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 13-202 of the Tax-General Article (\u201cT.-G.\u201d), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>prohibits the disclosure of \u201ctax information,\u201d including tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Appellant challenged the Comptroller\u2019s denial of her request in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court upheld the Comptroller\u2019s decision, prompting this appeal. Appellant presents four issues for our review, which we have recast as two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">I. Whether the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s MPIA request for the 1984 tax return for appellant\u2019s late mother\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">II. Whether the court erred by requiring appellant to carry the burden of proof of entitlement to disclosure of records requested under the MPIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">On May 9, 2006, appellant faxed a letter to the Comptroller requesting, pursuant to the MPIA, \u201ca copy of the original Maryland Estate Tax Return for [her] late mother\u2019s estate\u201d that was filed with the Comptroller on January 6, 1984. The Comptroller denied the request by letter dated June 14, 2006, stating, \u201cpursuant to the Annotated Code of Maryland, Tax-General \u00a7 13-202 and \u00a7 13-203, disclosure of tax information is prohibited except in accordance with a proper judicial order or a legislative order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Appellant filed, pro se, a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review\u201d in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, stating that the Comptroller denied her request: \u201c(a.) without giving a reason under MPIA for the denial; (b.) without providing the legal basis under MPIA for the denial; and (c.) without advising Petitioner about the remedy under MPIA to challenge the denial.\u201d The Comptroller did not file a timely response, prompting appellant to file a Motion for Default Judgment. The Comptroller responded before entry of default judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>explaining that it was required to deny appellant\u2019s MPIA request because inspection would be contrary to the tax statute that generally prohibits disclosure of tax returns. The circuit court denied the Motion for Default Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">On December 21, 2006, the court held a hearing on the Petition for Judicial Review. Appellant appeared at the hearing unrepresented by counsel. She framed the issue as \u201cwhether the Comptroller sustains his burden under the Maryland Public\u2014[sic] for acts under the Maryland Public Information Act to deny my request since the Maryland Legislature at [MPIA \u00a7 10\u2014617(f)(2) &amp; (3) ] clearly intended that my mother\u2019s estate records be disclosed to me, a person of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Comptroller responded that the MPIA has a mandatory exception to its disclosure policy for records \u201cthat [are] not disclosable as a matter of law.\u201d The Comptroller informed the court that \u00a7 13-202 of the Tax-General Article prohibits the disclosure of \u201ctax information,\u201d which is defined in T.-G. \u00a7 13-201 to include information from tax returns. The Comptroller stated that appellant\u2019s status as the daughter of the decedent did not entitle her to disclosure of the estate\u2019s confidential tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Appellant responded that her request was for \u201cfinancial information,\u201d which under the MPIA is available for inspection by a \u201cperson in interest.\u201d Appellant argued that, as the daughter of the decedent, she is a person in interest. She further argued that the MPIA does not specifically identify tax records as exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The court denied the Petition for Judicial Review. The court ruled that, under a plain reading of the MPIA, and absent any case law interpreting \u201cfinancial information\u201d to include tax records, \u201cthe [c]ourt could not order the Comptroller to turn over the records because the Legislature has directed that it not be done.\u201d The court memorialized its ruling in an order dated January 3, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The General Assembly enacted the MPIA in 1970, four years after Congress\u2019s passage of the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), now codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 <em>et seq. </em>(2000). <em>See Blythe v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 492, 513, 870 A.2d 1246 (tracing the origins of the MPIA), <em>cert. granted, </em>388 Md. 97, 879 A.2d 42 (2005). \u201cThe purpose of the Maryland Public Information Act ... is virtually identical to that of the FOIA\u201d; consequently, to the extent that the MPIA is like the FOIA, the federal circuits\u2019 interpretation of the FOIA is persuasive. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880 (1984); <em>accord Stromberg Metal Works, Inc. v. Univ. of Md., </em>382 Md. 151, 854 A.2d 1220 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Like the FOIA, the MPIA grants to the public the right to inspect public records. <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 506, 474 A.2d 880. Consistent with its purpose, the Act expressly states that its provisions \u201cshall be construed in favor of permitting inspection of a public record.... \u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-612(b); <em>accord Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 544-45, 759 A.2d 249 (2000); <em>A.S. Abell Publ\u2019g Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983). Notwithstanding the broad access to records that is generally afforded by the MPIA, the Act specifically exempts certain records from disclosure. S.G. \u00a7 10-615 expressly requires custodians of public records to deny inspection of public records in certain specific circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">A custodian shall deny inspection of a public record or any part of a public record if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">(1) by law, the public record is privileged or confidential; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(2) the inspection would be contrary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">(i) a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">(ii) a federal statute or a regulation that is issued under the statute and has the force of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">(iii) the rules adopted by the Court of Appeals; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(iv) an order of a court of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Denial of a request for a record that comes within \u00a7 10-615 is mandatory. <em>Blythe, </em>161 Md.App. at 516, 870 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The Comptroller argues that the estate tax return sought by appellant comes within S.G. \u00a7 10-615(2)(i), which requires denial of a request to inspect a public record if \u201cthe inspection would be contrary to ... a State statute.\u201d The Comptroller directs us to T-G \u00a7 13-202, which prohibits State employees from disclosing \u201cin any manner, any tax information.\u201d \u201cTax information\u201d is defined in T.G. \u00a7 13-201(1) as \u201cparticulars disclosed in a tax return required under this article, if the return contains return information as defined in \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d \u201cTax information\u201d is further defined in T.G. \u00a7 13-201(2) as \u201cany return information, as defined in \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, required to be attached to or included in a tax return required under this article.\u201d \u201cReturn information\u201d is defined in \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">a taxpayer\u2019s identity, the nature, source, or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, overassessments, or tax payments ... or any other data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary [of the Treasury] with respect to a return ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">We have said that the MPIA is modeled on the FOIA; consequently, decisions interpreting the federal statute are persuasive in interpreting counterpart provisions of the MPIA. <em>Faulk, </em>299 Md. at 506, 474 A.2d 880. Like S.G. \u00a7 10-615, the FOIA exempts from disclosure any material that is protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>by a separate statute. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (exempting from disclosure any material that is protected by a separate statute, provided the statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public, and the statute establishes criteria for withholding or specifies the particular materials to be withheld). Courts have held that \u00a7 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, cited above, qualifies as a statute that comes within the nondisclosure provisions of \u00a7 552(b)(3) of the FOIA. <em>See e.g., Landmark Legal Foundation v. I.R.S., </em>267 F.3d 1132, 1134 (D.C.Cir.2001); <em>Grasso v. I.R.S., </em>785 F.2d 70, 75 (3rd Cir.1986); <em>Currie v. I.R.S., </em>704 F.2d 523, 526-28 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>King v. I.R.S., </em>688 F.2d 488, 496 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Mason v. Callaway, </em>554 F.2d 129, 131 (4th Cir.1977) (per curiam); <em>Fruehauf Corp. v. I.R.S., </em>566 F.2d 574, 578 (6th Cir.1977); <em>Grenier v. U.S. I.R.S., </em>449 F.Supp. 834, 840 &amp; n. 22 (D.Md. 1978). The federal authority on the subject reinforces our construction of counterpart provisions of the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We mention that there is a provision in the Tax General Article, \u00a7 13-203, that permits disclosure, under specific circumstances, of tax information to certain individuals and entities. Under that section, disclosure may be available, provided it is \u201cin accordance with a proper judicial order or a legislative order\u201d; made to an employee of the State who has a right to the information by reason of employment; or made to another tax collector, the Maryland Tax Court, a legal representative of the State in limited circumstances, a license-issuing authority in specified instances, or as part of a publication of statistics that does not reveal personal information. None of the statutory exceptions to nondisclosure of tax information applies to appellant\u2019s request for the estate tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellant cites <em>Ashton v. Cherne Contracting Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 87, 648 A.2d 1067 (1994), for the proposition that federal and state tax returns \u201care not privileged ... [and] they are discoverable.\u201d We held in <em>Ashton </em>that tax returns are discoverable from the taxpayer, and we agreed with other jurisdictions that \u201cstatutes [such as T.-G. \u00a7 13-202] that provide for nondisclosure of tax return information by govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ment employees do not preclude disclosure by the taxpayer himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 648 A.2d 1067 (emphasis added). The holding of Ashton has no effect on the statute\u2019s mandate of nondisclosure by the government. Ashton is of no help to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">We conclude that the information contained in a Maryland estate tax return falls within the definition of \u201ctax information,\u201d and, consequently, may not be disclosed by personnel within the Comptroller\u2019s Office under T.-G. \u00a7 13-202. Because that statute prohibits disclosure of tax information, including tax returns, those records are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10\u2014615(2)(i) of the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Appellant does not seriously contest that interpretation of the Act. She argues, however, that the Comptroller denied her request for the estate tax return because she lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to request it. Appellant evidently misunderstands the basis of the Comptroller\u2019s denial and believes that her request was denied under S.G. \u00a7 10-617(f)(2) and (3), which prohibit disclosure of \u201cfinancial information,\u201d except to \u201ca person in interest.\u201d Appellant seems to argue that the estate tax return is \u201cfinancial information,\u201d to which she is entitled under S.G. \u00a7 10\u2014617(f) as a person in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument is flawed in two respects. First, the Comptroller did not deny her request for the estate tax return on the ground that she \u201clacked standing\u201d under \u00a7 10-617(f) to request it. The Comptroller denied the request because \u00a7 10-615(2)(i) of the Act prohibits disclosure. Second, to the extent that appellant contends that a tax return is \u201cfinancial information,\u201d and thereby subject to disclosure to persons in interest, \u00a7 10\u2014617(f) simply does not support the contention. Such a construction of the \u201cfinancial information\u201d provision would create a fatal inconsistency between that section of the MPIA and \u00a7 10-615(2)(i), which prohibits disclosure of documents when inspection would be contrary to State statute. It is a settled rule of statutory construction that various sections of a statute are to be construed in harmony. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm. v. Anderson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>395 Md. 172, 183, 909 A.2d 694 (2006). The MPIA simply does not bear the construction appellant would have us give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Appellant argues that the court erred in requiring her to produce case law construing tax records as financial information under MPIA \u00a7 10\u2014617(f). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The MPIA requires the custodian to carry the burden of justifying denial of a request for disclosure of documents. S.G. \u00a7 10-623(b)(2)(i). As the custodian of tax returns, the Comptroller met that burden by (1) establishing that the MPIA mandates nondisclosure when the inspection would be contrary to state statute and (2) showing that the Tax-General Article of the Maryland Code prohibits disclosure of tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">As we read the court\u2019s comments to appellant, the court simply was pointing out to her that, in the absence of any authority for the proposition that tax returns are subject to disclosure as financial information under S.G. \u00a7 10-617(f), the law is clear that tax returns cannot be disclosed under S.G. \u00a7 10-615(2)(i). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\">.
