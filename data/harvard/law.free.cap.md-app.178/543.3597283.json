Mr. G. challenges that ruling on appeal. He asks: \u201cDid the court abuse its discretion in terminating the permanency plan of reunification?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the court erred in finding that DSS made reasonable efforts, and therefore it erred or abused its discretion in changing the permanency plan. Accordingly, we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">James was born on July 26, 1996, to Mr. G. and Rhonda A. He lived with his mother until March of 2004. At that time, James began to live with appellant, because Ms. A.\u2019s drug abuse prevented her from caring for James. A few months later, on August 6, 2004, Mr. G. was arrested for a violation of parole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On August 13, 2004, the Department filed a Petition with Request for Shelter Care, alleging that James was a child in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the Department, James had been \u201cin the care of his father for the past four months,\u201d and they were \u201cliving with the father\u2019s lady friend, Deborah Holman.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Petition recounted appellant\u2019s incarceration, and also noted that Ms. A., a drug abuser, was not enrolled in treatment, was living a \u201ctransient lifestyle,\u201d and could not be contacted by the Department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By order of August 13, 2004, James was placed in the care of Ms. Holman pending an adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">At a hearing on September 29, 2004, the parties stipulated that James was a CINA. Appellant reported that he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>released from incarceration in October 2004.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Ms. Holman was apparently faced with loss of her Section 8 housing as of November 1, 2004, the parties jointly recommended placement of James with his aunt, Joslyn B. Accordingly, on October 8, 2004, James was adjudicated a CI\u00d1A and committed to the custody of the Department, with limited guardianship granted to Ms. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">After a review hearing on August 29, 2005, the court placed James with his paternal cousin, Angela C.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court also issued an Order on that date, establishing a permanency plan of \u201creunification with parent or guardian,\u201d to be achieved by August 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">A master for juvenile causes held a six-month review hearing on May 16, 2006. On May 24, 2006, pursuant to the master\u2019s recommendation, the court entered an Order continuing James\u2019s placement with his cousin, and continuing the permanency plan of reunification. However, it extended the target date for implementation until May 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">At the next six-month review hearing, held by a master on December 12, 2006, the parties requested a \u201ccontested hearing\u201d concerning the permanency plan. At that evidentiary hearing, held by a master on February 23, 2007, DSS sought to change James\u2019s permanency plan from parental reunification to placement with a relative for custody and guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Philomena Ukadike,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a DSS case worker who had been assigned to James since April 2006, was the sole witness for DSS. She reported that James was in the fourth grade, with average grades, and was receiving therapy at Kennedy Krieg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>er for minor behavioral issues. Ukadike recounted that, during the period between July 2006 and December 2006, she met with appellant just once, at the cousin\u2019s home. In addition, she stated: \u201c[H]e came to the office once to see my supervisor.\u201d According to Ukadike, DSS and appellant had executed a \u201cservice agreement,\u201d which required appellant to obtain employment and housing, and to maintain contact with James and with the Department. However, the service agreement was not placed in the record, and no evidence was presented as to the Department\u2019s obligations, if any, under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">With regard to the Department\u2019s request to change James\u2019s permanency plan, Ukadike stated: \u201cThis child came into care in 2004. This is 2007. It\u2019s over 12 months and [appellant] hasn\u2019t provided documentation for employment or housing.... [W]e can\u2019t do reunification at this point.\u201d She acknowledged, however, that while Ms. C. was \u201cinterested\u201d in being certified as a foster parent, she \u201chasn\u2019t expressed any interest [in adoption]. She [i.e., Ms. C] is hoping that the parents will really try to have a reunification with the child.\u201d The following exchange is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now with regard to the change in plan, you\u2019re recommending that the plan be changed to limited placement for custody and guardianship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asb\">[UKADIKE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And not adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXJ\">[UKADIKE]: No because child [sic] is 10 years old and I do know that the child is attached to his parents especially the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">[APPELLANT S COUNSEL]: Other than [appellant\u2019s] lack of more stable employment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">[UKADIKE]: And housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">[APPELLANT S COUNSEL]:\u2014and lack of housing is there anything else that would prevent James from being returned to his father\u2019s care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">[UKADIKE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And are you saying then that the lack of housing and the lack of adequate employment is what makes you want to change the plan from reunification to placement with a relative for custody and guardianship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">[UKADIKE]: Yeah because it\u2019s over two years this child has been in placement. [Appellant] you know for the past two years hasn\u2019t been able to fulfill those plans. (Boldface added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">As to appellant\u2019s unemployment, Ukadike stated that appellant had met with her supervisor at the DSS office, who referred appellant to one organization, People Encouraging People, \u201cto see if they could help him.\u201d That was the only referral made by DSS. According to Ukadike, appellant \u201ccall[ed] back and said that he did go [and] that they say they couldn\u2019t help him.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Ukadike claimed she had discussed the issue of appellant\u2019s unemployment with him. But, she did not specify the number of conversations or the dates of such conversations. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you ever discuss his employment status with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">[UKADIKE]: Yeah he told me that he\u2019s looking for employment but he doesn\u2019t have enough experience and it\u2019s difficult for him to find employment and he\u2019s coming to [an] employment agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: [S]o you\u2019re saying he told you he\u2019s working through a temporary agency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">[UKADIKE]: Yes, and he said it\u2019s difficult for him to work a job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So does the work through the temporary employment agency in your mind count as employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">[UKADIKE]: Well he said he has shown me his check. He said he\u2019s not making money to be able to have housing or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>Did he appear to be working but just not making enough money?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">[UKADIKE]: <em>Well don\u2019t know if he\u2019s working. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s working. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Later in the hearing, Ukadike was asked whether there was \u201canything else that the Department of Social Services can do to help [appellant] gain more gainful employment.\u201d She responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">As to housing, Ukadike explained that the Department had not provided appellant with housing assistance, because he did not have a job. She noted that, for his address, appellant had provided her with the address of his girlfriend, Ms. Holman, with whom he and James had lived prior to appellant\u2019s incarceration. Testifying over appellant\u2019s hearsay objection, Ukadike said that she had contacted Holman, who advised that appellant was not living with her.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But, she indicated that appellant is her friend, and that he visits to help her because she is disabled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ukadike recounted that she scheduled a home visit with Holman to assess her residence, but Holman cancelled the appointment. Ukadike offered Holman two other dates for the home visit, both of which Holman rejected. Ukadike stated that, \u201c[o]n that note I told her when you think it\u2019s appropriate to call me and I will come for the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>assessment. I didn\u2019t hear from her again.\u201d Ukadike admitted that she did not contact Holman again, nor did she contact appellant to assess his housing situation. Nevertheless, Ukadike performed a clearance on Holman for purposes of visitation between appellant and James at her home, and stated that the results were \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">According to DSS, appellant exercised occasional visitation with James. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAP\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: [Besides the Thanksgiving visit since the last review court [sic] which was in May what has been the visitation schedule that father has had with James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">[UKADIKE]: [Appellant] use [sic] to go [to the cousin\u2019s home] to visit James. Sometimes take James out and bring him because I\u2019ve seen him on one or more occasion that I went on a visit he brought James over to the caretaker so I could visit with James prior to Thanksgiving you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: What was the frequency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATr\">[UKADIKE]: There was no frequency.... [Appellant] could call the child once a week or for the next two or three weeks the child wouldn\u2019t hear from him or see him. There was no frequency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what is the visitation schedule mother is following?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">[UKADIKE]: None because mother hasn\u2019t come to have a service agreement. However I\u2019ve heard from the child that when the child do visit the godmother [sic][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] mother do come over there and see the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And how often does the [child] go to see his grandmother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>[UKADIKE]: Every other weekend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The following transpired on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuD\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: With regard to the visits [between appellant and James] are the visits supervised by Department of Social Service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">[UKADIKE]: It was never a supervised visit, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3R\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So you never had concerns about [appellant] mistreating his child so [as to] make you want to have supervised visits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">[UKADIKE]: Not to the best of my knowledge. The only concern we have is that [on one occasion appellant] failed to return the child on time. The child missed two days of school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But that\u2019s information you got from the caregiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah9\">[UKADIKE]: And also Ms. [Holman]. And also the godmother of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: With regard to the number of visits since they\u2019re not at the agency you don\u2019t have any direct knowledge as to how many visits occur or when they occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">[UKADIKE]: I do talk to the child. The child did tell me when he sees his father. Since November the child hasn\u2019t seen the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s based on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnF\">[UKADIKE]: Based on [James] not going to see the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you know this because.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHj\">[UKADIKE]: The child has said and the caretaker has said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So the Department of Social Service has no problem with [appellant] picking up his son and visiting with his child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">[UKADIKE]: ... We don\u2019t have a problem. The reason why the visit was stopped was ... an adult was living in the home. We didn\u2019t do any supervised inspection for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>home. I didn\u2019t know anything about it you know that\u2019s why the visit was stopped. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">After Ukadike\u2019s testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the Department had not presented sufficient evidence to support a change in the permanency plan. The master disagreed, stating: \u201cThe court believes the Department of Social Services has presented a prima facie case for the court to make a determination as to whether the plan should be changed in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Appellant testified in his own behalf. He stated that he has no high school diploma, but has experience in warehousing, construction, and dishwashing, and was \u201cout every day at least four days out of the week putting in applications\u201d for work. His job search included placing applications with temp agencies and with the City of Baltimore. His last employment, in 2006, had been temporary. He claimed that Ukadike had never discussed employment assistance with him, although her supervisor had given him a referral \u201cthat I went to and it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">[JAMES\u2019S COUNSEL]: You said that things did not work out with People Encouraging People?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">[JAMES\u2019S COUNSEL]: What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">[APPELLANT]: Well they were more on the tip that they were trying to help people that maybe that had HIV or something like that helping those type of people. I told them I needed help as far as housing or jobwise or whatever and they say there was nothing they could do with me about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">[JAMES\u2019S COUNSEL]: And when they told you they couldn\u2019t help you did you go back to the Department of Social Services for another referral?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">[APPELLANT]: No ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">[JAMES\u2019S COUNSEL]: And why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">[APPELLANT]: Because I just went out and did my thing as far as trying to get a job on my own you know and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>guess doing what I had to do. I never went back to talk to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">[JAMES\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you know if anything else was available?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">[APPELLANT]: Not with them but I just went out on my own like I said and tried to get a job myself and do it the way I knew how.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Appellant was also questioned concerning his visitation with James:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: How often do you talk with your son James and since last summer how frequently have you visited?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">[APPELLANT]: Oh we talk on the phone a lot. He calls me. I call him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And when you say a lot can you give us a number? Once a week, twice a week, once a month or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">[APPELLANT]: No I talk to James at least a good five times out of a week. He calls me when he get out of school. He talks to me. I call him sometimes before he goes to bed and we talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And how often do you actually see him in person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-12\">[APPELLANT]: Well I just recently seen him but before\u2014 I just recently seen him maybe what a week or two weeks ago. Before then I would call ask [sic] about seeing him but he was spending time with his grandmother on his mother\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can you visit him at his grandmother\u2019s house on his mother\u2019s side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t even\u2014she don\u2019t talk to me and I haven\u2019t been talking to the grandmother really. When he goes over there, it\u2019s like he don\u2019t call me when he over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>there. He say he just don\u2019t call when he over there or they won\u2019t let him or something like that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Have you spoken with [the cousin] about visiting with James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah she lets me visit with him. I use to could go get him bring him over and keep him but that\u2019s been changed now so. We still having a good thing of being together and talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And do you love James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdK\">[APPELLANT]: Yes ma\u2019am I sure do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And does he appear in your view to love you too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes. We have our father and son time and our little chats. We miss each other cause we apart but when we get together he tells me he want to be with me. I want to be with him and I let him know that it\u2019s a little something going on now and we\u2019ll get together. We\u2019re gonna get it together one day so you know I\u2019m just going with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">On cross-examination, James\u2019s counsel asked appellant how many times he had seen James since December of 2006. Appellant responded that he had seen him \u201ca nice amount of times. I been seeing him on and off sometimes and also talking with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The master then heard argument of counsel. The Department\u2019s attorney asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">According to Ms. [Ukadike\u2019s] testimony the respondent has been in the same placement since July of 2005. Bonding has definitely occurred. He is progressing in school. His therapeutic needs are being met. As you\u2019ve heard, he does visit with his father but through all of these years with a plan of reunification the requirements of housing and employment have not been met. The Department would recognize and commend the efforts. However, we haven\u2019t had the results we need to plan properly for James and to plan for his permanency in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">You did hear testimony that at this time mother is not in a situation to accept reunification. Father is not in a situation to accept reunification. Accordingly, the Department is requesting that the plan be changed so that we can head in a direction to provide permanency for the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Counsel for James and appellant both opposed the Department\u2019s request for a change in the permanency plan. James\u2019s attorney argued that the Department\u2019s referral of appellant to People Encouraging People was \u201cnot ... appropriate,\u201d and that the Department should provide further employment assistance to appellant. Appellant\u2019s lawyer echoed those arguments, stating: \u201cWe believe that the department has not made reasonable efforts to implement the permanency plan basically on the reasons she has stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Seems like the Department has done some things although it certainly could have done more. It seems like the father did some things although it seems like he could\u2019ve done more as well.... There has to be a plan and there has to be something to show that the plan is going to be fulfilled. The plan here is ... reunification with the parent.... The Department of Social Services and the parents have an obligation to do something to fulfill that plan. And even if they do fulfill that plan and they do everything they\u2019re supposed to do and the plan doesn\u2019t work out ... the court has to change the plan. Here the father says he has been looking for employment. I do believe that he has been doing everything he is supposed to do but there has to be something that\u2019s going to come out of there. It\u2019s just I looked, I looked, I looked, and I looked hard and I looked hard and nothing happened and the plan is not supposed to change. That\u2019s not the way it works. The way it works [is] I looked. I tried. The Department assisted me and like I said the Department certainly could\u2019ve done a little better than what it did. And then I got a job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and they gave me a house and then we\u2019re all happy, but that\u2019s not happening because the first part is not being fulfilled for whatever reason. And it doesn\u2019t seem to be any time table on which those things are going to be fulfilled .... Therefore the court will unfortunately have to change the plan because the plan that we have is not moving forward----I don\u2019t see a particular problem with ... the child visiting in the father\u2019s home except for this whole issue of inspection of the home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. The court will change the plan to placed with a relative for custody and guardianship. Limited custody to the Department of Social Services and the caretaker pending the next hearing. The court will find reasonable efforts in that the child is placed with a relative. That the Department is monitoring the respondent\u2019s educational needs and refer the respondent for appropriate therapy in this matter. The court will direct that the Department of Social Services and the father enter into a service agreement within 30 days and the Department of Social Services is to provide the [appellant] with appropriate employment referrals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Within 30 days the Department of Social Service [sic] to assess where the father resides for the purposes of overnight visits with the respondent in that home. The Department says they don\u2019t have a particular problem with the child having overnights as long as the father brings the child back on time.

He challenged the proposed change in the permanency plan and the proposed finding that the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>partment made reasonable efforts with regard to reunification. On March 5, 2007, the court adopted the master\u2019s proposed order as its Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The hearing on Exceptions was held on April 26, 2007. The court noted that the change of permanency plan to include adoption was not consistent with the transcript of the proceedings before the master, stating: \u201cI think the adoption was a mistake. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Master Sampson intended to put in there. It was custody and guardianship.\u201d The court then asked appellant\u2019s counsel: \u201c[I]f there was a concurrent plan of reunification does that change the position of your client?\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201c[I]t might change the argument somewhat because the main reason that this was filed was because this did say adoption; and that\u2019s a pretty drastic change.\u201d Counsel for the Department resisted the suggestion of a concurrent plan. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7x\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: We would have issue with a concurrent plan of reunification. That is different as I see it from a secondary plan of reunification which is essentially always a plan with the Department to continue working with parents who wish to continue. [In m]y way of thinking concurrent is a plan running right along side in first place with placement with a relative for custody and guardianship and requires the Department to take the same action toward that plan as it would take if it were the only plan. And we were looking to move on to a different permanency plan, one which would satisfy [James\u2019s] needs as the child ...

[ellipsis in original].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, that is the mandate from the federal government, for the Department, that\u2019s the setup that the Department follows the concept of I believe, concurrent, as I see it exists in the courtroom and with this Court and in orders, but is often what the Department conceptualizes as the role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Secondary is backup.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Department\u2019s attorney also informed the court that, since the hearing before the master, the Department had assessed Ms. Holman\u2019s home and permitted overnight visits there between appellant and James.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">James\u2019s attorney asked the court to continue the plan of reunification. She said,:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">[W]e are asking that the permanency plan ... remain reunification or, in the alternative, for it to be a concurrent plan of relative placement for custody and guardianship along with reunification. Our main goal is to really keep reunification as part of the permanency plan in order for the Department of Social Services to continue to provide services to either mother or father toward the goal of reunification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">I do believe that there are other services out there that the Department could have referred [appellant] to but when he came before the Court, Ms. Ukadike said that she didn\u2019t know what other services she could have referred him to, she didn\u2019t know if there were any other services. [Appellant] says to me that the Department did not really make reasonable efforts to look for any other services. I cannot believe that there are not other agencies out there that would assist [appellant] with ... the obstacles that he has, such as being an ex-convict ... as well as the fact that he doesn\u2019t have a high school diploma....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">I really [think] that if we were to change the plan to relative placement, what we are really doing is having James stay with his Aunt under the guise of relative placement for custody and guardianship; but in fact, it\u2019s going to be really long-term foster care and there would be no effort by the Department to help mother and father to regain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>unification. They are going to be left trying to get that on their own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">On April 26, 2007, the court issued an Order stating that \u201cthe existing Orders were sufficient for the present,\u201d and that it would hold \u201cthe decision in this case Sub Curia\u201d and \u201cfile an order in the future.\u201d The promised Order followed on May 10, 2007. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">The BCDSS has made reasonable, although certainly not exemplary, efforts to achieve reunification. The permanency plan for James until this hearing has been reunification with a parent or guardian. Baltimore City Department of Social Services made the following reasonable efforts with the parent/guardian in support of this plan: entered into a service agreement, referred Respondent for therapeutic services and placement in the home of a relative thereby strengthening family ties, monitored Respondent\u2019s father\u2019s employment and monitored the respondent\u2019s education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">Certainly, more could have been done to help Respondent\u2019s father get a job, which would in turn have helped with getting housing. However, given the length of time Respondent has been removed from the home, Master Sampson\u2019s statement that the changing of the plan is \u201cboth practicable and realistic\u201d is a sound conclusion. Respondent has been out of the home for 22 months, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. 675(5)(F). Nevertheless, and even though the plan will be changed to placement with a relative for custody and guardianship, BCDSS must make more aggressive efforts to help [appellant] obtain employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">Plan changed from reunification to placement with a Relative for Custody and Guardianship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr\">Exception as to the recommendation by Master Sampson that the plan change from one of reunification to relative placement is not sustained. However, Master Sampson\u2019s recommendation that the new plan include one of placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>with a relative for ADOPTION is not accepted simply because that appears to be an oversight since Master Sampson, on the record, clearly did not envision adoption by Respondent\u2019s cousin as one of the plans. Therefore, the plan does not include that of adoption by a relative. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Appellant complains that the court erred or abused its discretion \u201cin terminating the permanency plan of reunification.\u201d In support of his position, appellant argues that the court erred in its underlying finding that DSS made reasonable efforts to achieve reunification. Further, appellant contends that, given the failure of DSS to make reasonable efforts to assist him in finding employment and housing, his lack of both did not justify a change in the permanency plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">According to appellant, \u201c[i]t strains credulity that \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 can constitute a single referral to assist a parent who has little education as well as a criminal record find a job.\u201d Although appellant concedes that the Department \u201cis not required to make reasonable efforts where attempts at reunification would obviously be futile,\u201d he contends that \u201cthis clearly was not such a case.\u201d Appellant continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">In circumstances such as those presented here, that do not involve physical abuse or harm to the child, the law does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>not permit the Department to be passive when it removes children from their parents\u2019 custody. The law requires the Department to bring its skills, experience, and resources to bear in a reasonable way to bring about reunification. Part of the social worker\u2019s role is to assist the parent in following the service plan. The Department simply did not present evidence that it did so in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">DSS counters that the court \u201chad ample evidence to find that the plan of reunification was no longer viable.\u201d It highlights that, at the time of the hearing, James had been in DSS\u2019s custody for over two years. In its view, appellant \u201cinappropriately urges lingering foster care over permanence and as such is wholly at odds with the permanency planning review process that was established by federal mandate.\u201d DSS concludes: \u201cSecuring James a placement with a paternal relative was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion, for it placed James\u2019s best interest at the forefront by affording him permanency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">With regard to the reasonable efforts issue, DSS maintains that appellant \u201cabdicated his role in partnering with the Department to find steady employment and housing by declining to make contact with the Department until December 2006; giving caseworkers a false home address; and declining to inform the Department about his lack of employment success after it referred him to People Encouraging People.\u201d Claiming that \u201c[t]he State is not obliged to find employment for the parent,\u201d DSS contends that, \u201c[i]n light of [appellant\u2019s] failure to work with the Department, and given his unilateral, unsuccessful approach to finding employment, the court correctly found that the Department\u2019s [single] referral to People Encouraging People was a reasonable effort to assist [appellant] in finding and maintaining employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">James does not repudiate the position he advanced below, <em>ie., </em>that the Department failed to make reasonable efforts in support of reunification. Nevertheless, he contends that the court\u2019s Order effectively addressed the Department\u2019s previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>lapses, and thus the court acted within its \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in altering his permanency plan. James explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">This case underscores how resolving CINA cases in the best interest of the child involved may require courts to craft practical solutions to familial problems. It also reflects how the passage of time or circumstances may cause a child to change his views about the plan that most suits his current needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">The court\u2019s order reflects, at the very least, a concern that the Department needed (and continues to need) to provide employment assistance, and is an effort to ensure that the father gets that important assistance. If the Department fails to take those steps, James or the father can seek to enforce the court\u2019s order through contempt proceedings. If those services succeed and the father can stabilize his situation, the court will be able to reassess its permanency plan order and reconsider the appropriateness of reunification. If the father is unable to achieve sufficient stability to warrant reunification even after receipt of those services, James will continue to live with his relatives to whom the Department will have provided additional services to attain permanence for James.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">By ordering the Department to \u201cmake more aggressive efforts to help Mr. G. obtain employment,\u201d the court has actually provided James with more possibilities for permanency. Under the court\u2019s order, the Department must now seek a relative placement while continuing to assist the father to overcome the barrier that has prevented reunification. The court\u2019s decision is clearly in James\u2019 best interest as it requires the Department to help the father overcome barriers to reunification, while at the same time ensuring that James has stable placement with a relative if reunification is unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In Maryland, when a child is removed from the home for health or safety reasons and put in an out-of-home placement, the court must establish a permanency plan for the child.

It said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-17\">The permanency plan is an integral part of the statutory scheme designed to expedite the movement of Maryland\u2019s children from foster care to a permanent living, and hopefully, family arrangement. It provides the goal to which the parties and the court are committed to work. It sets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tone for the parties and the court and, indeed, may be outcome determinative. Services to be provided by the local service department and commitments that must be made by the parents and children are determined by the permanency plan. And, because it may not be changed without the court first determining that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so, the permanency plan must be in the child\u2019s best interest. These are the reasons, no doubt, that the court is charged with determining the plan and with periodically reviewing it, evaluating all the while the extent to which it is being complied with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">What the Court said in <em>In Re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003), also provides guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">As <em>In re: Damon M. </em>observes, the purpose of a permanency plan is to set the direction in which the parent, agencies, and the court will work in terms of reaching a satisfactory conclusion- to the situation. Once set initially, <em>the goal of the permanency plan is re-visited periodically at hearings to determine progress and whether, due to historical and contemporary circumstances, that goal should be changed. </em>It is not the purpose of the initial permanency plan hearing, however, to resolve all issues involved in that final resolution. If that were the case, there would be no need for review of how, on a regular basis, the plan is progressing or not. Also as <em>In re: Damon M. </em>indicates, the initial permanency plan hearing is to be held and conducted expeditiously. Protracted proceedings in establishing the initial plan defeat the purpose of the statute. The statute presumes that, unless there are compelling circumstances to the contrary, the plan should be to work toward reunification, as it is presumed that it is in the best interest of a child to be returned to his or her natural parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 582, 819 A.2d 1030 (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement set forth in F.L. \u00a7 5-525(d) has its genesis in federal law, with the enactment of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (\u201cAACWA\u201d), Pub.L.

Thus, on the surface, <em>reasonable efforts quite simply had to do with the quality of preservation services given before foster care placement and the quality of reunification services provided during foster care placement. </em>Both services promoted [AACWA\u2019s] goal of reducing the number of children in foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 642 A.2d 201 (1994) <em>(\u201cIvan M.\u201d), </em>the Court discussed the development of AACWA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">During the 1970\u2019s, nationwide concern grew regarding the large number of children who remained out of the homes of their biological parents throughout their childhood, frequently moved from one foster care situation to another, thereby reaching majority without belonging to a permanent family.

One of the important purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Under the federal act, a state is required, among other things, to provide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payment. <em>The case plan must include ... a description of the services provided to the parents, child and foster parents to facilitate return of the child to his or her own home </em>or to establish another permanent placement for the child. The state must also implement a case review system that provides for ... judicial review.... The purpose of the judicial review is to \u201cdetermine the future status of the child\u201d including whether the child should be returned to its biological parents, continued in foster care for a specified period, placed for adoption, or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in foster care on a long term basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 104-105, 642 A.2d 201 (internal citations omitted; emphasis added). <em>See also In Re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 574-76, 819 A.2d 1030 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In 1997, Congress revised AACWA through the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (\u201cASFA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-89, 111 Stat. 2115 (codified in 42 U.S.C. Chapter 7, subchapters IV-B and IV-E). As Bean explains, the revisions were enacted largely in response to growing criticisms directed at the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement, which included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">charges that children were still in foster homes too long. The charge was that they lingered now, not because of agency inaction, but because agencies were engaged in excessive efforts to \u201crepair hopelessly dysfunctional families. Instead of the permanency intended by the federal reasonable efforts clause, impermanency resulted].\u201d Perhaps of even greater concern, however, was the perception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>that children were being reunited with parents when it was not safe to do so in the name of reasonable efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Bean, 36 U. Tol. L.Rev. at 326 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Despite congressional concern about children enduring prolonged foster care, Congress did not entirely eliminate the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement. Rather, it revised the obligation, so that children \u201cwere no longer doomed to spend their years waiting for reunification efforts....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bean explains, <em>id. </em>(footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">In 1997, after again looking at the child protection system, Congress sought to clarify \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and respond to concerns that AACWA had encouraged states to go too far in preserving parent-child relationships that were more harmful than beneficial. It did so in ASFA, primarily by making the child\u2019s health and safety \u201cparamount.\u201d In line with this change, permanency for children moved to the forefront. Under ASFA, children were no longer doomed to spend their years waiting for reunification efforts to make their homes safe. Some situations were exempted from the reasonable efforts requirement, the time period for making reunification efforts was shortened, and adoption was encouraged. If efforts to reunite parent and child were not effective within a limited time, parental rights were to be terminated and adoption sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Under Title IV-B and IV-E, as amended by ASFA, in order to receive federal funding, a state is required to implement a federally-approved state plan for the delivery of child welfare services, which, in relevant part, must provide that \u201creasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify families ... to make it possible for a child to safely return to the child\u2019s home,\u201d if such efforts are consistent with the permanency plan for the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(B). However, ASFA also mandates that, \u201cin determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a child ... and in making such reasonable efforts, the child\u2019s health and safety shall be the paramount concern.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(A). Therefore, when continuation of reunification efforts is incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>sistent with the permanency plan, the state plan must provide for completion of \u201cwhatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.... \u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 671(a)(15)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">As indicated, a state, such as Maryland, that implements a federally approved plan may receive reimbursement for a percentage of the maintenance payments expended by the state for foster care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 674(a)(1). For an involuntary out-of-home placement to qualify for federal reimbursement funding, however, there must be \u201ca judicial determination to the effect that ... reasonable efforts\u201d to reunify the family or finalize the permanency plan \u201chave been made,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 672(a)(2)(A)(ii) (as amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-171, 120 Stat. 4, \u00a7 7404), or that reasonable efforts need not be made, under exceptions not relevant here. <em>Id. See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D) and note 17, <em>supra </em>(describing exceptions to reasonable efforts requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Federal regulations concerning the Title IV-B and IV-E programs articulate specific instructions to the states concerning the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement. Federal regulations require, for example, that \u201cjudicial determinations regarding ... reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan in effect, including judicial determinations that reasonable efforts are not required, must be explicitly documented and must be made on a case-by-case basis and so stated in the court order.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21(d) (2007). Further, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21(b) (2007) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(b) <em>Reasonable efforts. </em>The State must make reasonable efforts to maintain the family unit and prevent the unnecessary removal of a child from his/her home, as long as the child\u2019s safety is assured; to effect the safe reunification of the child and family (if temporary out-of-home placement is necessary to ensure the immediate safety of the child); and to make and finalize alternate permanency plans in a timely manner when reunification is not appropriate or possible.... In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a child and in making such reasonable efforts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>child\u2019s health and safety must be the State\u2019s paramount concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">(2) <em>Judicial determination of reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan, </em>(i) The State agency must obtain a judicial determination that it has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan that is in effect (whether the plan is reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, placement with a fit and willing relative, or placement in another planned permanent living arrangement) within twelve months of the date the child is considered to have entered foster care ... and at least once every twelve months thereafter while the child is in foster care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">(ii) If such a judicial determination regarding reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan is not made ... the child becomes ineligible under title IV-E at the end of the month in which the judicial determination was required to have been made, and remains ineligible until such a determination is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Notably, despite the federal requirement for \u201creasonable efforts,\u201d it is not a defined term under federal law, either by statute or by regulation. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in regard to the implementation of ASFA, HHS rejected calls for a definition of \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d It explained, 63 F.R. 50057, 50073 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">During our consultation with the field, some recommended that we define reasonable efforts in implementing the ASFA. We do not intend to define \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d To do so would be a direct contradiction of the intent of the law. The statute requires that reasonable efforts determinations be made on a case-by-case basis. We think any regulatory definition would either limit the courts\u2019 ability to make determinations on a case-by-case basis or be so broad as to be ineffective. In the absence of a definition, courts may entertain actions such as the following in determining whether reasonable efforts were made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u2022 Was the service plan customized to the individual needs of the family or was it a standard package of services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u2022 Did the agency provide services to ameliorate factors present in the child or parent, i.e., physical, emotional, or psychological, that would inhibit a parent\u2019s ability to maintain the child safely at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u2022 Do limitations exist with respect to service availability, including transportation issues? If so, what efforts did the agency undertake to overcome these obstacles?[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">Typically, State child welfare agencies and the courts encounter cases in which it is appropriate to make reasonable efforts to prevent a child\u2019s removal from home or to reunify the family. Quite frequently, though, States are faced with circumstances in which it is unclear how much effort is reasonable. At the initial stage of and throughout its involvement with a family, the child welfare agency assesses the family\u2019s needs and circumstances. The State agency should make reasonable efforts to prevent the child\u2019s removal from home or to reunify the family commensurate with the assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In 1998, the General Assembly adopted ASFA to comply with the federal law. <em>See </em>1998 Md. Laws, ch. 539 (\u201c[T]o provide certain reunification services and concurrently develop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>and implement a certain permanency plan[.]\u201d). In <em>In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. 402, 906 A.2d 898 (2006), the Court explained: \u201cThe purpose of [ASFA] was to streamline the foster care placement process and provide permanent homes for children in foster care, by expediting permanency planning hearings and TPR proceedings. Further, the presumption of [ASFA] is that if reunification efforts fail the preferred result is adoption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 906 A.2d 898 (internal citations omitted). In a footnote, the Court added, <em>id. </em>at 420 n. 15, 906 A.2d 898: \u201cGenerally, [ASFA] is designed to promote the adoption of children in foster care. To that end, [ASFA] provides that a child\u2019s health and safety are paramount in determining whether reasonable efforts to preserve the family had been undertaken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The <em>Karl H. </em>Court also said, 394 Md. at 420 n. 15, 906 A.2d 898:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">The Legislature was aware that enactment of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[t]he bill could result in more court decisions to terminate parental rights and a more expedient TPR process, thereby allowing children to spend less time in foster care and be adopted more rapidly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">In addition, the bill\u2019s provision for time-limited reunification efforts would limit provision[s] of reunification services to 15 months under specified circumstances, resulting in an indeterminate but significant amount of savings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">[Department of Legislative Services, Fiscal Note, H.B. 1093 at 5, 6 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">The Legislative Floor Report indicates that, \u201c[t]he bill also establishes that reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or with a legal guardian may be made concurrently with the reasonable efforts to reunify the family.\u201d Department of Legislative Services, Floor Report, H.B. 1093 at 1 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>As we have seen, the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement embodied in F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525(d) (requiring that \u201creasonable efforts shall be made\u201d to reunify families) derives from federal law, but \u201creasonable efforts\u201d is an undefined term in the statutory scheme. Instead, the meaning and implementation of the reasonable efforts requirement is the province of the states. In <em>Suter v. Artist M., </em>503 U.S. 347, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), the Supreme Court ruled that private parties cannot sue under Titles IV-B and IV-E to enforce the federal reasonable efforts requirement, in part because of the statute\u2019s silence as to the meaning of \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 112 S.Ct. 1360. The Supreme Court observed: \u201cNo further statutory guidance is found as to how \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 are to be measured....

C.J. \u00a7 3-801 (v) defines \u201creasonable efforts\u201d as \u201cefforts that are reasonably likely to achieve the objectives set forth in [C.J.] \u00a7 3-816.1(b)(l) and (2),\u201d which consist of \u201cpreventing] placement of the child into the local department\u2019s custody,\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-816.1(b)(l) and, for children who are placed in State custody, \u201c[f]inaliz[ing] the permanency plan in effect for the child,\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-816.1(b)(2)(i), and \u201c[m]eet[ing] the needs of the child, including the child\u2019s health, education, safety, and preparation for independence.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-816.1(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Maryland regulations for out-of-home placements provide some insight into the contemplated range of reunification services.

The court is required to consider the timeliness, nature, and extent of the services offered by DSS or other support agencies, the social service agreements between DSS and the parents, the extent to which both parties have fulfilled their obligations under those agreements, and whether additional services would be likely to bring about a sufficient and lasting parental adjustment that would allow the child to be returned to the parent. </em>Implicit in that requirement is that a reasonable level of those services, designed to address both the root causes and the effect of the problem, must be offered\u2014 educational services, vocational training, assistance in finding suitable housing and employment, teaching basic parental and daily living skills, therapy to deal with illnesses, disorders, addictions, and other disabilities suffered by the parent or the child, counseling designed to restore or strengthen bonding between parent and child, as relevant. Indeed, the requirement is more than implicit. FL \u00a7 5-525(d), dealing with foster care and out-of-home placement, explicitly requires DSS to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to \u201cpreserve and reunify families\u201d and \u201cto make it possible for a child to safely return to the child\u2019s home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">There are some limits, however, to what the State is required to do. <em>The State is not obliged to find employment for the parent, to find and pay for permanent and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>suitable housing </em>for the family, to bring the parent out of poverty, or to cure or ameliorate any disability that prevents the parent from being able to care for the child. <em>It must provide reasonable assistance in helping the parent to achieve those goals, </em>but its duty to protect the health and safety of the children is not lessened and cannot be cast aside if the parent, despite that assistance, remains unable or unwilling to provide appropriate care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">The State is not required to allow children to live permanently on the streets or in temporary shelters, to fend for themselves, to go regularly without proper nourishment, or to grow up in permanent chaos and instability, bouncing from one foster home to another until they reach eighteen and are pushed onto the streets as adults, because their parents, even with reasonable assistance from DSS, continue to exhibit an inability or unwillingness to provide minimally acceptable shelter, sustenance, and support for them. Based upon evidence of the effect that such circumstances have on the child, a court could reasonably find that the child\u2019s safety and health ... is jeopardized. Recognizing that children have a right to reasonable stability in their lives and that permanent foster care is generally not a preferred option, the law requires, with exceptions not applicable here, that DSS file a TPR petition if \u201cthe child has been in an out-of-home placement for 15 of the most recent 22 months.\u201d <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-525.1(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 499-501, 937 A.2d 177 (italics and boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5), the federal progenitor of F.L. \u00a7 5-525.1(b), the provision cited in <em>Rashawn H. </em>The court below said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">Certainly, more could have been done to help Respondent\u2019s father get a job, which would in turn have helped with getting housing.

Respondent has been out of the home for 22 months, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. 675(5)(F).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>As the text above indicates, while the circuit court acknowledged that \u201cmore could have been done to help\u201d appellant find a job, it was concerned, understandably, by the length of time that James had been out of the home; it found reasonable efforts largely because of that concern.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But, the length of James\u2019s out-of-home placement did not automatically compel a finding of reasonable efforts. We agree with appellant that the court was clearly erroneous in finding that DSS made reasonable efforts toward reunification. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The court cited 42 U.S.C. 675(5)(F) after noting that James had been out of the home for more than 22 months. Section 675(5)(F), a provision of ASFA, establishes a method to calculate the date on which a child is considered to have \u201centered foster care\u201d for purposes of the federal Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments grant program. It does not refer to \u201c22 months.\u201d We assume that, in commenting on the length of James\u2019s out-of-home placement, the court meant to refer to a related provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(E). That provision imposes the following requirement on state child welfare agencies as a condition of federal funding through the Title IV-E program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">[I]n the case of a child who has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months ... the State shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child\u2019s parents ... and, concurrently, to identify, recruit, process, and approve a qualified family for an adoption, unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">(i) <em>at the option of the State, the child is being cared for by a relative;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(ii) a State agency has documented in the case plan (which shall be available for court review) a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(iii) <em>the State has not provided to the family of the child, consistent with the time period in the State case plan, such services as the State deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the child\u2019s home, if reasonable efforts [to reunify the family] are required to be made with respect to the child </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The federal scheme governing permanency plan review makes clear that relevant judicial determinations \u201cmust be made on a case-by-case basis....\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21(d); <em>see also </em>C.J. \u00a7 3-816.1(b). The passage of twenty-two months is not, standing alone, a sufficient justification for abridgment of parental rights if, in that period, the Department did not make reasonable efforts to effect reunification. Indeed, the portion of federal law to which the circuit court referred explicitly exempts from the twenty-two month provision in \u00a7 675(5)(E) those circumstances in which \u201cthe State has not provided to the family of the child ... such services as the State deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the child\u2019s home, if reasonable efforts [to reunify the family] are required to be made with respect to the child....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(E)(iii); <em>see also </em>F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525.1(b)(3)(iii) (even if child has been out-of-home for 15 of the most recent 22 months, local department is not required to file a TPR action if it did not provide services to the family consistent with the case plan). Moreover, the provision cited by the court below is inapposite for another reason: this case falls into an exemption because, \u201cat the option of the State, the child is being cared for by a relative....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(E)(i). <em>See also </em>F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525.1(b)(3)(i) (exempting local department from obligation to file TPR petition if the child is in the care of a relative).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">To be sure, both federal and state law make clear that a local department is not required to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d indefinitely. Indeed, urgency is a theme that runs throughout the applicable statutes. C.J. \u00a7 3-823(h)(3) exhorts: \u201cEvery reasonable effort shall be made to effectuate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>permanent placement for the child <em>within 24. months after the date of initial placement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 629a(a)(7) (establishing Title IV-B federal grant program for \u201ctime-limited family reunification services,\u201d which are services provided to a child and the parent of a child in foster care to facilitate reunification \u201csafely and appropriately within a timely fashion, but only during the 15-month period that begins on the date that the child ... entered foster care\u201d); F.L. \u00a7 5-525(b)(l) (in accordance with Title IV-B, the Department shall \u201cprovide <em>time-limited </em>family reunification services to a child placed in an out-of-home placement and to the parents or guardian of the child, in order to facilitate the child\u2019s safe and appropriate reunification <em>within a timely manner\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); COMAR 07.02.11.03(B)(48) (implementing federally-required \u201ctime-limited family reunification services\u201d program). But, these statutes and regulations do not provide that the passage of time is a <em>substitute </em>for reasonable efforts. To the contrary, while these federal and state provisions limit the time in which the agency is required to make reasonable efforts, they do not license the attenuation of a parent\u2019s rights when the agency fails to make reasonable efforts during the applicable time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The question remains whether the circuit court erred in finding that DSS made reasonable efforts with respect to reunification. Appellant points out that \u201cthe sole impediment to reunification was Appellant\u2019s lack of a stable job,\u201d which, in turn, affected his ability to secure suitable housing; DSS had no concern for James\u2019s safety with appellant. Mr. G. suggests that his poor education and his criminal record were \u201cclear obstacles\u201d to his ability to obtain employment. For that reason, argues appellant, he \u201crequired special training or knowledge\u201d from a social worker \u201cto overcome\u201d the challenges he faced. Noting that there was \u201c[ajbsolutely no evidence ... that Appellant made himself hard to find or was unavailable to the Department,\u201d he complains that his referral to People Encouraging People was \u201cthe only referral provided by the Department to assist Appellant in obtaining a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In its determination that the Department made reasonable efforts, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">Baltimore City Department of Social Services made the following reasonable efforts with the parent/guardian in support of this plan: entered into a service agreement, referred Respondent for therapeutic services and placement in the home of a relative thereby strengthening family ties, monitored Respondent\u2019s father\u2019s employment and monitored the respondent\u2019s education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Although the Department\u2019s effort regarding therapeutic and educational services for James was commendable, the Department has not suggested how such efforts were designed to assist Mr. G. with his needs. Notably, the only \u201creasonable effort\u201d in the list above that pertained to appellant is that the Department \u201cmonitored\u201d his employment and \u201centered into a service agreement.\u201d Yet, the service agreement was not included in the record. At the hearing before the master, both appellant and Ms. Ukadike testified as to the requirements that the service agreement placed on appellant, which included obtaining employment and housing, as well as maintaining contact with James and with the agency. No evidence was presented, however, as to the Department\u2019s obligations under the agreement. Thus, the court could not evaluate what services the Department had committed to provide Mr. G. And, whatever \u201creasonable efforts\u201d entail, under the circumstances attendant here it should have been more than mere \u201cmonitor[ing] [of the] Respondent\u2019s father\u2019s employment,\u201d or a single referral to one employment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">It is undisputed that appellant attempted on his own, without success, to secure employment. Given his lack of education, his lack of skills, and his prior criminal record, it is not surprising that his efforts to gain employment were not fruitful. Mr. G. clearly was in need of vigorous professional assistance. Although DSS seeks to place the blame on appellant, claiming he \u201cdeclin[ed] to inform the Department about his lack of employment success after it referred him to People Encouraging People,\u201d that assertion is belied by the Department\u2019s own witness, Ms. Ukadike, who testified that, following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>that lone referral, appellant \u201ccall[ed] back and said that he did go [and] that they say they couldn\u2019t help him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Department\u2019s assertion that appellant did not contact DSS to receive a referral until December 2006 is similarly without support in the testimonial record. Neither Ukadike nor appellant stated the date of the referral, other than that it took place sometime between July and December of 2006. Nor is it clear that the single referral was even suited to . appellant\u2019s circumstance; appellant\u2019s uncontradicted testimony was that People Encouraging People informed him that their services were geared to assist HIV-positive persons, and that they did not have a program for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">To be sure, appellant admitted that he did not ask for another referral, nor did he physically return to the Department\u2019s office. But, the record is devoid of any evidence that, after appellant reported that the initial referral was unsuccessful, DSS made any follow up, even to verify that the referral was appropriate, or took any other affirmative step to provide appellant with further assistance in obtaining employment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">No party has cited any Maryland cases that are analogous to the case <em>sub judice. </em>We have found few reported Maryland cases in which relatively meager efforts were sustained in the face of a parental challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In the TPR case of <em>Ivan M., supra, </em>335 Md. 99, 642 A.2d 201, the Court reversed a court\u2019s finding that a local department failed to make reasonable efforts at reunification. That case is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>however.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">There, the mother had \u201cchronic schizophrenic and autistic mental disorders ... which repeated attempts at psychiatric treatment ha[d] been unable to cure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 642 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>201. Her condition precluded her from ever holding employment. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 642 A.2d 201. The agency repeatedly offered services to the mother, but the mother consistently rejected the assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 108-110, 642 A.2d 201. Furthermore, the <em>Ivan M. </em>Court explained that, even if the department had failed to offer services, where \u201cattempts at reunification would obviously be futile, the Department need not go through the motions in offering services doomed to failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 642 A.2d 201. In its view, the evidence \u201coverwhelmingly demonstrate^] that [the mother] is unfit to care for Ivan and that she will remain unfit indefinitely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118, 642 A.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In this case, appellant does not suffer from a psychological or developmental disability that impairs his parenting ability. Indeed, there is no suggestion that appellant is an unfit parent. Moreover, in contrast to <em>Ivan M., </em>little was offered to appellant in the way of assistance, and he certainly never rejected any help.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\"><em>In re Ashley E., supra, </em>158 Md.App. 144, 854 A.2d 893, is also pertinent. That case involved a change in the permanency plan for four children, from reunification to termination of parental rights. On appeal, the mother complained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred in changing the permanency plan, because the evidence did not establish that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 854 A.2d 893. We upheld the court\u2019s determination that the local department had made reasonable efforts toward reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The four siblings in <em>Ashley E. </em>were placed in the care of the local department after one of the children revealed at school that she had been sexually abused at home. <em>Id. </em>at 146-50, 854 A.2d 893. In interviews with therapists, the children disclosed frequent instances of sexual abuse at the hands of their mother and her sexual partners. <em>Id. </em>All four children had emotional and mental problems that, in the view of a psychologist retained by the department, were \u201cthe result of long-term abuse, probably for their entire lives....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 854 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>893. Expert testimony established that the mother lacked the ability to keep the children safe. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 854 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Notably, during the sixteen months that the children had been in foster care, the mother \u201chad not complied with the service agreements (one of which she signed and two of which she did not).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 854 A.2d 893. The court recounted the mother\u2019s derelictions, <em>id. </em>at 155-56, 854 A.2d 893:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">[The mother] had not participated in parenting classes that had been offered. She had not consistently signed releases for medical treatment for the children. She had not consistently attended visitation with the children. Out of 68 weeks of visitation, she had seen Gregory 26 weeks, Matthew 14 weeks, Laione 21 weeks, and Ashley 18 weeks. She had not attended school meetings for the children. She had lost several jobs since September 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">[The social worker] further explained that the appellant refused to acknowledge the abuse the children had experienced in her household, and therefore refused to take responsibility for it. Her lack of honesty in acknowledging the circumstances in which the children were sexually abused and consequent lack of empathy for them made it difficult for the children to heal emotionally from their trauma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In the face of such derelictions, we upheld the change in the plan, citing the department\u2019s repeated attempts to maintain visitation by the mother and its provision of psychological evaluation and counseling services to the children and the mother, as well as referrals to other services, such as parenting classes, of which the mother did not avail herself. <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, 854 A.2d 893. We were satisfied that the psychological evaluations of the mother \u201cshowed that [she] does not have a mental or developmental disability that would make her not amenable to the general, ordinary type of reunification services that in fact were offered to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 854 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The tacts of <em>Ashley E. </em>are markedly different from those in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As appellant notes, \u201c[t]his is not a case of a parent who has abused his child or is drug addicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In a handful of other cases, Maryland appellate courts have held that a local department failed to make reasonable efforts toward reunification. The TPR case of <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 and J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 796 A.2d 778 (2002) <em>(\u201cTristynn D. and Edward F.\u201d), </em>is noteworthy, because the Court recognized the need for the agency to provide appropriate services, albeit in the context of a father who was cognitively impaired. There, the father was unable to read, and was alleged by the local department to be \u201cmentally disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699 n. 22, 796 A.2d 778. But, the Court observed that there was insufficient evidence, beyond \u201cconjecture and speculation,\u201d that he was \u201c \u2018mentally disabled\u2019 as that term is scientifically measured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the department provided various services, including parenting classes and referrals to a domestic violence program and a drug and alcohol evaluation, <em>id. </em>at 684, 796 A.2d 778, the Court noted that the services did not address the deficiencies that, in the department\u2019s view, precluded reunification. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 682-84, 796 A.2d 778:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">Insofar as we have been able to discern from the record, [the Department] never offered any specialized services designed to be particularly helpful to a parent with the intellectual and cognitive skill levels [the Department] alleges are possessed by petitioner.... [For example,] the record does not reflect that [the Department] sought to utilized the services that might be available through the Developmental Disabilities Administration, even though it was relying in its drive toward termination on the fact that in the opinion of its workers, petitioner was disabled by reason of mental impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">[The Department] apparently did not even offer petitioner services to assist him with literacy, even after petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>signed [a] Social Services Agreement and fulfilled the obligations it set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Accordingly, the Court reversed the termination of the father\u2019s parental rights as to his two sons. The Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 700-701, 796 A.2d 778:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Primarily, [the Department] failed petitioner, and did not adequately perform its statutorily mandated duties ... by failing to provide a timely and sufficiently extensive array of available programs for petitioner, who, while perhaps hampered by some cognitive limitations, is eager and may well be able, with properly tailored services, to care for his children. From the moment petitioner came to ask for help, [the Department,] as far as we can discern, provided only untailored reunification services. [The Department] should have, instead of providing services for which there was little or no need, provided more specific services for petitioner who consistently displayed a willingness and genuine desire to care for his children. [The Department] had at its disposition better suited services for petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. CAA92-10852 and CAA92-10853, </em>103 Md.App. 1, 651 A.2d 891 (1994) <em>(\u201cMichael and Melvin </em>/.\u201d), this Court reversed the termination of a father\u2019s parental rights as to his twin sons. There, the local department had provided a wide array of services to the children\u2019s mother, <em>id. </em>at 16, 651 A.2d 891, who was also a juvenile in the department\u2019s care, <em>id. </em>at 6-7, 651 A.2d 891, but it did not provide any services to the young father. Noting the array of services generally available, <em>id. </em>at 18-19, 651 A.2d 891, we stated, <em>id. </em>at 21, 651 A.2d 891:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">In the present case, [the Department\u2019s] efforts at reunification amounted to a single conversation with [the father] and the mailing of several form letters to him. While [the father] was undoubtedly delinquent in his parenting of the twins for the first two and one-half years of their lives, the evidence at trial did not establish that [the Department\u2019s] attempts at offering services would be futile, nor did the evidence demonstrate that no amount of reunification ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>vices would even accomplish reunification of [the father] with his children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>In re Tiffany B., </em>228 S.W.3d 148 (Tenn.Ct.App.2007), cited by appellant, also provides guidance. In that case, the appellate court interpreted Tennessee\u2019s enactment of the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement of ASFA. The court stated, 228 S.W.3d at 158 (internal citations and footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">While the Department\u2019s efforts to assist parents need not be \u201cherculean,\u201d the Department must do more than simply provide the parents with a list of service providers and then leave the parents to obtain services on their own. The Department\u2019s employees must bring their education and training to bear to assist the parents in a reasonable way to address the conditions that required removing their children from their custody and to complete the tasks imposed on them in the permanency plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The <em>Tiffany B. </em>court observed that the local department had made scant efforts to work with the parents. <em>See id. </em>at 159-60. It concluded: \u201cDespite its knowledge that the parents were addicted to crack cocaine, homeless, unemployed, and facing criminal charges, the Department apparently expected the parents to initiate the remedial efforts on their own and to ask their case manager for help. This expectation was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We have found several cases from courts of other states that have grappled with similar factual circumstances under their own state law implementations of the reasonable efforts requirement. These cases suggest that one referral by the department, without followup, such as happened here, does not constitute reasonable efforts. As the Minnesota Court of Appeals stated in <em>Matter of Welfare of J.A., </em>377 N.W.2d 69, 73 (Minn.Ct.App.1985): \u201cTo measure the adequacy of services, it is necessary to learn whether the services go beyond mere matters of form, such as the scheduling of appointments, so as to include real, genuine help____\u201d <em>See also State ex rel. A.T., </em>936 So.2d 79, 86 (La.2006) (reversing termination of parental rights, noting that the social services department \u201cadmits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>no rehabilitative services were offered to [the mother] to assist her in obtaining suitable housing after the children were taken into custody ... yet this was the main, if not sole, impediment to reunification cited continuously by [the department].\u201d); In <em>In re Manuel P., </em>889 A.2d 192, 196 (R.I.2006) (upholding a lower court\u2019s finding that the agency did not make reasonable efforts toward reunification; although the department had provided the mother with psychological evaluations and parent education classes, it failed to follow up in providing the services that were indicated by the evaluations.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>In re Alvin R., </em>108 Cal.App.4th 962, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 210 (2003), is particularly instructive. In that case, a child had been removed from his father\u2019s custody and placed in the care of his grandmother because of the father\u2019s excessive physical discipline of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 213-15. The agency was supposed to arrange therapeutic counseling for the child, as a predicate for visitation with the father with the goal of reunification. Instead, the agency made a single referral to a counselor who was not able to accept new patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The California appellate court reversed a finding that reasonable reunification efforts had been made, explaining, <em>id. </em>at 218 (emphasis in original; internal citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">Reunification services need not be perfect. But they should be tailored to the specific needs of the particular family. Services will be found reasonable if the Department \u201chas identified the problems leading to the loss of custody, offered services designed to remedy those problems, maintained reasonable contact with the parents during the course of the service plan, and made reasonable efforts to assist the parents in areas where compliance proved difficult. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">The maternal grandmother\u2019s schedule and her insistence upon a therapist near her home was a major obstacle to any reunification efforts. Nevertheless, the Department\u2019s only effort to overcome this obstacle was apparently to make a referral to a therapist who had no time available to see [the child]. There was no effort to find other therapists in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>area, or that the Department attempted to find transportation for [the child] to see an available therapist further away. <em>Some </em>effort must be made to overcome obstacles to the provision of reunification services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">We recognize that the mere fact that more services could have been provided does not render the Department\u2019s efforts unreasonable. Here, however, reunification was not going to be accomplished without visitation, and the social worker knew that [the child] would be unlikely ever to consent to visitation without conjoint therapy. And conjoint therapy was not going to be accomplished unless some effort were made to get [the child] into individual therapy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">[T]hus, <em>one </em>service, getting [the child] into eight sessions of individual therapy, stood in the way of all measures remaining under the reunification plan, and the Department submitted no evidence of having made a good faith effort to bring those sessions about.... And there was no evidence with regard to any follow-up by the Department to move things along or to assist the overwhelmed maternal grandmother in any respect other than a referral to a therapist with a waiting list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">And yet, time was <em>critical </em>.... Under such circumstances, we cannot find that substantial evidence supports the finding that reunification services were reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In this case, Ms. Ukadike testified that the only impediments to appellant regaining custody of James were appellant\u2019s lack of stable employment and lack of housing, but the Department claimed it could not provide housing assistance until appellant was employed. And yet, the only effort the Department made to address appellant\u2019s unemployment was a single referral to an organization that could not address appellant\u2019s employment needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The case of <em>In re Ebony H., </em>68 Conn.App. 342, 789 A.2d 1158 (2002), stands in contrast to the instant case. There, the mother, an abuser of cocaine, was referred to several substance abuse programs, as well as counseling sessions, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>which she failed to keep appointments. <em>Id. </em>at 1161. Eventually, the mother completed a forty-five day inpatient substance abuse program, and then asked the department to assist her in obtaining housing. \u201cIn response, the department \u2018did nothing more than make one telephone call to Community Action with no follow up.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Nine days later, the mother again tested positive for cocaine, and missed several subsequent appointments for enrollment into other substance abuse programs. <em>Id. </em>at 1161-62. Although the trial court castigated the department for its response to the mother\u2019s request for housing assistance, calling it \u201c \u2018shameful and far beneath any acceptable level of professional conduct,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1162 (quoting trial court), the trial court ultimately concluded that the department had made reasonable efforts toward reunification, given the multiple referrals for substance abuse treatment, and that \u201c \u2018[c]ocaine addiction and a failure to follow through on counseling are the factors that prohibit reunification.....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting trial court). The appellate court affirmed, stating, <em>id. </em>at 1163:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s finding that the department\u2019s response to the [mother\u2019s] request for assistance in obtaining housing was shameful and unacceptable, our review of the evidence ... does not leave us with a definite and firm conviction that the court mistakenly found that the department had made reasonable efforts____The evidence overwhelmingly supports the court\u2019s findings that the department, on numerous occasions, had enrolled the [mother] in treatment programs ... and that [her] addiction ... thwarted the department\u2019s efforts to reunify her and the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Reasonable efforts were found in <em>Ebony H., </em>despite the department\u2019s \u201cshameful and unacceptable\u201d single referral for housing, because the impediment to reunification was not the parent\u2019s lack of housing. Rather, it was her substance abuse, which the department had made copious efforts to address. In this case, the Department responded to the major impediment to reunification, appellant\u2019s lack of employment, in pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cisely the way that the <em>Ebony H. </em>court characterized as \u201cshameful and unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We conclude that the juvenile court erred in finding that the Department made reasonable efforts toward reunification. Although the Department\u2019s efforts need not be perfect to be reasonable, and it certainly need not expend futile efforts on plainly recalcitrant parents, its services must adequately pertain to the impediments to reunification. Moreover, the obligation to render \u201creasonable efforts\u201d rests on the Department, not the parent, and, in the context of this case, it required more than a single referral to a vocational resource. Appellant\u2019s lack of a job, which, in turn, adversely affected his ability to obtain suitable housing, prevented his reunification with James. In effect, \u201cfor want of a nail ... the battle was lost.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In light of our conclusion that the court erred in finding that the Department made reasonable efforts, we turn to the ultimate determination of whether the court abused its discretion in changing James\u2019s permanency plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\"><em>In re Yve S., supra, </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030, is relevant to our analysis. There, the juvenile court changed the permanency plan for a twelve-year-old from the goal of reunification to long-term foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 819 A.2d 1030. The plan was later changed to termination of parental rights and adoption. Thereafter, it was again changed to long-term foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 819 A.2d 1030. The mother noted appeals as to the various rulings, which were consolidated. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 819 A.2d 1030. The Court observed, <em>id. </em>at 565, 819 A.2d 1030:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The proper starting point for legal analysis when the State involves itself in family relations is the fundamental constitutional rights of a parent. Certain fundamental rights are protected under the U.S. Constitution, and among those rights are a parent\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment[] liberty interest in raising his or her children as he or she sees fit, without undue interference by the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Nevertheless, the Court acknowledged, <em>id. </em>at 568, 819 A.2d 1030: \u201cThe rights of a parent in the raising of his or her children ... are not absolute. One need not wander far into the thickets of family law before running into situations and circumstances where application of an absolute right of the parent would fail to produce a just result.\u201d <em>See also In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705-06, 782 A.2d 332 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Court discussed the manner in which the best interest of the child standard is to be applied when considering a change in permanency plan, 373 Md. at 618, 819 A.2d 1030:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APZ\">[T]he standard does not mean that the child should be placed in the best possible environment. The statutory mandate requires that reunification of the child with the parent be the goal of the permanency plan if there is competent and credible evidence that future abuse or neglect is not likely. \u201cThe fear of harm to the child or to \u2022society must be a real one predicated upon hard evidence; it may not be simply a gut reaction or even a decision to err-if-at-all on the side of caution.\u201d <em>In re Jertrude O., </em>56 Md.App. 83, 100 [466 A.2d 885] (2003[1983]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Turning to the lower court\u2019s decision, the <em>Yve S. </em>Court concluded that it had abused its discretion in applying the standard. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 618-19, 819 A.2d 1030:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArF\">A fair reading of the findings and ruling of the hearing court indicate that the focus of the court was on what would be the best environment for Yve S., not whether future neglect or abuse was not likely if returned to her mother\u2019s custody. The trial judge commented on the allegedly superior stability and structure of the foster home, and whether Yvonne S. would be able to provide the level of structure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>court felt Yve S. needed. Reinforcing this notion, the court ruled that Yve S. should remain in long-term foster care, stating \u201cI feel that it\u2019s appropriate that she remain, where she has been, for over thirty-some months, where she has done very well. She\u2019s blossomed there.\u201d Because the hearing judge focused on where Yve S. would be better off, as opposed to the competent evidence of future abuse or neglect, insufficient consideration was given to whether the goal of the permanency plan should be reunification rather than long-term or permanent foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In this case, as we have seen, in changing James\u2019s permanency plan from parental reunification to placement with a relative, the court wrote: \u201c[Gjiven the length of time Respondent has been removed from the home, [the master\u2019s] statement that the changing of the plan is \u2018both practicable and realistic\u2019 is a sound conclusion. Respondent has been out of the home for 22 months, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. 675(5)(F).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In our view, the juvenile court\u2019s decision partakes of a similar error to that identified by the <em>Yve S. </em>Court. In focusing on what was \u201cpracticable and realistic,\u201d the court never addressed James\u2019s best interest, as required by statute and case law. <em>See </em>C.J. \u00a7 3\u2014823(h)(2)(vi) (court shall change permanency plan \u201cif a change in the permanency plan would be in the child\u2019s best interest\u201d); <em>In re Damon M., supra, </em>362 Md. at 436, 765 A.2d 624 (permanency plan, once established, may not be changed unless the court determines \u201cit is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so\u201d). Moreover, it seems to have overlooked the statutory factors in F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014525(e)(1), discussed earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">To be sure, both F.L. \u00a7 5-525(e)(l)(iv) and (e)(l)(vi) speak to the amount of time that the child has been in the custody of the State. It is also clear that ASF A, and by extension the conforming provisions of Maryland\u2019s statutes, recognize that, in the words of the <em>Rashawn H. </em>Court, it is detrimental for children to remain in foster care when, \u201ceven with reasonable assistance from DSS,\u201d the parents are unable or unwilling \u201cto provide minimally acceptable shelter, sustenance, and support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>for them.\u201d <em>Rashawn H., supra, </em>402 Md. at 501, 937 A.2d 177. But, the duration of James\u2019s stay in the care of his cousin seemed to be the circuit court\u2019s paramount consideration.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Notably, DSS was not seriously concerned that appellant posed any danger to James of abuse or chronic neglect. Upon the record before us, James was taken into the Department\u2019s care because of Mr. G.\u2019s temporary inability to care for him due to his brief incarceration. Moreover, there was no evidence that James would be harmed if he were returned to his father. To the contrary, Ms. Ukadike, the State\u2019s only witness, stated: \u201cI do know that the child is attached to his parents especially his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">James contends that, even if the Department did not make reasonable efforts, we should not disturb the court\u2019s change in the permanency plan. In his view, the court\u2019s Order that the Department \u201cmust make more aggressive efforts to help [appellant] obtain employment,\u201d coupled with its contempt power to enforce that order, is a sufficient assurance that the Department will provide appellant with adequate services going forward. He suggests that the court\u2019s Order \u201chas actually provided James with more possibilities for permanency,\u201d because \u201cthe Department must now seek a relative placement while continuing to assist the father to overcome the barrier that has prevented reunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">According to James, either he or appellant may enforce the court\u2019s Order via contempt proceedings against the Department. But, James has not considered that appellant would be unable to challenge a ruling that does not find the Department in contempt. <em>See Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>371 Md. 243, 246, 808 A.2d 795 (2002) (holding that \u201ca party that files a petition for constructive civil contempt does not have a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At oral argument, appellant noted that this Court\u2019s affirmance of the lower court\u2019s Order would arguably foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>appellant\u2019s ability to appeal a later order of the court maintaining a permanency plan of guardianship with a relative. Therefore, appellant urged that he cannot wait to see if the Department\u2019s efforts improve; if those efforts are not satisfactory to Mr. G., he likely would be unable to appeal another adverse decision that has the effect of maintaining what would by then have become the status quo. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Under the Court of Appeals\u2019s recent jurisprudence on the reviewability of permanency plan orders, a subsequent ruling that maintains the revised permanency plan is not necessarily appealable. A party may only appeal a non-final order arising from the permanency plan review process if it \u201coperates to either deprive [the parent] of the care and custody of her children or change the terms of her care and custody of the children to her detriment.\u201d <em>In re Billy W., supra, </em>386 Md. at 691-92, 874 A.2d 423. The <em>Billy W. </em>Court ruled that an order that merely \u201cmaintained the permanency plans for the children\u201d was not appealable, because the parent\u2019s \u201ccustodial rights had been abrogated when the children were declared in need of assistance and committed to DSS\u2019s custody, but not when the trial court maintained the permanency plans for the children, which did not adversely affect [the parent\u2019s] parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 874 A.2d 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In <em>In re Alvin R., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th 962, 134 Cal. Rptr.2d 210, the court noted: \u201cWhen it appears at the six-month review hearing that a parent has not been afforded reasonable reunification services, the remedy is to extend the reunification period, and order continued services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-19. We agree with the <em>Alvin R. </em>court. On this record, given DSS\u2019s failure to provide reasonable efforts, the court erred or abused its discretion in changing the permanency plan from reunification to relative placement.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>For these reasons, we shall reverse the Order of the circuit court changing the permanency plan and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">ORDER CHANGING PERMANENCY PLAN REVERSED.

In many cases, including <em>In re Samone H., supra, </em>385 Md. at 299-301, 869 A.2d 370, and <em>In re Yve S., supra, </em>373 Md. at 565-68, 819 A.2d 1030, the Court has discussed the fundamental rights of parents. In <em>Samone H., </em>for example, the Court said: \"[A] parent\u2019s interest 'occupies a unique place in our legal culture, given the centrality of family life as the focus for personal meaning and responsibility. [Far] more precious than property rights, parental rights have been deemed to be among those essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. 385 Md. at 299, 869 A.2d 370 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\">. As Bean observes, 36 Tol. L.Rev. at 332, ASFA's \"focus on \u2018time-limited\u2019 efforts for reunifying families [ ] and its emphasis on permanency may predispose a judge to find reasonable efforts when failing to do so will delay a permanent ... placement for the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b614-10\">. Although DSS faults appellant for failing to ask for more help, we observe that many of the clients who require help do not recognize that they need assistance; they are not proactive.

We note that maintenance of a permanency pl\u00e1n of parental reunification may be combined with court-ordered contingency planning for placement with a relative. In <em>In re Karl H., supra, </em>394 Md. at 422, 906 A.2d 898, the Court observed that the statutory scheme \"clearly allows for such contingency planning.\u201d <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(F) (\"[R]easonable efforts to place a child ... with a legal guardian ... may be made concurrently\u201d with reasonable efforts to reunify the family.); F.L. \u00a7 5-525(d)(3) (same); 45 C.F.R \u00a7 1356.21(b)(4) (\"Reasonable efforts to finalize an alternate permanency plan may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family.\u201d). A contingency-planning approach would enable the Department to direct resources toward preparing James\u2019s cousin to become his legal guardian in the event that appellant is ultimately unable to regain custody, while preserving appellant\u2019s ability to enforce DSS\u2019s compliance with the \"reasonable efforts\u201d mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Nevertheless, we point out that the <em>Karl H. </em>Court disfavored so-called \"concurrent permanency plans\u201d of both reunification and adoption, 394 Md. at 422, 906 A.2d 898, \"especially when the inconsistent plan calls for a TPR petition to be filed before the next scheduled court review of the permanency plan,\u201d on the ground that such \"diametrically inconsistent\u201d plans \"give DSS (and the parents) no real guidance and can lead to arbitrary decision-making on the p art of DSS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court opined that \"[t]he objective of contingency planning can be achieved without a Janus-type order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>also Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 488 n. 5, 937 A.2d 177.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
