Airy in Carroll County (the \u201cProjects\u201d). Harrison Farm, LLC (\u201cHarrison\u201d) and Ridgewood, LLC (\u201cRidgewood\u201d), appellees, hold title to the real property upon which the Projects were to be built by the developer, Forty West Builders, Inc. (\u201cForty West\u201d), appellee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The County Commissioners for Carroll County, appellant (hereafter the \u201cCounty,\u201d the \u201cBoard,\u201d or the \u201cCommissioners\u201d), challenge an Order issued by the Circuit Court for Carroll County on October 17, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among other things, the Order enjoined the County from applying to the Projects an adequate public facilities ordinance enacted in 2004, because in December 2002 the County had granted a Concurrency Management Certif\u00edcate (\u201cCMC\u201d) for each project, pursuant to an earlier and less stringent adequate public facilities ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The court also found the County in constructive contempt of its November 2008 order, in which the court had granted Forty West preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Appellant presents three issues on appeal, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">1. Whether the trial court erred or abused its discretion when it found the County to be in constructive contempt of the November 13, 2003 Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">,2. Whether the trial court erred in granting injunctive relief to Forty West based on a finding contained in its grant of partial summary judgment that the CMC constitutes a contractual obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">3. Whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Forty West\u2019s claims based upon Forty West\u2019s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the finding of contempt and the court\u2019s order granting additional injunctive relief, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">I. THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEMES</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">We begin with an overview of the relevant provisions of the Maryland Code (\u201cCode\u201d) and the Carroll County Code (the \u201cCounty Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Boards of county commissioners constitute the governing bodies of the counties of the state, such as Carroll County, that have not adopted home rule under Article XI-A (the \u201cHome Rule Amendment\u201d) of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 2005 RepLVol.), Art. 25. A board of county commissioners functions as the county government and \u201cis the county body politic; in performing its various functions, it exercises legislative, quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial authority, sometimes in combination.\u201d <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs Of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>382 Md. 306, 323, 855 A.2d 325 (2004) (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>omitted). The county commissioners sometimes wear \u201cdifferent hats,\u201d by which they \u201cperform[ ] a legislative action followed by an administrative/executive action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 855 A.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Maryland Code, Article 25 sets forth the nature and powers of county commissioners and the manner of exercising their powers. <em>Casey v. Mayor and City Council of Rockville, </em>400 Md. 259, 280, 929 A.2d 74 (2007). These powers pertain to matters such as road and bridge construction, land drainage, and public watershed associations. They are supplemented elsewhere in the Code, notably here by Article 66B, pertaining to land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Maryland Code, Article 66B, commonly known as the \u201cenabling act,\u201d <em>Congressional School of Aeronautics, Inc. v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>218 Md. 236, 244, 146 A.2d 558 (1958); 58 Op. Att\u2019y Gen\u2019l 521, 522 (1973), \u201cgenerally regulates land use (planning and zoning) in Maryland\u2019s non-charter, Code home rule counties, Baltimore City, and municipalities possessing planning and zoning powers[.]\u201d <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, </em>382 Md. at 308-09 n. 1, 855 A.2d 325.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Article 66B, \u00a7 10.01(a)(1) permits any local jurisdiction to enact ordinances \u201cto facilitate orderly development and growth ...,\u201d and to enact \u201cordinances or laws providing for or requiring ... adequate public facilities.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Section 52 of the County Code provides for the creation, jurisdiction, powers and duties of the Planning and Zoning Commission of Carroll County (the \u201cPlanning Commission\u201d). Pursuant to \u00a7 52-5, the Planning Commission \u201cshall have all the powers, functions and duties as provided in Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>On March 5, 1998, the County adopted Ordinance No. 161, entitled \u201cPublic Facilities and Concurrency Management,\u201d codified as Chapter 167 of the County Code. The stated aim of Chapter 167 was to \u201cpermit[] planned residential growth to proceed at a rate that will not unduly strain public facilities, especially schools, roads, water, and sewer facilities, and police, fire and emergency medical services.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-l.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Chapter 167 required a developer to apply for a CMC at the outset of the development process. County Code, \u00a7 167-6.A, titled \u201cConcurrency Management approval,\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">No development project subject to this chapter may be approved by the Board of County Commissioners, the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals, or any other county official having the authority to grant approval, until the project has satisfied the requirements of this chapter and a concurrency management certificate has been issued by the Department of Planning.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">To obtain a CMC, the developer had to submit \u201ca concept plan ... and a concurrency data form containing sufficient information for the county to determine the impact of the proposed project on public facilities.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-6.G.(1). In particular, the developer had to show that the proposed project satisfied various \u201cthreshold\u201d requirements as to school capacity; road capacity; availability of fire, police, and emergency medical services; and water and sewer services. County Code, \u00a7 167-5.C. With regard to school capacity under Chapter 167, the developer had to demonstrate that \u201c[projected enrollment at schools servicing a proposed project was at 120% or less of the state-rated capacity.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-5.C.(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>A developer who received a CMC was permitted to \u201cproceed with recording and development, as long as the developer [met] specified milestones, dates by which certain stages must be completed.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-l.B. Put another way, \u201cmilestones\u201d are deadlines \u201cby which a developer must submit the next stage of a project to the Department of Planning for approval.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If \u201cavailable threshold capacity\u201d (\u201cATC\u201d) did not exist at the concept plan stage, the project was to be \u201cassigned a place in a queue.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 167-l.C. Of import here, \u00a7 167-6.E stated: \u201cOnce a project has received a concurrency management certificate, no further approval for adequate facilities and services will be required for the project if the project is completed in accordance with its milestones.\u201d County Code, at \u00a7 167-6.E. Moreover, \u00a7 167-6.G(7) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Any person aggrieved by a decision of the county denying a concurrency management certificate in whole or in part and alleging this chapter has been erroneously applied may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any further appeal shall be to the Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Effective June 10, 2003, the County enacted Ordinance No. 03-11 (the \u201cDeferral Ordinance\u201d). It mandated a twelvemonth deferral of the \u201csubmittal, acceptance, review, processing and approval of all ... residential subdivisions ... and site plans for residential development ... except for those plans approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the effective date [of June 10, 2003.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">On April 22, 2004, the County enacted Ordinance No. 04-13, which repealed Chapter 167 and replaced it with Chapter 71, titled \u201cAdequate Public Facilities and Concurrency Management.\u201d It states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00a7 71-5.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On or about October B, 2002, Forty West submitted concept plans and applications for CMCs to the County for two proposed subdivisions: a 70-lot project to be called Eagles Crest, and a 61-lot project to be called Ridgewood Estates. Forty West paid development review fees to the County for the Projects in the amounts of $8,869 and $8,122, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The County issued CMCs for the Projects, which bear the date of November 22, 2002. The CMCs were signed by Forty West as the developer on December 10, 2002, and by Jeanne S. Joiner, the Director of the County Department of Planning, on behalf of the Commissioners, on December 17, 2002. The word \u201c(SEAL)\u201d appears next to each signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At the relevant time, the CMC was a two-page form document. In general, it identified the name of the housing project; the total number of building lots; the years in which building lots were allocated; milestone dates; and the dates by which plats were to be recorded. The document also contained an acknowledgment that the requirements of the Concurrency Management Law (\u201cCML\u201d) were met for the particular project. Notably, it conditioned issuance of building permits on the developer/owner satisfying all requirements of the CML and all other applicable laws and agreements between the developer/owner and the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Both CMCs at issue here contain almost identical language. As to Eagles Crest, for example, it said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>I hereby certify that the requirements of the Carroll County Adequate Public Facilities and Concurrency Management Ordinance (Chapter 167 ...) have been met for the above project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">The County will issue building permits for the subdivision known as \u201cEagles Crest,\u201d according to the following schedule, provided that the Developer/Owner meets all requirements of Chapter 167, Code of Public Local Laws and Ordinances for Carroll County, all other applicable laws, and all agreements between the Developer/Owner and the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">By the terms of the CMCs at issue here, during fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007 Forty West was to satisfy certain \u201cmilestones\u201d before the County would issue building permits for the Projects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a prerequisite to the issuance of any building permits, Forty West was required to submit a \u201cPreliminary Plan Package Submittal Milestone\u201d by June 8, 2003. In addition, the County would issue the first fifty permits, for fiscal year 2005, only if Forty West submitted a \u201cFinal Plat Package Submittal Milestone\u201d by March 1, 2005, and a \u201cDate of Recordation of Milestone\u201d by May 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">By letters dated December 10, 2002 (for Ridgewood Estates) and December 18, 2002 (for Eagles Crest), Clayton Black, of the Bureau of Development Review (the \u201cBureau\u201d), wrote to Stephen Costello at Forty West, enclosing the completed CMC. Each letter warned: \u201cPlease note that a failure to meet these milestone dates will result in the cancellation of your certificate and a new application will need to be filed. Extensions of these dates can not be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On April 24, 2003, Steven C. Horn, the Director of the County Department of Planning, issued a \u201cSpecial Report to the Board of Carroll County Commissioners\u201d (the \u201cSpecial Report\u201d). It stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Concurrency Management</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">Aside from the fact that implementation of the Ordinance [Chapter 167] has proven to be complex, data intensive, and difficult to track, Concurrency Management is \u201cfixable\u201d. Inconsistent implementation, due to lack of staff comprehension and inadequate resources, has given credence to the notion that the best solution is to \u201cscrap\u201d Concurrency Management and proceed with the establishment of a new adequate facilities ordinance. Staff submits that addressing the following shortcomings in the Ordinance would result in a more effective growth management tool while sparing the County the time and expense of starting from scratch on the creation of a new adequate facilities ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">1. Make Concurrency responsive to countywide growth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Currently, the Ordinance does not apply in the municipalities, therefore, implementation of a countywide growth management tool is problematic....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">3.

The problem with the single test at concept plan stage is the County issues the Concurrency Certificate based on the concept plan. <em>The Certificate acts like a \u201ccontract\u201d with the developer, and by its issuance, the County agrees that the project can move forward to completion\u2014irrespective of the possibility that public facilities may become inadequate before the project is ready for recordation. </em>Additional adequacy testing must consider investments made by developers in preparing preliminary plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">According to the Special Report, the resolution of these problems was expected to \u201cbe complicated and time consuming,\u201d and those individuals studying the problem needed \u201cto complete the task without the added pressure of ongoing subdivision plan review.\u201d Therefore, it recommended \u201ca tern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>porary deferral on the processing of unapproved plans (plans not yet approved by PZQ\u201d i.e., the Planning and Zoning Commission, and \u201con the acceptance of new subdivision plans that are subject to the Concurrency Management Ordinance.\u201d The Special Report continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">The deferral is recommended to extend for up to 12 months, thereby allowing the referenced Committees and County staff ample time to undertake the analyses and corrective actions referenced herein. The 12 month deferral period is a temporary measure to prevent land development that may be inconsistent with proposed or pending changes. Without this deferral, we may artificially create a rush to submit and process subdivision plans (to develop and achieve vested rights) and encourage speculative land development in anticipation of contemplated changes to the referenced ordinances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Following issuance of the CMCs, Forty West began engineering work, percolation testing, and street traffic studies in order to meet the first milestone of June 8, 2003, for preliminary plan package submittal. In order to finance the purchase of the properties and to continue development efforts, Forty West borrowed $6,981,250 on May 2, 2003, secured by a Deed of Trust. Then, on May 9, 2003, Harrison Farm, LLC obtained ownership from Edward H. Harrison of the 91-acre parcel to be developed as the Eagles Crest subdivision, for the sum of $3,587,726.63. On the same date, for the sum of $4,444,212.36, Ridgewood LLC acquired the 153-acre parcel from Mt. Airy Farm LLP. It was to be developed as Ridge-wood Estates. Through August 20, 2003, appellants incurred development costs, excluding the cost of the land, but including site engineering, traffic studies, percolation testing, and governmental fees, of approximately $480,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On May 19, 2003 (i.e., prior to the June 8,2003 milestone set forth in the CMCs), Forty West submitted preliminary plans for the Projects to the Bureau, and paid review fees to the County of $9,650.20 for Eagles Crest and $9,527.84 for Ridge-wood Estates. In letters dated May 30, 2003, the Bureau acknowledged that the plans were \u201caccepted for distribution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the appropriate review agencies,\u201d and that comments would be presented at a Subdivision Advisory Committee (\u201cSAC\u201d) meeting, tentatively scheduled for June 27, 2003. Further, it advised that the developer and engineers \u201cshould be available at the meeting to discuss any issues relative to the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">However, on June 5, 2003, the County adopted the Deferral Ordinance, effective June 10, 2003; it mandated a twelvemonth deferral of all projects then under review. On June 12, 2003, Horn advised Forty West that the Deferral Ordinance applied to the Projects, stating that \u201call processing of the[ ] plans will cease as of June 10, 2003.\u201d Horn continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">The Bureau of Development Review will retain all plans and associated fees, unless the applicant requests the return of the fees and the plans. Fees will not be released until a request to withdraw your application from the process is received and a form is signed requesting such action. The County Attorney is currently drafting the required form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">The County recognizes that you may be unable to meet the milestones in the Concurrency Management Certificate due to an act or omission of the County in adopting Ordinance 03-11. You will not be required to meet any milestone during the deferral period and a determination of the process will be made in the later stages of this deferral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Harrison and Ridgewood asked the Board for exemptions from the Deferral Ordinance. In connection with both Ridge-wood Estates and Eagles Crest, the Board held hearings in August of 2003. The Commissioners denied each request in a \u201cDecision\u201d issued on September 25, 2003. The rulings are largely the same. As to Eagles Crest, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">On August 21, 2003, the County Commissioners of Carroll County, Maryland (\u201cthe Commissioners\u201d), held a public hearing on the request of Harrison Farm, LLC and Forty West Builders, Inc. for an exemption from the Residential Development Deferral pursuant to Article I(vi)(6)(b) of Ordinance No. 03-11 for its project known as \u201cEagles Crest.\u201d Article I(vi)(6)(b) allows residential projects to apply for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>exemption that have been or are presently the subject of a municipal annexation petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">In order to grant a request for an exemption from the deferral, the Board must consider evidence of at least the following three minimum factors: whether there is substantial hardship to the owner or developer if the project is not allowed to proceed during the deferral period; whether adequate public facilities exist in the area where the project is located; and in the case of an inadequate public facility or service, whether the developer proposes and agrees to provide relief facilities or services prior to the use and occupancy of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">With respect to the request at issue, based on the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearing, as well as the Special Report to the Board from the Department of Planning, we make the following findings and conclusions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">The proposed project (\u201cEagles Crest\u201d) is located on the northeast corner of the Maryland Route 27 and Watersville Road intersection and as proposed will consist of approximately 70 units. The project was the subject of a Town of Mount Airy municipal annexation petition, originally received by the Town in December of 2001. The annexation petition was scheduled for a public hearing before the Town Planning and Zoning Commission, but the petition was withdrawn on October 3, 2002 before the hearing. The developer voluntarily withdrew the project because of economic concerns related to the limited number of lots the Town would approve and the costs of required infrastructure. The property has not been the subject of an annexation petition since that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">As for water and sewer service, the project will be served by on-site private well and septic facilities. As to emergency services, the project will be served by the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. Deputy Chief Douglas C. Alexander reviewed the request and expressed concerns regarding the adequacy of emergency services for this proposed subdivision; although, he indicated the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ment was not against the request exemption. The Town of Mount Airy opposed the request for exemption because of ongoing concerns about adequate facilities within the Town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">As to adequacy of schools, Mr. David Reeve from the Board of Education (BOE) responded that the Mount Airy Middle School will exceed functional capacity before the anticipated opening of a relief facility in August of 2008. The units in the proposed subdivision will begin to be brought on-line in 2005 further straining the capacity at the Middle School. According to BOE criteria, a school becomes \u201cinadequate\u201d when pupil enrollment exceeds 110% of the functional capacity of the facility, and adequacy standards for schools are a key issue reviewed during the development deferral period. Enrollment projections for the Middle School are currently 122% of functional capacity and will rise to 134% in 2007-2008. The Middle School has also been used as a temporary relief facility at the elementary school, which currently exceeds capacity and will continue to do so until the new Parr\u2019s Ridge Elementary school is open and available in 2005. The applicant has offered no relief for inadequacy. Because of the \u201cinadequate\u201d findings by the BOE, we find no compelling reason to allow this project to proceed during the deferral period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">Although the applicant provided information regarding substantial hardship at the public hearing, we do not find the information compelling enough to grant the exemption especially in light of the Middle School inadequacy and the failure of the applicant to provide any relief for the inadequacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">NOW, THEREFORE, this 25th day of September, 2003, the request for exemption is hereby DENIED.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Forty West appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Carroll County Board of Zoning Appeals (the \u201cZoning Board\u201d) (Case Nos. 4821 and 4822). Following a public hearing on August 26, 2003, the Zoning Board issued its decisions on October 7, 2003. It declined to review the legality of the Deferral Ordinance, or to require the Planning Commission to continue processing the plans for Eagles Crest and Ridgewood Estates. Forty West then sought review in the Circuit Court for Carroll County on November 5, 2003, which affirmed. Thereafter, Forty West appealed to this Court. In a consolidated appeal involving 17 cases, including <em>Harrison Farm, LLC and Ridgewood, LLC. v. County Commissioners of Carroll County, </em>Nos. 1435 and 1432, September Term, 2004 <em>(\u201cForty West I </em>\u201d), this Court affirmed on April 20, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The Court reasoned that the \u201cBoard is empowered to review administrative decisions only, not legislative decisions.\u201d <em>Forty West I, </em>slip op. at 7. Further, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">[T]he Ordinance was a legislative act that applied to appellants\u2019 projects by its terms. The Department of Planning was not asked to make an administrative determination with respect to a particular property or properties. The Department of Planning simply acknowledged the scope and effect of the Ordinance as applicable to all properties subject to its terms. In other words, there was no administrative determination that could be appealed to the Board. The challenge by appellants was a direct challenge to the legislative act of enacting the Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Notably, the <em>Forty West I </em>Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">For the above reasons, the Board lacked jurisdiction. We expressly decide no other issue. In the event actions are now filed invoking the general jurisdiction of the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>court, the court, upon request, may, in its discretion, decide whether to stay such actions, and any presently pending actions, <em>until the ultimate resolution of the administrative process.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>Forty West I, </em>slip op. at 7-8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In the interim, on October 9, 2003, while appellants pursued their challenge to the Deferral Ordinance, Forty West filed in the circuit court a \u201cVerified Complaint\u201d against the County Commissioners, asserting claims for breach of contract, anticipatory breach of contract, and equitable estoppel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Forty West sought various forms of relief, including a writ of mandamus or an injunction requiring the County to \u201c[i]mmediately resume and continue its review and approval process pertaining to [the Projects\u2019] development plan packages in the ordinary course, without requiring any further approvals for adequate facilities and services, as long as the projects are completed in accordance with their milestones.\u201d Forty West also asked the Court to extend the milestones \u201cfor a period of time equal to the number of days between June 10, 2003 and the date on which review and processing resumes on [the Projects.]\u201d Moreover, it requested compensatory damages and a declaratory judgment adjudicating \u201cthe rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the Concurrency Management Certificates----\u201d On the same day, Forty West filed a \u201cMotion for Preliminary Injunction,\u201d requesting the court to issue a preliminary injunction requiring the County \u201cto resume the processing of development plans for the projects known as Eagles Crest and Ridgewood Estates without requiring further approvals for public facilities and services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The County filed an opposition, in which it asserted that the CMCs were not contracts and, even if they were, they had not been breached. Therefore, the County argued that it was \u201cnot estopped from executing its authority.\u201d It also filed a motion to dismiss the request for preliminary injunction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Forty West had no statutory right to an appeal from the denial of its exemption request, and because Forty West had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">At an evidentiary hearing on October 29, 2003, Steven Costello, Forty West\u2019s President and a member of Ridgeway and Harrison, testified that, in reliance on the County\u2019s issuance of the CMCs, Forty West incurred substantial expenses, as outlined above, in order to complete the preliminary plan submissions due on June 8, 2003. He added that, if the County had not issued the CMCs, Forty West would not have acquired the real property on which the subdivisions were to be built.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of the Deferral Ordinance, Costello expressed concern that the County would \u201cinitiate new and stringent guidelines and other checkpoints that [would] make it harder or impossible for [Forty West] to develop.\u201d His concern was based on \u201cstatements in the paper from Mr. Horn stating that new regulations would probably be enacted and they would be retroactive to plans that are already in the County now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Forty West also introduced a slide presentation that the County\u2019s Director of Planning showed to prospective home-builders regarding the Chapter 167 CMC process. A slide in that presentation, entitled \u201cHOUSING ALLOCATION,\u201d provided: \u201cA housing allocation reserves a developer the right to receive a building permit in that fiscal year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on November 12,2003 (entered November 13, 2003), in which it granted the developer\u2019s application for preliminary injunction (the \u201cNovember 2003 Injunction\u201d). The court found that: (1) Forty West was likely to succeed on the merits; (2) greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>injury would be done to Forty West than the County in the absence of injunctive relief; (3) Forty West would suffer irreparable harm if development review were halted; and (4) the public interest would suffer \u201cno measurable damage[.]\u201d Therefore, it ordered the Board to \u201cresume the development review and approval process\u201d as to both Projects and to extend the milestones in both CMCs. In particular, the court revised the milestone dates by adding 156 days to account for the time period that elapsed between the date the moratorium commenced, June 10, 2003, and the date the court issued the injunction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In reaching its conclusions, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>1. The Likelihood That [Forty West] Will Succeed On the Merits</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">[Forty West] allege[s] the Concurrency Management Certificates are contracts, and that the [County] is in breach of those contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">[Forty West] and the [County] executed under seal two Concurrency Management Certificates. Both Certificates contained identical language, e.g., that the requirements of the Concurrency Management Ordinance \u201chave been made for the above project\u201d and that the \u201cCounty will issue building permits\u201d according to the schedule set forth in each Certificate provided that the developer meets all legal requirements. The Certificates bear the indicia of contracts, including mutual executory promises and the signatures of all parties under seal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">In reliance upon the agreements set forth in the two Certificates, Harrison Farm LLC and Ridgewood LLC promptly purchased the land for Eagles Crest and Ridge-wood Estates.... The companies also incurred initial development costs to stay on track so as to achieve the milestones contained in the Certificates....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\n<em>2. Balance of Convenience\u2014Whether Greater Injury Would Be Done to Defendant by Granting Injunction Than Would Result From Its Refusal</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">By granting the injunction, the County Department of Planning will have to process [Forty West\u2019s] subdivision plants] (and potentially all those subdivision plans that have received a Concurrency Management Certificate) while the Growth Management Task Force focuses on what is wrong with the practice of land development in Carroll County and presents those recommendations to the Board. The Court recognizes that addressing these problems will be time consuming and complicated for the Growth Management Task Force and that it would be ideal if the Task Force could conduct its review of land development in the county without dealing with ongoing subdivision plan review. However, the Court finds that greater injury would be done to [Forty West] if the injunction were not granted. Also, the Court notes that [Forty West] will not receive building permits until Fiscal Year 2005, and the Court will in all likelihood decide this matter on the merits before construction of Eagles Crest or Ridgewood Estates begins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>3. Whether [FoHy West] Will Suffer Irreparable Injury</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">[Forty West is] seeking the continuation of processing of [its] subdivision plans without the imposition of additional adequate public facilities requirements. [Forty West] allege[s] that because Ordinance 03-11 does not defer residential developments in Carroll County\u2019s municipalities, where a large percentage of residential growth is anticipated, it is likely that during the deferral period [Forty West\u2019s] projects will lose any competitive advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Stephen H. Costello, President of Forty West, testified at the preliminary injunction hearing that he borrowed $6,981,250.00 from The Columbia Bank to purchase the properties and that the bank holds a promissory note dated May 9, 2003, that provides that the principal shall be due and payable June 1,2005. The promissory note also pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>vides that interest on the principal shall be paid monthly commencing on the first day of the first month following the date of the promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">The Court finds that there is a likelihood that [Forty West] will prevail on the merits, and therefore, the possibility that [Forty West\u2019s] subdivision projects will suffer irreparable harm due to the County\u2019s decision to continue processing the plans of Carroll County\u2019s municipalities will suffice for satisfaction of this factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">A <em>The Public Interest</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">The public interest will suffer no measurable damage by the granting of this injunction, pending a hearing on the merits. [Forty West] will not be eligible for a building permit until 2005 and, therefore, should [the County] prevail at a hearing on the merits, none of the residences will have been constructed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The County noted an appeal as to the November 2003 Injunction. On its own initiative, the Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiorari in three consolidated cases, including <em>Board of County Commissioners for Carroll County v. Forty West Builders, Inc. See Board of County Commissioner for Carroll County v. John W. Pfaff Builders, Inc., </em>380 Md. 617, 846 A.2d 401 (2004) (per curiam). However, on December 3, 2004, the Court dismissed the appeals as moot. <em>Board of County Commissioners for Carroll County v. John W. Pfaff Builders, Inc., </em>384 Md. 22, 862 A.2d 404 (2004). The Court explained that it granted certiorari to consider the validity of County Ordinance No. 03-11, which \u201cimposed a one-year moratorium on the processing of residential development plans,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 23, 862 A.2d 404, but \u201cthe moratorium had expired and was not renewed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court said: \u201cThe issue we took the cases to decide is therefore moot, and there is no indication that it is likely to recur in any kind of similar factual setting, as the basis for the moratorium has, itself, been dealt \"with by subsequent county legislation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">As noted, on April 22, 2004, while the appeal from the November 2003 Injunction was pending, the County enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Ordinance No. 04-13, which repealed Chapter 167 and enacted Chapter 71.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By letter of May 13, 2004, the County informed Forty West of the adoption of Ordinance No. 04-13, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWK\">The adoption of these ordinances may have a direct impact on your proposed subdivision plans as compliance with each ordinance is required. We would encourage you to contact us to discuss this at your earliest convenience or have our engineer or surveyor make the necessary corrections to bring the plans into compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">Please call for an appointment to discuss your plans or let us know your intentions on how you will be addressing this matter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">By letters dated May 21, 2004, Forty West\u2019s counsel informed the County that Forty West \u201cchalleng[ed] the County\u2019s right to impose any new or revised adequate public facilities criteria to the ... projects].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Forty West indicated that the circuit court had \u201cissued an injunction requiring the County ... to continue the development review and approval process\u201d for the Projects. Appellees\u2019 counsel continued: \u201cI therefore categorically reject your assertion that compliance with the new adequate public facilities ordinance is required.\u201d Moreover, Forty West warned that \u201cthe threat of applying the standards contained in the new ordinance to the ... projects], while [the County] is subject to the Circuit Court\u2019s injunction, places the County in contempt of court or dangerously close to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On May 26, 2004, Forty West filed a \u201cPetition for Constructive Civil Contempt\u201d and a \u201cMotion for Additional Injunctive Relief.\u201d In its petition, Forty West alleged that by telephone on May 25, 2004, the County\u2019s attorney responded to appellees\u2019 letters of May 21, 2004, and the County advised: \u201c(1) that the existing injunction [did] not prohibit the application of new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>adequate public facilities criteria to Eagles Crest and Ridge-wood Estates, and (2) that the County intend[ed] to apply said criteria to the [Projects].\u201d Therefore, Forty West asked the court to find the County in contempt of its November 2003 Injunction. In its motion, Forty West sought to enjoin the County from applying \u201cany adequate facilities ordinances or criteria other than that which was in force and effect at the time the Concurrency Management Certificates were issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">In its opposition to the contempt petition, the County argued that it was not precluded from enacting and applying new ordinances to the Projects. Moreover, it claimed that it did not violate the November 2003 Injunction because it had resumed the development review and approval process with Forty West. In its opposition to Forty West\u2019s motion, the County argued: (1) that the circuit court was \u201cprecluded from exercising its jurisdiction\u201d because the issues raised by Forty West \u201cinvolve the subject matter of the appeal currently before the Court of Appeals\u201d; and, (2) under the separation of powers doctrine, the court lacked the power to grant injunctive relief that would prohibit the County \u201cfrom applying a duly enacted County law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The court held another evidentiary hearing on July 28, 2004. Costello testified that, immediately following the November 2003 Injunction, the County resumed the development review and approval process for the Projects. He recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">In December [2003], we had a SAC [Subdivision Advisory Commission] meeting, which is an open meeting to the public that all the reviewing agencies have a representative and to comment on the plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">We then, in January of '04, had a meeting with Bruce Waldron[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] and many of the reviewers, with our engineers, to go over their comments and to get an understanding of\u2014 of where to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">We then went back, started to revise the plans, turned them into the\u2014the Health Department for\u2014for our final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>perking, which was\u2014some of it was done in the wet weather season, which ended in April. Those results we just received two weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">We then formulated the final plans, you know, realigning the roads and lots ... and we are no[w] finalizing the plan for resubmission in August this year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Costello contended, however, that the Projects could not satisfy the Chapter 71 APF standards, if applied. Forty West then sought to demonstrate why its Projects could not survive the review process if the new APF standards were applied. In this regard, Forty West introduced the County Board of Education\u2019s school capacity projections.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The new APF standards for the Mt. Airy Middle School district provided that facilities are \u201cinadequate\u201d if they exceed 120% of functional capacity, and the County Board of Education report showed that projected enrollment in the Mt. Airy Middle School district from 2005 through 2013 exceeded 120% of functional capacity. Costello explained that adequate public facilities testing under Chapter 71 for middle schools \u201cchanged from a State-rated [capacity under Chapter 167] to a ... functionally-rated capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Waldron testified as to the County\u2019s efforts to comply with the November 2003 Injunction. He explained that after the Deferral Ordinance went into effect in June of 2003, processing of the Projects ceased. However, after the court issued the November 2003 Injunction, the County resumed the review process. It asked Forty West to submit plans that were reviewed at a December 2003 SAC meeting. Thereafter, the parties held a follow-up meeting to discuss comments that were made at the SAC meeting. The next step was for Forty West to submit revised plans, which his Department would \u201cforward to the various agencies for review.\u201d As of the July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>2004 hearing, however, Forty West had not submitted the revised plans, so \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot for [the County] to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ax2\">The court held the matter <em>sub curia, </em>pending the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in the consolidated appeals concerning the ordinance imposing the one-year moratorium, <em>supra. </em>As indicated, on December 3, 2004, the Court of Appeals dismissed that appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">On January 3, 2005, Forty West filed \u201cAmendments by Interlineation to Verified Complaint,\u201d in which it sought to expand the scope of the lawsuit by alleging that the Projects could not qualify for planning commission approval after the enactment of Chapter 71. Claiming that \u201cApplication of the new Chapter 71 to [Forty West\u2019s] projects will probably cause them to be rejected,\u201d Forty West requested that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">Find and declare that [Forty West\u2019s] rights under the Concurrency Management Certificates ... survived the County\u2019s enactment of Ordinance 04-13 [i.e., Chapter 71], and that said Ordinance had no effect on the County\u2019s obligation to continue processing the Eagles Crest or Ridge-wood Estates projects without further testing for adequate public facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The County filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or in the Alternative to Stay\u201d on January 13, 2005. It asserted: (1) \u201cThe question whether Chapter 71 applies to [Forty West\u2019s] projects should be heard and decided by the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to any ruling\u201d in the circuit court; (2) Forty West did not exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in the circuit court; and (3) Forty West \u201cfailed to take advantage\u201d of the time period between the issuance of the November 2003 Injunction and the adoption of Chapter 71 in April of 2004 to seek approval of the Projects. Moreover, the County alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">[Consideration of the application of Chapter 71 to [Forty West\u2019s] projects is not yet ripe. The various agencies have not yet approved [Forty West\u2019s] projects and such approval is a prerequisite for submission to the Planning and Zoning Commission. Only after a submission to the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>will the projects be tested for adequacy of public facilities. Assertions by [Forty West] as to whether or not their projects will satisfy adequacy requirements are sheer speculation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Then, on May 20, 2005, Forty West filed a \u201cMotion for Partial Summary Judgment,\u201d in which it asked the court to \u201crule, on the basis of undisputed facts, that the Concurrency Management Certificates were contracts,\u201d and thus the County was precluded from requiring any further approval for adequate public facilities, so long as the milestones were met. In the alternative, Forty West argued that \u201cthe County is estopped to impose more stringent facilities requirements by virtue of [Forty West\u2019s] reliance upon the Certificates and the County ordinance [Chapter 167] promising that no new standards would be imposed.\u201d In its opposition, the County denied that the CMCs are contracts. It also claimed that Forty West \u201cfailed to establish\u201d that it is \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of estoppel[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">By \u201cMemorandum Opinion and Order\u201d dated October 17, 2005 (the \u201cOctober 2005 Order\u201d), the circuit court denied the County\u2019s motion to dismiss and granted Forty West\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. As to the motion for partial summary judgment, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">This Court granted [Forty West\u2019s] Application for Preliminary Injunction based, <em>inter alia, </em>on this Court\u2019s finding that [Forty West was] likely to prevail on the issue that the Concurrency Management Certificates obtained by [Forty West] were contracts or acted like contracts, and the imposition of the deferral by [the County] amounted to a breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">[Forty West] and the [County] executed under seal two Concurrency Management Certificates. Both Certificates contain identical language, e.g., that the requirements of the Concurrency Management Ordinance \u201chave been made for the above project\u201d and that the \u201cCounty will issue building permits\u201d according to the schedule set forth in each Certificate provided that the developer meets all legal require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ments. The Certificates bear the indicia of contracts, including mutual executory promises and the signatures of all parties under seal. <em>See, Venners v. Goldberg, </em>133 Md.App. 428, 758 A.2d 567 (2000). In <em>Selig v. State Highway Administration, </em>383 Md. 655, 677, 861 A.2d 710 (2004), the Court held that once a party enters into a contract valid under the statute at the time of execution, subsequent statutes, generally, cannot impair the operation of those contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">. In reliance upon the agreements set forth in the two Certificates, Harrison Farm LLC and Ridgewood LLC promptly purchased the land for Eagles Crest and Ridge-wood Estates.... The companies also incurred initial development costs to stay on track so as to achieve the milestones contained in the Certificates____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">The Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether [the] Concurrency Management Certificates ... constitute a contractual obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Regarding the County\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">[The County] filed their [sic] Motion on the basis of [Forty West\u2019s] failure to exhaust administrative remedies citing two recent Maryland Court of Appeals decisions, <em>Maryland Recreation [Reclamation] Associates, Inc. v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 855 A.2d 351 (2004) and <em>City of Bowie v. Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board, </em>384 Md. 413, 863 A.2d 976 (2005) [2006]. [Forty West] allege[s it] has no administrative remedy to pursue. The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland in an opinion dated April 20, 2005, agreed with this Court that the Board of Zoning Appeals does not have jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the deferral ordinance. There is no point in staying these proceedings until such time as the Planning and Zoning Commission has issued an opinion as to the applicability of Chapter 71 to [Forty West\u2019s] projects, when [Forty West has] a vested contractual interest in applying Chapter 167 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the Carroll County Code, the law in effect at the time the Concurrency Management Certificates were issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Therefore, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">ORDERED, that the Defendant\u2019s Motion To Dismiss Or, In the Alternative, To Stay be, and it hereby is, denied; and it is further;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">ORDERED, that Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be, and it hereby is, granted; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">ORDERED, that Concurrency Management Certificate No. P-02-44 (Ridgewood Estates) constitutes a contractual obligation precluding the Board of County Commissioners of Carroll County, the Carroll County Planning Commission, or any agencies hereof from requiring any further approval for adequate public facilities, as long as the project is completed in accordance with its milestones, as amended by this Court\u2019s prior order granting injunctive relies; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">ORDERED, that Concurrency Management Certificate No. P-02-43 (Eagles Crest) constitutes a contractual obligation precluding the Board of County Commissioners of Carroll County, the Carroll County Planning Commission, or any agencies thereof from requiring any further approval for adequate public facilities, as long as the project is completed in accordance with its milestones, as amended by this Court\u2019s prior order granting injunctive relief; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">ORDERED, that [Forty West\u2019s] Petition for Constructive Contempt be, and it hereby is, granted and the County can purge itself of contempt by continuing to process Ridge-wood Estates and Eagles Crest under Chapter 167 ..., the law in effect at the time ... the Concurrency Management Certificates for both projects were issued; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">ORDERED, that [Forty West\u2019s] Motion for Additional Injunctive Relief be, and it hereby is, granted; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">ORDERED, that the Board of County Commissioners be, and it hereby is, enjoined from applying to Eagles Crest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and Ridgewood Estates any adequate public facilities ordinances or criteria other than that which was in force and effect at the time the Concurrency Management Certificates were issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Within ten days, both parties filed motions to alter or amend, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-584. Because the October 2005 Order was not issued until seventeen months after Forty West made its original request for relief, and fifteen months after the July 2004 hearing, Forty West\u2019s motion requested that \u201ceach milestone in the Concurrency Management Certificates be further extended by 387 days beyond the extensions ordered in November 2003.\u201d The County asked the court to vacate its finding of constructive contempt, and to amend the October 2005 Order by addressing Forty West\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the milestones, as amended by the November 2003 Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The court entertained the motions to alter or amend at a hearing held on June 8, 2006.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By \u201cOrder\u201d of August 17, 2006, the court granted Forty West\u2019s motion and extended the CMC milestones \u201c387 days beyond the 156-day extension\u201d ordered by the November 2003 Injunction. On August 28, 2006, the court issued an \u201cOrder\u201d denying the County\u2019s motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Because of the additional delay between Forty West\u2019s original request for relief on filed on October 26, 2005, and the court\u2019s eventual grant of relief on August 17, 2006, Forty West filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Court\u2019s Order of August 17, 2006\u201d on August 28, 2006. It asked the court to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">(a) Extend the milestone dates under Chapter 167 for a minimum of twenty-one months from [June 8, 2006] but require the County to process Forty West\u2019s plans under all the laws that existed at the time of the issuance of the Concurrency Management Certificates (and not just Chapter 167) to which milestone dates apply or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(b) Reaffirm the October 2005 Order that requires there be no additional requirements to test for adequate public facilities for the reasons cited therein and if [any \u201cof the new development, subdivision and adequate public facilities ordinances, rules, regulations and procedures adopted by the County in and after 2004\u201d] are to be applied to Forty West\u2019s projects then there shall be no milestone dates established inasmuch as none exist under [the new ordinances, rules, regulations and procedures adopted in or after 2004].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The County filed an opposition. The court has not yet ruled on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On September 8, 2006, the County noted an appeal from the circuit court\u2019s Order of October 17, 2005, and the Order of August 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASU\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The County appeals three rulings of the circuit court made in October 2005: the finding that the County was in constructive civil contempt of its Order of November 13, 2003, and could purge itself by continuing to process the Projects under Chapter 167; the grant of additional injunctive relief to Forty West; and the grant of partial summary judgment to Forty West. The County claims, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erred when it premised these rulings on its \u201cconclusion that the [CMCs] are or act like contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Preliminarily, Forty West claims that the appeal is premature, \u201cbecause the circuit court is still considering whether to grant Forty West\u2019s [August 28, 2006] Rule 2-534 motion to extend the development milestones or, in the alternative, delete the milestone requirements altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It adds: \u201cThe circuit court\u2019s ruling on this motion could render irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>vant or moot the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the additional interlocutory injunctive relief at issue here.\u201d Therefore, it urges this Court to \u201cdelay processing of the appeal until the withdrawal or disposal of the pending motion.\u201d In addition, Forty West insists that there is no statutory basis for an appeal of the partial summary judgment order because it is interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The County argues that the finding of contempt and the issuance of the preliminary injunction are interlocutory orders that are immediately appealable. Moreover, it maintains that the underlying determination that the CMCs are contracts is also reviewable, because the trial court\u2019s conclusion to that effect was the basis on which the court found the County in constructive contempt and granted injunctive relief, enjoining the County from applying any APF ordinance to the Projects, \u201cother than that which was in force and effect\u201d when the CMCs were issued. Appellant adds: \u201cThe correlation is clear: the reason why the court granted the additional injunctive relief was because it decided that the CMCs were contracts.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Even if we proceed with consideration of the appeal, Forty West contends that we need not decide whether CMCs are contracts. Rather, it urges us to confine our attention to whether the circuit court \u201cabused its discretion in finding that the CMC-contract argument\u2014or any of the other legal arguments in support of Forty West\u2019s claim\u2014is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d Forty West continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">Section 12\u2014303(3)(i) [of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] does not authorize a frantic leap to the Court of Special Appeals every time the circuit court enters an order supplying an additional <em>reason </em>for a prior grant of injunctive relief not challenged on appeal. Only the injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>relief itself may be appealed. [] There is nothing in the October 2005 order forging any necessary link between the CMC-contract finding and either the extension of milestones or the finding of contempt. Similarly, the statute authorizing immediate [appeal] of a contempt finding, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 12-304, does not permit appeals of other, unrelated interlocutory orders such as one granting partial summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Ordinarily, an appeal must be taken from a final judgment entered in the trial court in order for an appellate court to obtain jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d); <em>see Silbersack v. AC and S, Inc., </em>402 Md. 673, 678, 938 A.2d 855 (2008) (\u201c[T]here is a long-standing bedrock rule of appellate jurisdiction, practice, and procedure that, unless otherwise provided by law, the right to seek appellate review ... ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties.\u201d); <em>see also Hudson v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>402 Md. 18, 24, 935 A.2d 395 (2007); <em>County Com\u2019rs for St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. 415, 424, 903 A.2d 378 (2006); <em>Taha v. Southern Mgmt. Corp., </em>367 Md. 564, 567, 790 A.2d 11 (2002); <em>O\u2019Brien v. O\u2019Brien, </em>367 Md. 547, 554, 790 A.2d 1 (2002); Md. Rule 2-601. In the usual course, absent a final judgment, we may not reach the merits of an appeal. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>367 Md. at 554, 790 A.2d 1; <em>see Jenkins v. Jenkins, </em>112 Md.App. 390, 399, 685 A.2d 817 (1996) (\u201cThe longstanding rule in this State deems the existence of a final judgment as a jurisdictional fact prerequisite to the viability of an appeal.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 718, 690 A.2d 524 (1997). There is no final judgment here; the <em>court </em>only granted partial summary judgment to Forty West.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Nevertheless, under Maryland law, there are three delineated exceptions to the requirement that an appeal must be taken from a final judgment: (1) appeals from interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>rulings specifically allowed by C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 12-303 and 12-304;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (2) immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602(b);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and (3) appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine. <em>Hudson, </em>402 Md. at 24, 935 A.2d 395; <em>Lacer, </em>393 Md. at 424-25, 903 A.2d 378; <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660 (2005); <em>Addison v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 138, 153, 917 A.2d 1200(2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">As noted, the October 2005 Order granted Forty West\u2019s motion for additional injunctive relief. C.J. \u00a7 12-303(3)(i) permits a party to appeal an order \u201c[gjranting or dissolving an injunction,\u201d so long as the appellant \u201cfiled his answer in the cause[.]\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the court determined in its October 2005 Order that the County was in constructive contempt of its November 2003 Order. That ruling is appeal-able under C.J. \u00a7 12-304(a), which provides, subject to an exception not relevant here, that a party \u201cmay appeal from any order or judgment passed to preserve the power or vindicate the dignity of the court and adjudging him in contempt of court, including an interlocutory order, remedial in nature, adjudging a person in contempt, whether or not a party to the action.\u201d <em>See Bryant v. Howard County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>387 Md. 30, 45, 874 A.2d 457 (2005) (reiterating that a finding of contempt, even without the immediate imposition of punishment or sanction, is appealable because a finding of contempt leaves \u201cthe defendant adjudged to have wilfully violated a court order and may well leave the defendant subject to future punishment at the will of the court.\u201d) <em>See also Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>303 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Md. 473, 483, 494 A.2d 940 (1985) (\u201cA contempt proceeding, even though it may grow out of or be associated with another proceeding, is ordinarily regarded as a collateral or separate action from the underlying case and as separately appealable, with appellate review normally limited to the contempt order itself.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Here, the court issued its contempt finding and its grant of injunctive relief as part of an omnibus Memorandum Opinion and Order in which it granted Forty West\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. All three rulings were predicated on the circuit court\u2019s finding that the CMCs constituted contractual obligations. Because that determination was the basis for the contempt finding and the injunction, which are appealable interlocutory orders, we are satisfied that the CMC-contract issue is properly before us. If we were to adopt Forty West\u2019s position\u2014that the contract issue is not before us\u2014we would be barred from reviewing an appealable interlocutory order merely because the circuit court issued such an order contemporaneous with a non-appealable interlocutory order (ie., the grant of partial summary judgment). The statutes that empower us to review interlocutory injunctions and contempt findings do not limit our authority in the way suggested by Forty West.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">As indicated, the CMCs were issued by the County and provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">I hereby certify that the requirements of the Carroll County Adequate Public Facilities and Concurrency Management Ordinance (Chapter 167 ... ) have been met for the above project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">The County will issue building permits for the subdivision known as \u201cEagles Crest,\u201d according to the following schedule, provided that the Developer/Owner meets all requirements of Chapter 167, Code of Public Local Laws and Ordinances for Carroll County, all other applicable laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and all agreements between the Developer/Owner and the County.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Appellant argues that the CMCs are not contracts and do not function as such. First, appellant contends that the CMCs did not contain language specific enough to create contracts. Second, appellant argues that, to the extent the County made promises in the CMCs, these promises were not supported by consideration. In addition, appellant contends that they were not validly executed, in accordance with Code, Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01, <em>et. seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Forty West insists that the CMCs are contracts, in which appellant promised that approval of Forty West\u2019s Projects would be governed by the APF ordinance that existed at the time the CMCs were issued. It contends that, to the extent appellant changed its APF law, these changes would not apply to the Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Forty West\u2019s position is rooted in its concern that its Projects cannot meet the new Chapter 71 standards, which increased the threshold required for certain services to be deemed \u201cadequate.\u201d According to Forty West,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Whereas the previous ordinance required that a project satisfy APF standards only once (prior to issuance of a CMC), after which \u201cno further approval for adequate facilities and services will be required\u201d (\u00a7 167-6.E ...) the new Chapter 71 imposes <em>five separate stages </em>of review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u2022 An initial, \u201ctentative\u201d determination by the Department of Planning (\u00a7 71-6.C(2) ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u2022 An initial \u201crecommendation\u201d by the Department of Planning (\u00a7 71-6.D(3) ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u2022 An initial \u201cadequacy determination\u201d by the Planning and Zoning Commission (\u00a7 71-6.D(4) ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u2022 A final \u201crecommendation\u201d by the Department of Planning (\u00a7 71-6.E(3) ...); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u2022 A final \u201cadequacy determination\u201d by the Planning and Zoning Commission (\u00a7 71-6.E(4) ...).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Forty West also points out that, unlike its predecessor, Chapter 71 does not provide for an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals with respect to the denial of a CMC. Moreover, Chapter 71 includes multiple stages of APF review, but does not provide for the milestones that were a feature of Chapter 167. Forty West asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u2022 Under the former law, public facilities were either adequate or not. However, under the new law, a new category has been created, called \u201capproaching inadequacy,\u201d with lower thresholds of inadequacy, and any project falling in that category can be denied approval, modified, or stalled. (\u00a7 71-5.D(2), Apx. 32).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\u2022 Under the prior law, school capacity was adequate so long as projected enrollment would be 120% or less of \u201cstate-rated\u201d capacity. (E. 472; \u00a7 167-5.C(l)(a), Apx. 5). Under the new law, however, elementary and high schools are \u201capproaching inadequacy\u201d when projected enrollment is 110% to 119% of state-rated capacity. (\u00a7 71-5.D(2)(a), Apx. 32). Moreover, middle schools are \u201capproaching inadequacy\u201d when projected enrollment is 110% to 119% of <em>functional </em>capacity, and \u201cinadequate\u201d at levels of 120% or more of <em>functional </em>capacity. (E. 472; \u00a7 71-5.D(2)(a),(3)(a), Apx. 32).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u2022 If public facilities are deemed inadequate or approaching inadequacy, the County can impose a \u201cphasing schedule\u201d lessening the number of building permits issued each year for development projects.

(\u00a7 71-4.B, Apx.30). However, the County mandates that building permits issued by municipalities not subject to the County\u2019s ordinances \u201cshall be included\u201d in computing the average. <em>Id.[ </em><footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] This is a departure from prior practice and will reduce the number of building permits issued by the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Before reviewing the parties\u2019 contentions in greater detail, we pause to review the basic principles of contract law.

If the agreement be so vague and indefinite that it is not possible to collect from it the intention of the parties, it is void because neither the court nor jury could make a contract for the parties. Such a contract cannot be enforced in equity nor sued upon in law. For a contract to be legally enforceable, its language must not only be sufficiently definite to clearly inform the parties to it of what they may be called upon by its terms to do, but also must be sufficiently clear and definite in order that the courts, which may be required to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>it, may be able to know the purpose and intention of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 217, 76 A.2d 354 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u201cIn construing a contract, each clause must be given effect if reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Arundel Fed.

It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">[T]he CMC failed to place any obligation whatsoever on the County to even process Forty West\u2019s projects by a date or time certain. The CMC did not include provisions or language that reflected intent by the Board to confer a vested right to housing allocations or a guarantee of preliminary subdivision approval by the Commission of the same number of lots as the housing allocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Forty West responds that the CMCs \u201care or function as contracts between Forty West and the County. They bear the indicia of contracts, including mutual executory promises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and the signature of all parties under seal.\u201d It insists that the County regards CMCs as contracts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">Sec. 167-6.E of the County Code States: \u201cOnce a project has received a concurrency management certificate, <em>no further approval for adequate facilities and services will be required </em>for the project if the project is completed in accordance with its milestones.\u201d The Special Report that prompted the County to adopt the deferral ordinances states: \u201cThe [Concurrency Management] Certificate <em>acts like a \u2018contract\u2019 </em>with the developer, and by its issuance, <em>the County agrees that the project can move forward to </em>completion\u2014irrespective of the possibility that public facilities may become inadequate before the project is ready for recordation.\u201d Unrebutted testimony established that the County\u2019s Director of Planning, in a slide presentation to homebuilders discussing the concurrency management process (prior to the adoption of the Deferral Ordinance) stated: \u201cA housing allocation <em>reserves a developer the right </em>to receive a building permit in that fiscal year.\u201d (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The CMCs expressly stated that the Projects satisfied then existing APF requirements. On that basis, the County clearly agreed .to \u201cissue building permits for the subdivision.\u201d When read together with the milestones schedule, the County was obligated to issue particular building permits at specified times, so long as Forty West met the requirements listed in the CMCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">At the relevant time, \u00a7 167-6.E of the County Code expressly stated: \u201cOnce a project has received a concurrency management certificate, no further approval for adequate facilities and services will be required for the project if the project is completed in accordance with its milestones.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Of import here, \u201c \u2018Maryland adheres to the general rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>parties to a contract are presumed to contract mindful of the existing law and that all applicable or relevant laws must be read into the agreement of the parties just as if expressly provided by them, except where a contrary intention is evident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 344, 731 A.2d 441 (1999) (quoting <em>Wright v. Commercial &amp; Sav. Bank, </em>297 Md. 148, 153, 464 A.2d 1080(1983)). Thus, the CMCs must be construed in light of \u00a7 167-6.E of the County Code; it explicitly provided that, upon issuance of a CMC, the County will not require additional APF approval. Neither the CMCs nor the County Code created an exception to this language allowing the County to impose new standards by changing the law and applying it retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Appellant points to several matters not addressed by the CMCs, to suggest that the promises contained within the CMCs are not enforceable. These include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201c[T]he CMC created no rights to a development approval or the processing of development approvals by the Board within any specific period of time\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cAdequate public facilities testing ... does not guarantee approval of any specific number of lots\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c[B]y issuance of a CMC, the County did not guarantee issuance of a specific number of permits by a specific date.\u201d [based on testimony]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201c[T]he issuance of the CMC ... did not constitute approval of a preliminary subdivision plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u201cThe CMC did not include provisions or language that reflected ... a guarantee of preliminary subdivision approval by the Commission of the same number of lots as the housing allocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The Board\u2019s contractual duties under CMCs are no less clear and definite simply because the CMCs do not regulate every detail of the development process. As the Court has said, \u201cA contract is not rendered unenforceable merely because the parties do not supply every conceivable detail or anticipate every contingency that may arise.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Scheffres v. Columbia Realty Co., Inc., </em>244 Md. 270, 285, 223 A.2d 619 (1966) (citations omitted). In effect, appellant would have us overlook the definite obligation the CMCs imposed on the County\u2014to refrain from applying new public facilities requirements to the Projects\u2014merely because the CMCs did not control every aspect of the development process. We decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The Board also insists that a CMC is not a contract but it is, instead, \u201ca staff-generated form\u201d; \u201ca \u2018fill in the blanks\u2019 generic form\u201d; \u201cnothing more than a \u2018written determination\u2019 of available threshold capacity\u201d; \u201can approval required of almost all residential developers before a subdivision plan could be filed\u201d; and \u201cmerely a \u2018determination\u2019 as defined in the CML \u00a7 167-2.\u201d This blizzard of descriptions is not persuasive: a writing can be all of these things and still constitute a contract, so long as it contains the essential elements of a contract. Moreover, the Board\u2019s list of descriptive labels for CMCs raises the question of why it would execute CMCs, under seal, if the CMCs were not intended to have any operative or binding effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">To support its position, the Board further relies on the following language from 5 McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7 19.39 (emphasis added by Board):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">Moreover an ordinance that is a mere permission or at most an administrative act ... <em>is not a contract </em>within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition against impairing the obligation of a contract. The same is true of a permit, such as a building permit, and withdrawing it after granting it does not imp air contract obligations. Similarly, a grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate busses [sic] under municipal license is not a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">As we see it, this language does not apply here because it does not refer to CMCs. While issuance of a building permit or similar license, without more, ordinarily does not contractually bind a municipality, this is only a general rule. By suggesting otherwise, the Board adheres to a formalistic theory of contracts that finds its fullest expression in the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>insistence that \u201cthe CMC was not a contract Nowhere within the CMC was the word \u2018contract\u2019 or similar descriptive wording used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Appellant also argues that the CMCs were not contracts because they lacked consideration. It maintains that the word \u201cseal\u201d next to the signatures on the CMCs \u201cdid not amount to consideration\u201d for the alleged \u201ccontract.\u201d The word \u201cseal,\u201d it argues, was evidence of the Director of Planning\u2019s \u201cdelegated corporate authority to issue a CMC. Appellant further contends that Forty West did not tender anything of value to the County, in contrast to prior decisions finding that a government extended a contract or vested contractual interest to a landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In addition, the Board maintains that the word \u201cseal\u201d was not intended to establish consideration, but only to show that the CMCs were executed by one acting under the Board\u2019s authority. Appellant asserts in its brief, \u201cthe use of the word seal is evidence of the Director of that Department\u2019s delegated corporate authority to issue a CMC.\u201d It relies on the following language from <em>Tipton v. Partner\u2019s Management Co., </em>364 Md. 419, 432, 773 A.2d 488 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The rule as explained in <em>General Petroleum [v. Seaboard Terminals Corp., </em>23 F.Supp. 137 (D.Md.1938) ] is the general rule that applies in instances where a corporate seal is affixed to a document. Because there is a separate and distinct purpose for the affixing of a corporate seal to a document, <em>i.e., </em>it may be evidence of corporate authority for the execution of the document, then there must be other evidence establishing that the corporation intended for the document to be a specialty in order for the twelve-year limitation period to apply. The mere affixing of the corporate seal may not be enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Forty West responds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">The County\u2019s suggestion that the seals were there only to indicate \u201cevidence of corporate authority\u201d has two flaws: (1) it begs the question why evidence of Forty West\u2019s corporate authority was needed in the first place, since Forty West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>was allegedly offering no consideration, and therefore was doing nothing that would required corporate authority, and (2) it assumes that evidence of the County\u2019s own authority to execute the document was needed, which is a mystery if the County was not committing itself to anything, as the County argues on this appeal. The County fails to grasp the significance of execution under seal. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Twining [v. National Mort. Corp., </em>268 Md. 549, 554, 302 A.2d 604 (1973) ], \u201cThe common law has never required a consideration in contracts under seal, but has enforced them because they were held to be the deliberate engagements of the parties making them.\u201d If ever there was a \u201cdeliberate engagement\u201d between two parties, the CMCs qualify for that characterization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In any event, Forty West maintains that it did provide consideration for the CMCs. It claims that the \u201cbenefits\u201d gained by the County \u201cin the form of new housing and resultant tax revenues\u201d is consideration. Moreover, it contends that, \u201cby promising to refrain from imposing further APF review after a CMC is issued, the County encouraged developers to do exactly what Forty West did in this case, namely, purchase land in the County and expend significant monies to develop that land, for the ultimate benefit of the citizens of Carroll County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">To be binding and enforceable, contracts ordinarily require consideration. <em>Cheek v.

Those phrases are somewhat misleading, however, because, in fact, consideration is irrelevant to the validity of such a contract. The seal did not really \u201cimport\u201d consideration, because there was no need for consideration, and consideration was not truly presumed, because its existence was not necessary for the contract to be effective.

The Court observed: \u201cThe use of the word seal on documents involving the conveyance of interests in real property (whether fee simple or lessor interests), has historically had a separate purpose from that involving contracts of a different nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 773 A.2d 488. The Court cited a contracts treatise noting that a contract by deed <em>must </em>be sealed and delivered to be effective: \u201cThis is the main distinction between a <em>deed </em>and any other contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 773 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We also reject appellant\u2019s claim that the CMCs, if they were contracts, were not validly executed due to its failure to follow the procedures set forth in Md.Code, Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01, <em>et seq., </em>pertaining to Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreements (\u201cDRRAs\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In particular, appellant argues there was no public hearing or recordation of the CMCs in the County land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">As Forty West points out, this statute merely empowered counties to adopt, by ordinance, a formalized procedure for the execution of DRRAs; Carroll County did not pass the necessary enabling legislation, however, and so the provisions of Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01, <em>et seq. </em>do not apply. Notably, the County does not argue that its failure to pass such legislation prevented it from forming contracts with developers such as Forty West. <em>See Bollech v.

Mr. Costello was asked at the July 28, 2004 contempt hearing whether he was concerned about the enactment of Chapter 71. Mr. Costello stated, over objection, that it was his understanding that the projects would fail the final test for APF because the new APF testing would invoke a \u201cfunctionally-rated\u201d school capacity test as opposed to a \u201cstate-rated\u201d school capacity test. Mr. Costello based his understanding on enrollment projections for the Carroll County school districts. Counsel for the Board objected to the use of these enrollment projections because even though they had been \u201cput on the street\u201d by the Board of Education, the Board had not yet adopted its ten-year facility master plan. As a result, the numbers contained in the enrollment projections were not final and had not yet been adopted by the Board of Education. The court overruled counsel\u2019s objection and admitted the enrollment projections into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">At the very least, counsel\u2019s stated objection to Mr. Costello\u2019s reliance on the Board of Education\u2019s enrollment projections created a dispute of material fact, particularly since Forty West\u2019s entire argument on what \u201cmight occur\u201d as a result of the enactment of Chapter 71 rested on Mr. Costello\u2019s non-expert opinion as to whether or not the projects would pass a final APF testing. At the same hearing, Bruce Waldron, a Development Review Coordinator, testified for the County. He stated that he was not knowledgeable enough to testify as to whether the enrollment projections would adversely affect the Forty West projects ability to pass APF testing. Later in the hearing, counsel for the Board stated once again that there was no factual predicate to support the admission of the enrollment projections into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>evidence. Counsel added, \u201cwe really don\u2019t know what (the enrollment projections) represents, whether its accurate, whether its inaccurate, whether its to be relied upon or not relied upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Appellees counter that the court \u201chad evidence not only that the CMCs contained contractual obligations but that the County would breach those obligations.\u201d They posit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Even prior to the November 2003 Injunction, Judge Galloway heard evidence that the County intended to apply more stringent APF criteria to Forty West\u2019s projects than were contained in the existing ordinance. Crediting this testimony would have been particularly apt, in light of the Commissioners\u2019 ultimate decisions, which actually applied more stringent criteria even before the ordinance had been changed. Judge Galloway was also entitled to infer, from the fact that the County refused to call Horn to the stand during the October 2003 hearing, to testify about facts peculiarly within his knowledge (the County\u2019s intended modifications to the adequate public facilities criteria), that Horn\u2019s testimony would have been unfavorable. <em>Rodin v.

These letters, Forty West claims, \u201ctook note of the County\u2019s recent enactment of Chapter 71 and warned Forty West that enforcement of the ordinance \u2018may have a direct impact on your proposed subdivision plans as compliance with each ordinance is required.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The County\u2019s argument assumes that a breach of the CMCs could only take place if the application of Chapter 71 to the Projects required modification or abandonment of the Projects. We disagree. As we see it, the breach occurred in the application of those new APF standards to the Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The County does not refute the May 13, 2004 letters proffered by Forty West, in which the County insisted that compliance with Chapter 71 \u201cis required.\u201d The letters were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sufficient evidence to show the County\u2019s intent to apply the new APF ordinance to the Projects, in breach of the County\u2019s obligations under the CMCs. Even if the Projects survive the new Chapter 71 standards, that would be relevant only to Forty West\u2019s damages flowing from the breach, not to the breach itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Appellant argues that the court \u201cerred or abused its discretion when it found Carroll County to be in constructive contempt of its November 13, 2003 Order.\u201d The County insists that the November 2003 Order required only that it \u201cresume the development review and approval process\u201d for the Projects.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In appellant\u2019s view, the court did not, and could not, \u201cprevent the Board from enacting any new development legislation, nor did the court state that the Board was prohibited from applying new legislation to the Forty West projects.\u201d Appellant adds, in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">If the Court had prohibited the enactment of the new ordinance, the Court\u2019s order would have violated the separation of powers doctrine, which states that a court \u201ccannot require the legislature to take action within the scope of its prerogative, by mandamus or otherwise,\u201d <em>Maryland Committee For Fair Representation v.

Moreover, Forty West maintains that, at the July 2004 hearing, it demonstrated that its Projects would not satisfy the new APF standards. Referring to the County\u2019s letters of May 13, 2004, as evidence that the County intended to violate the November 2003 Injunction, it asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The letters took note of the County\u2019s recent enactment of Chapter 71 and warned Forty West that enforcement of the ordinance \u201cmay have a direct impact on your proposed subdivision plans as compliance with each ordinance is required.\u201d In response, Forty West\u2019s counsel sent letters to the County on May 21, 2004, pointing out that the May 13 letters threatened to place the County in contempt of court. A conference with the County Attorney\u2019s office on May 25, 2004, confirmed the County\u2019s intention to apply newly enacted APF standards to Forty West\u2019s projects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Turning to the November 2003 Injunction, Forty West argues that the court required the County to resume the review process, and that \u201c[t]he trial judge reasonably concluded that the County\u2019s choice to apply new APF standards would lead to the shutdown of processing, inconsistent with the circuit court\u2019s prior order to resume processing.\u201d Addressing appellant\u2019s separation of powers argument, Forty West concedes the County was free to enact the Chapter 71 legislation.

The November 2003 Order arose from Forty West\u2019s request for an injunction to prevent the County from suspending the approval process for the Projects, pursuant to the Deferral Ordinance. The County had passed the Deferral Ordinance in an effort to postpone residential development, while it developed more restrictive public facilities requirements. The November 2003 Order noted that Forty West was \u201cseeking the continuation of processing of their subdivision plans without the imposition of additional adequate public facilities requirements.\u201d In granting Forty West\u2019s request for injunction in November 2003, the court effectively determined that the County could not apply stricter public facilities condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tions to the Projects in an attempt to delay subdivision approval and issuance of building permits to Forty West. Therefore, it ordered the County to \u201cresume the development review and approval process\u201d for the Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In appellees\u2019 subsequent contempt petition, at issue here, they argued that the November 2003 Order required the County to \u201cresume the development review and approval process\u201d pertaining to the Projects. Citing the County\u2019s passage of Chapter 71, and its expressed intent to apply new APF requirements to the Projects, Forty West asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALf\">This action by the County directly contravenes the Order of November 13, 2003, in that said Order contemplated that the \u201cdevelopment review and approval process\u201d would be carried out under the ordinances in effect at the time of the Order. The County\u2019s application of new, more stringent APF requirements to [Forty West\u2019s] Projects constitutes a <em>de facto </em>cessation of the \u201cdevelopment review and approval process\u201d contemplated in the Order, and therefore places the County in contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The circuit court agreed with Forty West. It ordered that its Petition for Constructive Contempt be granted, and ruled that the County could \u201cpurge itself of contempt by continuing to process [the Projects] under Chapter 167 of the Code of Public Laws and Ordinances of Carroll County, the law in effect at the time [the CMCs] for both projects were issued[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In finding the County in contempt of its November 2003 Order, the court properly concluded that the County was yet again attempting to delay approval of the Projects in order to impose, retroactively, more rigorous public facilities requirements. Whether the County sought to accomplish this delay through a second \u201cdeferral ordinance,\u201d or by applying new, stricter APF standards on the Projects, the effect was the same: approval of the Projects would be held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The court was not required in the November 2003 Order to set forth specifically all possible ways that the County could conceivably suspend or delay approval of the Projects. Nor could the County claim compliance with the Order by tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>rarily resuming approval, then suspending the process indefinitely. The November 2003 Order clearly barred the County from using public facilities adequacy as a justification for failing to approve the subdivisions and issue building permits, and the court did not err in finding that appellant violated the November 2003 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Appellant insists that the award of preliminary injunctive relief was improper. It contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over Forty West\u2019s request for additional injunctive relief because Forty West failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">On or about December 30, 2004, Forty West filed an Amended Complaint seeking to enjoin the Board from applying Chapter 71 to its projects.[ ] Forty West, which had obtained a Concurrency Management Certificate under the precursor to Chapter 71, Chapter 167, argued that the additional adequate public facilities testing on its projects under Chapter 71 would be unfair and prejudicial. Yet, such a determination would necessitate the review and interpretation of both Chapter 71 and the repealed Chapter 167. This interpretation should not have been made by the circuit court but by the administrative agency most familiar with Chapter 167 and Chapter 71, the Planning and Zoning Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Appellant\u2019s brief continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">Forty West contends that an administrative agency lacks jurisdiction to hear any sort of direct challenge to a legislative act (like the enactment of Chapter 71). (E.253). Forty West, however, has not challenged the enactment of Chapter 71. Instead, Forty West has challenged the administrative decision to apply Chapter 71 to its projects. Even though the enactment of Chapter 71 was a legislative action, the decision to apply Chapter 71 to Forty West\u2019s projects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>was an administrative action, and therefore, Forty West was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief from the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Further, the County asserts: \u201cA claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies is jurisdictional in nature, and may be raised at any time, including on appeal ... Due to Forty West\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies, no justiciable controversy existed before the trial court, and any claim for injunctive relief should have been dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Appellees respond that \u201cthe policies underlying the exhaustion requirement are not implicated here.\u201d They argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">It is because administrative agencies have special expertise in the subject matter of the statutes they interpret that courts defer to their findings and proceedings. <em>Heery Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>384 Md. 129, 137-38, 145, 862 A.2d 976 (2004). Here, however, the contempt proceeding did not involve interpretation of a statute that the agency administers, but interpretation of a court order. Neither the County nor any of its administrative agencies has special expertise in determining whether their own actions have violated an order of the circuit court. Nor does the County Code provide an administrative remedy, such as injunctive relief, for violation of a court order. Clearly the trial court is in the best position to decide, in the first instance, whether a party to a pending lawsuit has shown contempt by intentionally violating the court\u2019s express orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The grant or denial of an injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.

On the other hand, in the absence of a statutory or administrative remedy, exhaustion is not required; a declaratory action may lie to challenge an administrative ruling. <em>Cf. Anderson House, LLC v. Mayor and City Council of Rockville, </em>402 Md. 689, 705-06, 939 A.2d 116 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We agree with Forty West that it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to seeking injunctive relief or a contempt finding. Forty West\u2019s argument, which we have accepted, is that Chapter 71 does not apply to the Projects because, under the CMCs, Forty West had already satisfied its APF-related obligations under Chapter 167. Requiring Forty West to submit the Projects to a second APF review process would deprive it of its rights under the CMCs. Thus, exhaustion has no application here, because there is no administrative procedure open to Forty West to achieve the relief it seeks, which is enforcement of its contractual rights under the CMCs and Chapter 167 of the County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">According to appellant, the decision to apply Chapter 71 to the Projects is an \u201cadministrative decision.\u201d This belies the text of Chapter 7 1, which states: <em>\u201cNo development project subject to this chapter may be approved </em>by the [Planning] Commission <em>until the project has satisfied the requirements of this chapter.\u201d </em>County Code, \u00a7 71-6 (emphasis added). Chapter 71 applies to \u201cMajor residential subdivisions\u201d and \u201cMinor residential subdivisions not in the Agricultural District.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 71-3. Appellant does not argue that the Projects are exempt from Chapter 71 by the statute\u2019s terms, or that the Commission has any discretion to refrain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>applying the new APF review process to a project that is submitted to the Chapter 71 process. Nor does Chapter 71 set forth any administrative process for a landowner to follow when the developer correctly maintains that his or her projects are exempt from the ordinance due to an existing contractual relationship between the County and the developer, resulting from the issuance of a CMC. Moreover, Chapter 71 does not provide a remedy for a developer whose plans are denied following adequacy review; the developer\u2019s plan is to be \u201cplaced in a queue and re-tested on an annual basis.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 71-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Appellant claims there is no showing that Forty West could not meet the new criteria under Chapter 71. This is irrelevant. Even if the County stipulated that the Projects could survive the Chapter 71 review process, it is the submission of the Projects to a second APF-review process, not the end result of that process, that would constitute a violation of the County\u2019s duties under the CMCs. We decline to require Forty West to submit its Projects to Chapter 71 review, given its contractual rights, as we recited above, under the CMCs. Presumably, if the CMCs had never been executed, Forty West would have been required to submit the Projects to the Chapter 71 review process. But, Forty West already pursued the administrative APF-approval process under the earlier statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">.

The annexation petition was scheduled for a public hearing before the Town Planning and Zoning Commission, but the petition was withdrawn on October 3, 200 before the hearing.
