EYLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">James Desmond Jones, appellant, was convicted, after a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, of second-degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Subsequently, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment on the second-degree murder conviction, with twenty-years concurrent on the use of a handgun conviction. On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress and the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Prior to trial, a motions hearing was held. The parties stipulated that the court would consider the testimony adduced at the hearing as evidence during trial. At the motions hearing, the following transpired, pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Detective John Lee, of the Annapolis City Police Department, testified that on January 25, 2006, he became involved with the investigation into the homicide of Darnell Brown, who had been killed on January 13, 2006, and whose body had been found on the grounds of St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis. Mr. Brown \u201cwas known to [the police] to be a seller of [controlled dangerous substances],\u201d and was found dead with several gunshot wounds to the torso, \u201claying on his side, coat pulled over his head. His pocket [ ] turned inside out. There was drugs found on him. There was a cell phone case ... but no cell phone.\u201d Detectives also found \u201ca series of tire tracks,\u201d in \u201cclose proximity to where Mr. Brown was found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Detective Lee testified that Detective Johns obtained Mr. Brown\u2019s cell phone records, which revealed a \u201cseries of calls made to Mr. Brown just moments before he died.... \u201d The calls were traced to \u201csomebody named Jones in Kent County ... on Station Road.\u201d Pursuant to this information, Detective Lee, as well as Detective White, Detective Johns, and Lieutenant Kneisling, of the Annapolis City Police Department, and Deputy Hickman, of the Kent County Sheriffs Department, traveled to 11299 Station Road, the home of appellant and his wife, Tammy Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Detective Lee testified that the property had a long driveway that split to the left and to the right. He stated that initially the officers went \u201cto the left where [they] met an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>older couple, the Webs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who said they were Tammy\u2019s parents. Ms. Webb said that she was the mother of Tammy Jones and that Tammy Jones lived next door.\u201d Ms. Webb, who was \u201cvery friendly,\u201d and \u201cmore than helpful,\u201d also told the police that \u201cshe thought there was something strange going on over there and that they were into drugs. And that they keep the windows pulled down in the house. And that her daughter was a nice daughter, but she met her husband and has not been right since she met that man.\u201d Detective Lee stated that \u201cthere\u2019s lots and lots of dogs on the property. And they were all making all kinds of noise when we got there.\u201d He did not remember whether Ms. Webb \u201cstepped out [of the house] or whether we had to knock briefly and she came out. But we didn\u2019t wait at any great length of time at the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Detective Lee testified that Detective Johns asked Ms. Webb if she knew her daughter\u2019s telephone number. Ms. Webb provided \u201cwhat she knew to be Tammy Jones\u2019 phone number,\u201d which was \u201cthe same number the [the police] had from the phone records.\u201d After speaking with Ms. Webb, who had not indicated that she did not want the officers on the property, the officers \u201cwalked over to\u2014the other side of the property,\u201d where there were three buildings, one of which, \u201cimmediately to the right from the driveway,\u201d appeared to be a residence, and two appeared to be \u201coutbuildings or barns.\u201d Detective Lee testified that Detective Johns knocked on the front door for several minutes without any answer \u201cwhen the door opened and a lady who was later identified as Tammy Jones came out of the house and shut the door behind her.\u201d Detective Johns testified that it was cold and windy outside, and the officers asked if there was \u201csome place we could go and talk and [Ms. Jones] suggested next door, the building immediately adjacent to her house.\u201d The officers followed Ms. Jones to the next building, and \u201c[s]he opened the door and said come on in.\u201d Detective Lee stated that Ms. Jones was \u201cvery friendly and willing to talk\u201d to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>After approximately ten minutes, Detective Lee left the building for a few minutes, leaving Ms. Jones and Detective Johns behind. He was then \u201csummoned to another storage building which was the next barn down.\u201d Detective Lee testified that he \u201cwas told that Ms. Jones had gone back to her house and retrieved ... the key to the second barn.... \u201d The officers proceeded to the second barn, and Ms. Jones \u201clet them in\u201d and showed them a tan Chevy Malibu. Detective Lee stated that Detective Johns asked if the officers could look inside the car, and Ms. Jones left to retrieve the keys to the car. Detective Lee testified that Ms. Jones returned with the keys \u201cand opened it for Detective Johns,\u201d but later stated that he did not recall who opened the car. The police looked inside the vehicle and noticed \u201csome sort of a stain, probably blood in the back seat\u201d that \u201clooked as though it had been cleaned up. And there was also a hole which appeared to possibly be a bullet hole in the back seat of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">After observing the interior of the car, Detective Lee photographed the car, the interior of the barn, and the inside of the car. The officers had the car towed to the Annapolis police station as possible evidence, and subsequently applied for a search and seizure warrant for the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On cross-examination, Detective Lee testified that he did not recall seeing any \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs \u201canywhere on either property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Detective William Johns testified that, upon arriving at the property, the detectives encountered Ms. Webb, who told them that Tammy Jones was her daughter \u201cand that she lived next door, actually on the same property, but just the house next door to hers.\u201d Ms. Webb, who was \u201cvery friendly, very cooperative,\u201d also told them that \u201cshe thought there was something funny going on over there. She thought they were selling drugs or doing drugs over there.\u201d Ms. Webb also told the officers that she had rented a car for Ms. Jones to use, and that the rental company wanted the car back, but that Ms. Jones \u201cwouldn\u2019t give it back and locked it in one of the shed buildings over there.\u201d Ms. Webb asked the officers if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>could try to get the car back for her when they went to speak to Ms. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">While the officers were talking to Ms. Webb, Tammy Jones walked out of the back door, and Ms. Webb \u201cpointed her out to [the officers] and said there\u2019s Tammy right there.\u201d Subsequently, the officers walked over to the house and knocked on the door for \u201cat least five minutes before it was finally answered .... by Tammy Jones.\u201d Detective Johns asked Ms. Jones if they could step inside to talk, as it was \u201ca rather cold day,\u201d but Ms. Jones said that she would rather they talk in one of the other buildings on the property. Detective Johns stated that \u201cat one point [he] asked her about the car her mother had mentioned. And she stated to [him] that it was in the other shop next door. And [he] asked her if [they] could go over and look at it. She said yes, but she had to go get the key.\u201d Subsequently, Ms. Jones went back to the house, and then came out with the key \u201cand opened up the second shop and let [the officers] in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">After Ms. Jones let the officers in to the building, they were able to observe a Chevy Malibu. Detective Johns asked Ms. Jones \u201cif she would mind us looking inside the car and she said no, it was okay, but she had to go get the key.\u201d Ms. Jones left again, and returned with the key, which she handed to Detective Johns. Upon opening the car, the officers observed \u201cwhat appeared to be stains on the back seat that appeared to ... be blood stains that someone had tried to clean up that were faded.\u201d There was also \u201cspots of what appeared to be blood around the doorframe,\u201d and a \u201csmall hole in the seat back of the back seat on the passenger side, which was consistent ... with the injuries to the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Detective Johns testified that Ms. Jones confirmed that her mother had rented the car for her to use, and that she was the only one who drove it. Ms. Jones told the officers that she had once allowed her husband, appellant, to drive the car, but that her mother \u201cfussed at her about that, so she never let him drive it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Detective Johns testified that he did not recall seeing any \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Subsequently, Detective Johns was recalled, and shown several photographs, offered into evidence as appellant\u2019s Exhibit B, depicting multiple \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on the property. Detective Johns identified the areas depicted in the photographs, but testified that the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs in the photographs were not there at any time when he was on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The State also offered photographs, admitted as Exhibit 5, depicting photographs taken by police during the execution of the search warrant on February 3, 2006. Detective Johns testified that the photographs did not depict \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">During argument on the suppression motion, appellant argued that the property was \u201creplete\u201d with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs; thus, \u201c[a]n intrusion was made onto the property by the police in an unlawful manner. They were essentially trespassers when they crossed over onto this land.\u201d In accordance with this argument, appellant requested that the court \u201csuppress the ultimate search of the vehicle ... and everything that flowed from it,\u201d as the fruits of an illegal search. Appellant conceded that he did \u201cnot have case law that is going to support this type of position, but ... there is plenty of case law that deals with curtilage and the entry onto one\u2019s immediate surroundings of their home in an unwelcome and intruding type fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court ruled as follows, in relevant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">So I would find as a fact the evidence persuades me that the only sign that was there when the police came to the property was this large sign on the\u2014what appears to be a large cedar tree that according to the testimony was set back 30 feet from the driveway, from the gravel driveway. And that that sign, which in the photos that we have is shaded by overhanging branches, was a sign which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>have been overlooked by someone coming up the driveway in a normal fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">But even if it had not been overlooked what the sign says is \u201cNo Trespassing, hunting, or fishing\u201d all of those in larger letters. And in smaller letters \u201cViolators prosecuted under penalty of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The inclusion of the words \u201chunting or fishing\u201d and the fact that the sign is placed back from the road in the middle of a field is significant to the [c]ourt as to the expectations of the owners of the property and the significance they intended that sign to have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">The [c]ourt, like counsel in the case, has done a little research looking for Maryland case law about \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs and about warrantless entry by police onto property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">And as best I can find we don\u2019t really have a case on point where there was a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign, which was seen by the police or should have been seen by the police where the police proceeded onto the property and then a court decided, you know, what the significance of the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign was as to the warrantless entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">And I think under all the circumstances that it was not a violation of the reasonable expectation of privacy for them to come up the driveway in the first place and to go knock on the first door that they came to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">And once they had done that, being in a place where they had the right to be, I think that they had an increased right to stay on the property when Ms. Web, one of the owners of the property, invited them to go and talk to her daughter and didn\u2019t tell them to go away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">She was in effect inviting them to stay and to pursue their inquiry. They went and knocked on the door of Ms. Jones. And I do not find that it was unreasonable for them to continue knocking for some minutes until the door was answered because .... [i]t could be any explanation for her taking several minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">Again, I don\u2019t think it was unreasonable under the circumstances that have been described. And what has been described is that when Ms. Jones did answer the door, she then also was friendly, like her mother, and also was cooperative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">Hi * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Because the testimony we have heard was that again [Ms. Jones] is the co-owner of the whole property____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">And [the co-owner of property] ha[s] the right to consent to bring a police officer in the house and let the police officer look around in this room or that room or this shed or that barn. And that is exactly what happened here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">So I think that the evidence is very clear that it had become a consent search. And once they were invited with consent into the sheds and saw the rental car, I think [it] is clear enough under the Carroll doctrine ... that in order to preserve the evidence that they would have the right to tow it, and to preserve it, and get a search warrant before going further if there were containers within the vehicle that might not be accessible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">And they got that search warrant, so there is not a question once they saw the car the rest of it flows from the facts that we have heard, that the police did only what they had a right to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">---- And the [c]ourt would deny the motion to suppress under all the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Following the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, trial commenced. The following was adduced, pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Ms. Webb testified that she rented a car for Ms. Jones in December, 2005, and that only Ms. Jones was authorized to drive it. Ms. Webb stated that she had seen Ms. Jones driving the car, that she was the principal driver, and that Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Jones drove without appellant in the car on \u201cvery few\u201d occasions. Ms. Webb saw appellant driving the car once, and confronted Ms. Jones about it because appellant was not an insured driver on the car. Ms. Webb stated that her daughter was left-handed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Monica Brown, the decedent\u2019s wife, testified that on January 13, 2006, she left $300 in cash for the victim so that he could pay the electric bill. Ms. Brown never saw the money again, and no money was found on the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Rachel Cline testified as an expert in DNA forensic analysis. Ms. Cline testified that appellant could not be excluded as a \u201cminor contributor\u201d to the DNA evidence obtained from the victim\u2019s right front pants pocket. Ms. Jones was excluded as a contributor. Ms. Cline concluded that the bloodstains found on the vehicle\u2019s seat cushions matched Mr. Brown\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Gregory Klees testified as an expert in the field of shooting trajectory analysis. Mr. Klees testified that based on the trajectory of a bullet hole found in the backseat of the Chevy Malibu, the bullet was fired from inside the vehicle, originating towards the passenger\u2019s side. Mr. Klees could not state conclusively, however, whether the bullet was fired from the passenger\u2019s seat or the driver\u2019s seat, agreeing that the shot could possibly have originated from a person firing a weapon with his or her left hand from the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. Photographs of reenactments that were performed \u201cto try to see the possibility or plausibility of [the gun] being fired from various locations\u201d were entered into evidence. Mr. Klees agreed that a photograph of a reenactor shooting from the driver\u2019s seat depicted the reenactor \u201cturned around and up on one knee.\u201d Mr. Klees stated that during \u201creenactment of the body positions on the driver\u2019s seat, we had the reenactor assume various positions, trying to get the barrel of the firearm in line with the ... developed trajectory line. And that was one position we did to achieve that goal.\u201d Photographs were also introduced depicting reenactments of a shooter on the passenger\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Mr. Brown died of two gunshot wounds to the chest. A bullet and a spent bullet were recovered from the victim\u2019s body, and determined to be .45 caliber. Testimony was adduced that in executing the search warrant, police found several boxes of .45 caliber ammunition at appellant\u2019s residence, as well as various weapons. No .45 caliber weapon was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In closing arguments, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cthe facts that could demonstrate or implicate [appellant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a moral certainty are forever in juxtapose in this case. I think both the State and this side of the table have combined to show that, if anything, that Tammy Jones was the perpetrator of this particular shooting.\u201d Appellant argued that the State had not established that appellant was in the vehicle at the time the shots were fired, and that even if appellant was in the vehicle, there was no proof that he was in the front passenger seat. Appellant also argued that even if he were in the front passenger seat, it was more plausible that the shots came from the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The State argued that whether appellant shot the victim, he \u201cwas there.\u201d The State opined that \u201cafter [appellant] and Tammy engaged in the murder of Darnell Brown, [appellant] went through [Mr. Brown\u2019s] pockets. And [appellant] took that money. If [appellant] was there when this happened, there is no way that he didn\u2019t at least know what went on.\u201d \u201cAnd if [appellant] was in that car, as his DNA shows, when Darnell Brown was murdered, if [appellant] was at the scene and in Darnell Brown\u2019s pants pockets at the time he was murdered, then it is certainly fair to say that [appellant] knew what was going on----[and] was involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The court, in convicting appellant of second-degree murder, ruled as follows, in relevant part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">The suggestion was made, I think in a speculative way ... that perhaps [appellant] arrived [at the murder scene] at a later time in a second vehicle, put his hand in the pocket and wasn\u2019t even there when the crime took place. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>er, the [c]ourt really has no evidence that the Joneses had two vehicles or that there were multiple vehicles involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">And it seems to me that the what happened part of it is answered in large part by the trajectory analysis that was offered by Mr. Klees....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">We have a series of photos.... The one line of those reenactment photos is showing the position that a person might have needed to be in to fire the bullet from a handgun in the trajectory of someone in the driver\u2019s seat, or coming from the driver\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">The suggestion ... is that it makes more sense for the driver to have been the shooter, if she were left-handed and basically just whipped around and shot with the gun in her dominant left hand. The picture, however, which matches up with the trajectory of the bullet, does not have the person who would be coming from the driver\u2019s seat, however, in what to me would be a natural position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">The person, a woman ... basically has to get up on her knees in order to have the gun that high. The position of the gun is almost basically to the top of the headrest. So that for someone to shoot the gun in that way, the person in the driver\u2019s seat would have to raise their hand as high as their head, turn around and shoot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">The evidence and line of photos from the reenactor on the passenger\u2019s side is that that person ... would be able to fire from what looks to me to be a more natural position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">So all of that to me, again, is consistent with shots being fired from the passenger\u2019s side of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">[T]he only evidence we have as to usage of the car was that most of the time [appellant and Ms. Jones] were in it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>together, and all but one time he was the passenger and she was the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">So in effect I find that that is unrebutted evidence of a habit or routine. Even though it\u2019s a habit or routine which is only a month in duration, it still is the only evidence that we have as to the usage of the car. And ... there is no reason to think that it was different on this particular occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">* * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">There is also evidence, when we look at ... the search warrant application and also the return ... for the Jones home ... that there are also many, many handgun-related items in ... the family home that was occupied by [appellant] and Ms. Tammy Jones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">And that includes a box of the kind of ammunition which is consistent with use on the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">In the woods behind the house, there are slugs from a .45, again consistent with the type of ammunition used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">----There is no .45 caliber handgun that is found. Let me invite counsel to correct me, if I\u2019m wrong. There\u2019s a 9 millimeter, but there is no .45. And yet they have all this .45 ammunition and they\u2019ve got .45 slugs, apparently target practice, in the backyard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">So it does appear to me that it is a viable argument by the State to suggest that there was a .45 caliber handgun which was in their possession, which apparently normally might have been in the home. And the police did a thorough search of the home, and they didn\u2019t find it. So apparently it was disposed of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">In this case, putting all of those strands of evidence together, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] ... was the person sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, the person who, in greatest likelihood, from the reconstruction of the event, fired the gun from the passenger\u2019s seat, who handled the body of the victim, Mr. Darnell Brown, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>before, during or after the time that he was dying, leaving his DNA in the pockets, and who apparently also disposed of the cell phone, since it was right there next to where he was reaching into the right-hand pocket, and putting all of that evidence together I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the [c]ourt must find him guilty of second degree murder....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the police were unlawfully on his property because the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign, which the court found as a fact was on the property, precluded police entry onto the property, and moreover, there was no valid consent to search. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">When reviewing a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, our scope is ordinarily limited to the record of the suppression hearing and does not include the record of the trial. <em>Myers v. State, </em>395 Md. 261, 274, 909 A.2d 1048 (2006) <em>(citing Byndloss v. State, </em>391 Md. 462, 477, 893 A.2d 1119 (2006)). We consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing on the motion, in this case, the State. <em>State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 581, 861 A.2d 62 (2004). Ordinarily, we will give great deference to a hearing judge\u2019s factual findings, and we will not disturb them unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 581-82, 861 A.2d 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">1. Effect of \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d Sign</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Appellant first contends that the initial entry onto his property was unlawful, based on the presence of a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign, but he cites no authority on point to support that proposition. We are not aware of any reported Maryland decisions in which the issue has been decided. Nevertheless, we have little difficulty in concluding that the initial entry by the police officers was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924), the Supreme Court established that police officers are permitted to enter and search an open field without a warrant because the owner has no reasonable expectation of privacy in such areas. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 44 S.Ct. 445. This frequently has been referred to as the \u201copen field\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In discussing Fourth Amendment protection, courts often discuss property law and the common law concept of curtilage, i.e., the home and its immediate area used for living purposes. In the early days of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, those concepts were applied more rigidly than now, as we have gravitated toward a totality of the circumstances analysis. While property law and curtilage remain relevant, it is now clear that property law does not control Fourth Amendment analysis, <em>Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 304, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 183, n. 15, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214(1984) (trespass law not synonymous with scope of Fourth Amendment protection), and concepts of \u201copen field\u201d and curtilage are often used to distinguish those areas in which an occupant has no reasonable expectation of privacy from those in which the occupant does. <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300-01, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (the Fourth Amendment protects people, and what a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in a home, is not protected, and conversely, Fourth Amendment protection may exist outside the home or curtilage).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since <em>Katz, </em>the focus has been on whether the individual in question manifests a subjective expectation of privacy and, if so, whether it is reasonable. <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>207, 211-12, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second prong, whether it is reasonable, is measured objectively, and focuses not only on the place involved but also on what type and manner of intrusion the individual wants to keep from invading his privacy. <em>Widgren v. Maple Grove Township, </em>429 F.3d 575, 579 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Oliver, </em>police officers entered the defendant\u2019s property to investigate a report that marijuana was being grown on the property. The property contained no trespassing signs. The officers saw growing marijuana. The Supreme Court held that the defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the open land, explaining that open lands \u201cusually are accessible to the public and the police in ways that a home, an office, or commercial structure would not be.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 178, 104 S.Ct. 1735. In reaffirming its decision in <em>Hester, </em>the Court further explained that an open field does not necessarily mean that the area be open or a field, as those words are used in common speech. <em>Id. </em>at 180, n. 11. In comparing trespass law with the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, the Court noted that a right to exclude a person under trespass law does not necessarily embody a Fourth Amendment interest, the former being to exclude and protect against thieves and vandals. <em>Id. </em>at 183, n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976), police officers went to a house to investigate information that the defendant was involved in drug trafficking. When the police approached, the defendant was standing in the doorway, neither within the house nor entirely outside of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406. The question was whether the defendant was in a public place,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Court answered that in the affirmative, explaining that she was exposed to public, view, speech, hearing, and touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In the case before us, the front of the house and the door were exposed to the public, and appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to entry of the yard and a knock on the door by investigating police officers. <em>See Christian v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 212, 222, 914 A.2d 151 (2007) (defendant had no expectation of privacy in area between screen door, that was observed open, and solid entry door of house); <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 601, 666-67, 837 A.2d 989 (2003), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 484, 864 A.2d 1006 (2004) (vestibule of an apartment house same as an open field, and police had a right to be there).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The principles applied in the above cases lead to the conclusion that police officers who, on legitimate business, approach a dwelling to ask questions do not commit an unlawful search or seizure of property. <em>See United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984) (A search occurs \u201cwhen an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed.\u201d A seizure of property occurs \u201cwhen there is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Similarly, police officers on legitimate business, in approaching a dwelling to ask questions, do not commit an unlawful seizure of the person. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that, generally, when police officers approach a person to ask questions, an accosting, they have not seized the person. <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 374-75, 735 A.2d 491 (1999). It may become a seizure, depending on the level of restraint and whether the person feels free to leave. <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Almost all courts that have considered the issue have agreed with the above principles. The Court of Appeals so held in <em>Scott v. State, </em>366 Md. 121, 782 A.2d 862 (2001), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Davis v. United States, </em>327 F.2d 301, 303 (9th Cir.1964).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Referring to the process as the right to \u201cknock and talk,\u201d the Court held that police officers may approach a dwelling, knock on the door, identify themselves as police officers, and ask questions, including whether they can conduct a search. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 782 A.2d 862. The only requirement is that the officers \u201cbe on some legitimate official business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129-30.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v. State, </em>378 Md. 355, 357-61, 835 A.2d 1208 (2003) (reaffirming <em>Scott </em>and upholding knock and talk when a police officer approached a door to a motel, responded \u201cmaintenance\u201d when the occupant asked who was there, and identified himself as a police officer when occupant opened door).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In the case before us, the presence of the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign does not change the analysis or the result that would otherwise obtain. For Fourth Amendment purposes, appellant could not have had a reasonable expectation that the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign would or should prevent visitors with a legitimate purpose from walking to the front door, including police officers in furtherance of an investigation. The Supreme Court has held (1) that the threshold of a home is not a protected area when voluntarily exposed, <em>Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, and (2) open land not otherwise subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy is not made so by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>presence of a no trespassing sign, even if the investigating officer sees it. <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions, on facts similar to those before us, have reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Wysong v. Florida, </em>614 So.2d 670 (Fla.App.1993), and <em>State v. Poppe, </em>131 Or.App. 14, 883 P.2d 905 (1994). We have not undertaken a comparative analysis of all of the cases involving no trespassing signs, but we note that courts have been very consistent in concluding that no trespassing signs, in and of themselves, do not make a police officer\u2019s entry on property unlawful. The presence of no trespassing signs may be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances, however. <em>See, e.g., Keenom v. State, </em>349 Ark. 381, 390, 80 S.W.3d 743 (2002) (officers exceeded right to knock and talk when officer witnessed what he believed to be suspicious behavior by a then unidentified person, ascertained the person\u2019s identity, obtained the assistance of other officers, caravanned to the person\u2019s rural residence, went past no trespassing signs, knocked on the door and attempted to obtain the person\u2019s consent to search, and after he refused, kept him outside in cold weather for 20 to 45 minutes, -without permitting him to reenter his residence to obtain a coat, before arresting him); <em>see </em>cases collected in 60 A.L.R. 5th 1, \u00a7 11, discussing reasonable expectation of privacy in driveways, when no trespassing sign posted on or near driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Appellant relies on <em>Beale v. State, </em>230 Md. 182, 186 A.2d 213 (1962) and <em>Brown v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 22, 540 A.2d 143 (1988), but they do not support his position. In <em>Beale, </em>a police officer entered an enclosed back yard, without permission, and observed the defendant throw narcotics paraphernalia from a window when another police officer approached the front door. The facts in that case are clearly distinguishable from the case before us, where the officers walked through an open area to the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In <em>Brown, </em>police officers entered the property in question to investigate a report of illegal activity. This Court stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>it was proper to enter the property for that purpose, noting that the front door area was entitled to extremely limited Fourth Amendment protection because the defendant was not entitled to an expectation of privacy in an area in which the public was welcome. The police did invade the defendant\u2019s rights, however, when after receiving <em>no </em>answer to their knock, they entered a back yard, enclosed by a stockade type fence, and which was used for both outdoor eating and laundering clothes. <em>Brown, 75 </em>Md.App. at 34, 540 A.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">2. Validity of Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Appellant next contends that Ms. Jones \u201ccould only have reasonably concluded that she had no choice but to agree to the police \u2018requests\u2019 \u201d to search. We disagree and conclude that once the officers were lawfully on the property, Ms. Jones voluntarily consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">It is well settled that a warrantless search is per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions, one of which is a search conducted pursuant to consent. <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 334, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006) (citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)). For consent to search to be effective, it must have been given freely and voluntarily. <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 334, 893 A.2d 1018 (citing <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041). Consent may be given by a third party having common authority over the property, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974), or having apparent authority to consent. <em>See Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 187-89, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). Ultimately, to determine whether the State met its burden of proving that effective consent was given, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 334, 893 A.2d 1018 (citing <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041). See <em>Scott, </em>366 Md. at 140-45, 782 A.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In the case sub judice, both Detective Lee and Detective Johns testified that after asking Ms. Jones if there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>somewhere that they could speak to her, she suggested the building next door to the house. Ms. Jones, who was \u201cvery friendly\u201d and \u201cwilling to talk\u201d to the officers, opened the door to the building and told the officers to \u201ccome on in.\u201d After asking Ms. Jones about the car that her mother had rented, Ms. Jones told the officers that it was in the other building. Ms. Jones said that she would not mind if the officers observed the vehicle, but that she had to get the key to the building, which she did. After retrieving the key, Ms. Jones \u201clet [the officers] in\u201d the building, and subsequently retrieved the key to the car located in that building. Under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that consent was freely and voluntarily given. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is, essentially, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that \u201cthe shooter must have been the passenger in the car and that [a]ppellant must have been the passenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">When, as here, an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence, and will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(c). The standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); see <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003). We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] findings of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 488, 855 A.2d 1220 (2004) <em>(citing McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675 (1997)), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998) <em>quoting State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994)). \u201cWe do not measure the weight of the evidence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>rather we concern ourselves only with whether the verdict was supported with sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d 675 <em>(citing Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478-79, 649 A.2d 336).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">In this case, there was substantial circumstantial evidence tending to demonstrate that appellant was the shooter. Appellant\u2019s DNA was found in the victim\u2019s pocket, linking him to the crime scene. After hearing testimony, resolving conflicting evidence, and assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the court concluded that \u201cmost of the time,\u201d appellant and Ms. Jones were in the car together, and \u201call but one time [appellant] was the passenger and she was the driver.\u201d The court further found that a person shooting from the driver\u2019s side would have to assume an unnatural position in order to fire the gun in the necessary trajectory. Furthermore, boxes of .45 caliber bullets and spent slugs, consistent with the ammunition used to shoot the victim, were found on appellant\u2019s property, although no .45 caliber handgun was found, suggesting that appellant disposed of the evidence. Moreover, the vehicle containing blood stains and a bullet hole was found on appellant\u2019s property. Thus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for second-degree murder, or, at the very least, as an accomplice thereto. <em>See, e.g., State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 598 (1992) (noting that \u201cwhen two or more persons participate in a criminal offense, each is responsible for the commission of the offense.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">. The correct spelling is \u201cWebb.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. In <em>Katz, </em>the Supreme Court held that the defendant had an expectation of privacy in a telephone booth while making a call. The defendant\u2019s call was monitored through an electronic device. The Court observed that the defendant was entitled to assume that his words would not be \u201cbroadcast to the world.\u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 351-52, 88 S.Ct. 507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">. In <em>Ciraolo, </em>police officers, from an airplane flying in navigable space, observed growing marijuana in a fenced garden behind a residence. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15, 106 S.Ct. 1809. The Supreme Court stated that even though the garden may have been within the curtilage, that did not bar police observation of areas that could be observed by any member of the public flying in navigable space, because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to such surveillance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. The defendant was ultimately arrested inside of the house, having fled when the police arrived. The Court held the officers were entitled to hot pursuit, and the arrest was lawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">. The <em>Davis </em>court, in sustaining a mid-day encounter, stated, \"[ajbsent express orders from the person in possession against any possible trespass, there is no rule of private or public conduct which makes it illegal per se, or a condemned invasion of the person\u2019s right of privacy, for anyone openly and peaceably, at high noon, to walk up the steps and knock on the front door of any man\u2019s \u2018castle\u2019 with the honest intent of asking questions of the occupant thereof\u2014whether the questioner be a pollster, a salesman, or an officer of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">. In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant was in a motel room, and he did not challenge the right of the police officer to be in the common areas. The right to approach a dwelling is not limited to multiple dwelling units separated by common areas, however. The Scott Court cited <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>544 A.2d 1277, 1280 (Me.1988) with approval, in which a private dwelling was involved, including its statement that an owner impliedly invites those with a legitimate social or business purpose to intrude upon the owner's property. Additionally, courts recognizing the knock and talk rule have generally applied it to private residences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
