This appeal arises out of a tort claim, in which appellants allege that appellees, Advance Contracting, Inc. and Timothy Nickels, negligently repaired the roof of appellants\u2019 premises, thereby clogging a roof drain that ultimately resulted in a flood of their premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">On March 18, 2005, appellants filed suit against appellees in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City; appellees answered the Complaint on May 6, 2005. Appellees then filed a Third Party Complaint on August 9, 2005 against Crown Industrial Park (Crown), the owner of the property where appellants\u2019 premises are located. Crown, however, was never served with the Third Party Complaint. On September 21, 2005, the Third Party Complaint was amended to add Wayne Kirchner, the property manager of Crown, as a defendant/third-party plaintiff. The Amended Third Party Complaint alleged that Kirchner\u2019s negligence caused or contributed to the flood and, thus, he should be liable for any damages awarded to appellants. Kirchner filed his Answer on December 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Prior to the commencement of trial, appellants and appellees agreed to a jury trial on the issue of liability only. On August 30, 2006, a three-day trial began. At the conclusion of the third day, the jury returned a judgment in favor of appellees. Thereafter, appellants filed a timely Motion for New Trial and for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. The Motion was denied on September 23, 2006. This timely appeal followed, presenting for this Court three questions, which we have rephrased as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>1. Did the trial court err in permitting cross-examination of appellants\u2019 witnesses with prior inconsistent statements made to their property insurance carrier and regarding their relationship with their property insurance carrier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting certified copies of weather reports from Baltimore-Washington International Airport to show rain accumulations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">3. Did the trial court err in denying appellants\u2019 Motion for New Trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We answer the questions presented in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Since 1997, appellants have occupied a commercial leasehold space at 56N of the Crown Industrial Park located on Eastern Avenue in Baltimore, Maryland. Crown is the owner and landlord of this property located within the Crown Industrial Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The building at 56N has an \u201cA\u201d frame roof, in which the center line of the roof runs parallel to the front of the building. There are other buildings in the industrial park which adjoin appellants\u2019 premises on both sides and in the back. Consequently, when water falls on the back part of the roof, the water flows downward, until it accumulates at the bottom of the roof. As a result, two drains were installed in the low area of the back portion of the roof to allow any accumulated water to drain.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">During the winter of 2001 to 2002, appellants\u2019 premises, located below the low point on the back of the roof, began to leak. For the thirty years preceding this leak, Crown had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>experienced any roofing problems. After being notified of the leak, Kirchner told Anders Johansson, the president and principal of both appellants, that permanent repair work would need to be completed during the spring. In the meantime, a temporary system of troughs was put into place to catch the leaking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">By mid-April of 2002, Crown had contracted with appellees to repair the roof. Thereafter, appellees installed an asphalt roof on the 56N building including the area near the drains. George Harris, one of appellees\u2019 employees, supervised the job and performed much of the work. He testified that the drains on the roof were protected during the repair work with the use of \u201cmicrosopic/KWRAPD,\u201d a roofing industry product, commonly referred to as a \u201cmop head or yard.\u201d These protective products were placed over the drains to prevent clogging. One of the drains, however, was clogged prior to appellees beginning work. Appellees notified Crown of this clogged drain and were told by Crown that it would take care of the problem. On April 15, 2002, appellees completed the job without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On May 2, 2002, after a heavy rainfall, Preston Fulk, one of appellants\u2019 employees, reported water leaking along the back wall of the premises that had formed into a pool of water approximately eight inches deep. The employee began moving equipment and materials away from the water and called Johansson to inform him of the leak. Johansson instructed the employee to contact Kirchner. Kirchner went onto the roof of the building to inspect the leak. Near the back wall of the roof, Kirchner found water that was in areas eighteen inches deep. He also noticed that one of the drains was clogged and subsequently removed approximately two handfuls of debris, including one or two bottles from the drain. When the drain still would not allow water to flow, Kirchner used a piece of wooden molding in an attempt to free the drain. Shortly thereafter, the drain gave way and thousands of gallons of water poured into appellants\u2019 premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Kirehner helped remove the water from appellants\u2019 premises. Afterward, he testified that he found a broken piece of pipe filled with gravel and a mixture of old and new tar. The following day, Johansson conducted his own investigation of the water damage. Johansson testified that, during his investigation, he observed an elbow joint pipe filled with a mixture of old and new tar lying on the floor below the roof drain in the ceiling. All testimony at trial indicated that the distinction between old and new tar is its color\u2014old tar is gray and oxidized, while new tar is dark black on the outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">During Johansson\u2019s investigation, he took thirty to forty photographs of the scene of the damage and made important notes. Johansson, however, did not take a photograph of the elbow pipe. The elbow pipe and the notes regarding the elbow pipe were subsequently discarded during clean-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Three days after the flood, Johansson composed a letter to appellants\u2019 insurer, The Hartford Fire Insurance Company (Hartford), regarding the loss and, in relevant part, wrote: In discussing this claim with ... (our agent) he noted that it is not up for subrogation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">You know as well as I know that the landlord\u2019s appointed manager (Wayne) [Kirehner] poked the hole in the pipe that caused the damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">I like that you subrogate this claim, since it will otherwise stay on my \u201cinsurability profile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">A provision in the lease between Crown and appellants, however, barred a direct claim against Crown.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">During the year following the flood, appellants made a claim under the property damage portion of their Commercial &amp; Comprehensive General Liability (CGL) policy with Hartford. The insurance company paid most of the claim, but failed to pay all of appellants\u2019 business interruption claim. Appellants subsequently sued Hartford in Baltimore City Circuit Court for the balance of their business interruption loss. Hartford moved the case to federal district court where it claimed that a \u201cProof of Loss,\u201d which appellants had executed, was an accord and satisfaction of the claim. The federal district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>agreed and appellants appealed. The appeal was ultimately settled for a nominal amount and Hartford released its subrogation claim as part of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Almost three years after the flood, in 2005, appellants brought suit in Baltimore City Circuit Court against appellees. Before trial commenced, the court granted appellants\u2019 Motion to Bifurcate so that no issues would be presented to the jury regarding damages. During the three-day jury trial, appellees, over the objection of appellants, introduced into evidence the letter from Johansson to Hartford. Appellees, also over the objection of appellants, cross-examined appellants\u2019 witnesses regarding that correspondence and the lack of success appellants had achieved in pursuing claims against Crown and Hartford. In addition, appellants objected to the weather data records compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Station at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport that were introduced into evidence without an explanation of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">On September 1, 2006, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. Appellants subsequently filed a Motion for New Trial and for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, which was later denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Appellants initially contend that the circuit court erred in allowing appellees to introduce Johansson\u2019s note to Hartford into evidence. Appellants further aver that the court improperly permitted cross-examination of their witnesses regarding their relationship and insurance coverage with Hartford, thereby violating the collateral source rule. Appellees, in rejoinder, argue that appellants\u2019 witness, Johansson, was properly questioned regarding his prior inconsistent statement contained in the note to Hartford. Appellees also insist that the factual chronology elicited through the cross-examination of appellants\u2019 witnesses regarding appellants\u2019 unsuccessful recovery against Hartford explained appellants\u2019 new motiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tion to pursue a claim against appellees almost three years after the flood. Upon our review of the proceedings below, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting appellants\u2019 witness to be impeached by prior inconsistent statements and we conclude that there was no violation of the collateral source rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cGenerally, the standard of review with respect to a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is that such matters are left to the sound discretion of the trial court and unless there is a showing that the trial court abused its discretion, \u2018its [ruling] will not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., </em>398 Md. 67, 82, 919 A.2d 1177 (2007) (quoting <em>Bern-Shaw Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>377 Md. 277, 291, 833 A.2d 502 (2003)) (brackets in original). The application of that standard depends on \u201cwhether the trial judge\u2019s ruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Bern-Shaw, </em>377 Md. at 291, 833 A.2d 502. If the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a pure legal question, we will review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. Id.; see also Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005) (concluding that, in a criminal case, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude hearsay is not discretionary and is thus reviewed <em>de </em>novo). Given that the trial judge\u2019s ruling under our review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors, we shall review the legal questions presented at bar using the abuse of discretion standard of review. Moreover, as we reiterated in <em>Lomax v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>88 Md.App. 50, 54, 591 A.2d 1311 (1991), we will only reverse upon a finding that a trial judge\u2019s determination was \u201cboth manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Prior to addressing Johansson\u2019s correspondence with Hartford before the jury, appellees\u2019 counsel approached the bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and advised the court of his intention to cross-examine Johansson regarding his prior inconsistent statement made to Hartford, in which he blamed Crown for appellants\u2019 loss and requested legal pursuit of Crown to preserve appellants\u2019 insurance status. Appellees\u2019 counsel also proffered that he planned to cross-examine Johansson about the fact that there was a three-year delay in any assertion of negligence against appellees; these claims were pursued only after appellants\u2019 claims against Crown and Harford were unfavorably resolved. Appellants objected to the proposed line of cross-examination, protesting that it was \u201ctotally improper for a party to bring issues of insurance in a case like this.\u201d The trial judge, however, ruled that this was not an instance where appellees were insinuating that appellants had already been \u201cfully paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The court, after reviewing the Johansson correspondence and listening to the arguments of counsel, found that \u201cthe critical issue of the case\u201d was whether Johansson did in fact observe an elbow joint pipe clogged with fresh tar lying on the ground the day following the flood. Consequently, the court permitted the cross-examination of Johansson regarding his inconsistent statements and the fact that appellants waited three years before initiating suit against appellees. The court, <em>sua sponte, </em>treated appellants\u2019 objections to appellees\u2019 proposed line of questioning as a Motion <em>in Limine </em>by appellants and denied it. Johansson was then cross-examined and the testimony in dispute has been reproduced in pertinent part below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: Q. You had insurance on your property in the building, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: You had insurance on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">Q. And one concern you had\u2014you were familiar with something called an insurability profile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Q. The fact is: If you had too many claims, you may lose your insurance; the rates may go up; you may not be able to get insurance, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">A. That could be one description, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Q. You also knew\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: Can I have a continuing objection on this line of questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">THE COURT: You may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: You also knew that if you had a claim and are able to have it be somebody else\u2019s fault, someone that the insurance company could get the money back from, that would not go on your insurability profile, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHE\">A. I wasn\u2019t sure of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Q. Let me show you what has been marked as Defense Exhibit 17. Tell me if you can identify it. (Whereupon there was a pause in the proceedings.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">Q. What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">A. It\u2019s a letter to an insurance company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">Q. Who wrote it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">A. Me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">Q. That he [sic] was the date on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-18\">A. May the 6th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-19\">Q. Would you please read it to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-20\">A. \u201cSuit. In discussing this claim with Mr. Heartly [sic], our agent, he noted that it is not up for subrogation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au1\">Q. Let me ask you, subrogation you knew is a principal [sic] by which the insurance company goes after the person that caused the claim, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-22\">Q. In your deposition you said it\u2019s making the guilty party pay, correct? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-23\">A. I wouldn\u2019t say guilty. Responsible party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-24\">Q. Please continue. I won\u2019t interrupt again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>A. \u201cYou knew as well as I know that the landlord appointed the manager to put the hole in the point that caused the break. I like that you subrogated this claim since it would otherwise stay on my insurability profile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Q. So it is true that as of May 6th, 2002\u2014at least based upon that letter\u2014the person that you considered responsible for the flood was Mr. Kirchner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">A. Yes. From what I knew at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">Q. And you copied\u2014you were already represented by Mr. Chaifetz [appellee\u2019s counsel] at the time, were you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">A. Mr. Chaifetz is my lawyer for many years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">Q. You copied him on that letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: Your Honor, I introduce Exhibit 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIA\">[Kirchner\u2019s counsel]: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acu\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: Now, you subsequently did make a claim against your insurance company for damages; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">[Appellants\u2019 counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel]: Incidentally, you found out at some point that under your lease agreement, you couldn\u2019t sue your landlord?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-17\">Q. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-19\">Q. And your lease says you can\u2019t do it. The landlord is not responsible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-20\">A. I knew that all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-21\">Q. You knew that? So you made the claim against your insurance company, but that didn\u2019t end satisfactorily. There was a dispute as to what the proper payment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>be and you felt felt [sic]. It hadn\u2019t been handled correctly, so you sued the insurance company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">Q. And ultimately, you lost that case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">A. No, we settled the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Q. Well, you settled it for this much, correct\u2014compared to what you were looking for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">A. It was the best deal we could make under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Q. On a percentage basis, without getting into numbers, what percentage of what you were looking for did you settle for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">A. How can I answer you that without giving a number?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5l\">Q. You don\u2019t. Just give a percentage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">A. I can\u2019t give a percentage because that\u2019s a number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">Q. One service of a hundred dollars is just one percent of the number, but whether it is a thousand dollars, $10,000 or $1, one percent is one percent. We don\u2019t have to give the numbers because of a certain ruling by the Court. But what is the percentage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact it is a very, very small percentage, what you settled for in terms of what you were looking for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATt\">A. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: May I approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">THE COURT: You may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-18\">(Whereupon the parties approached the bench and the following proceeding ensued on the record).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-19\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-20\">Q.

It\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Q. And it is after it resolved that you filed your lawsuit against my client, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">A. As supervisors [sic], we heard that your client was responsible. We attempted to find him and serve him, but we spent a couple of years trying to find him, but we couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">Q. I see. That\u2019s the delay. It took a couple of years to sue my client because you didn\u2019t know who had done the roofing work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">A. No. Well, that we knew. But to get hold of him to discuss it with him was impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">Q. I see. Assume you sent him some letters? I assume there is some written evidence of the assertion you are just making now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">A. I think we have the private detective that went out to his last given address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">Q. After you filed suit is what you\u2019re talking about, sir; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">Q. Do you have any written documentation or does [appellants\u2019 counsel] have any written documentation to back up what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">A. You\u2019d have to ask [appellants\u2019 counsel] that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Appellants argue that the mention of insurance during Johansson\u2019s cross-examination contaminated the trial, resulting in a fatal error and they point to the holding of <em>Morris v. Weddington, </em>320 Md. 674, 681, 579 A.2d 762 (1990), to the effect that \u201c[o]ur cases generally prohibit the slightest references in front of the jury primarily because such reference is irrelevant and has no bearing on the issue of damage\u201d to advance its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Maryland Rule 5-411 delineates the general rule regarding admission of evidence of liability insurance to show negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaG\">Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is well-established that evidence of a party\u2019s insurance is not permitted to show the ability or inability to pay and is, furthermore, not relevant to the proceeding as it may prejudice the jury\u2019s consideration of damages. <em>See Morris, </em>320 Md. 674, 579 A.2d 762. Maryland case law and Md. Rule 5-411, however, have carved exceptions out of the general prohibition against admitting evidence regarding a party\u2019s liability insurance. <em>See Snowhite v. State, Use of Tennant, </em>243 Md. 291, 221 A.2d 342 (1966). In <em>Snowhite, </em>the Court set forth and examined exceptions to the rule. Two of these exceptions are relevant in the case <em>sub judice: </em>\u201cthe fact of insurance may be relevant as bearing upon the credibility of a witness\u201d and \u201can admission of a party bearing on negligence or damages may include a reference to the fact of insurance which cannot be severed without substantially lessening the evidential value of this admission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 221 A.2d 342 (quoting McCormick of Evidence \u00a7 168, p. 356). While these two exceptions are applicable, the trial judge did not have to rely on the exceptions because the cross-examination of Johansson did not involve his insurance coverage, but instead only referenced appellants\u2019 communication with their own insurance carrier. Thus, we hold that the mention of insurance was to impeach Johansson\u2019s prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Appellants further argue that an analysis of the cross-examination shows that appellees\u2019 counsel did not impeach Johansson\u2019s testimony. Appellants claim that the line of questioning regarding Johansson\u2019s initial belief that Kirchner was responsible for the flood was not proper and that, even assuming it was proper, it was not developed. We disagree. The correspondence that was read into evidence directly contradicts Johansson\u2019s assertion that he initially believed appellees were at fault after allegedly finding the joint elbow pipe. In the note to Harford, Johansson blames Kirchner, writing: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cYou know as well as I know that the landlords [sic] appointed manager [Kirchner] poked the hole in the pipe that caused the damage.\u201d Moreover, Johansson not only maintains that Kirchner was responsible for the damage sustained, but even urged his insurance company to pursue Crown for subrogation. We disagree with appellants\u2019 assertion that an inquiry into Johansson\u2019s initial belief as to who was responsible would only even arguably be proper if appellants had first sued Mr. Kirchner, given that a provision in the lease agreement between Crown and appellees barred this type of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">A juror, hearing the contents of the letter and, upon learning that appellants were unable to sue their landlord for the flood damage, may conclude that Johansson did not see any new tar in the elbow joint and had only later, contrary to his direct testimony, formulated the opinion that appellees were at fault after all other avenues of recovery had proven unsuccessful. Given this inference, the court allowed appellees, through cross-examination, to show the chronology of the shift in appellants\u2019 focus for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Appellees impeached the alleged observation of the clogged elbow joint pipe on several grounds throughout trial. They elicited varying descriptions of the elbow joint pipe from appellants\u2019 witnesses, one describing the joint as intact and another describing it as shattered in pieces. Furthermore, the only photograph of the elbow joint showed it still connected to the other pipes near the ceiling of the warehouse and not on the ground as Johansson had described. Johansson also testified that, the day after the flood, he found an elbow joint pipe lying on the ground above the drain pipe in the ceiling. He claimed that the elbow joint was filled with old and new tar. Johansson then immediately suspected appellees as the cause of the flood. During his investigation, Johansson contemporaneously photographed the entire scene, but failed to photograph the elbow joint. Because of his suspicion that appellees were the cause of the flood, Johansson documented his observations of the elbow joint pipe in notes. The notes and the elbow joint pipe at issue, however, were subsequently destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Continuing to impeach appellants\u2019 evidence relative to the \u201ccritical issue\u201d of the case, appellees remarked that, after immediately concluding appellees were at fault, Johansson wrote a letter to Hartford insisting that Kirchner poked a hole in the drain pipe that caused the water damage. In the letter, Johansson requested that Hartford pursue Crown in subrogation to preserve his company\u2019s insurance record. A claim for subrogation against Crown, however, was barred by the lease provision. In the year following the flood, Hartford paid most of. appellants\u2019 property claim, but failed to pay all of its business interruption claim. Consequently, appellants brought suit against Hartford. After losing at trial, appellants and Hartford settled on appeal for a nominal amount and on the condition that Hartford release its subrogation claim as part of the settlement agreement. Appellees finished its sequential timeline by pointing out that, after the litigation with Hartford ended unsatisfactorily, appellants sued appellees alleging negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The chronological timeline evidences, in our view, why the reference to appellants\u2019 insurance carrier was relevant and probative to \u201cthe critical issue of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">COLLATERAL SOURCE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Appellants further submit that the cross-examination ran afoul of the collateral source rule. The collateral source rule \u201cpermits an injured person to recover the full amount of his or her provable damages, regardless of the amount of compensation which the person has received for his injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Haischer v. CSX Transp., Inc. </em>381 Md. 119, 134, 848 A.2d 620 (2004) (holding that \u201ccollateral source evidence is substantively inadmissible is consistent with decisions of this Court regarding such evidence\u201d); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 920A (1979). Appellees acknowledge that there are circumstances where the insurance status of a plaintiff may raise collateral source concerns, but aver that Johansson\u2019s cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>does not raise such a concern. Instead, appellees contend that appellees\u2019 counsel properly questioned Johansson about his lack of success in pursuing collateral sources. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellants conclude that \u201ca defendant could not in a tort case, such as this one, introduce evidence of the fact that the plaintiff had received insurance payments from a policy for which he had paid,\u201d relying on <em>Haischer </em>to support its proposition. In <em>Haischer, </em>however, the Court of Appeals analyzed whether the railroad company could introduce post-injury benefits after it claimed that its employee, suing under the Federal Boiler Inspection Act, 49 U.S.C. 20701, made a claim of financial distress and demonstrated malingering. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 848 A.2d 620. The Court reviewed potential exceptions to the collateral source doctrine and determined that disproving allegations of financial distress and malingering were not applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 848 A.2d 620. Thus, <em>Haischer </em>makes clear that collateral source evidence may at times be admissible to attack damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Despite the rationale and holding of <em>Haischer, </em>the case is not determinative of the issue <em>sub judice. </em>Johansson was not cross-examined on the issue of damages, but impeached regarding a prior inconsistent statement. Nowhere in the record does appellees\u2019 counsel imply that appellants had already received compensation for their damages and, thus, should not be compensated again. The court instead allowed the line of questioning to suggest that appellants changed their theory for recovery, three years after the flood, only after they were unsuccessful in pursuing their claims against Crown and Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Appellees attempt to bolster their collateral source argument by asserting that the bifurcated nature of the trial, whereby no issues regarding damages were presented to the jury, undermines any claim of prejudice. Appellants counter that the mention of insurance and the fact that appellants received payment, even if only partial, from Hartford is always harmful because \u201cit paints the plaintiff as a party which is trying to obtain an improper (at least in the jury\u2019s eyes) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>double recovery.\u201d Regardless of whether appellants\u2019 damages were at issue, the collateral source rule was not implicated. The purpose of the cross-examination was to impeach Johansson\u2019s credibility by pointing out his prior inconsistent statement and not to suggest that appellants were \u201cpartially paid.\u201d Furthermore, appellants brought suit against appellees only after litigation ended unsatisfactorily with Hartford. This, coupled with the fact that, amid appellants\u2019 forty photographs and documented notes that there was no physical evidence to corroborate their witnesses\u2019 claims that a joint elbow pipe clogged with new tar existed, rebuts \u201cthe critical issue\u201d in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Finally, appellees argue that appellants had the opportunity to request a collateral source instruction, but failed to do so. Appellees claim that the instruction could have been modified to inform the jury that its determination of the liability issues should not be affected by an inference or testimony regarding potential recoveries by appellants from collateral sources. Appellants contend that, because appellees opened \u201cthe insurance Pandora\u2019s Box,\u201d they were only obligated to object to the testimony and not to cure it with a pattern instruction. As stated previously, there was no prejudice to appellants from appellees mention of their insurance carrier. Consequently, the issue of who, if anyone, should have requested a modified pattern instruction regarding the collateral source rule is not determinative of the issue <em>sub judice. </em>We, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the impeachment of Johansson through his prior inconsistent statement an d in allowing appellees to question appellants\u2019 motivation to pursue litigation three years after the flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Appellants, in their second issue, contend that the circuit court erred in allowing the introduction of weather records into evidence without an expert to explain the information contained therein. Appellees counter that weather reports regarding amounts of rainfall were properly admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In their case, appellees offered certified copies of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s weather records for the Baltimore-Washington International Airport reporting rain patterns at the airport between the day of the roofing job, April 15, 2002, and the date of the flooding, May 2, 2002. Appellants objected to appellees\u2019 proffer of evidence, protesting that the distance between BWI Airport and its premises at 56N was approximately ten miles and, thus, too great a distance for a jury to speculate as to whether it had also rained at appellants\u2019 place of business. The court found that appellants\u2019 argument went to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility and admitted the weather records.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on whether or not to admit the weather records is also governed by the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Hall v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., </em>398 Md. 67, 82, 919 A.2d 1177 (2007). The trial judge\u2019s determination is given broad latitude and is not disturbed on appeal unless abused. <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 104, 118, 481 A.2d 250 (1984). The trial court\u2019s ruling admitting the weather reports was a proper exercise of its discretion. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">First, the issue in dispute is whether appellees negligently clogged the drain during their installation of the asphalt roof. Appellees offered weather records indicating that the airport received over three and a half inches of rain between April 16 and May 1, including two days, April 18 and April 28, of rain accumulations greater than one inch. Appellees offered the records showing this significant rainfall between April 16 and May 1 as circumstantial evidence that their conduct did not cause the damage in question, but that some other intervening cause was at fault. As such, the records were probative to rebut appellants\u2019 claim that appellees negligently repaired the building\u2019s roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Secondly, upon reviewing the documents, although lengthy, we agree that the records were not complicated or outside of the ordinary layperson\u2019s knowledge. In fact, the last column of the chart clearly denotes precipitation totals for the day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In appellants\u2019 brief, they argue that the thirty-page exhibit \u201ccontains literally thousands of measurements which were beyond the ability of the lay jurors to understand without the assistance of an expert\u201d and thus, pursuant to Md. Rule 5-702, an expert should have assisted the jury in understanding the meaning of the weather records. There is, however, no authority for appellants\u2019 assertion that an expert opinion is needed to interpret or explain the recorded rainfall amounts contained within a weather report.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">To support their assertion that expert testimony was needed, appellants cite the unreported decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in <em>Schultz v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>1989 WL 64725 (N.D.Ill. June 8, 1989). In <em>Schultz, </em>the plaintiff sought to introduce evidence of a weather report available to the airline before the aircraft took off showing turbulence in the area. The plaintiff contended that the airline should have known that there was heavy turbulence in the area and that therefore, the aircraft should have remained grounded. The court did not, as appellants suggest, refuse to allow the plaintiff to introduce the weather reports in the absence of expert testimony, but instead found that the weather report of heavy thunderstorms and wind, without an expert to show a standard of care violation by the airline, did not by itself create a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"AeU\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing appellees to enter the weather records into evidence. The records were not beyond a layperson\u2019s understanding as they merely quantified rainfall at a given location. The fact that the airport was approximately ten miles from appellants\u2019 premise does not go to the admissibility of the evidence, but to the weight of the evidence. In sum, the admission of the weather records was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In their last argument, appellants assert that the circuit court erred when it denied appellants\u2019 Motion for New Trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>by re-arguing the grounds advanced in their first two questions presented for our review. For the reasons we have stated, <em>supra, </em>and our discussion in this section, we hold that the circuit court properly denied appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Maryland Rule 2-533 provides that a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling is ordinarily not reviewable on appeal. <em>Brinand (Brenan) v. Denzik, </em>226 Md. 287, 173 A.2d 203 (1961); <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 600, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984) (An appellate court does \u201cnot generally disturb the exercise of a trial court\u2019s discretion in denying a motion for new trial.\u201d). As the Court of Appeals iterated in <em>Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, </em>328 Md. 51, 59, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992), \u201c[b]ecause the exercise of discretion under these circumstances depends so heavily upon the unique opportunity the trial judge has to closely observe the entire trial, complete with nuances, inflections, and impressions never to be gained from a cold record, it is a discretion that will rarely, if ever, be disturbed on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Appellants assert that errors regarding the admission of statements made by Johansson to his insurer and the weather reports warrant a new trial. These two bases advanced by appellants are, as we have previously discussed, evidentiary determinations within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Therefore, appellants must prove that the trial judge abused his discretion twice\u2014once when he allowed the admission of the said evidence and then again, when he denied appellants\u2019 Motion for New Trial. We hold that appellants fail on both accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The trial court properly permitted the cross-examination of Johansson\u2019s inconsistent statements. The cross-examination was probative in that it questioned appellants\u2019 motivation to pursue litigation against appellees only after all other avenues of financial recovery had been foreclosed. Appellees never suggested that appellants had been satisfied in whole or in part through their insurance carrier or prior litigation to implicate a collateral source issue. Additionally, the trial court properly admitted certified records from a government agency clearly indicating rainfall amounts in the Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>area during the relevant period. The circuit court did not err in denying appellants\u2019 motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">.
