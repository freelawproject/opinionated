On appeal, appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">1. Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress appellant\u2019s statement to police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in removing juror number 8?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">3. Did the trial court commit plain error by failing to take any action when the State commented on appellant\u2019s demeanor during rebuttal closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">4. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in propounding the pattern jury instruction on flight?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">We shall answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 4 and reverse and remand for a new trial. For the benefit of the trial court on remand, we will address question 1, because it relates to the admissibility of appellant\u2019s statement to the police. A new trial, however, obviates the necessity of answering questions 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">This case arises out of an incident that took place on June 13, 2006. Kyle Phillips, who was sixteen years old at the time, testified at trial that in the early afternoon of June 13, 2006, he was at the MARC station in Germantown with his friends, Jonathon Bruff, Matthew Pedmonte, Thomas \u201cTony\u201d Rouse, Gary Schneider, and Ryan Schneider. They were BMX biking, or \u201c[tjrick riding.\u201d When another group of individuals walked by, one of them turned around and asked Phillips and Pedmonte: \u201cDo you have a dollar?\u201d Phillips testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>responded: \u201cNo, do you have a dollar?\u201d, after which members of the other group \u201cstarted getting hostile,\u201d saying \u201cso you want to fight us[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Phillips recounted that the group of individuals left Phillips and his friends, but returned ten or fifteen minutes later in a larger group, now comprising about ten individuals. The group approached Phillips and walked up to the bikes, \u201csay[ing] stuff like these are nice bikes, and starting] to pick them up.\u201d When someone picked up one of the more expensive bikes, Phillips \u201csaid something\u201d and \u201cthen [] got hit.\u201d Phillips identified appellant as one of the individuals in the larger group.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">According to Phillips, although appellant was with the others in the larger group, Phillips did not see appellant strike anyone directly. During the fight, however, when one of the victims picked up a wrench, appellant walked towards him, \u201clike he was going to hurt him,\u201d and said, \u201cyou put that wrench down now\u201d in a \u201cvery threatening way.\u201d The fight lasted for about five or ten minutes, after which the group of individuals started to walk away with the bikes belonging to Phillips and his friends. Phillips testified that appellant \u201cwas one without a bike.\u201d Gary Schneider, according to Phillips, asked appellant: \u201cHey, can we get our bikes back[?],\u201d to which appellant replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do about it, but I\u2019ll see.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant walked off towards the group and was seen talking to them. The bikes were not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">James Roberts testified that on June 13, 2006, he was with Maurice Graham and Steve Yax while they were on their way to 7-Eleven to meet appellant, after which they were going to take the bus to Lake Forest Mall. Roberts, who was fifteen years old at the time, was the individual who asked Phillips for a dollar, the cost of the bus fare to the mall. Phillips\u2019 response made Roberts angry, but all three proceeded to walk away from Phillips and his friends. When they got to 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Eleven, Yax told appellant, who was with his girlfriend, what happened and all five individuals walked back to the MARC station. Roberts testified that he did not see appellant during the fight. When they left the fight, Roberts testified that he remembered looking behind him and seeing appellant walking with his girlfriend. According to Roberts, about ten or fifteen minutes after the fight, the group was stopped by the police. In a statement to police, admitted into evidence at trial, Roberts stated that he and the others, including appellant, were involved in hitting the victims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Roberts also told police that the victims were ordered to empty their pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The group took two bikes and threw Phillips\u2019 bike over a bridge onto the railroad tracks below. In addition to the damage to his bike, Phillips had his wallet, which contained $10, taken from his back pocket during the fight. \u201cWhen the wallet was recovered, the $10 was missing. Rouse\u2019s cell phone, MP3 player, and wallet, which did not contain any money, were taken from him. The group also took $15 in cash and a $50 Best Buy gift card from Pedmonte.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Police caught up with appellant, Roberts, Yax, and Graham as they were walking through a nearby neighborhood to Lake Forest Mall. Other officers arrived with the victims to conduct a showup identification. The victims positively identified appellant and the three other individuals. A MP3 player, apparently belonging to Rouse, was found in Yax\u2019s pants pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">At the police station, appellant provided the following statement, which was introduced at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">I called Steve Yax, a black Spanish male, long hair, braids, on my phone. He told me to meet him at the 7-Eleven in Germantown. I took the bus and met him. He wasn\u2019t at the 7-Eleven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">I went to the train station and met Steve Yax. Steve asked me if I wanted to wreck[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">Steve told me he asked some young dude on the bike for a dollar. The dude got smart with Steve so Steve wanted to fight. I walked up to the 7-Eleven with Steve and saw the kids Steve was talking about. They were on bikes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Steve and the other guys I was with started fighting. I walked off. I walked up to the Rolling Hills with Steve. I don\u2019t know the other two kids I was with. They were black males. I guess they were friends of Steve\u2019s. One girl was \u2022with us. I don\u2019t know her name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">Steve was talking about robbing people. He taiks about robbing Hispanics because they have money and get drunk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">We will set forth additional facts and proceedings below as necessary to discuss the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">At the suppression hearing, Detective Mike Sofelkanik of the Montgomery County Police Department testified that on June 13, 2006, he met -with appellant, who was seated in an interrogation room in the office of the Germantown Investigative Station.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During his testimony, Detective Sofelkanik was questioned about what took place when he entered the room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af2\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay. When you initially identified yourself, what did you tell him with regard to why you were there and why he was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">[WITNESS]: I identified myself as a detective with the Montgomery County Police and that I wanted to discuss why he was there. He understood that he was under arrest and I wanted to\u2014I told him I was a finder of facts and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>just wanted to hear if he had anything to say, and if he wanted to talk to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And how did he respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">[WITNESS]: He agreed to speak to me, and then I advised him that prior to giving me any specifics on the case, I needed to advise him of his constitutional rights.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Can you walk us through\u2014you\u2019ve introduced yourself, you told him he was under arrest, that you were going to try to find some facts and then you begin to do what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">[WITNESS]: After he was aware of who I was and he felt, what I thought felt, comfortable and he knew who I was and kind of an ice breaker. Just to let him know that I was not the arresting officer. That he was there, that I would like to speak to him and he felt comfortable. It seemed like he was comfortable. I then advised him that I could not ask him any questions in reference to the case prior to reading him his Advice of Rights form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and how did he respond to you at that point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">[WITNESS]: He said\u2014basically I read the rights to him and he responded in a normal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay, would you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">[WITNESS]:\u2014fashion. Nothing out of the ordinary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right. Now when\u2014you testified on direct examination, number one that you told him that you were a \u201cfact finder\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, and that was before you read him the rights. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Didn\u2019t you tell [the prosecutor], on direct examination, \u201cI said I was a fact finder. I asked him if he wanted to speak to me. He said yes. And then I read him his rights.\u201d Didn\u2019t you say that on direct examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[WITNESS]: I asked him why\u2014I asked him that [sic] I was there, I was a \u201cfact finder\u201d and that my job was a detective and I had to read him these rights prior to asking him any questions about the event. Now as far as talking to him and asking if he wanted to talk to us prior to reading him that? It\u2019s very possible I said that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, all right, and he said, \u201cYes\u201d when you asked him if he wanted to talk to you. That\u2019s what you said to [the prosecutor] on direct right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">[WITNESS]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Detective Sofelkanik also testified as to the rights he read appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Detective, would you demonstrate for the Court how it is you advised [appellant] of his rights on June 13, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">[WITNESS]: Yes____ He\u2019s sitting across from me at a table and I advised him prior to me questioning him. I was required to advise him of his constitutional rights. That basically that I\u2019m not allowed to ask you any questions until I advise you of the following directions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">And I asked him if he understood that. He verbally stated that he did and then I proceeded to\u2014and we have a form, it\u2019s the Advice of Rights, it\u2019s the MCP-50 form. We don\u2019t stray from that. It\u2019s the same form that we use every time in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>According to Detective Sofelkanik, he read appellant his rights \u201cright from the form.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It appeared to the detective that appellant understood his rights, and when he specifically asked whether appellant understood what was just said to him, appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Detective Sofelkanik did not recall that appellant ever asked him to explain anything. When the detective finally asked appellant, \u201c[D]o you want to talk to us at this time[?],\u201d appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Thereafter, both Detective Sofelkanik and appellant signed the form. Detective Sofelkanik also put his initials next to each question that he read to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Regarding appellant\u2019s right to an attorney during questioning, Detective Sofelkanik testified that appellant said that \u201c[h]e did not want an attorney. He agreed to speak to us.\u201d When questioned, the detective further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Did he at any time during the course of your reading him his is [sic] MCP-50, State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 the Advice of Rights, or at any time thereafter, invoke his right to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">[WITNESS]: No, and again if he would ask for an attorney, at that point I would not continue the interview; I\u2019m required to provide him with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Did he agree to answer your questions without an attorney being present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">[WITNESS]: Yes. He did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Detective Sofelkanik testified that, after reading appellant the form, he wrote as appellant dictated a statement of what occurred on June 13, 2006. He testified further that after the statement was transcribed, appellant made a few corrections that both he and appellant initialed. Appellant then signed each page of the two-page statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellant testified that he was first handcuffed to a table and fingerprinted, and then placed in a holding cell for several hours prior being escorted to the interrogation room. According to appellant, when he was seated at a table during fingerprinting and while in the holding cell, he requested to call his mother, an attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now when you were seated at the table where they were taking fingerprints, did you make any requests to anybody in the police station? This is before you went into the holding cell. Did you make any requests to anybody about anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">[WITNESS]: Just to call my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And who [sic] did you make that request to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">[WITNESS]: One of the officers, I\u2019m not sure\u2014I don\u2019t remember the names or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you mention to one of those officers that your mother was a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And what did the officer say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADC\">[WITNESS]: That I\u2019m supposed to wait until after I go to CPU and see the commissioner and such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: How many times did you mention that, that you wanted to call your mother or you wanted them to call your mother before you were put in the holding cell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">[WITNESS]: Several times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right. In the holding cell, did somebody come to talk to you while you were still in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>[WITNESS]: Yeah, one of the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, was it the same one that took the fingerprints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[WITNESS]: I\u2019m not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">[WITNESS]: Fm not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Did you talk to that person that came to see you in the holding cell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">[WITNESS]: No, I just asked him some questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asg\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What questions did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">[WITNESS]: Like what was going on, and am I allowed to leave. Like, if everyone in the place says I didn\u2019t do anything, because I didn\u2019t do anything, they would let me out right there and she said, \u201cNo.\u201d And then I asked to call my mother\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">[WITNESS]: And then I asked to call\u2014mother\u2019s a lawyer and they said they can\u2019t do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right, and that\u2019s when you were in the holding cell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">[WITNESS]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is that a \u201cyes\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">On cross-examination, appellant testified that he could not remember whether he asked Detective Sofelkanik for his mother, an attorney, while he was in the interrogation room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYB\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: So when Detective Sofelkanik comes in, Detective Sofelkanik comes in, right, he introduced himself to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">[WITNESS]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: The detective that just testified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9D\">[WITNESS]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-19\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Did you tell him you wanted to speak to your mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-20\">[WITNESS]: Possibly, I don\u2019t really remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: You don\u2019t remember, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">[WITNESS]: I tried to block it out I guess. It was an unpleasant memory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: You don\u2019t know who you told that you wanted to speak to you [sic] mother; you don\u2019t know when you told them you wanted to speak to your mother and you wanted to speak to your mother because she\u2019s your mother, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">[WITNESS]: Yeah, and also she\u2019s a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">When questioned as to whether the officer informed appellant of his rights, appellant stated, \u201c[n]ot in particular. He probably did though.\u201d Appellant testified that he signed and initialed the statement dictated to Detective Sofelkanik and conceded that the detective was telling the truth that appellant reviewed and made changes to his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">When reviewing a circuit court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress evidence, we \u201cconsider only the facts and information contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Longshore v.

Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004) and <em>Cooper v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 70, 877 A.2d 1095 (2005), appellant argues that Detective Sofelkanik committed \u201ca patent violation\u201d of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), by asking appellant if appellant would agree to speak to him and answer questions prior to administering the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant contends that Detective Sofelkanik \u201ceffectively obtained from [a]ppellant his commitment to speak about the crime prior to advising [a]ppellant of his <em>[Miranda </em>rights].\u201d This commitment to speak, appellant argues, \u201ccreated the impression that the interrogation was underway and that the advice of rights to follow was a mere formality.\u201d Because a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s circumstances would have understood that the agreement to cooperate could not be revoked, appellant argues that his \u201csubsequent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights cannot be considered voluntary and the statement that followed should not have been admitted against him at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In response, the State asserts that <em>Seibert </em>and <em>Cooper </em>are inapplicable because Detective Sofelkanik \u201cnever asked any questions or elicited any incriminating statements from [appellant] prior to advising him of his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In denying the motion to suppress, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">I\u2019ve looked at the <em>Seibert </em>case. And it deals with, as you were saying, it deals with a situation where the police basically had a practice, they had a protocol where they would specifically not advise people prior to getting a confession. And then having gotten a confession, they would go ahead and do the advice of rights and then re-get the confession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">And so it really, as they say, it deals with the midstream recitation of warnings, after interrogation, unwarned confessions have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In our case the statement was made that [Detective Sofelkanik] was going to be asking [appellant] questions, and asked [appellant] if he would speak. But there was no confession. There was no interrogation. There was no followup to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">And I don\u2019t find that it was, as in the <em>Missouri v. Seibert </em>case, it was a willful protocol that the police used for the purpose of getting a confession. I don\u2019t find that anything the detective did was a willful violation of Miranda.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Custodial interrogation refers to \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a suspect is in custody, \u201c[p]rior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A person may waive the effectuation of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights, \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">It is well established that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required in the absence of interrogation. <em>Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 37, 807 A.2d 732 (2002) (citing <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980)); <em>see Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 173, 759 A.2d 327 (2000) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is clear ... that the special procedural safeguards outlined in <em>Miranda </em>are required not where a suspect is simply taken into custody, but rather where a suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682)). \u201cInterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>\u201crefers ... to any words or actions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. An incriminating response is one \u201cwhether inculpatory or exculpatory\u2014that the prosecution may seek to introduce at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The motions court in the instant case determined that there was \u201cno interrogation\u201d within the meaning of Miranda.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree. Detective Sofelkanik asked appellant only whether appellant \u201cwanted to talk to me.\u201d This question was not \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response,\u201d nor did it do so. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Appellant simply answered \u201cyes\u201d, at which point Detective Sofelkanik advised appellant that he could not ask appellant any questions until he advised appellant of his constitutional rights. It was only after Detective Sofelkanik (1) read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights using the MCP-50 form, (2) obtained appellant\u2019s acknowledgment that he understood those rights, and (3) learned that appellant was willing to talk, that Detective Sofelkanik questioned appellant about the incident. Moreover, Detective Sofelkanik testified that the purpose of his initial question was \u201ckind of an ice breaker.\u201d He said: \u201cJust to let [appellant] know that I was not the arresting officer. That he was there, that I would like to speak to him and he felt comfortable.\u201d Finally, we observe that Detective Sofelkanik\u2019s question also had a practical purpose\u2014if appellant had indicated no desire to talk, there would have been no realistic reason for Detective Sofelkanik to proceed with reading appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights in an effort to secure a statement. It would have been highly unlikely that, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>refusing to talk, appellant would have changed his mind upon being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Even assuming that <em>Miranda </em>applies to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that there was no violation of its procedural safeguards. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Seibert </em>and <em>Cooper </em>in this regard is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In <em>Seibert, </em>the Supreme Court struck down a two-step, \u201cquestion-first\u201d interrogation technique employed by police in that ease. 542 U.S. at 604, 612, 124 S.Ct. 2601. The police protocol at issue in <em>Seibert </em>called for the purposeful withholding of <em>Miranda </em>warnings until police interrogation produced a confession. <em>Id. </em>Following the confession, the police officer would administer the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then question the suspect again to elicit the same confession. <em>Id. </em>Although the first confession, obtained <em>pre-Miranda </em>warnings, was inadmissible, the second confession was ostensibly admissible in court. <em>Id. </em>The Court in <em>Seibert </em>held that, when such a strategy is used, the second confession must be suppressed \u201cbecause the midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession could not effectively comply with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>constitutional requirement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Similarly, in <em>Cooper, </em>the police conducted a two-stage interrogation technique when questioning the appellant. 163 Md. App. at 74, 877 A.2d 1095. The police obtained two statements during interrogation, the first unwarned and the second warned. <em>Id. </em>At trial, over the appellant\u2019s objection, the State introduced only the second, warned statement into evidence. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Seibert, </em>this Court reversed the appellant\u2019s murder and associated weapons convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 96, 877 A.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The case <em>sub judice </em>does not present the interrogation technique condemned by <em>Seibert </em>and <em>Cooper, </em>because Detective Sofelkanik did not use the \u201csuccessive interrogation\u201d strategy employed by the police in those cases. <em>See Seibert, 542 </em>U.S. at 613, 124 S.Ct. 2601; <em>Cooper, </em>163 Md.App. at 96, 877 A.2d 1095. Detective Sofelkanik never obtained an incriminating statement from appellant before he administered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, nor did he elicit that same incriminating statement again \u201con the heels <em>of </em>the unwarned statement.\u201d <em>See Cooper, </em>163 Md.App. at 96, 877 A.2d 1095. Nevertheless, appellant argues that Detective Sofelkanik\u2019s question had the effect of \u201cobtaining] from [a]ppellant his commitment to speak about the crime prior to advising [appellant of his <em>[Miranda </em>rights].\u201d The short answer to this contention is that there is no evidence in the record supporting the existence of such commitment. Appellant never testified that his affirmative response to Detective Sofelkanik\u2019s question somehow obligated him to talk to the police after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, asking appellant \u201cif he wanted to talk to\u201d Detective Sofelkanik prior to advising appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not a violation of <em>Miranda </em>under the teachings of <em>Seibert </em>and <em>Cooper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>Request for Mother, An Attorney</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">At the suppression hearing, appellant testified that, while being fingerprinted,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he made a request to an unnamed officer to \u201c[j]ust to call [his] mother\u201d and told the officer that his mother was an attorney. Appellant also testified that, prior to being placed in a holding cell, he asked to call his mother \u201c[s]everal times.\u201d Finally, appellant testified that, while inside the holding cell, he asked another officer if he could call his mother, saying, \u201cmother\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d and that the officer responded that he could not \u201cdo anything.\u201d Appellant, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>er, could not remember if he requested to speak to his mother, an attorney, when advised by Detective Sofelkanik of his right to an attorney before and during any questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Appellant argues that his statement to Detective Sofelkanik should have been suppressed because the trial judge\u2019s finding that appellant did not invoke his right to counsel was clearly erroneous. Appellant maintains that he \u201cplainly testified that he asked to call his mother\u2014an attorney\u2014several times prior to being placed in the interrogation room.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In denying the suppression motion, the court made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">All right. Well based upon the testimony that I\u2019ve heard regarding the Advice of Rights form, in looking at Exhibit No. 1, the detective testified about the procedure that he used and the procedure he followed in advising the rights, pursuant to this form MCP-50----\u2014it appears as though the detective followed the proper procedure in advising [appellant] of his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">... There has been, according to the detective, there was never an invocation of Right to Counsel; there was never any request to stop speaking. He described the conversation as very normal. He asked questions, [appellant] responded and I think he used the word that he was \u201cdictating\u201d and so he wrote down the statements as best he could that [appellant] made to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">After that he gave the statement to [appellant] for review. [Appellant] looked at it, actually made changes, initialed the changes, indicating to me that he understood the statement enough that he wanted the corrections and changes made to the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">... [Appellant] at one point on the stand said, and I don\u2019t believe he said clearly and specifically that he asked for a lawyer in this case. He said that his mom was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lawyer. He said that he asked to speak to his mom. He\u2019s not sure, he thinks he said that. He\u2019s not sure who he said it to, when he said it, where he was when he said it. So I\u2019m not certain that he\u2019s even certain that he said it. So based upon that I can\u2019t find, to the degree necessary, that he invoked counsel. Given the fact that I\u2019m not even certain that he\u2019s certain he said it. So for that reason I\u2019m going to find that <em>Miranda </em>was complied with and I\u2019ll find that the statement was voluntarily made by [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqI\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We give great deference to a hearing judge\u2019s factual findings, and we will not disturb them unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 581, 861 A.2d 62 (2004); <em>see also Matthews v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 725, 732, 666 A.2d 912 (1995) (\u201cIn considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to weighing and determining first-level facts.\u201d). Applying that standard to the record before us in the instant case, we conclude that there was sufficient support in the record for the motions court\u2019s factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The motions court determined that appellant was so uncertain as to whether he asked for an attorney that his claims were insufficient for a finding that there was a clear and specific request for counsel. Appellant could not recall to whom he made any of the requests to call his mother or whether all of his requests were made to the same officer. Appellant also could not recall if he asked Detective Sofelkanik if he could speak to his mother. Detective Sofelkanik testified that appellant never requested an attorney when he read appellant his Advice of Rights. Both appellant\u2019s general uncertainty and the unequivocal testimony of Detective Sofelkanik cast doubt on whether appellant ever invoked his right to counsel. Moreover, \u201c[i]t is the trial judge who determines the credibility of witnesses when, as in a suppression hearing, he functions as the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 686, 690, 566 A.2d 131 (1989). The trial judge determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>appellant was not a credible witness, stating \u201cI don\u2019t believe [appellant] said clearly and specifically that he asked for a lawyer.\u201d The trial judge explained: \u201cHe\u2019s not sure who he said it to, when he said it, where he was when he said it. So I\u2019m not certain that he\u2019s even certain that he said it.\u201d Therefore, there is \u201ccompetent evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual finding[]\u201d that appellant never invoked his right to counsel. <em>See Fuge v. Fuge, </em>146 Md.App. 142, 180, 806 A.2d 716 (2002) (\u201cIf there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Nevertheless, appellant asserts that the trial court was clearly erroneous because appellant\u2019s <em>\u201conly </em>uncertainty\u201d in invoking his right to counsel \u201cpertained to whether he had asked <em>Detective Sofelkanik </em>if he could place a telephone call to his mother.\u201d Appellant contends that, although he \u201cdid not remember the names of the individual officers to whom he made the requests, [ ] he never wavered in his account that the requests were repeatedly made.\u201d In so arguing, appellant refers us to appellant\u2019s testimony that he asked to speak to his mother, an attorney, several times before he was placed in the holding cell and once while he was in the holding cell, all of which occurred prior to being placed in the interrogation room and questioned by Detective Sofelkanik. Even assuming that the trial court\u2019s factual finding was clearly erroneous, appellant still cannot prevail under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 182, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), the Supreme Court held that an accused\u2019s invocation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a bail review hearing did not constitute the invocation of the accused\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment. Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia discussed, among other things, \u201cthis Court\u2019s jurisprudence relating to the Fifth Amendment guarantee that \u2018[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 111 S.Ct. 2204. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436[, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694] (1966), we established a number of prophylac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tic rights designed to counteract the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation, including the right to have counsel present. <em>Miranda </em>did not hold, however, that those rights could not be waived. On the contrary, the opinion recognized that statements elicited during custodial interrogation would be admissible if the prosecution could establish that the suspect \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 475[, 86 S.Ct. 1602.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477[, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378] (1981), we established a second layer of prophylaxis for the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel: Once a suspect asserts the right, not only must the current interrogation cease, but he may not be approached for further interrogation \u201cuntil counsel has been made available to him,\u201d 451 U.S., at 484-485[, 101 S.Ct. 1880]-which means, we have most recently held, that counsel must be present, <em>Minnick v. Mississippi </em>498 U.S. 146[, 111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489] (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 111 S.Ct. 2204.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Justice Scalia then articulated the requirements for invoking one\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">The rule of that case <em>[Edwards </em>] applies only when the suspect \u201cha[s] <em>expressed </em>\u201d his wish for the particular sort of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of <em>Miranda. </em>It requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney <em>in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police. </em>Requesting the assistance of an attorney at a bail hearing does not bear that construction. \u201c[T]o find that [the defendant] invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel on the present charges merely by requesting the appointment of counsel at his arraignment on the unrelated charge is to disregard the ordinary meaning of that request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 111 S.Ct. 2204 (citations omitted) (alteration in original) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In a footnote, Justice Scalia elaborated further on the invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">We have in fact never held that a person can invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights anticipatorily, in a context other than \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d\u2014which a preliminary hearing will not always, or even usually, involve[.] If the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel can be invoked at a preliminary hearing, it could be argued, there is no logical reason why it could not be invoked by a letter prior to arrest, or indeed even prior to identification as a suspect. Most rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against. The fact that we have allowed the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, once asserted, to be effective with respect to future custodial interrogation does not necessarily mean that we will allow it to be asserted initially outside the context of custodial interrogation, with similar future effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 182 n. 3, 111 S.Ct. 2204 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In <em>Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152 [759 A.2d 327] (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 Md. 623 [766 A.2d 147] (2001), this Court had the occasion to apply the principles enunciated in <em>McNeil </em>to the appellant\u2019s alleged invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel when, prior to the appellant\u2019s arrest, the appellant\u2019s attorney advised police that the appellant \u201cwould make no statement to police officers without his attorney being present.\u201d <em>Marr, </em>134 Md.App. at 159 [759 A.2d 327]. We held that the \u201cappellant did not validly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel because the invocation by counsel occurred outside of the context of custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173 [759 A.2d 327]. Speaking for this Court, Judge James Eyler explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>safeguards were intended to provide protection against the inherent coerciveness of custodial interrogation. The \u201cinherent compulsion\u201d that is brought about by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>combination of custody and interrogation is crucial for the attachment of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602 [16 L.Ed.2d 694], As the Supreme Court articulated in <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), \u201c[i]t is clear ... that the special procedural safeguards outlined in <em>Miranda </em>are required not where a suspect is simply taken into custody, but rather where a suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Judge Eyler also observed that \u201cat least five federal courts of appeal subsequently have interpreted <em>[McNeil] </em>to mean that an individual may not invoke the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel before custodial interrogation has begun or is imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 759 A.2d 327.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because in <em>Marr </em>the purported invocation of the right to counsel occurred before the appellant was in custody, Judge Eyler concluded that \u201cwe need not decide whether, in addition to custody, interrogation must be actual or at least imminent before the right to counsel can be invoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 759 A.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>Costley v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 90, 111, 926 A.2d 769 (2007), this Court had the opportunity to revisit the issue left open in <em>Marr. </em>In <em>Costley, </em>after his arrest, Costley told the officer who escorted him to a holding cell that he wanted an attorney. <em>Costley, </em>175 Md.App. at 99, 926 A.2d 769.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>held that Costley did not validly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 110, 926 A.2d 769. We explained that the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>McNeil </em>\u201csuggests that custody, absent interrogation, is insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 926 A.2d 769. We stated that \u201cin order for the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards to take effect, there must first exist custodial interrogation\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 926 A.2d 769 (internal quotations omitted). On that basis, we concluded that any request made by Costley to the officer who placed him in a holding cell was ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 926 A.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We come to the same conclusion in the case <em>sub judice </em>as we did in <em>Costley. </em>Assuming that appellant clearly expressed his desire for the assistance of counsel by repeatedly asking to talk to his mother, an attorney, all such requests were made by appellant prior to being placed in the interrogation room and questioned by Detective Sofelkanik. As found by the trial court, and not disputed by appellant, at no time from his entry into the interrogation room until the completion of his statement did appellant ask to speak with his mother, or otherwise request the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we hold that appellant did not validly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel prior to giving a statement to Detective Sofelkanik.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Flight Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to flight because the evidence failed to generate such an instruction. Appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he simple fact that [ajppellant left the scene at some point was not tantamount to evidence of flight so as to generate a flight instruction.\u201d According to appellant, \u201c[a]bsent any evidence that [a]ppellant knew the police were looking for him or that he was actually being pursued by the police, there simply is no inference of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>guilt to be drawn from the mere fact that he departed the area.\u201d Appellant concludes that the instant case fails to satisfy even one of the four inferences, set forth in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 312, 901 A.2d 208 (2006), that must be drawn from the facts in order for a flight instruction to be proper. Because the flight instruction was \u201cwholly unwarranted\u201d and \u201cextremely prejudicial,\u201d appellant maintains that reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The State responds that the trial court properly exercised its discretion to instruct the jury using the pattern jury instruction on flight. Also relying on <em>Thompson, </em>the State argues that the pattern flight instruction is a correct statement of law, that the content of the instruction was not fairly covered by other instructions, and that the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of this case. According to the State, the flight instruction is applicable because the record contains more than \u201csome evidence\u201d that appellant \u201cfled the scene of the crime with the other perpetrators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">At trial, the prosecutor requested that the court give a flight instruction because (1) appellant left the scene only seconds behind the others, and (2) the instruction gives the jury discretion to determine whether there was flight. Defense counsel objected to the State\u2019s request, arguing that appellant \u201cstayed behind\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t flee with the other codefendants.\u201d The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">Okay. In looking at the instruction, it indicates that the jury has to decide whether or not there was in fact flight. And then if there was flight, then they have to determine whether or not that amounts to evidence of a consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">And in this particular case, there is evidence that he left with the group; there\u2019s evidence that he stayed behind. And there\u2019s even evidence that he stayed behind and talked to one or two of the witnesses about the bike, and there\u2019s evidence that he went and talked to the group about getting the bike back. Those are all things that the jury has to consider and it\u2019s their determination to decide what in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>happened. And the range runs from the very first statement to the very last statement that I\u2019ve made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">So, given the way that this flight instruction is presented, that they have to determine if flight did occur. And that\u2019s an essential, not essential, but it\u2019s an important factor in this case. I\u2019ll read 3.24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The court then instructed the jury, using Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions-Criminal 3:24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">A person\u2019s flight immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt. Flight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether there is evidence of flight. If you decide there is evidence of flight, then you must decide whether this flight shows consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Defense counsel noted an exception to the giving of the flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">In <em>Thompson, </em>the Court of Appeals set forth a thorough discussion and analysis of the flight instruction under Maryland law. The appellant in <em>Thompson </em>initially urged the Court to overrule precedential case law approving the flight instruction and to declare such instruction <em>per se </em>improper. <em>Thompson, </em>393 Md. at 302, 901 A.2d 208. The Court declined to do so, stating that \u201c[w]e have consistently upheld the propriety of flight instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 901 A.2d 208. \u201cOur position has been consistent with the majority of both federal and State jurisdictions, which allow flight instructions in appropriate circumstances where the evidence supports an inference of consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 n. 2, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The Court of Appeals then proceeded to analyze the trial court\u2019s giving of the flight instruction in <em>Thompson </em>under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-325(c),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which governs the giving of instructions to the jury. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">We have interpreted Rule 4-325(c) as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS2\">requir[ing] the trial court to give a requested instruction under the following circumstances: (1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVh\"><em>Id. </em>at 302, 901 A.2d 208 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Court determined that the flight instruction given by the trial court in <em>Thompson, </em>which was identical to Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions-Criminal 3:24, \u201caccurately reflects the law of the State of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 901 A.2d 208. The Court also concluded that the substance of the flight instruction was not adequately covered by \u201cthe general jury instructions regarding inferences from the evidence generally [Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions-Criminal 3:00], and the appropriate weight to be given to circumstantial evidence in particular [Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions-Criminal 3:01].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Finally, the <em>Thompson </em>Court focused on whether the flight instruction was applicable under the facts before it. <em>Id. </em>at 310-11, 901 A.2d 208. The Court reiterated its adoption of the four-prong test set forth in <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1977), regarding the propriety of giving a flight instruction. <em>Thompson, </em>393 Md. at 311, 901 A.2d 208. The Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">for an instruction on flight to be given properly, the following four inferences must reasonably be able to be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>from the facts of the case as ultimately tried: that the behavior of the defendant suggests flight; that the flight suggests a consciousness of guilt; that the consciousness of guilt is related to the crime charged or a closely related crime; and that the consciousness of guilt of the crime charged suggests actual guilt of the crime charged or a closely related crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 312, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The issue in <em>Thompson, </em>according to the Court, was the third inference, namely, \u201cthat the consciousness of guilt was consciousness of guilt of the crimes for which [the appellant] was on trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances present in <em>Thompson, </em>the Court concluded that it was both error and abuse of discretion for the trial judge to give the flight instruction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 311, 315, 901 A.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Like the Court of Appeals in <em>Thompson, </em>this Court concludes in the case <em>sub judice </em>that the Maryland pattern jury instruction on flight, given by the trial judge, is a correct statement of Maryland law and that such instruction was not fairly covered by the other instructions given to the jury. Unlike <em>Thompson, </em>however, whether the flight instruction is applicable under the facts of the instant case involves the first two inferences of the <em>Myers </em>test, namely, whether \u201cthe behavior of [appellant] suggests flight\u201d and whether \u201cthe flight suggests a consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>393 Md. at 312, 901 A.2d 208. Appellant argues that the \u201cfact that [a]ppellant left the scene at some point was not tantamount to evidence of flight so as to generate a flight instruction,\u201d because \u201cthere simply is no inference of guilt to be drawn from the mere fact that [appellant] departed the area.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Flight is defined as an \u201cact or instance of fleeing, esp. to evade arrest or prosecution.... Also termed <em>flight from prosecution; flee from justice.\u201d </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 670 (8th ed.2004). Professor Wigmore employs the term \u201cflight from justice\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Flight <em>from </em>justice and its analogous conduct, have always been deemed indicative of a consciousness of guilt. \u201cThe wicked flee, even when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.\u201d...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused\u2019s flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 276 (Supp.2007) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cAt its most basic, evidence of flight is defined by two factors: first, that the defendant has moved from one location to another; second, some additional proof to suggest that this movement is not simply normal human locomotion.\u201d 22 Charles Alan Wright et al. Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5181 (1978 &amp; Supp.2007). This additional proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of other than normal human movement also must reasonably justify an inference that it was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort to avoid apprehension or prosecution based on that guilt. <em>State v. Lincoln, </em>183 Neb. 770, 164 N.W.2d 470, 472 (1969).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the context of leaving the scene of a crime, the classic case of flight is where a defendant leaves the scene shortly after the crime is committed and is running, rather than walking, or is driving a speeding motor vehicle. On the other hand, merely walking away from the scene of a crime ordinarily does not constitute flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In <em>Lincoln, </em>a window at a jewelry store was broken at night and various items taken from the window display. <em>Lincoln, </em>164 N.W.2d at 471. Within seconds a service man from the alarm company saw a car, with the defendant and a companion inside, come around the corner one block from the scene of the crime traveling 30 miles per hour without its headlights on. <em>Id. </em>Five minutes before the burglary, a police officer observed the same car with its lights off in an alley 21/2 blocks from the jewelry store. <em>Id. </em>at 472. When the officer started to drive his cruiser down the alley, the defendant\u2019s car pulled out at the other end of the alley. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska decided that a flight instruction was proper where the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cclearly sufficient to sustain an inference of flight as distinguished from mere departure from the scene of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court drew a distinction between the meaning of the words \u201cflight\u201d and \u201cdeparture:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">The term \u201cflight\u201d is often misused for the word \u201cdeparture.\u201d Departure from the scene after a crime has been committed, of itself, does not warrant an inference of guilt. \u201cFlight\u201d may be established by a broad range of circumstances. We believe the proper rule to be that for departure to take on the legal significance of flight, there must be circumstances present and unexplained which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>in conjunction with the leaving, reasonably justify an inference that it was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort to avoid apprehension or prosecution based on that guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Courts in other states have drawn a similar distinction between \u201cflight\u201d and \u201cdeparture.\u201d <em>See e.g., State v. Rodgers, </em>103 Ariz. 393, 442 P.2d 840, 842 (1968) (\u201cClearly before an instruction on flight can be given the evidence must disclose more than a mere departure from the scene.\u201d); <em>People v. Clem, </em>104 Cal.App.3d 337, 163 Cal.Rptr. 553, 557 (1980) (stating that the mere fact that the defendant did not remain at the scene of the crime, but was arrested several days later at a different locale, was insufficient to warrant a flight instruction); <em>People v. Zertuche, </em>5 Ill.App.3d 303, 282 N.E.2d 201, 204 (1972) (\u201cThe concept of flight embodies more than just leaving the scene of the crime. The defendant must be attempting to avoid arrest or detention.\u201d); <em>State v. Bruton, </em>66 Wash.2d 111, 401 P.2d 340, 341-42 (1965) (\u201c[T]he evidence or circumstances introduced and giving rise to the contention of flight must be substantial and sufficient to create a reasonable and substantive inference that the defendant\u2019s departure from the scene of difficulty was an instinctive or impulsive reaction to a consciousness of guilt or was a deliberate effort to evade arrest and prosecution.\u201d); <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>43 N.J. 209, 203 A.2d 177, 192 (1964) (\u201cFor departure to take on the legal significance of flight, there must be circumstances present and unexplained which, in conjunction with the leaving, reasonably justify an inference that it was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort to avoid an accusation based on that guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Therefore, we hold that an accused\u2019s departure from the scene of a crime, without any attendant circumstances that reasonably justify an inference that the leaving was done with a consciousness of guilt and pursuant to an effort to avoid apprehension or prosecution based on that guilt, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>constitute \u201cflight,\u201d and thus does not warrant the giving of a flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We acknowledge the State\u2019s argument that the pattern flight instruction does not presume that flight occurred. The language of the instruction leaves it to the jury to first decide whether there is evidence of flight. Only then is the jury instructed to decide whether the evidence of flight shows a consciousness of guilt. Regardless, we conclude that when a flight instruction is not generated by the facts of the case, the instruction should not be given. Otherwise a flight instruction would be warranted in virtually every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In the instant case, taking the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, appellant simply walked away from the scene of the crime with the group of individuals who had just perpetrated the robberies. When appellant left the scene, the police had not arrived, nor was their arrival imminent. There was no evidence that appellant attempted to flee the neighborhood or to secrete himself from public view to avoid apprehension. Indeed, only 10-15 minutes after the crime, the police stopped appellant in a nearby neighborhood with three of the other perpetrators, one of whom possessed some of the stolen property. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that there were no circumstances attendant to appellant\u2019s departure from the scene of the crime that would reasonably justify the inference of a consciousness of guilt. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s behavior did not constitute flight, and the trial court erred in giving the flight instruction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Finding error, we must next decide whether the error in the instant case was harmless. Error is harmless when \u201ca reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 388, 906 A.2d 374 (2006) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 726, 870 A.2d 609 (2005). Where \u201cerror cannot be deemed \u2018harmless[,]\u2019[ ] a reversal is mandated.\u201d <em>Bryant v. State, </em>129 Md. App. 150, 162, 741 A.2d 495 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The evidence adduced at trial in support of appellant\u2019s guilt was far from overwhelming. One victim testified that, during the altercation, appellant \u201cstood somewhat to the side.\u201d Another victim, when asked, \u201cWhat did you see [appellant] do?,\u201d testified, \u201cI don\u2019t believe he was doing anything.\u201d When interviewed by an investigator, a third victim admitted that appellant was \u201cthe older guy who was standing there\u201d and was not \u201cin the group\u201d but was \u201coff to the side.\u201d One victim also testified that he did not see appellant strike anyone directly. There was no evidence that appellant took any victim\u2019s property or was seen carrying such property away from the scene. When appellant was stopped by the police, none of the stolen property was in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The State\u2019s theory for appellant\u2019s culpability was as an aider and abettor. But that theory also had its evidentiary problems. Gary Schneider testified that, after the fight ended, appellant stayed behind while the others in the group left with the victims\u2019 bicycles and other property. According to Phillips\u2019 testimony, when Gary Schneider asked appellant if he could get the bicycles back, appellant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do about it, but I\u2019ll see.\u201d Appellant then caught up with the group of perpetrators and was seen talking to them. Upon our own review of the entire record, we cannot assert a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the flight instruction had no influence on the verdicts against appellant. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the giving of the flight instruction constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Appellant did not ask Detective Sofelkanik any questions about why he was there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. In his testimony, Detective Sofelkanik read seven \"question[s]\" listed on the Advice of Rights form: (1) \u201cyou have the right now or anytime to remain silent,\u201d (2) \"anything you say may be used against you,\u201d (3) \"you have the right to a lawyer before and during any questioning,\u201d (4) \"if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed for you,\u201d (5) \"you have the right to be taken promptly before a District Court Commissioner who is a judicial officer not connected with the police\u201d who will \"inform you of each offense you are charged with and the penalties of each offense (6) \"do you understand what I have just said,\u201d and (7) \"do you want to talk to us at this time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\">. Detective Sofelkanik testified that \"the reason I know he said, \u2018Yes' is because I write down exactly what they say and it\u2019s procedure that we have to verbally hear something from their mouth and [appellant] responded, 'Yes\u2019 to the answer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">. Because the court also said that there was no '\u2018willful'\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>violation, appellant argues that such wording \"necessarily presupposes a <em>Miranda </em>violation.\u201d Appellant thus claims error because whether or not a violation was willful is irrelevant as a matter of law. We agree with the State that appellant \"relies on a strained interpretation of a portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d At no point in its ruling did the court find, or presuppose, that there was a <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">. Even if appellant had so testified, his commitment to talk to the police would not have been an incriminating response within the meaning of <em>Miranda, </em>nor would it necessarily render the subsequent <em>Miranda </em>warnings ineffective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b333-9\">. At trial, Detective Sofelkanik testified that, although he did not have specific knowledge of when appellant was fingerprinted, it is police procedure to take fingerprints after interrogation. The State argues in its brief that this testimony \"suggests that [appellant] asked to call his mother after his statement was already made.\u201d For the purpose of our analysis, we need not resolve this issue and shall accept appellant's version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b334-13\">. Appellant also claims that he asked to call his mother, an attorney, \"at least one time\u201d after his interrogation. We need not address appellant's alleged invocation of his right to counsel after interrogation because he made no confession thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">.
