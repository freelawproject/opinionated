EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Christopher Lee, appellee, was convicted by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of offenses related to the unlawful possession of a firearm. The State, appellant, charged appellee in a two-count criminal indictment, the first count for unlawful possession of a regulated firearm by a person convicted of a disqualifying crime under Maryland Code (2003, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 5\u2014133(b)(1) of the Public Safety Article (\u201cP.S.\u201d), later amended to \u00a7 5-133(c), and the second count for unlawful possession of a handgun under Maryland Code (2002, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). Prior to the beginning of trial, the trial court, as explained below, amended the indictment, effectively dismissing count one of the indictment and adding a new charge, unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under C.L. \u00a7 5-622, without appellant\u2019s consent. Appellee entered a guilty plea to the new charge under C.L. \u00a7 5-622 and to the original count two charge for unlawful possession of a handgun. The trial court accepted appellee\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced appellee to a total of eight years incarceration, all of which was suspended, plus three years of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">On appeal, appellant raises the sole issue of whether the trial court erred in amending the indictment by deleting a charge and substituting a new one against appellee, without appellant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Finding error in the trial court\u2019s action, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">On July 27, 2004, appellant filed a two-count indictment against appellee. Count one of the indictment charged that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the date of July 1, 2004, appellee was in possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime, in violation of P.S. \u00a7 5\u2014133(b)(1). Count two of the indictment charged that appellee did unlawfully wear, carry, and transport a handgun in violation of C.L. \u00a7 4-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The facts surrounding the offenses appellee allegedly committed are not at issue in this appeal and can be stated briefly. On the evening of July 1, 2004, police officers patrolling in the 700 block of The Alameda in Baltimore City observed appellee sitting on the front steps of a home with a group of people. The officers\u2019 attention was drawn to the group when an unknown person jumped up and quickly went inside of the home. The officers stopped their vehicle and recognized appellee from prior occasions. Appellee initiated conversation with the officers, and when the officers started to exit their vehicle, appellee stood up and walked into the home. The officers noticed appellee was displaying the characteristics of an armed person by holding his waistband, and the officers chased appellee through the home. Appellee fled out the back door of the home and crawled under a mobile home. Appellee emerged from underneath the mobile home, and the officers eventually stopped him. The officers recovered a semi-automatic handgun from underneath the mobile home that appellee had crawled under, and appellee was arrested. The recovered handgun had been reported stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On May 14, 2007, following numerous postponements, appellee appeared for trial in circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the prosecutor moved to amend the charging document, stating that the count one charge under P.S. \u00a7 5\u2014133(b)(1), should be amended to P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c)(l)(ii). P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c)(l)(ii) prohibits possession of a regulated firearm by a person convicted of certain enumerated offenses, including violations of C.L. \u00a7 5-602 prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, or dispensing of a controlled danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ous substance (\u201cCDS\u201d). Violations of P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) carry a minimum sentence of 5 year's, no part of which may be suspended. Appellee was a person prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm under P.S. \u00a7 5\u2014133(c)(l)(ii), based on a January 23, 2003 conviction under C.L. \u00a7 5-602, relating to distribution of CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Appellee objected to appellant\u2019s amendment to the charging document, which the trial court overruled. Counsel for appellee then offered his own motion to amend the charging document, and proffered that assuming appellee was in possession of a handgun, appellee could be charged under P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c), with its mandatory minimum penalty of five years, no part of which may be suspended; or appellee could be charged under C.L. \u00a7 5-622, which has similar elements to P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c), and carries a maximum sentence of five years with the possibility of suspension or parole. Counsel for appellee explained that, under the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d appellee should be charged under C.L. \u00a7 5-622, not P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c), stating: \u201cI think the law is pretty clear when there\u2019s two statutes [that] apply and they both carry elements that apply to the prohibited behavior[,] [t]he Defendant should get the benefit of the lesser of the two statutes.\u201d Appellee requested that the trial court dismiss the count one charge under P.S. \u00a7 5-133, and charge appellee under C.L. \u00a7 5-622.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In response to appellee\u2019s motion, appellant asserted that appellee should be charged under P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c), explaining there were differences between P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) and C.L. \u00a7 5-622.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>[Appellee\u2019s prior convietion] is enumerated. The crime for which [appellee] received a prior conviction was under [section] 5-602, distribution of CDS. There are differences in the statute. Under 5-133 it requires that it be a regulated firearm and a handgun is a regulated firearm. 5-622 does not require that it be a regulated firearm. Any gun qualifies, including] short barreled shotguns, antique rifles, anything of that nature. They require different elements. They\u2019re two distinct crimes. The legislature chose to enact both of them knowing that there was some overlap, and the State chose to charge [appellee] under the Public Safety Article and not under the Criminal Law Article. We could have charged them under both. [Appellee] could have been convicted under both. [Appellee] could have been sentenced to consecutive time under both, but in that, [appellee] is charged under 5-133. The State\u2019s position is that the only available penalty is five years without the possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The trial court then inquired when, in the three years since the date the indictment was filed against appellee, did appellant start charging defendants under both P.S. \u00a7 5-133(e) and C.L. \u00a7 5-622. The prosecutor responded that the decision of whether to charge defendants under both P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) and C.L. \u00a7 5-622 was decided by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office on an individual, case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The trial court then issued its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">It just seems somebody who has a minor record, relatively minor record, and who really hasn\u2019t been in trouble over the three years since he\u2019s been charged, that it was obviously, whether it\u2019s [section] 5-622 or the Section that he was charged under, possession of an unregistered handgun is a serious matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">But it seems to me he\u2019s entitled to the benefit of 5-622 under the Rule of Lenity, and that he would be entitled to a sentence of five years with parole, with eligibility for parole and not one where there\u2019s no eligibility for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">So I will accept a plea of guilty to\u2014under [section] 5-622 and also to wear, carry\u2014three years, wear, carry, transport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the handgun. So it will be a total of eight years. And as I said I will accept that plea because I think he\u2019s entitled to the benefit of [section] 5-622.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The prosecutor noted an objection to the trial court\u2019s action, explaining it was appellant\u2019s position that the only appropriate sentence was five years without the opportunity for parole, and that appellant would appeal. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Counsel for appellee explained the ramifications of a guilty plea to appellee. Appellee then offered his guilty plea, which the trial court found was free, voluntary, and intelligent, and the court then accepted appellee\u2019s guilty plea. The prosecutor recited the agreed statement of facts, and based on the statement of facts, the trial court found appellee guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under C.L. \u00a7 5-622, and one count of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun under C.L. \u00a7 4-203. The trial court then sentenced appellee to a total of eight years, all of which was suspended, and three years of supervised probation, including payment of court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Appellant appealed, pursuant to Maryland Code (2006 Repl. Yol., 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). Appellant contended in the notice of appeal that the trial court had \u201cquashed the indictment in this matter and substituted an additional uncharged Count in its place.\u201d Appellee, <em>pro se, </em>has not filed a brief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">1. <em>Appellant\u2019s Right of Appeal and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">We begin our discussion by considering appellant\u2019s right of appeal under C.J. \u00a7 12-302(c)(l). C.J. \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(1) provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that in a criminal case, the \u201cState may appeal from a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss or quashing or dismissing any indictment, information, presentment, or inquisition.\u201d In this case, both appellant and appellee moved to amend the charging document. The trial court initially granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to amend, but later accepted a guilty plea to a violation of C.L. \u00a7 5-622, which was not part of the original indictment. The court\u2019s action effectively granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge under P.S. \u00a7 5-133 and substituted a charge under C.L. \u00a7 5-622. The docket entries indicate that all counts were disposed of, and the case was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Appellant\u2019s right of appeal under C.J. \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) was therefore ripe upon final judgment, which occurred when the trial court sentenced appellee for his convictions under C.L. \u00a7 5-622 and C.L. \u00a7 4-203. The fact that only one count was dismissed in the two-count indictment is not a bar to appeal under C.J. \u00a7 12-302(c)(l). <em>See Jones v. State, </em>298 Md. 634, 638, 471 A.2d 1055 (1984) (holding that State\u2019s appeal of trial court\u2019s dismissal of first count in a four count indictment under C.J. \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) was not ripe until final judgment on the remaining counts pled in the guilty plea, and noting that upon imposition of the sentences on the remaining counts, \u201cthe situation ... was ripe for the State to appeal or to perfect its earlier attempt to appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The dismissal of an indictment is at the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>see State v. Lohss, </em>19 Md.App. 489, 494, 313 A.2d 87 (1973), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>272 Md. 113, 321 A.2d 534 (1974), and we review for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">II. <em>The Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in effectively dismissing count one of the indictment and in accepting a guilty plea from appellee to an offense that was not charged or agreed upon by appellant. Appellant contends the trial court\u2019s action improperly interfered with appellant\u2019s authority and discretion in charging criminal defendants, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>trial court improperly involved itself in a plea negotiation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In Maryland, State\u2019s Attorneys have broad discretion in deciding which charges to prosecute against defendants. <em>See Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 298, 914 A.2d 25 (2006) (\u201cState\u2019s Attorneys retain broad discretion ... in determining which cases to prosecute, which offenses to charge, and how to prosecute the cases they bring.\u201d); <em>Beverly v. State, </em>349 Md. 106, 121, 707 A.2d 91 (1998) (\u201cIt is well-settled that the determination of which criminal charges, if any, to bring is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d); <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>278 Md. 243, 252, 363 A.2d 468 (1976) (\u201cIt is clear that state\u2019s attorneys in this State have very wide and largely unreviewable discretion as to whether or not to pursue the prosecution of criminal offenses.\u201d). The grant of discretionary authority to state\u2019s attorneys in determining which cases and charges to prosecute was explained by the Court of Appeals in <em>Brack v. </em>Wells:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">By the Constitution of Maryland, Article 5, Section 9, the State\u2019s Attorney shall perform such duties as may [by] law be prescribed. By section 33 of Article 10 of the Code [(current version at \u00a7 34 of Article 10)], that officer is required to \u2018prosecute and defend, on the part of the State, all cases in which the State may be interested.\u2019 In such prosecutions of persons accused of crime, he must exercise a sound discretion to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent. He must be trusted with broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes, subject generally to judicial control. The office is one not purely ministerial, but involves the exercise of learning and discretion. As a general rule, whether the State\u2019s Attorney does or does not institute a particular prosecution is a matter which rests in his discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">184 Md. 86, 90, 40 A.2d 319 (1944) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The role of trial courts in the plea agreement process was defined by this Court in <em>Barnes v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 694, 523 A.2d 635 (1987). In <em>Barnes, </em>we interpreted the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-243, which governs plea agreements, explaining that \u201c[a]lthough [Rule 4-243] does not expressly prohibit judicial participation in plea bargaining, its language contemplates a limited role for the trial judge in that process.\u201d 70 Md.App. at 702, 523 A.2d 635.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We explained that the role of the trial court as contemplated by Rule 4-243 is consistent with the judicial role in plea negotiations suggested by Standard 14-3.3 of the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty (2d ed. 1980 &amp; 1986 Supp.). <em>Id. </em>at 704, 523 A.2d 635. We explained that under the ABA\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice on guilty pleas, \u201cthe judge may meet with defense counsel and the prosecutor when the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ties are unable to reach a plea agreement on their own, but that the judge\u2019s role in such a meeting should be to \u2018serve as a moderator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 523 A.2d 635 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 14-3.3(c)). We also noted that under the ABA Standards, \u201cthe judge should never through word or demeanor, either directly or indirectly, communicate to the defendant or defense counsel that a plea agreement should be accepted or that a guilty plea should be entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 14\u20143.3(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Barnes, </em>during an <em>Alford </em>plea hearing, the trial court conducted a colloquy with the defendant and during that colloquy offered the defendant a sentence of 30 years, when the State was only willing to recommend a 50 year sentence in its plea discussions with the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 697-98, 523 A.2d 635. Based on our interpretation of the language under Rule 4-243, we held the trial court\u2019s conduct in offering the defendant a more favorable sentence than the State was willing to offer \u201cexceeded the permissible bounds of judicial participation in plea bargaining contemplated by Rule 4-243\u201d and that \u201cthe judge, in effect, negotiated his own agreement with the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 523 A.2d 635. We explained: \u201cThe trial judge, in our view, improperly interjected himself into the plea bargaining process as an active negotiator, infringing upon the function reserved to counsel in the adversary process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 523 A.2d 635. We then held that as a result of the trial court\u2019s improper action, the defendant was improperly coerced into pleading guilty, and we vacated the guilty pleas. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 523 A.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In this case, appellant wished to charge appellee under P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c), which carried a mandatory five year sentence, none of which could be suspended. The trial court effectively dismissed this charge and, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, replaced it with a charge under C.L. \u00a7 5-622. Considering that State\u2019s Attorneys are afforded broad discretion in determining which charges to prosecute, and the limited role that trial courts are to play during plea bargaining as defined in <em>Barnes, </em>we find the trial court\u2019s action in this case exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the permissible bounds of judicial participation in a defendant\u2019s entry of a guilty plea. There is no authority under the Maryland Rules, Code, or case law that permits a trial court to bring a new charge against a defendant, after dismissing an original charge, without the State\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s statement during the guilty plea hearing, the rule of lenity does not permit or authorize a trial judge to substitute charges in a charging document or to impose a plea agreement. Moreover, the rule of lenity is not otherwise applicable in this situation. In <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 253, 858 A.2d 1100 (2004), this Court considered the issue of whether under the rule of lenity, the sentence of a defendant convicted under Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h), which has been repealed and recodified at P.S. \u00a7 5\u2014133(c)(1)(h), could be no greater than that authorized under C.L. ,\u00a7 5-622. <em>See Alston, </em>159 Md.App. at 270, 858 A.2d 1100. In <em>Alston, </em>a defendant had been sentenced in circuit court for several offenses, including five years without the possibility of parole for the unlawful possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony under Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h). <em>Alston, </em>159 Md.App. at 257, 858 A.2d 1100. On appeal, the defendant contended that because he could have been convicted under C.L. \u00a7 5-622 for the same conduct for which he was convicted under Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h), and a conviction under C.L. \u00a7 5-622 carried a sentence of no more than five years, without a non-eligibility for suspension or parole requirement, under the rule of lenity his sentence could be no greater than that authorized under C.L. \u00a7 5-622. <em>Id. </em>at 270, 858 A.2d 1100. We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument regarding the rule of lenity as it applied to the two statutes. <em>See id. </em>at 273, 858 A.2d 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In <em>Alston, </em>we defined the rule of lenity as being:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVD\">a principle of statutory construction providing, in its most general application, that, in cases of ambiguity, doubts shall be resolved in favor of criminal defendants. It frequently is applied in the context of merger of offenses for sentencing purposes, when the defendant has been convicted of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>offenses (either both statutory or one statutory and one a derivative of common law) that do not merge under the required evidence test, but there is \u201cdoubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaetion[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 858 A.2d 1100 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 373, 772 A.2d 1240 (2001)) (alteration in original). We explained \u201cthe purpose of the rule of lenity is to prohibit a court from \u2018interpret[ing] a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 858 A.2d 1100 (quoting <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525 (1990)) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We explained the rule of lenity does not apply, however, when there is no ambiguity to resolve, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">when two statutes proscribe the same conduct and apply different penalties, the prosecutor has unfettered discretion (if he is not discriminating against any class of defendants) to choose between the statutes. So long as the provisions \u201cunambiguously specify the activity and the penalties available upon conviction,\u201d the rule of lenity has no application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 272, 858 A.2d 1100 (quoting <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979)) (citation omitted). Applying this analysis to C.L. \u00a7 5-622 and Article 27, \u00a7 445(d)(1)(h), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">[T]he State could have prosecuted the appellant, based on the same conduct, for violating CL section [5-622], which was part of the Controlled Dangerous Substances laws, enacted by 1991 Md. Laws, ch. 613; or for violating section 445(d)(1)(h), subject to an enhanced penalty under section 449(e), which was enacted in 2000, as part of the Responsible Gun Safety Act, 2000 Md. Laws, ch. 2. There is no ambiguity as between these provisions, and hence the rule of lenity is not triggered. The State had discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>prosecute the appellant under the provision carrying the stiffer penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 858 A.2d 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">While there are no Maryland cases with facts substantially similar to this case, appellant called our attention to a similar case, decided by the California Court of Appeal, <em>People v. Smith, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 655, 126 Cal.Rptr. 195 (1975). In <em>Smith, </em>the trial court, during pre-trial proceedings, granted a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a former plea of not guilty to \u201cassault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,\u201d and over the objection of the state prosecutor, permitted the defendant to plead guilty to the offense of battery. 53 Cal.App.3d at 657, 126 Cal.Rptr. 195. The California Court of Appeal treated the trial court\u2019s action as a dismissal of the original charge for aggravated assault, and regarding the battery charge, explained the trial court had taken it \u201cupon itself to charge the [defendant] with an otherwise uncharged and nonincluded, although related, lesser offense than that which had been charged by the [State of California].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 126 Cal.Rptr. 195. The California Court of Appeal held the action by the trial court was unlawful, explaining \u201cjust as the executive may not exercise judicial power, so the judiciary is prohibited from entering upon executive functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 126 Cal.Rptr. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Similar to the facts of <em>Smith, </em>the trial court in this case effectively dismissed the count one charge under P.S. \u00a7 5-133, and by its own action and over the objection of the prosecutor, charged appellee with a non-included but related charge under C.L. \u00a7 5-622 that carried a lesser penalty. Finding the holding of <em>Smith </em>instructive, and based upon our earlier analysis, we hold that the trial court in this case abused its discretion when it did so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>guilty pleas, vacate appellee\u2019s guilty pleas, reverse the dismissal of the original charge under P.S. \u00a7 5-133 and the addition of a new charge under C.L. \u00a7 5-622, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED.

The elements of P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) are more specific than the elements of C.L. \u00a7 5-622(b) and require additional acts. P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) requires possession of a \"regulated firearm,\u201d defined under P.S. \u00a7 5-101(p)(l)-(2) as a handgun or specific assault weapon; whereas, C.L. \u00a7 5-622(b) requires possession of a \"firearm,\u201d which is defined as including various types of firearms in addition to regulated firearms. Additionally, P.S. \u00a7 5\u2014133(c)( 1)(ii) requires a previous conviction of certain enumerated offenses, whereas, C.L. \u00a7 5-622(b)(l) requires a felony, conspiracy to commit a felony, or attempted felony conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-11\">.

We do not have before us the question of whether, under the rule of lenity, convictions under both C.L. \u00a7 5-622 and P.S. \u00a7 5-133(c) would merge for sentencing purposes, if based on the same conduct. In that situation, they would likely merge, with the offense carrying the lesser penalty merging into the offense carrying the greater penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
