EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">This case raises several issues stemming from a real estate foreclosure action initiated in the Circuit Court for Charles County by substitute trustees Diane S. Rosenberg and Mark Meyer, appellees, against mortgagors Donna P. Jones and Tanya L. Jones, appellants. Appellants unsuccessfully sought to stay foreclosure prior to the sale. Following the foreclosure sale, appellants filed exceptions to the sale and sought discovery. The circuit court denied discovery, overruled appellants\u2019 exceptions, and ratified the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">On appeal, appellants raise several issues: (1) whether the circuit court erred in denying appellants\u2019 requests for injunctive relief to stop the foreclosure sale, under Maryland Rule 14\u2014209(b); (2) whether the circuit court erred in quashing appellants\u2019 notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>served on appellees shortly before the hearing on appellants\u2019 second request for injunctive relief;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) whether the circuit court erred in ratifying the foreclosure sale; (4) whether the circuit court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion to stay enforcement of the judgment ratifying the sale, pending appeal to this Court; and (5) whether the circuit court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>denying appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment ratifying the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Perceiving no error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On August 31, 2005, appellants executed a deed of trust for property located at 10693 Jacksonhole Place in Charles County, Maryland, to secure a loan in the amount of $224,800. The lender was GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. of Santa Rosa, California. The deed of trust included a provision that the borrower, after default, had a right to have enforcement of the deed of trust suspended upon compliance with certain conditions, including the payment of all amounts due, plus expenses. The deed also contained an adjustable rate rider, with an initial interest rate of 1 percent. The deed provided the interest rate would change on November 1, 2005, by a rate calculated by adding 3.375 percent to the current rate index, but not exceeding 12 percent. The initial monthly payment was $723.05. The monthly payments were subject to change each year, and were to increase substantially after November 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">As time progressed, the interest rate on the loan increased, and the amount of the periodic payments owed by appellants increased. By October, 2006, the loan was in default, triggering acceleration of the loan balance. Appellants were notified that the matter would proceed to foreclosure. Upon receiving notice, appellants, in a letter dated October 30, 2006, requested validation of the debt. On October 30, 2006, the foreclosure action was docketed in circuit court, and appellees were appointed as substitute trustees that same day. Appellees\u2019 statement of debt showed a balance due in the amount of $238,568.16, which consisted of $225,273.78 principal, accrued interest and other charges in the amount of $12,780.18, computed at an interest rate of 6.875 percent. Appellees filed a petition for a nominal bond on October 30, 2006, which was approved on November 20, 2006. The bond was filed on November 29, 2006, and the foreclosure sale was scheduled for November 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>On November 10, 2006, appellees sent a letter to appellants, by certified mail and first class mail, notifying them that the foreclosure action had been filed and that an auction sale of the property would occur on November 29, 2006. On November 20, 2006, appellants, <em>pro se, </em>filed in circuit court a motion for an emergency injunction to stop the foreclosure sale and to quash service. The motion did not contain a supporting affidavit. On December 8, 2006, appellees responded to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The circuit court did not rule on appellants\u2019 motion for an emergency injunction to stop the foreclosure sale and to quash service prior to the foreclosure sale, and the sale occurred on November 29, 2006. On December 6, 2006, the report of sale and affidavit of notice were filed. The property was sold to Craig Heurich and Alison Mason for $262,000, which was in excess of the amount owed by appellants, according to the statement of debt. The circuit court issued a notice that the sale would be ratified on January 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">On December 21, 2006, appellants, <em>pro se, </em>filed a second motion for an emergency injunction to stop the foreclosure sale or, in the alternative, to stop the ratification of the sale. The objections stated in the motion included lack of an opportunity to cure the default; lack of notice of the foreclosure sale by registered mail; that appellants had filed suit against appellees in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on November 17, 2006, alleging that the deed of trust violated federal mortgage laws;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that appellants submitted a surety bond on November 20, 2006, to the clerk of the circuit court and the bond covered any debt owed;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>appellants were denied due process; and certain other objections relating to the form of the foreclosure documents. Appellants also alleged that they paid the debt through an \u201cinternational bill of exchange,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> although appellants now concede such documents are not recognized by Maryland courts as valid legal documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On December 27, 2006, appellees responded to appellants\u2019 motion, asserting that appellants\u2019 request for an injunction did not comply with the affidavit requirements of Maryland Rule 14\u2014209(b); the international bill of exchange was a fraudulent document and frivolous; the purported bond filed by appellants was not a proper bond; the stated grounds of appellants\u2019 motion were without merit and did not state a basis for granting an injunction; to the extent the court viewed appellants\u2019 motion as constituting exceptions to the foreclosure sale, all of the exceptions had to be overruled; upon default, appellants had no right to cure, only a right to redemption; on November 10, 2006, appellants were mailed a reinstate quote and payoff quote, and appellants had an opportunity to reinstate their loan but failed to do so; appellees were in full compliance with notice requirements; and appellants had not set forth any procedural irregularities with particularity. Appellees requested that the court deny appellants\u2019 request for an emergency injunction to stop foreclosure, deny appellants\u2019 exceptions to the foreclosure sale, and grant further relief as the court deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The court scheduled a hearing on appellants\u2019 motion for an injunction against foreclosure and exceptions to the sale and appellees\u2019 response, to be held on February 27, 2006. On February 12, 2006, counsel entered an appearance on behalf of appellants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 21, 2007, appellants moved for a continuance of the hearing, which was denied on February 23, 2007. On February 26, 2007, appellants moved for a state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ment of payout and arrearage owed. Prior to the hearing, appellants served notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>on appellees, to occur on March 6, 2007. On February 27, 2007, the same day as the motions hearing, appellees moved to quash the notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">At the hearing, on February 27, 2006, appellants requested discovery of the original loan documents, including the original deed of trust, in order to determine whether the mortgage was usurious and improper, as well as discovery of whether appellants received actual notice of the foreclosure sale. By order entered on March 2, 2007, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion to quash appellants\u2019 requested discovery, overruled appellants\u2019 exceptions to the foreclosure sale, ratified the sale, and ordered that the matter be referred to the court auditor for an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">On March 9, 2007, appellants noted an appeal from the ratification of the foreclosure sale, and moved to stay enforcement of the ratification of sale pending appeal. Appellants did not file a supersedeas bond with the motion. Appellees filed an opposition to a stay of ratification pending appeal, and on March 15, 2007, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On March 20, 2007, appellants, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-585, filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment of ratification of sale, based upon the court\u2019s revisory power under subsection (a); fraud under subsection (b); and newly discovered evidence under subsection (c). In that motion, appellants alleged that the foreclosure action was improper because appellees had violated the Truth In Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, <em>et seq., </em>and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, <em>et seq., </em>and that, with additional discovery, appellants could prove the violations. Appellants attached to the motion a packet of materials purportedly prepared by Linda J. Rougeux, an \u201cauditor\u201d with \u201cAdvocates for Justice\u201d based in Abilene, Texas. The packet purports to represent the audit of a loan involving appellants and \u201cIndyMac Bank,\u201d but the terms are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>very different from the terms of the loan that is the subject of this case. Moreover, while the audit purports to conclude that there are possible violations of federal law with respect to the audited loan, the papers do not indicate the source of the information and do not provide a conclusion under oath. Some of the papers appear to be form documents which the organization presumably makes available to members of the public. Appellants also attached to the motion an article promulgated by the \u201cCenter for Responsible Lending,\u201d dated December, 2006, containing data on the \u201cforeclosure risk in the subprime market\u201d and a copy of remarks made to the Congressional Black Caucus by a policy analyst at the Center for Responsible Lending on the issue of sub-prime mortgage lending.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On March 23, 2007, appellees filed a response to appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment. Appellees contended they were not involved in the mortgage settlement with appellants and, therefore, were not liable for any potential violations of federal mortgage laws; that appellants had not cited any authority providing that violations of federal mortgage laws were a defense against foreclosure; and that appellants had not set forth any facts or evidence to support their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On April 6, 2007, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment of ratification of sale. On April 11, 2007, the third party purchasers of the foreclosed property filed a motion requesting judgment awarding possession, and on May 2, 2007, appellants filed an opposition. On May 3, 2007, the circuit court entered an order awarding possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Additional facts will be added as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">I. <em>Ratification of the Foreclosure Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">On appeal appellants contend their two motions for injunctive relief from foreclosure, one filed before and one filed after the foreclosure sale, were permitted under Maryland Rule 14-209(b), and that they should have prevailed on the merits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Appellants also contend they were entitled to further discovery at the time of the February 27, 2006 hearing, and the circuit court abused its discretion in quashing their notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>Finally, appellants contend they presented valid exceptions to the foreclosure sale, although labeled as the second motion for injunctive relief, and that the circuit court erred in ratifying the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A. <em>Injunction to Stop Foreclosure Sale under Maryland, Rule H-209(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The grant or denial of an injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and on appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 493, 521, 678 A.2d 55 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">A debtor who owns property subject to a lien created by a lien instrument possesses three means of challenging a foreclosure: \u201cobtaining a pre-sale injunction pursuant to Maryland Rule 14\u2014209(b)(1), filing post-sale exceptions to the ratification of the sale under Maryland Rule 14\u2014305(d), and the filing of post-sale ratification exceptions to the auditor\u2019s statement of account pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-543(g), (h).\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. v. Neal, </em>398 Md. 705, 726, 922 A.2d 538 (2007) (citations omitted); <em>see also Greenbriar Condo., Phase I Council of Unit Owners, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>387 Md. 683, 746-47, 878 A.2d 528 (2005). \u201cIn order to enjoin a sale pursuant to Md. Rule 14-209(b), the injunction must be filed <em>prior </em>to the foreclosure sale. If filed <em>after </em>the foreclosure sale, the injunction is in respect only to subsequent proceedings.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>387 Md. at 738, 878 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In this case, appellants\u2019 first request for an injunction was not in compliance with Rule 14\u2014209(b). That subsection states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">The motion shall not be granted unless the motion is supported by affidavit as to all facts asserted and contains: (1) a statement as to whether the moving party admits any amount of the debt to be due and payable as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of the date the motion is filed, (2) if an amount is admitted, a statement that the moving party has paid the amount into court with the filing of the motion, and (3) a detailed statement of facts, showing that: (A) the debt and all interest due thereon have been fully paid, or (B) there is no default, or (C) fraud was used by the secured party, or with the secured party\u2019s knowledge, in obtaining the lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Appellants\u2019 motion did not comply with any of the above requirements, and the court did not err in failing to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Appellants second request for an injunction to stay foreclosure under Rule 14\u2014209(b) was filed after the foreclosure sale and, therefore, was untimely for purposes of halting the foreclosure sale. Consequently, we shall direct our attention to appellants\u2019 requests for discovery and appellants\u2019 exceptions to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">B. <em>Motion to Quash Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">We review the denial of discovery under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Beyond Systems, Inc. v. Realtime Gaming Holding Co., LLC, </em>388 Md. 1, 28, 878 A.2d 567 (2005). A trial court abuses its discretion only if no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court in denying discovery. <em>See id. </em>at 28, 878 A.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">When ruling on exceptions to a foreclosure sale, Rule 14-305(d)(2) provides: \u201cThe court shall hold a hearing if a hearing is requested and the exceptions or any response clearly show a need to take evidence.\u201d On the issue of discovery related to exceptions to foreclosure sales, Gordon on Maryland Foreclosures explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">There are, essentially, no real guidelines for the procedures relating to exceptions and, particularly, discovery in preparation for the hearing. On request, most Circuit Court judges will allow a reasonable period of time for depositions and document production before the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>albeit substantially less time than in routine civil litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Alexander Gordon, IV, Gordon on Maryland Foreclosures \u00a7 24.2, at 1016 (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">At the motions hearing, appellants requested discovery of the closing documents on the loan, including the original copy of the deed of trust, in order to show the loan was usurious and improper. Appellants claimed the original terms of the promissory note were altered after appellant signed the note, and that appellant was forced to pay $18,000 more than was legally permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Appellants\u2019 counsel also explained that appellants claimed they did not receive proper notice of the foreclosure sale, and counsel requested discovery to determine whether appellants received notice. Appellants\u2019 counsel stated he had recently taken appellants\u2019 case, that prior to that appellants had been acting <em>pro se, </em>and that counsel had not reviewed the court file by the time of the hearing and needed additional time to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The circuit court noted appellants\u2019 counsel made an appearance on behalf of appellants on February 12, which gave him two weeks to prepare for the motions hearing on February 27. Additionally, the circuit court noted all of the documents appellants sought for discovery were on public file, the only exception being the original deed of trust, which appellees were not required to present to appellants in proceeding with the foreclosure sale. The court then granted appellees\u2019 motion to quash the notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Regarding appellants\u2019 request for discovery of the lending documents in order to show the loan was usurious and improper, usury is not a proper ground for setting aside a foreclosure sale, and the question of usury should be considered at the time of the audit. <em>See Kirsner v. Sun Mortgage Co., </em>154 Md. 682, 688, 141 A. 398 (1928). Thus, the question of whether the loan was usurious or improper was not relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the hearing on exceptions to the sale, and discovery of the lending documents was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">As to appellants\u2019 request for discovery as to whether they had received actual notice of the foreclosure sale, we agree with the circuit court\u2019s finding that, upon entering an appearance on February 12, appellants\u2019 counsel had sufficient time prior to the February 27 motions hearing to collect evidence on this issue. Moreover, appellants had actual notice of the foreclosure proceeding, no later than November, 2006. Therefore, we hold there was no abuse of discretion in denying appellants additional time for discovery and granting appellees\u2019 motion to quash appellants\u2019 notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">C. <em>Exceptions to the Foreclosure Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Having failed to file a proper pre-sale injunction to the foreclosure sale under Maryland Rule 14-209(b), appellants\u2019 next recourse was to file exceptions to the sale under Rule 14-305(d). In ruling on exceptions to a foreclosure sale and whether to ratify the sale, trial courts may consider both questions of fact and law. <em>See S. Md. Oil, Inc. v. Kaminetz, </em>260 Md. 443, 451, 272 A.2d 641 (1971) (explaining questions of fact and law may be raised in exceptions to foreclosure sales). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s finding of fact, we do \u201cnot substitute our judgment for that of the lower court unless it was clearly erroneous\u201d and give due consideration to the trial court\u2019s \u201copportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, to judge their credibility and to pass upon the weight to be given their testimony.\u201d <em>Young v. Young, </em>37 Md.App. 211, 220, 376 A.2d 1151 (1977). Questions of law decided by the trial court are subject to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>See Liddy v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 246-47, 919 A.2d 1276(2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>After a foreclosure sale, a debtor\u2019s right to redemption ends, however, a debtor may file exceptions challenging only procedural irregularities in the foreclosure sale <em>Brooks, </em>387 Md. at 746, 878 A.2d 528, under Rule 14-305(d). Rule 14-305(d)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">(d) Exceptions to Sale.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">(1) <em>How Taken. </em>A party, and, in an action to foreclose a lien, the holder of a subordinate interest in the property subject to the lien, may file exceptions to the sale. Exceptions shall be in writing, shall set forth the alleged irregularity with particularity, and shall be filed within 30 days after the date of a notice issued pursuant to section (c) of this Rule or the filing of the report of sale if no notice is issued. Any matter not specifically set forth in the exceptions is waived unless the court finds that justice requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The procedural irregularities might include: \u201callegations such as the advertisement of sale was insufficient or misdescribed the property, the creditor committed a fraud by preventing someone from bidding or by chilling the bidding, challenging the price as unconscionable, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741, 878 A.2d 528. There is a presumption in favor of the validity of a judicial sale, and the burden is on the exceptant to establish to the contrary. <em>See Jackson v. Townshend, </em>249 Md. 8, 13-14, 238 A.2d 81 (1968) (citations omitted); <em>PAS Realty, Inc. v. Rayne, </em>46 Md.App. 445, 446, 418 A.2d 1222 (1980) (citing <em>Hardy v. Gibson, </em>213 Md. 493, 508, 133 A.2d 401 (1957)). Appellants raised a number of challenges in their motion opposing ratification of the sale, as outlined above. The only challenge relating to procedural irregularities in the foreclosure sale, however, was that appellees failed to send notice by registered or certified mail. The circuit court made the following finding on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">I conclude that the trustees have as a matter of fact complied, and I find as a fact that they have complied with the expectations of [Rule 14\u2014206(b)(1)\u2014(2)]. That is to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and the timing contemplated by subsection 2B with regard to the notices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">There\u2019s evidence in the file here of the published notices in the local newspaper. There is evidence in the file of the postal receipts attesting to or as evidence associated with the affidavits attesting to the mailing by first class mail and certified mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">The closest thing I\u2019ve gotten to a proffer here is a suggestion that Ms. Jones didn\u2019t receive it. But that flies in the face of the actual history here where she must have received something or she wouldn\u2019t have asking [sic] us to enjoin the sale in the first place. So that suggestion is not, the only factual proffer we have here is simply not supported by the case history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The court then denied appellants\u2019 motion to stay ratification of the sale, ratified the foreclosure sale, and ordered that the case be referred to an auditor for an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The record contains an affidavit by appellees, stating that they gave notice of the foreclosure proceedings as required by Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol., 2007 Supp.) \u00a7 7-105 of the Real Property Article and notice of the foreclosure sale, by regular and certified mail, advising appellants as to the time, place, and terms of the foreclosure sale. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 14-206(b)(2) (before sale, \u201cthe person authorized to make sale shall send notice of the time, place, and terms of sale by certified mail and by first class mail to the last known address of ... the debtor\u201d). Attached to the affidavit are copies of the letter that was sent to appellants and copies of the postal receipts for the mailings. Appellants have not presented any evidence to the contrary. The circuit court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Appellants\u2019 challenge on the basis of improper notice was the only procedural challenge to the foreclosure sale and, thus, was the only proper exception to the foreclosure sale. Therefore, we hold the circuit court did not err in overruling appellants\u2019 exceptions to the foreclosure sale and ratifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>foreclosure sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">II. <em>Motion for Stay of Enforcement of the Judgment Ratifying the Sale, Pending Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Appellants contend the circuit court erred in denying their motion to stay enforcement of the judgment ratifying the foreclosure sale, pending appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">[A] stay pending appeal is governed by Rules 8-422 through 8-424. If the court determines that because of the nature of the action enforcement of the judgment should not be stayed by the filing of a supersedeas bond or other security, it may enter an order denying a stay or permitting a stay only on the terms stated in the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Maryland Rule 2-632(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">A party against whom a judgment has been rendered may stay its enforcement by filing a supersedeas bond that is in compliance with the requirements in Maryland Rule 8-423. In a foreclosure action, a supersedeas bond must be filed. <em>See Creative Dev. Corp. v. Bond, </em>34 Md.App. 279, 282-83, 367 A.2d 566 (1976) (explaining that with the exception of six specific actions, that do not include foreclosure actions, civil judgments cannot be stayed unless a supersedeas bond is filed); <em>Onderdonk v. Onderdonk, </em>21 Md.App. 621, 623-24, 320 A.2d 585 (1974) (explaining parties must file a supersedeas bond when moving to stay enforcement of judgment to ratify a foreclosure sale). Appellants did not file the necessary bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">It is well-settled law in Maryland that the rights of a bona fide purchaser of mortgaged property would not be affected by reversal of the ratification of sale, in the absence of a supersedeas bond. <em>Poku v. Friedman, </em>403 Md. 47, 939 A.2d 185 (2008); <em>Baltrotsky v.

There are only two exceptions to this rule: (1) unfairness or collusion between the purchaser and trustee and (2) when the mortgagee purchases the disputed property at the foreclosure sale. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 910 A.2d 1089 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">There is no contention that the third party purchasers in this case are not bona fide purchasers, and no contention that either of the two exceptions to the rule apply. Therefore, the court did not err in denying appellants\u2019 motion to stay enforcement of the judgment to ratify the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">III. <em>Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment of Ratification of Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Finally, appellants contend the court erred in not exercising its revisory power over the judgment of ratification of sale under Maryland Rule 2-535. Appellants argue that the court abused its discretion because appellants made a showing of fraud or irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We review the circuit court\u2019s decision to deny a request to revise its final judgment under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Mullaney v. Aude, </em>126 Md.App. 639, 666, 730 A.2d 759 (1999). The effect of a final ratification of sale is <em>res judicata </em>as to the validity of such sale, except in the case of fraud or illegality. <em>See Bachrach v. Wash. United Co-op., </em>181 Md. 315, 320, 29 A.2d 822 (1943); <em>Manigan v. Burson, </em>160 Md.App. 114, 120, 862 A.2d 1037 (2004) (citations omitted). The burden of proof in establishing fraud, mistake, or irregularity is clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Billingsley v. Lawson, </em>43 Md.App. 713, 718, 406 A.2d 946 (1979). To establish fraud under Rule 2-535(b), a movant must show extrinsic fraud, not intrinsic fraud. <em>See Manigan, </em>160 Md. App. at 120, 862 A.2d 1037 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">This Court explained the distinction between intrinsic fraud and extrinsic fraud in <em>Billingsley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">[A]n enrolled decree will not be vacated even though obtained by the use of forged documents, perjured testimony, or any other frauds which are \u201cintrinsic\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>trial of the case itself. Underlying this long settled rule is the principle that, once parties have had the opportunity to present before a court a matter for investigation and determination, and once the decision has been rendered and the litigants, if they so choose, have exhausted every means of reviewing it, the public policy of this State demands that there be an end to that litigation ...[.] This policy favoring finality and conclusiveness can be outweighed only by a showing \u201cthat the jurisdiction of the court has been imposed upon, or that the prevailing party, by some extrinsic or collateral fraud, has prevented a fair submission of the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><em>Billingsley, </em>43 Md.App. at 719, 406 A.2d 946 (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Merchs. Mortgage Co., </em>272 Md. 305, 308-09, 322 A.2d 544(1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Fraud is extrinsic when \u201cit actually prevents an adversarial trial but is intrinsic when it is employed during the course of the hearing which provides the forum for the truth to appear, albeit, the truth was distorted by the complained of fraud.\u201d <em>Manigan, </em>160 Md.App. at 121, 862 A.2d 1037 (quoting <em>Billingsley, </em>43 Md.App. at 719, 406 A.2d 946). Irregularity under Rule 2-535(b), is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[\u201c]the doing or not doing of that, in the conduct of a suit at law, which, conformable to the practice of the court, ought or ought not be to be done.\u201d (citation omitted) \u201cAs a consequence, irregularity, in the contemplation of the Rule, usually means irregularity of process or procedure ..., and not an error, which in legal parlance generally connotes a departure from the truth or accuracy of which a defendant had notice and could have challenged.\u201d (citation omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\"><em>Manigan, </em>160 Md.App. at 121, 862 A.2d 1037 (quoting <em>Billingsley, </em>43 Md.App. at 720, 406 A.2d 946).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In their motion, appellants made general allegations that appellees violated TILA and RESPA, and contended that with additional discovery they could prove such violations. Appellants attached a document, described as an audit report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>but which pertains to a mortgage loan that does not involve appellees and is unrelated to this case. Appellants also attached a public policy report that presented empirical data on sub-prime mortgage lending, as well as remarks made to the Congressional Black Caucus by a policy analyst at the Center for Responsible Lending on the issue of sub-prime mortgage lending. Appellants\u2019 motion contained no probative evidence showing extrinsic fraud or irregularity in the foreclosure sale and did not present newly discovered evidence. We hold the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in not exercising its revisory power over the judgment to ratify the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In conclusion, we note that we are not unaware of the issues that exist with respect to subprime mortgage lending, and that some persons believe that current foreclosure procedures do not provide debtors with sufficient opportunities to challenge foreclosure. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that that belief has merit, a debtor does not advance the debtor\u2019s cause by filing documents that do not comply with the Maryland Rules, are incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading. Because we have seen some of the same \u201cform\u201d documents in other foreclosure cases, in which the debtor, as here, acted <em>pro se, </em>we assume that someone (not appellants\u2019 current counsel) has provided bad advice and bad documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We hold the circuit court did not err (1) in denying appellants\u2019 requests for an injunction to stop the foreclosure sale, (2) in granting appellees\u2019 motion to quash appellants\u2019 notices of deposition and subpoenas <em>duces tecum; </em>(3) in overruling appellants\u2019 exceptions to the foreclosure sale and in ratifying the sale; (4) in denying appellants\u2019 motion for a stay of enforcement of the judgment ratifying the foreclosure sale, pending appeal; and (5) in denying appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend the final judgment of ratification of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

Appellants' reference to <em>Pacific Mortgage &amp; Investment Group, Ltd. v. Horn, </em>100 Md.App. 311, 641 A.2d 913 (1994), is unpersuasive. The discovery at issue in <em>Horn </em>was in the context of a lawsuit by the borrower against the lender and substitute trustee for statutory violations regarding the mortgage loan, <em>see id. </em>at 317-18, 641 A.2d 913, and did not involve exceptions to a foreclosure sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\">. Appellants point out that, at the motions hearing, they discussed their then pending complaint in federal court, in which they asserted violations of federal law, but the circuit court failed to consider those allegations. The allegations did not constitute a procedural challenge to the foreclosure sale and, therefore, were not proper exceptions that could have been raised at the February 27 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
