After merging offenses, the court imposed a sentence of 40 years for attempted first degree murder, and a consecutive ten year sentence for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement because the State had failed to lay the proper foundation. Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to call the witness for the sole purpose of impeaching him with a prior inconsistent statement. Perceiving no reversible error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">On January 8, 2006, at approximately 5:00 p.m., David W. Webb, Jr. was standing outside 13 North Locust Street in Hagerstown, with his fianc\u00e9e, Brook Rutherford. He testified that, while he was standing outside, a boy rode by on what Mr. Webb believed to be his stolen Mongoose bicycle. Mr. Webb then proceeded to approach the boy and asked him, not in \u201ca polite way,\u201d for the bike back. While Mr. Webb and the boy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>were conversing about the bike, Mr. Webb, out of the corner of his eye, saw someone approach him from across the street. The person shot Mr. Webb in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">After being shot, Mr. Webb ran down the street in the direction of his home. The assailant fired another shot at Mr. Webb as he ran, which missed. Mr. Webb looked back to see where the shooter was and noticed he was crossing the street and moving toward Ms. Rutherford. Mr. Webb then ran across the street, pushed Ms. Rutherford out of the way, told her-to run inside the house, and call the police. As Ms. Rutherford was going inside, Mr. Webb saw the shooter approaching him again. Mr. Webb curled up into a ball, and the shooter shot him again in the head. After he was shot, Mr. Webb opened his eyes and saw the shooter run \u201cup the street and around the corner on Washington Street.\u201d During his direct examination, Mr. Webb identified appellant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Officer Thomas Bartles, a Hagerstown City police officer, testified that he received a call at 5:19 p.m. advising that a shooting had occurred in the unit block of North Locust Street. Officer Bartles immediately responded and observed several individuals standing around a man, later identified as Mr. Webb, lying on the ground with blood coming from his head. Officer Bartles asked Mr. Webb if he could describe the assailant. Mr. Webb responded that \u201cthe shooter was a dark skinned black male.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Officer Bartles further testified that, on the day of the incident, uniformed patrol officers stopped two subjects in the first block of South Locust Street. Both subjects were taken to the precinct for one-on-one identification. Appellant, one of the subjects, was arrested and charged with the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The trial occurred on August 31, 2006. In addition to Mr. Webb and Officer Bartles, the State called eight witnesses. The relevant testimony is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Alice Smith, a neighbor of Mr. Webb, testified that she was outside at the time of the shooting. She observed Mr. Webb cross the street to speak to a light skinned black male on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>bike and then saw another man approach Mr. W ebb and shoot him in the head. Ms. Smith identified the weapon used as a silver handgun, about six inches long. She also testified that she heard the gun fire three times. When Ms. Smith was asked if she saw the man that shot Mr. Webb in the courtroom, she responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to say that he ... he looks very similar to the man. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s exactly him. Cause it has been a while since I\u2019ve seen him. But, yes, to me he does look a lot like him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Thirteen-year-old Amanda Sweeney-Teal testified that she met a man who introduced himself as \u201cTwenties,\u201d at the corner store on the day of the shooting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State asked Ms. Sweeney-Teal whether \u201cthat person that you met that was known as Twenty, that introduced himself as Twenty, do you see him in the courtroom today?\u201d She identified appellant as that man. She further testified that \u201cTwenties\u201d shot Mr. Webb and she saw three flashes from the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Ms. Sweeney-Teal\u2019s friend, Patricia Weedon, testified that she was walking with Ms. Sweeney-Teal when a man, whom she later identified as appellant, approached them and introduced himself as \u201cTwenty.\u201d She then observed Mr. Webb involved in an altercation with the boy on the bike and observed Twenty approach Mr. Webb and shoot him. She could not identify a weapon, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Brooke Rutherford, Mr. Webb\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, testified that she was standing outside at the time of the altercation. Ms. Rutherford identified appellant as the man who shot Mr. Webb. Ms. Rutherford further testified that she did not see the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The State also called Joshua Brown. Both of appellant\u2019s contentions revolve around the testimony of Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown testified that on January 8, 2006, at approximately 5:00 p.m., he was on Locust Street with a Mongoose bicycle with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201csomebody named Kevin.\u201d The State then asked Mr. Brown \u201c[w]hat happened?\u201d In response, Mr. Brown testified that \u201cthe boy named Kev shot [Mr. Webb].\u201d He stated that he had a silver, short gun and that, after he saw Kevin pull the gun out and heard it go off, he ran. He stated that no other friends were on Locust Street at that time. The State then continued questioning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">[State]: Are you familiar with an individual named Twenty?

Who were you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">[Witness]: The dude that was with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">[State]: Now, there was somebody with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-19\">[Witness]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-20\">[State]: Who ... where was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-21\">[Witness]: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-22\">[State]: Who was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-23\">[Witness]: He was around the corner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-24\">[State]: He stayed around the corner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-25\">[Witness]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-26\">[State]: When you say around the corner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-27\">[Witness]: Around the corner on Franklin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-28\">[State]: So, Twenty never came on to Locust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-29\">[Witness]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-30\">[State]: But Kevin Harris.... Let me ask you this, do you recall two girls being across the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>[Witness]: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">[State]: Okay. Earlier in your testimony you talked about two females that were walking and talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[Witness]: But they wasn\u2019t with me though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">[State]: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">[Witness]: They was not with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">[State]: Those two girls weren\u2019t with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">[Witness]: No, they was not \"with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">[State]: Okay.

How do you know Twenty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-16\">[Witness]: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-17\">[State]: How do you know Twenty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-18\">[Witness]: How do I know him?

Nothing further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-23\">Following Mr. Brown\u2019s, testimony, the State called Sergeant Paul Kifer, supervisor of the Criminal Investigation Unit, to the stand. The pertinent part of his testimony follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-24\">[State]: Okay. Sergeant, I\u2019m going to direct your attention to, ah, an incident that occurred on North Locust Street on January eight, 2006, a shooting. Are you familiar with that investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-25\">[Witness]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-26\">[State]: Okay. Ah, are you familiar with an individual named J.D. Brown or Joshua Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-27\">[Witness]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-28\">[State]: How are you familiar with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>[Witness]: We had gotten information as part of the investigation that there was someone that could possibly be----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor, to background. The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">[Witness]: Ah, someone possibly named JB or used the name JB. During our investigation with the Narcotics Task Force, ah, Mr. Brown was picked up in a separate incident, ah, as part of that investigation, brought into the police department. I was there at that time and Sergeant Robinson and I then interviewed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">[State]: Okay. When did the interview occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">[Witness]: That was on the tenth, I believe. Let me just refer to my notes here real quick. The tenth is when the ... the detail took place. He w as actually brought in and I actually interviewed him on the eleventh, early in the morning on the eleventh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">[State]: Of January?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">[Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">[State]: Did you speak to him about the shooting incident on January eighth, 2006?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">[Witness]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">[State]: Did he give a name or a nickname of a shooter? [Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">[State]: Impeachment, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">[Witness]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">[State]: What name did he give?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-19\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-20\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-21\">[Witness]: He gave the name of Twenty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-22\">[State]: Okay. Thank you. Nothing further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-23\">Appellant called no witnesses on his behalf. The jury convicted appellant on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">First, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce extrinsic evidence of Mr. Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement because the State failed to lay a proper foundation. Second, appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to call Mr. Brown as a witness for the sole purpose of impeaching him with a prior inconsistent statement that would otherwise constitute inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\n<em>A. Foundation Requirements to Admit Prior Inconsistent Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">At common law, Maryland followed the \u201cvoucher rule,\u201d which did not allow a party to impeach its own witness because the party \u201cvouched\u201d for the witness\u2019s credibility when putting him or her on the stand. However, a narrow exception existed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">While a party ordinarily may not impeach his own witness by proof of prior statements which are inconsistent with, or contradictory to, his testimony at trial, where such party satisfies the court that he has been taken by surprise and that the testimony is contrary to what he had a right to expect, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether or not proof of prior inconsistent statements should be permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\"><em>Hernandez v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 355, 365, 255 A.2d 449 (1969) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Even if the party was surprised, however, before proving the prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence, a proper foundation had to be laid. <em>Smith v. Briscoe, </em>65 Md. 561, 569-70, 5 A. 334 (1886). The foundational requirement was met by interrogating the witness as to when, the place at which, and the person to whom the contradictory statements were made. <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Castranda, </em>194 Md. 421, 439, 71 A.2d 442 (1950). If the witness denied making the prior statement or stated that he did not remember whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>he made it, the foundational elements for introducing the statement were satisfied. <em>Campbell v. Patton, </em>227 Md. 125, 141, 175 A.2d 761 (1961); <em>Moxley v. State, </em>205 Md. 507, 516-17, 109 A.2d 370 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In 1994, the Maryland Rules of Evidence were adopted, and the voucher rule was eliminated. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-607(\u201cThe credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Committee Note to Maryland Rule 5-607 (\u201cThis Rule abrogates the common-law voucher rule.... \u201d). Furthermore, the use of prior statements of witnesses, for the purpose of impeachment, including the required foundational elements, are now codified in Maryland Rule 5-613(a). The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">(a) Examining Witness Concerning Prior Statement. A party examining a witness about a prior written or oral statement made by the witness need not show it to the witness or disclose its contents at that time, provided that before the end of the examination (1) the statement, if written, is disclosed to the witness and the parties, or if the statement is oral, the contents of the statement and the circumstances under which it was made, including the persons to whom it was made, are disclosed to the witness and (2) the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">(b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent Statement of Witness. Unless the interests of justice otherwise require, extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible under this Rule (1) until the requirements of section (a) have been met and the witness has failed to admit having made the statement and (2) unless the statement concerns a non-collateral matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Maryland Rule 5-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">There is little case law commenting on or explaining the foundational elements, following the adoption of the Maryland rules. <em>See McCracken v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 330, 342-45, 820 A.2d 593 (2003). Because the common law foundational elements and the Rule foundational elements are essentially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>same, case law prior to the adoption of the Maryland Rules of Evidence is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The foundational requirements exist in order to be \u201cfair and just to the witness ... [so] that he may be enabled to refresh his recollection in regard to such statements....\u201d <em>Devan v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 182, 192, 300 A.2d 705 (1973) (quoting <em>Brown v. State, </em>72 Md. 468, 475, 20 A. 186 (1890)). The purpose of the foundational requirements is \u201cto accord the witness the opportunity to reflect upon the prior statement so that he may admit it or deny it, or make such explanation of it as he considers necessary or desirable.\u201d <em>Devan, </em>17 Md.App. at 193, 300 A.2d 705. The Court has also stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">there is no unvarying formula or ritual required for the establishment of a foundation to impeach. It is required that a witness be informed, sometime during the course of his testimony, that his interrogator is aware of and relying upon a statement the witness is claimed to have made at a particular time and place, to a particular person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">After the adoption of the Maryland Rules of Evidence, this Court, in <em>McCracken v. State, </em>150 Md.App. at 342-44, 820 A.2d 593, had an opportunity to analyze the foundational requirements that must be met before a prior inconsistent statement can be proved by extrinsic evidence. In <em>McCracken, </em>the defendant was arrested for carrying a concealed antique civil war gun into a bank. <em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 820 A.2d 593. After the defendant was arrested but before his <em>Miranda </em>rights were administered, the defendant told the police officers that if the trigger of the gun he was carrying was pulled, a projectile would be discharged and someone could be killed. <em>Id. </em>The trial court suppressed these statements. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 820 A.2d 593. The defendant testified in his own defense at trial, and during the State\u2019s cross-examination, he stated that the gun was not loaded or capable of being fired. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 820 A.2d 593. Without further questioning on cross-examination, the State then called one of the arresting officers in rebuttal to testify that the defendant had told him the gun was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>loaded at the time of arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 339-40, 820 A.2d 593. The State also relied on this testimony in its closing argument to reiterate to the jury that the defendant had told the officers the gun was loaded at the time of arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 820 A.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This Court found reversible error, stating that the State failed to lay a proper foundation before introducing extrinsic evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 820 A.2d 593. We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMA\">the State failed to give appellant an opportunity, during cross-examination, to explain his statements to the officers____ The prosecutor never asked appellant about the circumstances surrounding the statements he made to the officers at the time of his arrest, nor did he allow appellant to admit, deny, or explain the substance of the statements. Instead, the prosecutor waited for appellant to rest his case and then called [the arresting officer] to the stand as a rebuttal witness to impeach appellant\u2019s testimony through extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 344, 820 A.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The present case is unlike <em>McCracken. </em>The State\u2019s questions to Mr. Brown regarding the prior inconsistent statement sufficiently satisfied the foundational requirements. The State asked Mr. Brown if he was familiar with an individual named \u201cTwenty\u201d or if any of his friends used the nickname \u201cTwenty.\u201d He responded that he did not know any individual by that name. He was asked if he remembered being interviewed by Sergeant Kifer and Sergeant Robinson of the Hagerstown Police Department. Mr. Brown responded affirmatively. He further agreed that he had been interviewed regarding the shooting. Mr. Brown testified that he did not remember what he told Sergeant Kifer. The State further inquired whether Mr. Brown recalled telling Sergeant Kifer that Twenty was with him on Locust Street. Mr. Brown then testified that he did mention the name Twenty but he was not on Locust Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">It is clear from the questions asked and Mr. Brown\u2019s responses that Mr. Brown was given an opportunity to admit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>deny or explain the statement given to Sergeant Kifer at the Hagerstown Police Station. Mr. Brown was advised of the circumstances surrounding the statement. He testified that he could not recall what he told the police and initially denied knowing an individual named Twenty. Mr. Brown was given an adequate opportunity to reflect upon the statement and admit, deny or explain it while still on the witness stand. Thus, the State met the foundational requirements, and the court did not err in allowing the rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>B. Calling a Witness as Mere Subterfuge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court committed error by allowing the State to call Mr. Brown as a witness, asserting that there was no legitimate purpose in calling the witness other than to elicit his prior inconsistent statement that would otherwise be inadmissible. The State first counters by claiming that appellant failed to preserve the issue because appellant did not object when Mr. Brown was called to the stand. On the merits, the State argues that there is no evidence that the State had \u201cfull knowledge\u201d Mr. Brown was going to recant, and in any event, a valid purpose existed to call Mr. Brown to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We conclude that appellant preserved this issue for appellate review. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected as soon as the State began the line of questioning involving the prior inconsistent statement. Furthermore, appellant attempted to voice that Mr. Brown was the State\u2019s witness and before he was allowed to explain his reasoning the Court stopped counsel. Counsel\u2019s objection was sufficiently broad to preserve appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Maryland Rule 5-607 provides that \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-607.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A limited exception has been enunciated in case law, however, in that \u201c[t]he State cannot, over objection, have a witness called who it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>knows will contribute nothing to its case, as a subterfuge to admit, as impeaching evidence, otherwise inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Spence v. State, </em>321 Md. 526, 530, 583 A.2d 715 (1991). Although <em>Spence </em>was decided prior to the enactment of the Maryland Rules of Evidence, a number of cases have built on the foundation laid by <em>Spence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In <em>Spence, </em>the prosecutor told the judge during a bench conference that a witness \u201cwould testify that Spence was not involved, but that his purpose for calling [the witness] was to get before the jury prior out-of-court statements [the witness] had made to police officers that, in fact, Spence was one of the perpetrators of the burglary and robbery....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 583 A.2d 715. The Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]his blatant attempt to circumvent the hearsay rule and parade inadmissible evidence before the jury is not permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 583 A.2d 715. Furthermore, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he sole value to the State from Cole\u2019s testimony was that it opened the door for the \u2018impeaching\u2019 testimony for [the witness\u2019] prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The Court of Appeals built on the principles laid down in <em>Spence </em>when it decided <em>Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 636 A.2d 999 (1994). The defendant in <em>Bradley </em>was charged with kidnaping, armed robbery, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and related offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 636 A.2d 999. The defendant held the victim at gunpoint, ordered her into her car, and forced her to drive several blocks. <em>Id. </em>He then \u201cordered her out of the vehicle, grabbed her purse, and drove off in her car.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">To place the defendant in the car after it was taken, the State offered the victim\u2019s car phone bill, \u201cwhich indicated that calls were placed from her car phone to a particular phone number within one-half hour of the theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 636 A.2d 999. The State called the defendant\u2019s cousin, and he testified that he had received one or two phone calls from the defendant at a time subsequent to the theft. <em>Id. </em>In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question, the cousin then denied telling an officer that appellant had told him he had stolen a car. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The State put the police officer on the stand to recount the interview with the cousin. <em>Id. </em>The prosecutor indicated at trial that he knew before trial the cousin had recanted his earlier statements and there was a possibility he would do so on the stand. <em>Id. </em>at 597-98, 636 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On appeal, the State contended that because the cousin\u2019s testimony</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">substantively aided the prosecution\u2019s case, the State main-tainted] that the questions regarding the contents of his conversation with the defendant in no way violate <em>Spence ... </em>[because the State contends] if you call a witn\u00e9ss for a proper purpose, you may inquire into any additional relevant area for the sole purpose of opening the door for impeachment by a prior inconsistent statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 601, 636 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The Court disagreed, however, holding that \u201ca defendant is denied a fair trial if the State, with full knowledge that its questions will contribute nothing to its case, questions a witness concerning an independent area of inquiry in order to open the door for impeachment and introduce a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 636 A.2d 999. The Court qualified its holding by stating that \u201cour holding is not applicable where there is no clearly independent area of inquiry or where failure to inquire into a possibly independent area of inquiry could create a gap in the witness\u2019s testimony such that a negative inference may arise against the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 636 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In addition, the State is able to impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement if the witness\u2019s testimony is a surprise. <em>Id. </em>The Court gave the example in <em>Bradley </em>that if the cousin had been called to give favorable testimony to the State but unexpectedly did otherwise, impeachment would be permissible. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Furthermore, the Court stated that if the State does not create the need to impeach its own witness, then it is allowed to impeach the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 636 A.2d 999. As an example, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>if [the cousin] was asked \u201cwhat is your phone number?\u201d and he responded by providing his number, but then volunteered that \u201cmy cousin called me on April 1st and he told me that he purchased a car,\u201d the State should be permitted to counter this unresponsive answer with the prior statement that the defendant bragged about stealing a car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKS\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The Court of Appeals had another opportunity to address the State\u2019s impeachment of its own witness in <em>Walker v. State, </em>373 Md. 360, 818 A.2d 1078 (2003). In <em>Walker, </em>the defendant was charged with distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine on two separate dates in May, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 367 n. 1, 818 A.2d 1078. The State moved to compel the testimony of Myriek, a dealer whose drugs were supplied by Walker. <em>Id. </em>at 367, 818 A.2d 1078. During Myrick\u2019s direct testimony, he stated that Walker was not involved with the drugs and Walker was only in the area because Myriek owed him money. <em>Id. </em>at 368, 818 A.2d 1078. The State declared that it was going to impeach Myriek with a prior inconsistent statement given to the police, implicating Walker. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that the State was surprised by Myrick\u2019s testimony and allowed the State to attempt to impeach him with the prior inconsistent statement. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 818 A.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The Court of Appeals then adopted the analysis set forth by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Walker v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 505, 798 A.2d 1219 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>373 Md. 360, 818 A.2d 1078 (2003), and <em>Pickett v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 597, 707 A.2d 941 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Walker, </em>held that the only limitation on a party\u2019s ability to impeach its own witness is the subterfuge limitation. <em>Walker, </em>144 Md.App. at 518, 798 A.2d 1219. This limitation is only applicable if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>State has full, advance knowledge that the witness will recant his or her prior statement. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 798 A.2d 1219. Partial knowledge that the witness will recant is not sufficient to trigger this limitation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Thus, when only partial knowledge was demonstrated, because this Court could not expect the trial judge to \u201ccrawl inside the prosecutor\u2019s head to divine his or her true motivation[,]\u201d this Court applied the Maryland Rule 5-403 balancing test to determine whether a witness\u2019s testimony offered as impeachment was admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 798 A.2d 1219 (quoting <em>Pickett, </em>120 Md.App. at 604-05, 707 A.2d 941).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Court defined probative value as the \u201clikelihood of actually damaging the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 798 A.2d 1219 (quoting <em>Pickett, </em>120 Md.App. at 605, 707 A.2d 941). When analyzing the probative prong of the test, a court must determine if the witness has something useful to contribute to the prosecution\u2019s case other than the admission of his or her prior inconsistent statement. <em>Id. </em>This must be weighed against the prejudicial prong, which \u201crequires the court to consider whether the evidence prejudices the defendant unfairly, or misleads or confuses the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Furthermore, the witness\u2019s testimony must be evaluated to determine if the testimony is \u201cuseful to establish any fact of consequence significant in the context of the litigation,\u201d and therefore, the witness may be impeached by the prior inconsistent statement. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 798 A.2d 1219 (quoting John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 38, at 142 (5th ed.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Thus, the test laid out by this Court and adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Walker, </em>required the court to determine if the State had full knowledge that the witness was going to recant. If the State did not, the trial court was required to balance the probative value of the witness\u2019s testimony against its prejudicial nature to determine whether the State would be allowed to introduce a prior inconsistent statement to impeach the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Appellant relies heavily on <em>Spence </em>and <em>Bradley </em>to support its claim that the State was not surprised by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Brown\u2019s recanting his testimony, and therefore, the only purpose for calling Mr. Brown was to introduce Mr. Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement. To support his contentions, appellant argues that if the State truly expected Mr. Brown to testify favorably for the prosecution, the prosecutor would have mentioned his anticipated testimony to the jury during opening statements, as the prosecutor had done with other witness\u2019s testimony. The only other evidence appellant offers to prove the State had \u201cfull knowledge\u201d that Mr. Brown was going to recant his testimony was the prosecutor\u2019s use of Kevin Harris\u2019 last name even though Mr. Brown had only referred to him as \u201cKev\u201d or \u201cKevin\u201d throughout his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, we conclude that the record does not demonstrate that the State had full knowledge that Mr. Brown would recant his testimony. The prosecutor could have made a tactical decision to not include Mr. Brown in her opening statement, as she did not name every witness that was called at trial and describe the expected testimony. Furthermore, Sergeant Kifer testified that Kevin Harris was the other individual arrested by the Police Task Force. The fact that the prosecutor was aware of his full name only means that the prosecutor exercised diligence and awareness in preparing for trial. Neither of these pieces of evidence or anything in the transcript leads us to the conclusion that the State had full knowledge that Mr. Brown was going to recant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Furthermore, the State had a legitimate purpose in calling Mr. Brown to the stand. Mr. Brown was in the middle of the events that transpired on January 8, 2006. He was in possession of the bike that caused the dispute. He was arguing with Mr. Webb when Mr. Webb was shot that night. The fact that Mr. Brown decided to tell the jury \u201cThe boy named Kev shot [Mr. Webb,]\u201d in response to the question \u201cWhat happened\u201d does not mean the State \u201ccreated the need to impeach\u201d Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown could have fashioned a number of responses to that question that may not have risen to the level of allowing the State to impeach him. But because he responded with a direct contradiction of an earlier state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ment, he opened himself up to the possibility of the State impeaching him with the prior inconsistent statement. As said in <em>Bradley, </em>the State is not responsible when a witness \u201cblurts\u201d out a statement that harms its case and creates a need to impeach the witness. <em>Bradley, </em>333 Md. at 607, 636 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Assuming that the State had partial, but not full knowledge, appellant claims that the trial court failed to exercise the balancing test outlined above, and if the court had properly conducted the test, it would have concluded that the prejudicial nature outweighed the probative value of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The fact that the record does not reflect whether a trial court conducted the balancing test does not mean the court did not do so. \u201cThere is a strong presumption that judges properly perform their duties.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>144 Md.App. at 535, 798 A.2d 1219 (citing <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 273, 619 A.2d 105 (1993)). \u201cA trial court is \u2018not obliged to spell out in words every thought and step of logic\u2019 leading to its determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beales, </em>329 Md. at 273, 619 A.2d 105). Furthermore, \u201cthere is no requirement that the trial court perform the Md. Rule 5-403 balancing test <em>on the record.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Thus, we conclude' that when the circuit court overruled appellant\u2019s objection to the State using Mr. Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement and the rebuttal testimony of Sergeant Kifer, it properly conducted the balancing test and decided that the probative value outweighed any prejudice to appellant. There is nothing in the record before us that causes us to conclude the court abused its discretion. Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing the State to use Mr. Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. Ms. Sweeney-Teal testified that she met \"Twenties and some other boy\u201d on her way to buy sunflower seeds with her friend. She referred to him as \"Twenties\u201d throughout her testimony.
