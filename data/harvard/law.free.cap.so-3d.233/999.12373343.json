This case does not involve the \u201cstanding\u201d of the entity to invoke the judicial adjudicatory process. Specifically, these appeals stem from the reissuance of a permit by the Air Pollution Control Program (\u201cthe Air Program\u201d) of the Jefferson County Department of Health, which is governed by the Jefferson County Board of Health (\u201cJCBH\u201d), in 2014 to ABC Coke, a subsidiary of Drummond Company, Inc., pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401-7671q.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"aex-dedup-2\">ABC Coke operates a production plant (\u201cthe plant\u201d) located in Tarrant. The plant was built in 1919, and it initially manufactured munitions and other products to support the United States\u2019 efforts in World War I and World War II. Currently, the plant employs 385 people and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-14\">\u201cthe plant produces coke by heating coal in an oxygen-depleted environment, and the coke is then shipped to customers. The [coke] by-products are recovered through cooling settling and reaction processes to produce coke oven gas, tar, light oil and ammonium sulfate. The coke oven gas is consumed on site for energy recovery and the other by-products are sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">GASP is a not-for-profit corporation located in Alabama. In its pleading in the circuit court, GASP identified its corporate mission as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-16\">\u201cThe purpose of GASP is to further the conservation, preservation, protection, maintenance, improvement, and enhancement of human health and the environment on behalf of its members and in the public interest. GASP\u2019s current mission is to reduce air pollution, educate the public about the health risks of poor air quality, and encourage community leaders to serve as role models for clean air and clean energy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">JCBH is a local health authority established pursuant to \u00a7 22-4-1, Ala. Code 1975. This court has held that JCBH is a state agency. Smith v. Smith, 778 So.2d 189, 191 (Ala. Civ. App. 1999). Pursuant to \u00a7 22-28-23, Ala. Code 1975, JCBH established the Air Program, a local air-pollution-control program. JCBH has promulgated rules of administrative procedure applicable to hearings and appeals of administrative actions pertaining to the Air Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>Pursuant to Title V of the Clean Air Act,' 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401-7671q, ABC Coke is required .to obtain a permit to operate the plant every five years because of,the air-, pollutant emissions released by the plant during the production of coke and coke byproducts. JCBH, through the Air Program, functions as a \u201cpermitting authority\u201d for Jefferson County under the Clean Air Act. Se\u00e9 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">ABC Coke and its predecessors have had a Title V permit from JCBH to operate the plant for decades. ABC Coke last received a permit from the Air Program on November 17, 2008. That permit ivas scheduled to expire on November 17, 2013. On May 16, 2013, ABC Coke submitted an application to the Air Program seeking renewal of its Title V permit. According to, JCBH, ABC Coke was allowed to continue to operate under the expired permit because it had submitted a timely application for renewal before that permit expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">On February 9, 2014, the Air Program issued a 'draft' renewal Title V permit to ABC Coke. On the'same day, the\u2018Air Program issued a public notice of the draft renewal permit and also set an initial period to receive public comments on the draft renewal permit, which .was to end on March 11,- 2014. The Air Program subsequently held \u00e1 public-information session on March 31, 2014, at which citizens were provided information about the draft renewal permit and were given an. opportunity to ask questions and to offer comments for the public record. On April 9, 2014, the Air Program held a public hearing and responded in writing to. comments and questions that had been presented at the public-information session. Additional information sessions were held on April 12 and April 16, 2014. Forty-nine individuals or entities submitted written comments on the draft renewal permit, and 25 individuals spoke at the public hearing. On April 18, 2014, GASP submitted written comments on the draft renewal permit. The Air Program considered and responded to GASP\u2019s comments before issuing a final renewal permit, Major Source Operating Permit No. 4-07-0001-03, to ABC Coke on August 11, 2014. An order entered by a hearing officer during the administrative-review process, which is discussed in more detail below, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aih-dedup-2\">\u201c[t]he proposed permit and all related public comments were sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u2018EPA\u2019) for review. Pursuant to section 505(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA has a right to object to the [Air] Program\u2019s issuance of the permit if the permit contains provisions that are not in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7661d(b). EPA did not object to issuance of the permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_Ks\">On August 26, 2016, GASP filed a petition requesting a hearing before JCBH to contest the renewal of the Title V permit to ABC Coke. A healing officer was appointed by' JCBH to serve in the matter. ABC Coke filed a motion to intervene in the administrative proceedings, which the hearing officer granted. On November 4, 2014, the Air Program filed a motion to dismiss GASP\u2019s request for a hearing, citing alleged procedural defects in GASP\u2019s petition seeking the hearing. On the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>day, ABC Coke filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that GASP lacked standing to bring the petition because, it said, GASP had failed to establish that it is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the administrative action, as required under JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">On March 19, 2015, the hearing officer entered an order containing findings of' fact and conclusions of law. The hearing officer held that GASP had failed to demonstrate that it is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the administrative action of the Air Program and that GASP had not complied with Rule 12.4.4(d) of JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure, which requires a request for a hearing to include \u201ca short statement of the terms and conditions which a requester proposes that the Board should include in an order modifying or disapproving the [Air] Program\u2019s administrative action.\u201d Therefore, the hearing officer concluded, GASP was not entitled to a hearing. The hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions were submitted to JCBH. JCBH entered an order on April 8, 2015, approving the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">\u25a0 On May 8, 2015, GASP filed a petition for judicial review in the Jefferson Circuit Court pursuant to \u00a7 41-22-20, Ala. Code 1975. GASP, JCBH, and ABC Coke filed motions for . a summary judgment in the circuit court. On January 14, 2016, the circuit court entered an order granting GASP\u2019s motion for a summary judgment. The circuit court concluded that GASP qualifies as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure and that GASP\u2019s petition requesting a hearing before JCBH fulfilled the requirements of notice pleading under the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure. JCBH and ABC Coke filed separate notices of appeal to this court on February 24, 2016. We have jurisdiction of these appeals pursuant to \u00a7 12-3-10 and \u00a7 41-22-21, Ala. Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The appropriate standard of review applicable to an appeal from a trial court\u2019s judgment regarding a decision of an administrative agency is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">\u201cThis court reviews a trial court\u2019s judgment regarding the decision of an administrative agency \u2018without any presumption of its correctness, since [the trial] court was in no better position to review the [agency\u2019s decision] than\u2019 this court.

Whether GASP was Entitled to a Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">Throughout the proceedings, the parties have couched GASP\u2019s ability to obtain a hearing before JCBH in terms of its status as an association acting on behalf of its members. We note that GASP describes itself as a corporation and not an association. Although \u201can association may have standing solely as the representative of its members,\u201d Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 527 So.2d 125, 130 (Ala. Civ. App. 1987), corporations, on the other hand, \u201chave the right to sue, and shall be subject to be sued, in all courts in like cases as natural persons,\u201d Ala. Const. 1901, Art. XII, \u00a7 240, but do not have standing \u201cto enforce the separate property rights of [their] individual members.\u201d Frazer v. Alabama State Policemen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Inc., 346 So.2d 959, 961 (Ala. 1977). GASP has not asserted that it was injured through the issuance of the permit\u2014for example, that it owned property that was impacted by the issuance of the permit. GASP claimed in its petition for a hearing only that some of its members were injured by the issuance of the permit. The parties have not made any distinction between the ability of an unincorporated association to assert the rights of its members and the ability of a corporation to do so; accordingly, we will discuss the issues as framed by the parties, without determining whether such a distinction applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">ABC Coke and JCBH contend that GASP cannot contest the issuance of the Title V permit because it is not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under principles of standing applicable in the judicial system and under JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure. The case before us involves only the petition of GASP to have an administrative hearing before JCBH; it does not involve the issue whether GASP would have \u201cstanding\u201d to file suit in the judicial system. There is a distinction between the two issues. See, e.g., Ecee, Inc. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 645 F.2d 339, 349-50 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201cAdministrative adjudications ... are not [proceedings under Article III of the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>tion] to which either the \u2018ease or controversy\u2019 or prudential standing requirements apply;' within their legislative mandates, agencies are free to hear actions brought by parties who might be without standing if the same issues happened to be before a federal court.\u201d); see also 13B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, and Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3531.13, at 273 (3d. ed. 2008) (\u201cAdministrative agencies are not established under Article III and should not be bound by judicial rules of standing in determining what parties to admit to adjudicatory or rulemaking proceedings, any more than they are bound by other judicial rules of procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">ABC Coke and JCBH assert that the circuit court failed to apply the test to determine standing of an association as set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), which test was made applicable to actions commenced in Alabama courts by Bama Budweiser of Montgomery, Inc. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 783 So.2d 792, 795 (Ala. 2000). Under that authority, an organization must meet the following three requirements in order to have associational standing to pursue an action in the judicial system: \u201c(a) its members [must] otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect [must be] germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343. See Bama Budweiser, 783 So.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">ABC Coke and JCBH contend that GASP failed to show that it had standing as an association by neglecting to show that it or any of its individual members had been injured by the renewal of the permit. They contend that GASP failed to specify any particularized- injury in fact that any of its members suffered, failed to show that its members experienced injury to a \u201clegally protected interest,\u201d and failed to show that any injuries to its members were tied to an \u201cunlawful act\u201d of JCBH. Bama Budweiser and Hunt, among other cases upon which JCBH and ABC Coke rely, however, are cases involving the standing necessary to invoke the judicial adjudicatory process, i.e., to file a suit in the court system. The question here is whether GASP is entitled to a hearing before JCBH. As explained above, an administrative agency\u2019s rules and proceedings are not bound by federal standing requirements. See Ecee, 645 F.2d at 349-50. Agencies promulgate rules to address the question of \u201cstanding\u201d and to establish the eligibility criteria for contesting administrative actions within the administrative process. JCBH has done so by promulgating Rule 12 of its rules of administrative procedure. Rule 12.4 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a_c-dedup-0\">\u201c12.4.1. Any Person aggrieved by an administrative action of the [Air] Program, other than the issuance of any rule or regulation or emergency order, may file with [JCBH] a request for a hearing to contest such action ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-9\">\u201c12.4.2 Any person aggrieved by the issuance, modification or repeal of any rule or regulation by the [Air] Program may file with [JCBH] a request for a hearing to contest such administrative action within forty-five days of such action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag-B\">\u201c12,4.3 Any person aggrieved by the issuance of an emergency order by the [Air] Program may file with [JCBH] a request for an expedited hearing to contest such administrative action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Rule 12.2.2 defines the term \u201caggrieved\u201d as \u201chaving suffered a threatened or actual injury in fact.\u201d Rule 12.2.5 defines the term \u201cperson\u201d to include a corporation. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>its. petition seeking a hearing, GASP asserted that it was a not-for-profit, membership corporation, that it was seeking relief on behalf of its members, and that its members were aggrieved by the issuance of the permit to ABC Coke because they had suffered, among other things, injurious soot deposits, unpleasant smells, and dangerous exposures to airborne carcinogens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\">Pursuant to JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure, \u201cany person aggrieved,\u201d which includes a corporation (or an association as GASP has been considered by the parties), by. an administrative action may file a request for a hearing to contest such action. See Rules 12.2 and 12.4. GASP filed a petition for a hearing in which it alleged injuries suffered by its members resulting from JCBH\u2019s issuance of the permit to ABC Coke, which satisfied the requirements that JCBH has established to afford a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by an action an administrative review of the action. Again, JCBH and ABC Coke do not contend that GASP, as a corporation, could not assert claims on behalf of its members. Although JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure perhaps could have incorporated additional requirements based on standing principles applicable' in the court system, those requirements cannot be superimposed on JCBH\u2019s rules. GASP\u2019s petition met the requirements of JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure, and it was not required to meet anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">JCBH contends that the circuit court erroneously relied upon affidavits of GASP\u2019s members that more particularly detailed the injuries allegedly resulting from the issuance of the permit, which GASP submitted in support of its summary-judgment motion. Those affidavits were not presented to JCBH or the hearing officer. Section 41\u201422\u201420(j), Ala. Code 1975, a part of the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cthe AAPA\u201d), \u00a7 41-22-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, requires that the proceedings in circuit court \u201cbe confined to the record and the additions thereto as may be made under subsection (i) of this section .... \u201d Although we agree that the affidavits were not properly before the circuit court, we note that the affidavits were not necessary because, as we held earlier, GASP was not required to meet any judicial-standing'requirements but, rather, was required to demonstrate only that it was a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d and, thus, entitled to an administrative hearing under JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"aks-dedup-2\">II. \u2019 Procedural Sufficiency of GASP\u2019s Petition for a Hearing Under JCBH\u2019s Rules of Administrative Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">JCBH and ABC Coke also contend that GASP\u2019s petition for a hearing before JCBH was deficient under Rule 12 of JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure. Rule 12.4.4 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-8\">\u201cA request for a hearing to contest an administrative action of the [Air] Program shall be made in writing and shall contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-9\">\u201c(a) the name, mailing address, and telephone number of the person making the request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-10\">\u201c(b) a short and plain statement identifying the administrative action of the [Air] Program being contested;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKzh\">\u201c(c) a short and plain statement of the threatened or actual injury suffered by-the requester as a result of the administrative action of the [Air] Program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqPQ\">\u201c(d) a short statement of the terms and conditions which the requester proposes that [JCBH] should include in an order modifying or disapproving the [Air] Program\u2019s administrative action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-13\">\u201c(e) the .name, mailing address, and telephone number of the requester\u2019s attorney, if represented by an attorney.\u201d- ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>JCBH and ABC Coke contend that GASP\u2019s petition for a hearing failed to include a short statement of GASP\u2019s proposed terms and conditions that JCBH should include in an order modifying or disapproving the Air Program\u2019s draft: permit, as required by Rule 12.4.4(d). In its petition for a hearing, GASP contested the entirety of the administrative action of the Air Program in renewing the Title V permit and stated: \u201cGASP proposes that the Jefferson County Board of Health issue an order disapproving the issuance of M\u00e1jor Source Operating Permit No. 4-07-0001-03 in its entirety.\u201d GASP contends that its plea to JCBH to disapprove the permit in its entirety meets the requirements of Rule 12.4.4(d).' We agree; the single sentence quoted above plainly seeks an order containing terms and conditions denying the permit. We conclude that GASP\u2019s request that JCBH disapprove entirely the reissuance of the permit sufficiently met the criteria set out in Rule 12.4.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">JCBH and ABC Coke further contend that GASP\u2019s petition for a hearing before JCBH failed to allege any specific error committed by the Air Program in issuing the permit to ABC Coke. Although such a requirement is not contained in Rule 12.4.4, JCBH and ABC Coke contend that GASP was required by law to allege some legal error on the part of JCBH in the reissuance of the permit to ABC Coke before it was entitled to a hearing. In its order denying GASP\u2019s request for a hearing, the hearing officer concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">\u201cFirst, GASP does not say what the [Air Program] did wrong. GASP has identified no alleged error that the Program committed \u2022 in reviewing ABC Coke\u2019s Permit\u2014no fact or legal theory which, if proved true or accepted, would support that result. Without this basic information, the Request for Hearing is hollow and fails to meet the burden for establishing that GASP has standing, because there is nothing to redress. Daimler-Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 [126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589] (2006) (internal - quotation, omitted) ... \u25a0(\u2018A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u2019); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 [112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351] (1992). GASP\u2019s' alleged injuries, which amount to civil tort claims, are not able to [be] redressed by [JCBH] or the Hearing Officer. GASP\u2019s Request for Hearing is thus simply a grievance, overlooking a pleading requirement so fundamental that it is commonly taken for granted: unlawful conduct must be alleged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">The cases cited by the hearing officer involve suits filed in court challenging agency actions , and are appropriately analyzed under \u201ccase or controversy\u201d principles applicable to the issue of standing- under Article III of the United States Constitution. Alleging a specific error and/or asserting a legal theory for relief may be requirements for establishing a- case or controversy and invoking the judicial process, but they are not\" requirements contained in JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure. In order to effectively and appropriately conduct a hearing on GASP\u2019s objections, JCBH might require more information than what is contained in Rule 1214.4, but the absence of such information did not make GASP\u2019s petition for a hearing fatally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Subsections (b) and (c) of Rule 12.4.4 require \u201ca short and plain statement identifying the administrative action of the [Air] Program being contested\u201d and \u201ca short and plain statement of the threatened or actual injury suffered by the requester as a result of the administrative action of the [Air] Program.\u201d In its petition for a hearing, GASP stated: \u201cThe adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>trative action of the Jefferson County Department of Health Air Pollution Control Program which is being contested is the issuance of Major-Source Operating Permit No.. 4-07-0001-03 to ABC Coke, A Division, of Drummond Company, Inc., on August 11, 2014.\u201d Under the heading \u201cThreatened.or Actual Injuries Suffered,\u201d GASP stated that, among other reasons, it was seeking relief on behalf of its members who lived and worked in close proximity to the ABC Coke plant and that those members had suffered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amty\">\u201csoot (particulate) deposits that are injurious to their homes and interfere with the enjoyment of their hom\u00e9s; smells that are unpleasant in and around their homes; exposures to airborne carcinogens in concentrations that tend to be injurious to human health and welfare; and exposures to airborne carcinogens in concentrations that create an incremental increase in the risk of cancer that is greater than 1 in 100,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-2\">\u201c[Wjhere an agency prescribes rules and regulations for the orderly accomplishment of its statutory duties, its officials must vigorously comply with those requirements; regulations are regarded as having the force of law and, therefore, become a part of the statutes authorizing them.\u201d Hand v. State Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 548 So.2d 171, 173 (Ala. Civ. App. 1988). The AAPA allows agencies to promulgate rules, and \u201cso long as the agency holds out, through a duly adopted and promulgated agency regulation having the force of law, that a [specific] procedure is required\u2014 and since such an alternative to the AAPA procedure is authorized by \u00a7 41-22-20(b)\u2014the agency must be held to its own standard.\u201d Id. at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">JCBH\u2019s rules of administrative procedure do not require GASP to articulate the alleged error committed by the Air Program to receive a hearing. Perhaps GASP would need to advance such an assertion to establish \u2022 standing to invoke the judicial adjudicatory process, but such an assertion is not required to entitle GASP to an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">III. Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">GASP contends that the circuit court did not rule on all the claims raised by GASP in its pleading filed in the circuit court, including its petition for a common-law writ of certiorari and claims asserting violations of due process by JCBH. Accordingly, GASP contends that the judgment entered by the circuit court is not final and will not support the appeals filed by' JCBH and ABC Coke. GASP argues that the appeals should be dismissed, specifically claiming that when a summary judgment does not resolve all the claims against all the parties and is not certified as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ala. R. Civ. P., the judgment is not appealable. ABC Coke contends that the judgment of the circuit court ordered the matter remanded to JCBH to consider the merits of GASP\u2019s petition for , a hearing and that, therefore, GASP received all the relief it had requested. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">\u25a0 In GASP\u2019s pleading filed in the circuit court, the relief sought by GASP for the alleged violation of its due-process rights was that the circuit court set aside JCBH\u2019s decision \u201cdismissing GASP\u2019s Request for Hearing [and] set aside all intermediate filings of [the] Hearing Officer .... \u201d GASP also asked the circuit court to \u201cremand the matter to [JCBH] with directions to assign another Hearing Officer and make arrangements for the compensation of that Hearing Officer in a manner that does not violate GASP\u2019s due process rights ... [and] to conduct a new hearing ... in a manner that does not violate GASP\u2019s due process rights .... \u201d The circuit court remanded the matter to JCBH in order for it to grant GASP\u2019s request for a hearing and denied all of GASP\u2019s other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>requests for relief. The circuit court ordered that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-4\">\u201c[w]ith regard to the intermediary orders of Defendant JCBH which [GASP] made subject to its appeal, the Court\u2019s review of [GASP\u2019s] right to judicial review is only with regard to the ultimate disposition of the issue which caused [GASP] to be an aggrieved person, namely the issuance of the said Permit. All other intermediate orders for which [GASP] seeks review by this Court are not reviewable orders and are due to be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">\u201cA summary judgment rendered on all the issues presented, or for all the relief requested, is a final order which can support a timely appeal.\u201d Dees v. State, 563 So.2d 1059, 1060 (Ala. Civ. App. 1990)(citing Gamble v. First Alabama Bank, 404 So.2d 688 (Ala. Civ. App. 1981)). JCBH\u2019s decision was to dismiss GASP\u2019s petition for a hearing. The circuit court\u2019s judgment reversed that decision and held that GASP was entitled to a hearing. The circuit court\u2019s judgment disposed all of GASP\u2019s claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Furthermore, we note that a petition for the common-law writ of certio-rari, which GASP argues is a pending claim, is a method of review rather than a claim for relief. See Personnel Bd. of Jefferson Cty. v. Bailey, 475 So.2d 863, 867 (Ala. Civ. App. 1985). \u201cAlthough a party seeking review of a ruling by an administrative agency may petition the court for a common-law writ of certiorari, this means of review is allowable only when no statutory right of appeal or statutory certiorari review is available.\u201d Ex parte Worley, 46 So.3d 916, 921 (Ala. 2009). The existence of a statutory right to an appeal or another form of judicial review \u201cforecloses review by way of a petition for a common-law writ of certiorari.\u201d Id. at 922. Therefore, because the circuit court addressed all of GASP\u2019s claims for relief and there was no further action for the circuit court to take, the judgment is final and appealable. Dees, 563 So.2d at 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Although an agency is afforded deference in its decisions, the agency decision must be reversed when \u201csubstantial rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the agency action is ... [i]n violation of any pertinent agency rule.\u201d \u00a7 41-22-20(k)(3). See also Ex parte Wilbanks Health Care Servs., Inc., 986 So.2d 422, 425 (Ala. 2007). Because we find that JCBH\u2019s decision was not in compliance with its rules of administrative procedure, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court reversing the decision of JCBH and remanding the cause for JCBH to conduct the hearing requested by GASP.
