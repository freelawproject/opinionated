Code 1975, \u00a7 16-24C-1 et seq., involving Kevin Stewart (\u201cthe teacher\u201d), a teacher in the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Boaz school system. The superintendent of the Boaz school system, in a letter dated April 8, 2015, notified the teacher that termination of the teacher\u2019s employment would be recommended by the superintendent because of the teacher\u2019s work at a pawn shop during the course of a paid medical leave from.his employment as a teacher with the Boaz school system. After an ore tenus proceeding, the Boaz City School Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) voted to terminate the teacher\u2019s employment. The teacher timely sought appellate review of that decision,, and a hearing officer was appointed to hear the teacher\u2019s appeal on the administrative record. That hearing officer issued an order determining that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious and that the Board\u2019s decision was due to be reversed. The Board appealed to this court from the hearing officer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Under the SFA, hearing officers are to apply an \u201carbitrary-and-capriciouS\u2019 standard of review ... of employers\u2019 decisions under the SFA.\u201d Ex parte Lambert, 199 So. 3d 761, 768 (Ala. 2015). That standard \u201cis meant to be extremely deferential to the ... decision\u201d of a board of education employing a teacher, such as the Board in. this case, and \u201c \u2018require[s] ... deference to\u2019\u201d the pertinent board\u2019s decision from hearing officers \u201c \u2018even if [a hearing officer] would have reached a different result than did the [b]oard.\u2019 \u201d Huntsville City Bd. of Educ. v. Jacobs, 194 So.3d 929, 939 (Ala. Civ. App. 2014) (quoting Chilton Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Cahalane, 117 So.3d 363, 368 (Ala. Civ. App. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">We further note that, in undertaking appellate review of a hearing officer\u2019s order entered in a case governed by the SFA, we review that order with no presumption that the order, as opposed to the decision of the disciplining board of education, is correct. See Cahalane, 117 So.3d at 368 (noting that, in disciplinary proceedings under the SFA, school boards receive evidence and are triers of fact and that hearing officers are \u201cin no better position than is this court -to review\u201d disciplinary decisions of school boards under the SFA). Cf. Alabama Dep\u2019t of Youth Servs. v. State Pers. Bd., 7 So.3d 380, 385 (Ala. Civ. App. 2008) (noting that, in the analogous context of proceedings involving judicial review of an administrative-agency decision under the Alabama Adininistrative Procedure Act, Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 40-22-1 et seq., this court will review a circuit court\u2019s judgment without a presumption of correctness because the circuit court is in no better position to review an agency\u2019s decision than is this court). In effect, this court\u2019s review function under the SFA is similar to that' obtaining in administrative-law' settings generally\u2014that is, review of the underlying decision \u201cas though the [initial] appeal had been taken directly to this court.\u201d State Oil &amp; Gas Bd. v. Seaman Paper Co., 285 Ala. 725, 742, 235 So.2d 860, 876 (1970); accord Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Nunis, 252 Ala. 30, 34, 39 So.2d 409, 412 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">The record before the Board reveals the following facts. In pursuance of its responsibilities as to governance of the school system in the City of Boaz, the Board has adopted a policy' manual governing the conduct of, among other things, the Board\u2019s employees. Among the provisions of the policy manual is \u00a7 5.9.3, which governs paid sick leave of regular, full-time employees; two of its subdivisions provide as follows: \"</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-9\">\u201c5.9.3.a.1.3 Use of Sick Leave\u2014Eligible employees may only use sick leave for absences caused by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-10\">\u201c1. Personal illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-11\">\u201c2, Incapacitating personal injury..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA9F\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-12\">\u201c5,9.3.a.l.4 Certification\u2014Employees must certify that sick leave was used for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>one of the reasons provided in state law and specify the reason. If the employee\u2019s principal or department head has probable cause to believe that an employee has abused or misused sick leave, a physician\u2019s statement verifying the existence and nature of the illness or medical condition may be required by the Board. Abuse of sick leave may subject the employee to disciplinary action. \u201c[Reference: Ala. Code \u00a7 16-1-18.1 (1975) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">(Emphasis added.) The Board\u2019s policy manual also contains a prohibition of conflicts of interest, \u00a7 5.6, that provides that \u201c[e]mployees may not use their offices or positions for personal gain and must adhere to applicable provisions of\u2019 state ethics laws and may engage in \u201coutside employment\u201d only under particular terms and conditions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-5\">\u201ca. Employees will not engage in outside business activities or render any service for another employer during such time as duties and responsibilities have been assigned by the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">\u201cb. Employees will not accept outside employment that would interfere with or impair the ability of the employee to perform duties as a Board employee effectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">The teacher has worked as an agricultural-science instructor at Boaz High School since 2001 and has, on occasion, worked as a tennis and swimming coach there. On or before January 12, 2015, the teacher and two other persons formed a corporation called \u201cSand Mountain Pawn and Outdoors, Inc.,\u201d in order to operate an existing pawn-shop business that was conveyed to the incorporators by another person; according to testimony at the hearing before the Board, the teacher held a 35% ownership interest in the pawn-shop business. Soon thereafter, the teacher began disengaging from his work for the Board, directly notifying a superior on January 21, 2015, that he would no longer be able to coach tennis \u201c[d]ue to the advice of [his] physician\u201d and submitting a form \u201cabsence authorization\u201d dated January 26, 2015, obtained from a chiropractor stating that the teacher was under the chiropractor\u2019s cai-e and recommending that the teacher be \u201cexcused\u201d from January 27, 2015, through February 24, 2015. However, the particular illness or injury made the basis of the teacher\u2019s absence from his duties was not disclosed in either communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">On February 4, 2015, during the period for which the teacher had sought to \u201cexcuse\u201d his absence from his educational duties, another Board employee who had received information that the teacher was working at the pawn-shop business\u2019s location went to that location and observed the teacher assisting customers of the business; when asked why he was working for the pawn-shop business while on sick leave from his employment with the Board, the employee admitted that the question was \u201ckind of tricky\u201d but apparently did not provide a substantive answer. On February 10, in response to that encounter, the teacher hand delivered a letter to the school-system superintendent again formally requesting a medical leave of absence and a form signed by a physician at a family-medicine clinic stating that the teacher was \u201c[f]ully restricted\u201d from working \u201cuntil reassessment on February 24, 2015, and release[] by\u201d the chiropractor who had executed the January 26, 2015, form. Again, however, neither the letter nor the form specified an illness or injury suffered by the teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">On February 16, 2015, the Boaz school superintendent sent a letter to the teacher (\u201cthe February 2016 letter\u201d) stating that the work excuse from the family-medicine physician \u201cfailed to certify the information required under\u201d \u00a7 5.9.3 of the Board\u2019s pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>icy manual; directing the teacher to \u201cimmediately obtain certification regarding the existence, nature and extent of [his] medical condition,\u201d to include \u201cwhether reasonable accommodations might be provided by the Board so that [he could] continue working for the Board\u201d; and seeking, if no accommodations could be provided, \u201can explanation as to how [the teacher could] be unable to teach but still perform work\u201d for the pawn-shop busin\u00e9ss. The February 2016 letter was hand delivered to the teacher-at the pawn-shop business\u2019s location on February 18, 2015. Six days later, on February 24, 2015, the teacher sent an e-mail message to the superintendent stating that he was \u201crequesting to extend [his] medical leave\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he would \u201cremit [his] physician\u2019s certification\u201d on February 27, 2015. Also on February 24, 2015, the teacher\u2019s chiropractor prepared a letter to the superintendent averring that the employee was \u201cbeing treated for a serious chronic degenerative health condition\u201d that \u201ccan result in transient periods of partial to full incapacitation,\u201d that the chiropractor had conducted a \u201cre-examination\u201d of the teacher on that date and had observed \u201cremaining positive orthopedic tests, decreased range of motion, and weakness of the extensor muscles of the spine,\u201d and that the chiropractor could \u201crecommend no accommodations to [the teacher\u2019s] school work environment that [would] ensure[ ] the safety and well being of\u2019 the teacher or his students. The letter sought to extend the teacher\u2019s release from work until April 7, 2015, and stated that the teacher\u2019s condition would be reevaluated as to his ability to return to his work duties for the Board. The chiropractor\u2019s letter was provided to school-system personnel on March 4, 2015, in connection with the teacher\u2019s rejection of an offer by the Board to accommodate the teacher by allowing him to do light-duty work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">In light of the chiropractor\u2019s letter, the superintendent transmitted to the Board a recommendation on March 13, 2015, that leave for the teacher be approved for up to 12 weeks in duration, with paid sick leave and personal leave being expended first and the remaining leave being unpaid under applicable federal law. After the Board had accepted the superintendent\u2019s recommendation, the superintendent sent a second letter to the teacher (\u201cthe March 2015 letter\u201d) notifying him that, although his request for leave had been approved, he would be required, as of April 2, 2015, to pay for any further employee benefits and that the teacher would not receive regular pay for any further leave; the superintendent also represented that, under \u00a7 5.6 of the Board\u2019s policy manual, the teacher was not to engage in any outside business activities for other employers between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and warned that it would be the responsibility of the teacher to keep the superintendent informed as to the teacher\u2019s status. The March 2015 letter, like the February 2015 letter, was personally delivered to the teacher at the pawnshop business\u2019s location, where the teacher was observed to have been discussing arrangements of displays at the location.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">On April 8, 2015, after the teacher had been observed by private\u2019 investigators to have been exerting himself at the pawnshop business\u2019s location to pull and push heavy items such as shelving racks, lawn mowers, and pallets, he reported to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>for the Board without having obtained medical clearance. The superintendent thereafter sent a third letter to the teacher (\u201cthe April 2015 letter\u201d) informing him that the superintendent would be recommending to the Board that the teacher\u2019s employment be terminated. The April 2015 letter, among other things, stated that the teacher had not been present for work during school hours, averred that the teacher had been observed both before and after the granting of his medical-leave requests working at the pawn-shop business\u2019s location, and concluded that the teacher had \u201cnot been forthcoming about [his] ownership interest in the [pawn-shop business, [his] work there, and/or [his] medical condition/ability to work.\u201d The April 2015 letter also informed the teacher of his right to request a hearing before the Board regarding the proposed termination of his employment, which hearing was requested and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">At the hearing on the employee\u2019s termination, the employee testified that the condition for which he had sought chiropractic treatment was a detachment of-one of his ribs from his spinal column; he initially identified the detachment as having been a discrete event that occurred on January 27, 2015, the day after the chiropractor\u2019s \u201cabsence authorization\u201d form was completed, but later testified that the condition was one from which he had suffered for approximately 10 years before the hearing and that nothing had. \u201ctrigger[ed]\u201d his work absence in late January 2015. Further, the evidence adduced at the hearing revealed the teacher to have been a near-constant fixture at the pawn-shop business\u2019s location during his time off from his teaching-job between January 2015 and April 2015, and he admitted that he had not been \u201ccompletely forthcoming ... about how much [he had been] doing\u201d at that location with Board personnel. After the close of the hearing, the Board voted unanimously to terminate \u2022 the teacher\u2019s employment and issued a written decision observing that the evidence had established both the substance of the superintendent\u2019s grounds stated in the April 2015 letter and that the teacher had failed \u201cto adhere to [B]oard policy including but not limited to [\u00a7 ] 5.6\u201d (emphasis added).'</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Pursuant to Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 16-24C-6(a), a portion of the SFA, \u201c[t]enured teachers ... may be terminated at any time ... for incompetency, insubordination, neglect of duty, immorality, failure to perform duties in a satisfactory manner, or other good and just cause.\u201d In this case, the Board concluded that the. superintendent, in light of dhe teacher\u2019s ongoing involvement with the pawn-shop business during his absence from his work for the Board, had correctly identified the teacher\u2019s conduct with respect to seeking, obtaining, and using sick leave with respect to his long-standing chronic rib condition as being, in effect, a misrepresentation or suppression of his ability to work for the Board. Stated in another manner, the work absences on the part of the teacher between January 2015 and April 2015 could properly have been determined by the Board actually to have been \u201ccaused\u201d by his desire to perform duties in aid of the pawn-shop business that he co-owned so as to be outside the permissible scope of sick leave under \u00a7 5.9.3.a.l.3 of the Board\u2019s policy manual, especially given the teacher\u2019s conduct in reporting for work with no medical or chiropractic release to do so just after the paid component of the leave approved by &gt; the Board had expired in early April 2015. Compare Waters v. City &amp; Cty. of Montgomery Pers. Bd., 507 So.2d 951, 952 (Ala. Civ. App. 1986) (employee who had gone hunting while on sick leave properly held to have abused sick leave so; as- to- warrant termination of public employment).</p>\n<p id=\"ADpW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>As amicus curiae the Alabama Association of School Boards correctly notes, Standard 2 of the Alabama Educator Code of Ethics, which stipulates that educators \u201cshould exemplify honesty and integrity in the course of professional practice,\u201d Ala. Admin. Code (State Bd. of Educ.), Rule 290-4-l-.01(6)(c), also specifically proscribes \u201c[falsifying, misrepresenting, omitting, or erroneously reporting reasons for absences or leaves.\u201d Rule 290-4-1-.01(6)(e)2(iv). The Board\u2019s determination that the teacher\u2019s conduct in this case'warranted discipline was consistent with the duty of school systems under state administrative regulations of ensuring that \u201call educators ... who have contact with children ... act in accordance with\u201d that ethical code. Rule 290-4-l-.01(6). Thus, the Board\u2019s action, far from being arbitrary or capricious so as to run afoul of the standard espoused by our supreme court in Lambert, supra, falls squarely within the authority of a school board to terminate the employment of a tenured teacher for conduct within the scope of \u00a7 16-24C-6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">We conclude that the decision of the Board to terminate the employment of the teacher was proper. We do so notwithstanding the contrary conclusion of the hearing officer, who in our view improperly limited his inquiry in the order reversing the Board\u2019s decision solely to whether the conduct demonstrated in the eyidentia-ry record before the Board amounted to a violation of the conflict-of-interest provisions contained in \u00a7 5.6 of the Board\u2019s policy manual. Cfi Cahalane, 117 So.3d at 371 (holding that the same hearing officer as in this case \u201cerred in substituting his judgment for that of\u2019 the pertinent school board in that case). The order under review is, therefore, reversed, and the cause is remanded to the hearing officer with instructions to affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS..</p>\n<judges id=\"b1037-6\">Thompson, P.
