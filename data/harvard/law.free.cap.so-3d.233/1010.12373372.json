R. Crim. P., petition for postconviction relief. The petition challenged his February 17, 2006, conviction for murder, see \u00a7 13A-6-2, Ala. Code 1975, and his resulting sentence of 99 years\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed Mays\u2019s conviction and sentence on-- appeal in an unpublished memorandum issued on February 23, 2007. Mays v. State (No. CR-05-0954), 4 So.3d 584 (Ala. Crim. App. 2007) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">Mays filed an in forma pauperis application, which was granted. The instant petition, Mays\u2019s third, was deemed filed on December 28, 2015, and was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">Petitioner\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-17\">Mays filed the standard Rule 32 form found in the appendix to Rule 32, Ala, R. Crim. P., and selected as the basis of his claim ground 12(B), the court was without jurisdiction to render judgment or to impose the sentenc\u00e9. In- his memorandum supporting his petition, Mays alleged that he was given a mental evaluation to determine his competency but that the trial court failed to hold a hearing or to explicitly find him either competent or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-18\">State\u2019s Response</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-19\">The State filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that Mays\u2019s claim was procedurally barred by the following rules: Rule 32.2(a)(2) (precluding claims that were raised at trial); Rule 32.2(a)(3) (precluding claims that could have been raised at trial); Rule 32.2(a)(4) (precluding claims that were raised on appeal); Rule 32.2(a)(5) (precluding claims that could have been raised on appeal); Rule 32.2(b) (precluding claims that were presented in \u00e1 prior petition and' precluding new nonjurisdictional claims lacking an explanation establishing good caus\u00e9 why the new grounds could not have been presented in the'prior petition); and\" Rule 32.2(c) (precluding claims raised in an untimely petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-20\">The State then pleaded that the claim was not meritorious, specifically alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqjV\">\u201cA trial court is authorized to make a preliminary determination, without the aid of a jury, as to whether there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>dant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Nicks v. State, 783 So.2d 895 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). It appears that no order was entered as to competency as a result of Petitioner\u2019s mental examination. Neither Section 15-16-21 of the Code of Alabama (1975) nor Rule 11.6 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure require the trial court to make a specific written finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial when a competency hearing is not held. The Court\u2019s order to set this matter for trial after receiving and reviewing the results of the defendant\u2019s mental examination was a sufficient determination that the defendant was competent to stand trial. This Court complied with all rights invoked by Petitioner upon his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and his request for a mental examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azo-dedup-1\">(C. 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Circuit Court\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"au8-dedup-0\">The circuit court issued the following order dismissing the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-5\">\u201cORDER DISMISSING PETITION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-6\">\u201cOn or about December 30, 2015, the Defendant, Robert Thomas Mays, filed what appears to be at the very least his third petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 32 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Robert Thomas Mays is referred to herein as either \u2018the Defendant\u2019 or \u2018Mays\u2019). On December 13, 2005, Mays was convicted after a jury trial of the intentional murder of his mother and was later sentenced by Circuit Judge Frank Brunner to serve 99 years in the state penitentiary. His conviction was affirmed on appeal and his two subsequent Rule 32 petitions were summarily dismissed. The order dismissing his petitions [was] also appealed by the Defendant and affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-7\">\u201cIn his most recent filing, Mays argues that the trial court did not have the authority to proceed to trial without first making a determination as to his competency to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the offense. A similar argument was made in Nicks v. State, 783 So.2d 895 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). In Nicks, the Court held that the defendant\u2019s \u2018competency claim is procedurally barred by Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (5), Ala.R.Crim.P, as a claim that could have been, but was not, raised at trial or on appeal.\u2019 Nicks at 907. The determination of a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is a matter that is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Baker v. City of Huntsville, 516 So.2d 927, 931 (Ala. Cr. App. 1987). Even the Defendant concedes in his petition that \u2018[t]he court has discretion to determine if the underlying factual basis constitutes reasonable ground to doubt the accused\u2019s sanity.\u2019 It appears Mays is essentially arguing that the .trial judge in his case abused his discretion. After consideration of the petition, the court finds that the Defendant\u2019s present Rule 32 claim is non-jurisdictional and that it is time-barred pursuant to the provisions of Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 32.2(c). The claim made by Mays in his petition is also precluded by Rule 32.2(a), Ala.R.Ci'im.P., because it was or could have been raised and addressed at trial or on appeal. The petition is also due to be dismissed pursuant to Rule 32.2(b) as a successive petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-9\">\u201cThe Court further finds that because the Defendant has previously filed multiple postconviction petitions in this case, which have been summarily dismissed and affirmed on appeal, it is necessary to adopt reasonable measures to prevent further frivolous litigation by the Defendant that waste limited judicial resources. It is therefore ORDERED and DECREED as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>\u201c1. The Defendant is hereby expressly enjoined from filing any new petition, motion or pleading relating to any claim that he has previously raised on appeal or in a post-conviction petition for relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">\u201c2. In the event the Defendant files any other post-conviction motion, petition or pleading with this Court he shall execute a sworn affidavit \u00e9x-pressly certifying that the claims being raised are new claims that have not [been] previously raised by him in any previous filing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-6\">\u201c3. In the event the Defendant files any other post-conviction motion, petition or pleading with this Court he shall submit with his new petition or motion a summary of all previous post-conviction motions or petitions filed by him that relate to his conviction in the above case. The summary shall include the date of each filing; the claims made by him in each previous filing; the relief requested by him in each filing; a short statement as to the decision of the trial court with respect to each claim and, if the decision was appealed, the ruling of any appellate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-7\">\u201c4. Any request filed by the Defendant to proceed in forma pauperis shall include the information required in the above paragraphs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-8\">\u201c5. The Defendant shall be subject to the contempt power of this Court in the event he is found in the future to have submitted a false affidavit to the Court or to have willfully violated any other provision of this order. Upon a finding of contempt, the Defendant may be punished as provided by law and this punishment may include an additional period of incarceration for contempt after completion of his sentence in the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-9\">\u201c6. The Defendant shall be served with a copy of this order by personal service with return made to the Cull-man County Circuit .Court Clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-11\">\u201cThe filing restrictions placed on the Defendant by this order have been narrowly tailored to prevent continued frivolous filings by the. Defendant but are designed to allow him access to the courts in the event he has a meritorious claim. In the event any future filing by the Defendant does not conform to the procedure set forth herein, the court will not grant any application to proceed in forma pauperis and the Clerk is directed and hereby ORDERED to refuse to accept a filing fee for any future filings until the Defendant complies with the filing restrictions imposed herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">(C. 37-39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">When reviewing a circuit court\u2019s summary dismissal of a postconviction petition \u201c \u2018[t]he standard of review this Court uses ... is whether the [circuit] court abused its discretion.\u2019\u201d Lee v. State, 44 So.3d 1145, 1149 (Ala. Crim. App. 2009) (quoting Hunt v. State, 940 So.2d 1041, 1049 (Ala. Crim. App. 2005)). If, however, the circuit court bases its determination on undisputed facts, \u201can appellate court is presented with pure questions of law, [and] that court\u2019s review in a Rule 32 proceeding is de novo. State v. Hill, 690 So.2d 1201, 1203 (Ala., 1996).\u201d Ex parte White, 792 So.2d 1097, 1098 (Ala. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">Moreover, except for utilizing on appeal a preclusionary bar under circumstances that are not present in this ease, \u201cwhen reviewing a circuit court\u2019s \u2022 rulings made in a postconviction petition, we may affirm a ruling if it is correct for any reason.\u201d Bush v. State, 92 So.3d 121, 134 (Ala. Crim. App. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">On appeal, Mays reasserts the claim raised in his petition and further argues that the circuit court erred by failing to allow him to amend his petition and that the circuit court erred when it failed to allow Mays to rebut the State\u2019s response,</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Mays also presents a .claim not raised in his Rule 32 petition. Mays claims for the first time on appeal that the circuit court erred for failing to hold an evidentia-ry hearing on the due-process violations that resulted in Mays\u2019s being tried and convicted while incompetent. However, he did not allege in his petition that he was in fact incompetent when he was tried; therefore, this claim is not subject to review. See Arrington v. State, 716 So.2d 237, 239 (Ala. Crim. App, 1997)(\u201cAn appellant cannot raise an issue on appeal from the denial of a Rule 32 petition which was not raised in the Rule 32 petition.\u201d); see also Fincher v. State, 837 So.2d 876, 881 (Ala. Crim. App. 2002) (\u201cThis Court will not remand a case to the circuit court to hold an evidentiary hearing on a jurisdictional claim that was not presented in the petitioner\u2019s Rule 32 petition unless facts appear in the record affirmatively showing a lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">I.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">On appeal, Mays alleged that he was given a mental evaluation to determine his competency but that the trial court failed to hold a hearing or to explicitly find he was either competent or incompetent. Mays provides in his appellate brief additional facts in support of his claim. This Court will not consider- those additional facts. See, e.g., Bearden v. State, 825 So.2d 868, 872 (Ala. Crim. App. 2001) (\u201cAlthough Bearden attempts to include more specific facts regarding his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in his brief to this Court, those allegations are not properly before this Court for review because Bear-den did not include them in his original petition before the circuit court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Mays\u2019s claim is a procedural-competence claim. Procedural-competence claims, i,e., improper determination of whether a defendant should be given a mental evaluation, or whether the trial court should have held a hearing to determine if a defendant is competent or incompetent, are nonjurisdictional.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-10\">\u201cNicks claims that the circuit court erred in denying his Rule 32 petition because, he says, the circuit court failed to hold a hearing to determine his competency to stand .trial, despite what he says was sufficient evidence that he was incompetent to, stand trial. See Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). Nicks, in support of this claim, also makes the following arguments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-11\">\u201cA. That the court had a continuing obligation to conduct a competency hearing at any point during trial at which a \u2018bona fide\u2019 doubt as to his compet\u00e9nce to stand trial surfaced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak08\">\u201cB. That Alabama law required that any competency hearing be conducted in front of a jury and that any competency determination be -left to the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-12\">\u201cC. That the evidence of his lack of competence to stand trial was sufficient to. require the circuit court to hold a competency hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avd-dedup-2\">\u201cD. That the remedy for the circuit court\u2019s error is to hold a retrospective hearing on his competence to stand trial, or, if that is not practical, to vacate his conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-13\">\u201cThe state argues, and we agree, that this competency claim is procedurally barred by Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (5), Ala. R. Crim. P., as a claim that could have been, but was not, raised at trial or on appeal. See Medina v. Singletary, 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>F.3d 1095, 1106 (11th Cir. 1995)(stating \u2018[a] Pate claim \u201ccan and must be raised on direct appeal\u201d\u2019)- Cf. Matthews v. State, 671 So.2d 146 (Ala. Cr. App. 1995), and Dill v. State, 600 So.2d 343 (Ala. Cr. App. 1991)(each raising on- direct appeal a trial court\u2019s failure to sua sponte order a Pate hearing); James v. Singletary, 957 F.2d 1562 (11th Cir. 1992)(holding that a Pate claim \u2018can and must be raised on direct appeal\u2019); and Thomas v. State, 766 So.2d 860 (Ala. Cr. App. 1998)(holding that whether the competency hearing was constitutionally inadequate and its results inherently unreliable was procedurally barred pursuant to Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (5), Ala. R. Crim. P.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Nicks v. State, 783 So.2d 895, at 906-07 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Therefore, as pleaded by the State and found by the circuit court, this claim was procedurally barred by Rule 32.2(a)(3), because it could have been, but was not, raised at trial; Rule 32.2(b), because it was presented in a successive petition; and, Rule 32.2(c), because the petition was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Mays argues on appeal that the circuit court abused its discretion by failing to allow him to amend his petition. However, Mays did not raise this issue by posttrial motion, such as a motion to reconsider; therefore, the issue was not preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-9\">\u201cThe record reflects that Broadnax did not raise this issue in the circuit court, by way of postjudgment motion, or otherwise. Cf. Loggins v. State, 910 So.2d 146, 149 (Ala. Crim. App. 2005) (recognizing a motion to reconsider as a valid postjudgment motion in the Rule 32 context). It is well settled that \u2018[t]he general rules of preservation apply to Rule 32 proceedings.\u2019 Boyd v. State, 913 So.2d 1113, 1123 (Ala. Crim. App. 2003). See also Slaton v. State, 902 So.2d 102, 107-08 (Ala. Crim. App. 2003).... Therefore, this issue was not properly preserved for this Court\u2019s review and will not be considered;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">Broadnax v. State, 130 So.3d 1232, 1241 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Moreover, the circuit court' dismissed the petition on April 14, 2016; Mays\u2019s motion to amend was filed on April 15, '2016. Rule 32.7(b) allows amendments only prior to the entry of judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-14\">\u201cBryant\u2019s second amended petition was clearly untimely, having been filed after entry of judgment, and. was properly stricken by the circuit court. See Rule 32.7(b), Ala. R. Crim. P. (\u2018Amendments to pleadings may be permitted at any stage of the proceedings prior to the entry of judgment.\u2019 (emphasis added)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-15\">\u201cMoreover, the striking of Bryant\u2019s second amended' petition was not contrary to \u2018Rule 32\u2019s liberal amendment policy,\u2019 as Bryant contends, because although amendments to Rule\u2019 32 petitions are to be freely granted, that general rule applies only to amendments timely filed before judgment is entered. Because Bryant\u2019s second amended petition was untimely filed after entry of judgment, the circuit court properly refused to consider it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-16\">Bryant v. State, 181 So.3d 1087, 1135-36 (Ala. Crim. App. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-18\">In the third issue presented by Mays on appeal, he argues that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, because he did not present this issue to the circuit court it is not before us. See Broadnax, supra, and Arrington, supra,</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-19\">Moreover, with regard to Mays\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>missing his claims without first allowing him an opportunity to respond to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, this Court has recently addressed this precise issue in Mashburn v. State, 148 So.3d 1094 (Ala. Crim. App. 2018), and held that Rule 32 does not require a circuit court to permit a Rule 32 petitioner to file a response to the State\u2019s answer or motion to dismiss.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqsD\">\u201c \u2018Rule 32.7(a), Ala. R. Crim. P., allows the State 30 days to file a response to the Rule 32 petition. There is, however, no provision in Rule 32 for the petitioner\u2014who, pursuant to Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R. Crim. P., should have included the full factual basis for his request for relief and each of his legal assertions in his Rule 32 petition\u2014to file a reply to the State\u2019s response.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">148 So.3d 1114 (quoting Jenkins v.

P.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-8\">\u201c[i]f the court determines that the petition is not sufficiently specific, or is precluded, or fails to state a claim, or that no material issue of fact or law exists which would entitle the petitioner to relief under this rule and that no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, the court may either dismiss the petition or grant leave to file an amended petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">See also Hannon v.

Because Mays\u2019s claim was precluded, summary disposition was appropriate. For the reasons stated above, Mays is also due no relief of the second and third issues argued on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1062-13\">Windom, P.J., and Burke and Joiner, JJ., concur.
