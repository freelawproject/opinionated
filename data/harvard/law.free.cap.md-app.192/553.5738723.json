Subtitle 3 applies to specific diseases, one of which (at Part IV) is tuberculosis. H-G section 18-324, entitled \u201cControl of communicable tuberculosis,\u201d authorizes the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cSecretary\u201d) or a health officer to have a person examined for tuberculosis upon learning that the person is suspected of having tuberculosis; and that, upon a finding that the person has tuberculosis and the person\u2019s condition endangers or may endanger the public, to \u201corder the individual to receive appropriate medical care.\u201d H-G \u00a7\u00a7 18-324(a) and (b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>H-G section 18-325 prohibits the following acts by people suffering from communicable tuberculosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">(a) <em>Refusal to enter health facility. </em>\u2014 An individual may not refuse to comply with the placement ordered under \u00a7 18-324 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">(b) <em>Disorderly behavior; leaving before proper discharge. </em>\u2014 While an individual is in any placement for tuberculosis treatment, the individual may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">(1) Behave in a disorderly manner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">(2) Leave the placement before being discharged property-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The statute also criminalizes those acts and imposes penalties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">(c) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 An individual who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be imprisoned in a penal institution with facilities for tuberculosis treatment until the Secretary or the Health Department of Baltimore City finds that the condition of the individual no longer endangers the health of the community, or the Secretary obtains a court order that states that the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">(1) Is to be moved to a specified less restrictive setting for continuation of treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">(2) Must comply with the treatment until the Secretary determines the treatment has been completed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">(3) May not behave in a disorderly manner or leave the placement until the Secretary determines that the individual has completed the treatment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">(4) Following a hearing, will be reimprisoned until the Secretary determines that the individual has completed the treatment, if the individual does not comply with the terms of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">In the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, Isaac Livingston, the appellant, was convicted in a bench trial of one count of refusing to comply with a placement order issued by the Secretary, in violation of H-G section 18-325(a), and one count of behaving in a disorderly manner while in a placement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>tuberculosis treatment, in violation of H-G section 18-325(b)(1). He was sentenced to a penal facility for the treatment of tuberculosis until the Secretary either determined that his condition no longer endangered the health of the community or obtained a court order consistent with H-G section 18-325(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On appeal, Livingston presents two issues for review, which we have reworded and reordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">I. Did the trial court err in ruling that H-G section 18-325(b)(1) is not unconstitutionally vague?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">II. Was the evidence legally sufficient to sustain Livingston\u2019s convictions?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Livingston, age 52 at the relevant time, was diagnosed with tuberculosis while living in Augusta, Georgia. He relocated to Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, for the purpose of securing better medical care. Following his arrival, the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>issued an order directing him to be placed at Deer\u2019s Head Hospital (\u201cthe hospital\u201d) in Wicomico County for tuberculosis treatment. The order was issued on February 4, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Livingston drove himself to the hospital on the evening of February 5, 2008. He was assigned to an isolation room. The isolation room opened to an anteroom where hospital staff would put on their gowns and protective hoods or masks before entering Livingston\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Rebecca Gravenor, a registered nurse and \u201cinfection control practitioner\u201d at the hospital, testified that, on February 7, 2008, she spoke to Livingston about the required procedures at the hospital and advised him that he had to wear a mask whenever he left his room to go into the anteroom or the hallway. According to Gravenor, the purpose of wearing the mask was \u201c[t]o prevent large droplet spray from the patient,\u201d because coughing, speaking, yelling, singing, and breathing all can force tuberculosis bacteria into the air and cause the disease to spread. Initially, Livingston was allowed to go outside the hospital building onto the hospital grounds, which included a dock where he could sit without wearing a mask so long as no one was within 50 feet of him. Gravenor explained that fresh air is good for tuberculosis patients, and that the \u201cTB germ dies in sunlight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A few days after Livingston arrived at the hospital, Grave-nor observed him standing beside his car in the hospital parking lot. He was not wearing a mask and other people had walked within 20 feet of him. When she and other hospital employees approached Livingston, he put his mask on.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">On February 15, 2008, Livingston\u2019s grounds privileges were revoked and he was required to stay in his room. A sign was placed on the outside of the door to Livingston\u2019s room warning that \u201cthis patient is not to leave this room for any reason.\u201d On one occasion after Livingston\u2019s grounds privileges had been revoked, Gravenor entered the anteroom and, before she could put on the protective equipment, Livingston opened the door between his room and the anteroom. When she asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>him to return to his room until she had donned her protective equipment, he complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Barbara Rolf, a nurse who regularly worked from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., testified that Livingston occasionally came out of his room without a mask on, entered the anteroom, and looked out a window in the anteroom. She never saw Livingston outside the anteroom without a mask. While Livingston was at the hospital, Rolf frequently spoke with him because he was \u201cawake a lot at night.\u201d On March 5, 2008, Livingston told her, \u201cI need to get out of here or I will be in the pen or I will hurt someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Amanda Insley worked as a charge nurse at the hospital. She testified that on March 10, 2008, as she was entering the hospital building to begin work at 7:00 a.m., she observed Livingston and a hospital staff member standing near Livingston\u2019s parked car. Livingston was about a foot away from Insley. The hospital staff member was wearing a protective mask, but Livingston was not. Insley reported the incident to a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Portia Mathews also worked as a nurse at the hospital. On March 15, 2008, she spoke with Livingston about leaving his hospital room. Livingston told her that \u201che was under the assumption that he could leave the unit\u201d at night because there were less people around. Mathews told him that he could not, and that he had to stay in isolation in his room. Livingston responded that he would not leave again. About two days later, Mathews observed Livingston enter the anteroom without wearing a mask.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">On March 19, 2008, Mathews worked from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. When she left the hospital building at about 11:30 p.m., she saw Livingston\u2019s vehicle parked about four spaces from the hospital entrance. The next morning, she noticed that Livingston\u2019s vehicle had been moved. She did not see Livingston driving his vehicle, however. Upon entering the hospital, Mathews went to Livingston\u2019s room. There she saw a Tiger Mart coffee cup with coffee in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Mathews acknowledged that she never saw a list outlining what Livingston could and could not do while at the hospital. She testified that the infection control nurse educates patients about tuberculosis isolation guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Jeanne Abbott, a nursing assistant, testified that, on Livingston\u2019s second day in the hospital, a nurse gave her and another nursing assistant a mask and asked them to go outside and give it to Livingston, tell him he could not be outside without it, and ask him to return to his room. Abbott testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP4\">We found [Livingston] out in his vehicle in the parking lot. We went out there to tell him and he cursed at us. He said he knew he was supposed to have a mask and he had one there but since he was outside he wasn\u2019t putting it on. In fact, he didn\u2019t wear it out, he didn\u2019t have it in there, so we gave him another one and instructed him that he had to put this on and he needed to go back to his room. He flatly refused and cursed at us and we went back in to instruct the charge nurse as to what had happened. And they called security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Abbott also testified that on March 16, 2008, she went to Livingston\u2019s room in response to a call bell. She looked in a window to the anteroom and did not see anyone. When she pushed the door open, however, Livingston \u201cwas right there in [her] face,\u201d without a mask on.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Another nursing assistant at the hospital, Megan Towers, testified that on March 16, 2008, while she was working the 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. shift, she responded to Livingston\u2019s call bell. When she entered the anteroom, Livingston was there with his mask around his neck. She asked him to put on his mask and she quickly stepped out of the anteroom. After Livingston put on his mask, Towers reentered the anteroom. Livingston told her he had a rash on his neck and the nurse was supposed to put Benadryl on it. Towers told Livingston she would contact a nurse for him, which she did, but the nurse was involved in \u201ca situation down the hall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">About a half hour to 45 minutes later, Livingston rang his call bell again. When Towers responded, Livingston wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>to know where the nurse was. She told him the nurse was busy with another situation. According to Towers, Livingston \u201cstated that this was fucking ridiculous. That he needed attention and it\u2019s fucking ridiculous that nobody can come in and see him.\u201d Livingston asked for everyone\u2019s name, which Towers gave him, and continued to curse at her. When Towers told Livingston that she did not have to listen to his cursing, \u201che lunged at [her] with his fist in the air.\u201d His right hand was balled into a fist and came within a couple of inches of her. Towers ran out of the room and reported to the charge nurse what had happened because she \u201cwas scared.\u201d Thereafter, Towers returned to Livingston\u2019s room with Patricia Drayton, a nurse, who tried to calm him down. He continued to be irate and to curse, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Towers also testified that, on other occasions, Livingston was in the anteroom without a mask on. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">There would be times when instead of ringing his bell [Livingston] would come to the door of the anteroom, which there\u2019s a small window there and look out for somebody without his mask on. And that\u2019s concerning because that\u2019s where we gear up. And then there would be times if I went into his room to do things, and then when I left I\u2019d take everything off and he\u2019d open the door and ask me a question when I was not protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Patricia Drayton testified that Livingston had, on occasion, left his room without wearing a protective mask. She stated that, at one time, when he was placing his dinner tray in the anteroom, she advised him he could not do so. On a couple of occasions, he went into an unoccupied adjoining isolation room and used a telephone and the bathroom without wearing a mask.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Drayton also testified about the incident in which Livingston lunged at Towers. According to Drayton, after Towers reported the incident to her, she went to Livingston\u2019s room. As she entered, he jumped up out of a chair by the door, faced her, and started cursing. She backed out of the doorway because she felt threatened. Drayton told Livingston he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>not threaten her staff. When he denied doing so, Drayton said she would report to the supervisor Towers\u2019s claim that Livingston had lunged at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Livingston testified on his own behalf. He claimed he never was given a copy of any rules about use of the protective mask, and that he received conflicting information from hospital staff members about when and where he had to wear the mask. According to Livingston, Gravenor told him he had to wear a mask when he left his room, but that he could take the mask off outside if no people were around, although \u201cif somebody was within five feet of [him,] [he] was supposed to have a mask on.\u201d He also was told that he could go outside and, as long as he told a staff member he was doing so, there were no restrictions on how long he could stay out. On one occasion, after he told a staff member he was going outside, he fell asleep on a bench on the hospital grounds. He later was awakened by a nurse who told him that people were looking for him and did not know where he was. Subsequently, his privilege to leave his room was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Livingston further testified that he was not required to wear a mask while in his room, and that he never was told that he had to wear a mask while in the anteroom. He would place his dirty laundry in a basket in the anteroom and his cup in the anteroom when he needed ice. His food trays were left on the floor of the anteroom for him to pick up. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-o\">I was never told to wear the mask while I was in the room or when I changed my laundry or anything, the room that\u2019s coming into my room, nobody never told me I had to put a mask on when I put the laundry and stuff in the basket. That\u2019s the door they\u2019re talking about me looking out whatever, I was never told that, sir. I mean, I would have done it if I knew it, but when I seen somebody coming towards my room, I was trying to get my mask on, you know, I\u2019d catch myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Livingston denied ever going out the door of the anteroom into the hospital hallway without wearing a mask. He also denied ever driving his vehicle oft the hospital grounds. He admitted that every morning he went outside to warm up his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>vehicle and, on one occasion, he moved his vehicle from one space to another \u201cfor it to warm up\u201d because it had been sitting unused for a while.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Livingston acknowledged that he had had a conversation with Rolf in which he said he had to get out of the hospital or he would end up hurting someone. He denied having any plans to hurt Rolf, and attributed his feelings to \u201cthe frustration [he] was going through, the way [he] was being treated, and stuff of that nature.\u201d Livingston also acknowledged becoming \u201ca little agitated\u201d when a nurse did not respond to his request for cream for a rash on his neck. According to Livingston, Towers never came back to his room to tell him that the nurse was dealing with another situation and, when no nurse arrived after 45 minutes, he \u201cfelt kind of bad about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In finding Livingston guilty of failing to comply with the placement ordered by the Secretary, under H-G section 18-325(a), the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Now, I think clearly within the context of treatment and quarantine, an order to Mr. Livingston that he stay \u2014 after February when his grounds privileges were revoked, it\u2019s clear to me that he had been instructed that he was to remain in his room and that it was only within his room that he did not have to wear a mask, if he left his room he had to wear a mask. And I think it\u2019s clear also that he was under some circumstances, conditions at times permitted to go into the anteroom, but if he did so he had to wear his mask. And it\u2019s clear from the testimony of a number of witnesses that he did not do so on a number of occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">And I think that clearly falls within the scope of the initial order paragraph of State\u2019s Exhibit 1. And I note that 18-325(a) states that an individual may not refuse to comply with the placement ordered under Section 18-324 of this subtitle, and 18-324 of the subtitle provides that the order for placement can contain other conditions as the Secretary believes are necessary and those other conditions were, of course, that he be quarantined and submit to the treatment that was required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>So it seems to me clear that these failures on his part, which I find to be established beyond a reasonable doubt, did violate the terms of and were failures to comply with the terms of the placement order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As already noted, the trial judge also found Livingston guilty of behaving in a disorderly manner, under H-G section 18-325(b)(l). The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Well, with respect to count two, which is the disorderly conduct, I agree with [defense counsel] that the [s]tatute does not give us a great deal of help in defining disorderly conduct. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to look at the criminal statute for disorderly conduct for some guidance. But I think also that this particular provision has to be interpreted with respect to the context in which it is used, and it is disorderly conduct in a treatment facility for tuberculosis. So what may or may not be disorderly conduct in the rest of the world may provide guidance but is not controlling, I don\u2019t think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">And it seems clear to me that with respect to Mr. Livingston\u2019s contact in dealing with Ms. Towers on March 16th and with Nurse Drayton that it did \u2014 I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Livingston is guilty with respect to count two based on that. I will say just for clarity, I don\u2019t include Ms. Abbott in that, the facts and circumstances are such she opens the door and he\u2019s standing at the door, it could be that he was lurking there to startle her but it could be that he simply happened to be there and it was sort of incidental or accidental contact that brought him that close to her. He was in the room, he wasn\u2019t required to wear a mask within the room, so I\u2019m not really considering the evidence with respect to Ms. Abbott in reaching this decision with respect to count two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Livingston contends that H-G section 18-325(b)(l), which criminalizes behaving in a disorderly manner at a placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>for tuberculosis treatment, is unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed and fails to provide legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for triers of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The State responds that Livingston did not raise this issue below and that it lacks merit in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal on all charges, including Count 2 (behaving in a disorderly manner in violation of H-G section 18-325(b)(l)). In support of his argument on that count, he maintained that the phrase \u201cdisorderly manner\u201d should be given the same meaning that has been applied to that phrase as used in Md.Code (2002) section 10-201(e)(2) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), which prohibits \u201cwillfully act[ing] in a disorderly manner that disturbs the public peace.\u201d Defense counsel asserted that Livingston\u2019s behavior did not constitute acting in a disorderly manner within that meaning because the evidence established only that he had expressed his views \u201cin a loud manner.\u201d Alternatively, defense counsel asserted that, if the trial court rejected the argument that \u201cdisorderly manner\u201d is a term of art as used in CL section 10-201, and instead analyzed the meaning of the phrase by way of the common usage of the word \u201cdisorderly,\u201d the statute would be \u201cvoid for vagueness because we don\u2019t know what disorderly behavior is[,]\u201d and a law must \u201cput one on notice as to what behavior is to be anticipated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The court denied Livingston\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on Count 2. At the close of all the evidence, defense counsel renewed the motion, stating, in part, that as to Count 2 he would \u201csubmit on arguments previously submitted.\u201d The trial court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal on Count 2. The judge acknowledged that the Criminal Law Article offers some guidance in ascertaining the meaning of \u201cdisorderly manner,\u201d but reasoned that the phrase must be interpreted by common usage in the context of conduct in a treatment facility for tuberculosis. In so ruling, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>implicitly rejected Livingston\u2019s void-for-vagueness argument. Accordingly, the constitutional issue both was raised in, and decided by, the trial court, and is preserved for our review. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(a) (stating that a non-jurisdictional issue is preserved for appellate review when it was raised before or decided by the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In deciding the constitutionality of a statute, we begin with the presumption that the statute is valid. <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 610, 781 A.2d 851 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002). We will not find a statute unconstitutional if, \u201c \u2018by any construction, it can be sustained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Beauchamp v. Somerset County, </em>256 Md. 541, 547, 261 A.2d 461 (1970)). When the challenge to a statute is based on vagueness, the burden of establishing unconstitutionality is on the party attacking the statute. <em>Id. </em>As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Galloway, </em>however, when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae9\">a statute violates a \u201cmandatory provision\u201d of the Constitution, \u201cwe are required to declare such an act unconstitutional and void.\u201d ... Therefore, if it is established that the statute is vague \u2014 offends due process \u2014 and/or overbroad\u2014 sweeps within the ambit of constitutionally \u201cprotected expressive or associational rights\u201d \u2014 then the statute is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The \u201cvoid-for-vagueness doctrine,\u201d as applied to the analysis of penal statutes, requires courts to consider two criteria. The first criterion is that a statute must be \u201csufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u201d <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 459, 569 A.2d 604 (1990) (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted). \u201cThe standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is whether persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615, 781 A.2d 851 (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted) (alteration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>original). \u201cA law is not vague simply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard.\u201d <em>Ernes, </em>318 Md. at 459, 569 A.2d 604. Nor is a statute vague under the fair notice principle \u201cif the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, <em>if </em>they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615, 781 A.2d 851 (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The second criterion pertains to enforcement. It requires \u201cthat criminal statutes provide \u2018legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 781 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 8-9, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992)). Commenting on this criterion, the Court of Appeals in <em>Galloway </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">To survive analysis, a statute must \u201ceschew arbitrary enforcement in addition to being intelligible to the reasonable person.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d at 1279.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[A] statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWz\"><em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615-16, 781 A.2d 851 (some citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">As noted above, the statutory provision at issue in the case at bar states that, \u201c[wjhile an individual is in any placement for tuberculosis treatment, the individual may not: (1) Behave in a disorderly manner.\u201d H-G \u00a7 18-325(b)(l). We conclude that this statute is not vague under the fair notice principle, nor does it fail to provide legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">There is a common and generally accepted meaning to the phrase \u201cdisorderly manner\u201d that can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, and treatises. As the trial judge and the parties recognized, Maryland courts have opined upon the meaning of \u201cdisorderly\u201d as it pertains to the disorderly conduct offense codified at CL section 10 \u2014 201(c)(2), which prohibits a person from \u201cwillfully act[ing] in a disorderly manner that disturbs the public peace.\u201d It often has been stated that \u201c[t]he gist of the crime of disorderly conduct ... as it was in the cases of common law predecessor crimes, is the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area.\u201d <em>Drews v. State, </em>224 Md. 186, 192, 167 A.2d 341 (1961). <em>See also Spry v. State, </em>396 Md. 682, 691-92, 914 A.2d 1182 (2007); <em>Dziekonski v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 191, 200-201, 732 A.2d 367 (1999) (quoting <em>Reese v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 73, 80, 299 A.2d 848 (1973)); <em>Streeter v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 435, 438-439, 248 A.2d 119 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Beyond the guidance provided by cases involving the crime of \u201cdisorderly conduct,\u201d we agree with the trial court that the specific phrase at issue here, \u201cdisorderly manner\u201d as used in H-G section 18-325(b)(l), must be interpreted by considering its common meaning <em>in the context of a treatment facility </em>for tuberculosis. \u201cDisorderly\u201d is defined as \u201cnot in order,\u201d \u201cirregularly,\u201d \u201cconfusedly,\u201d \u201cturbulent,\u201d and \u201cunruly.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 652 (2002). It is also defined as \u201cengaged in conduct offensive to public order,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 360 (11th ed. 2005), and \u201c[c]ontrary to the rules of good order and behavior; violative of the public peace or good order; turbulent, riotous, or indecent.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 422 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Whereas disorderly conduct offenses generally are concerned with maintaining public peace and order, behaving in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>disorderly manner in a tuberculosis treatment facility requires consideration of the purpose of the statute, which is to prevent and control the spread of tuberculosis; the purpose of medical quarantine, which is to safeguard the public health; the need to maintain peace and order within the treatment facility; and, the need to ensure the safety of medical professionals, staff members, other patients, visitors, and the public at large. When we consider the plain language and purpose of the statute together with prior judicial constructions of the more general crime of \u201cdisorderly conduct,\u201d we conclude that the statute is sufficiently definite to inform a person of ordinary intelligence of the nature of the activity proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The gist of the crime of behaving in a disorderly manner while in a placement for tuberculosis treatment under H-G \u00a7 18-325(b)(l), \u201cis the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people in the area\u201d of the tuberculosis patient. <em>Drews, supra, </em>224 Md. at 192, 167 A.2d 341. As with disorderly conduct offenses under the Criminal Law Article, it includes conduct \u201c \u2018of such a nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons in or around the tuberculosis treatment facility who may witness the same and who may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 3 Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence, Sec. </em>850 (5th ed.)). It is evident that, within the context of a treatment center for people with communicable tuberculosis, that conduct would include willful actions that would tend to expose health care workers and other non-patients to the disease. Accordingly, Livingston\u2019s void-for-vagueness argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Livingston contends the evidence adduced at trial was legally insufficient to support his convictions for refusing to comply with the Secretary\u2019s placement order between February 15 and March 16, 2008, in violation of H-G section 18-325(a), and for behaving in a disorderly manner, in violation of H-G section 18 \u2014 325(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>In deciding a sufficiency of evidence contention respecting a criminal conviction, we must determine whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 71, 935 A.2d 421 (2007) (quoting <em>Rivers v. State, </em>393 Md. 569, 580, 903 A.2d 908 (2006)). When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence in a non-jury trial, we will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless it is clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c); <em>State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 589, 606 A2d 265, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 945,113 S.Ct. 390,121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>A. Refusing to Comply with the Secretary\u2019s Placement Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">As discussed above, H-G section 18-324(b)(l) permits the Secretary or a health officer to order an individual who has tuberculosis that \u201cendangers, or may endanger, the public health of the community, ... to receive appropriate medical care.\u201d Subsection (b)(2) further provides that, \u201c[i]f the individual fails to comply with the order,\u201d he may further be ordered into \u201cmedical quarantine in order to protect the public health.\u201d H-G \u00a7 325(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The clear purpose of this statute is to afford a person with communicable tuberculosis appropriate medical care and quarantine to prevent and control the spread of tuberculosis in order to protect the health of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On February 4, 2008, the Secretary issued an order respecting Livingston pursuant to H-G section 18-324(b). The order provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>I HEREBY ORDER you to medical treatment and quarantine at Deer\u2019s Head Hospital for treatment of your tuberculosis. Your quarantine will continue until such time as your doctors, the Prince George\u2019s County Health Department, and the Division of Tuberculosis Control of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene determine that you are well enough to return home and no longer pose a risk to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">IN ADDITION, I HEREBY ORDER you to comply with all medications and diagnostic tests ordered by your doctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Livingston contends that, while the above order required him to enter the hospital, it did not require him to don a mask upon leaving his isolation room and entering the anteroom, and therefore a reasonable trier of fact could not reasonably have found on the evidence adduced that he refused to comply with the placement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Livingston\u2019s reading of the placement order is unreasonably narrow. To be sure, it required him to admit himself to the hospital, and he did so. It further mandated, however, that he be quarantined at the hospital and obtain medical treatment until it was determined, among other things, that he no longer posed a risk to others. The hospital, not Livingston, determined the conditions necessary to establish a quarantine and treat Livingston for tuberculosis. The evidence presented at trial clearly established that Livingston knew the conditions of his quarantine and violated them by leaving his isolation room and entering the anteroom without a mask and by going outside the hospital building without a mask, all when other people were in his vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Gravenor testified that she told Livingston he had to wear a mask before coming out of his room into the anteroom or hospital hallway. Thereafter, she observed him seated in his vehicle without a mask on and, on one occasion, witnessed him, maskless, opening the door to the anteroom while she was in it and before she had donned her protective equipment. Rolf similarly testified that Livingston entered the anteroom without wearing a mask, and Insley observed Livingston near his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>vehicle without a mask. Mathews also advised Livingston that he could not leave his hospital room without wearing a mask. Thereafter, she observed him enter the anteroom without a mask on. Towers likewise observed Livingston either outside the hospital building or in the anteroom without a mask. Finally, Drayton observed Livingston, without a mask on, placing his dinner tray in the anteroom and entering an unoccupied adjacent isolation room to use the telephone and the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The testimony of these witnesses plainly was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Livingston failed to comply with the Secretary\u2019 placement order for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>B. Acting in a Disorderly Manner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Livingston next contends the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction for behaving in a disorderly manner. Specifically, he argues that, because he was in his assigned isolation room when he lunged at Towers, and no one else was present, he did not offend, disturb, incite, or tend to incite any of the people gathered in the same area. In addition, he maintains that his words, \u201cthis is fucking ridiculous,\u201d could not be the basis for a disorderly conduct conviction because they were protected under the First Amendment. They were not \u201cfighting words,\u201d or words tending to arouse prurient sexual desire or to cause an immediate breach of the peace, which are not afforded constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Respecting the incident in question, Towers testified that, when she first responded to Livingston\u2019s call bell, he was in the anteroom with his mask off but around his neck. She asked him to put his mask on while she stepped out of the room. Once Livingston put on the mask, Towers reentered the room, and Livingston told her that he had a rash on his neck and needed a nurse to put Benadryl cream on it. Towers said she would let the nurse know about his request, and she did. About a half hour to 45 minutes later, Towers responded to another call from Livingston, who complained that the amount of time he had waited for a nurse was \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d When Towers stated that she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>have to listen to his cursing, Livingston \u201clunged at [her] with his fist in the air,\u201d and \u201cstepped towards\u201d her, causing her to run out of the room in fear. She further described him as acting \u201cirritated,\u201d \u201cfrustrated,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d and \u201cemotional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Drayton said that, when she later went to Livingston\u2019s room to advise him that he could not threaten her staff members, he was seated. He appeared \u201cangry\u201d and, as she was talking to him, \u201che just jumped up out of the chair and faced [her].\u201d At that point, Drayton started to back out of the door because she \u201cfelt threatened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Thus, although Livingston\u2019s words and actions may not have offended, incited, or disturbed \u201ca number of people gathered in the same area,\u201d they most certainly disturbed and offended the nurses who were trying to treat him. These facts demonstrate why the crime of \u201cbehav[ing] in a disorderly manner\u201d under H-G section 18 \u2014 325(b)(1) cannot be entirely synonymous with the general crime of disorderly conduct, and must be understood in the context of the statutory scheme in which it appears. <em>See, e.g., Gilmer v. State, </em>389 Md. 656, 663, 887 A.2d 549 (2005) (stating that the interpretation of a statute must \u201c \u2018consider not only the ordinary meaning of the words, but also how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111 (2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The primary purpose of Part IV of Title 18 is to protect the public health by ensuring that individuals infected with communicable tuberculosis receive proper treatment. <em>See generally, </em>H-G \u00a7 18-324. More specifically, the crime of behaving in a disorderly manner applies to individuals such as Livingston whom the Secretary has ordered into a placement for tuberculosis treatment because their condition \u201cendangers, or may endanger, the public health.\u201d H-G \u00a7 18-324(b)(l). Rarely \"will such individuals offend or disturb \u201ca number of people gathered in the same area\u201d (no matter how outrageous their conduct) by simple virtue of the fact that their treatment regime limits their contact to a small number of health care providers. Accordingly, an individual ordered into a place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ment for tuberculosis treatment \u201cbehave[s] in a disorderly manner\u201d by acting in way that frustrates the ability of those health care providers to give that individual, or other patients, proper treatment. The evidence here was more than sufficient to show that Livingston, by speaking to the nurses in a profane manner \u00e1nd threatening them, interfered with their ability to render appropriate medical care to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Livingston\u2019s claim that his statement \u201cthis is fucking ridiculous\u201d was not sufficient to violate H-G section 18 \u2014 325(b)(1) does not accurately reflect the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling. Granted, Livingston\u2019s words alone may not have been sufficiently disturbing, inciteful, or obscene to qualify as \u201cbehav[ing] in a disorderly manner;\u201d however, the judgment of the trial court (and our holding here) accounted for both his words <em>and conduct. </em>The testimony of the nurses \u2014 which the trial court clearly credited \u2014 established that Livingston acted in an assaultive and threatening manner toward them and that his offensive and disruptive words <em>and </em>actions disturbed the orderly operation of the tuberculosis treatment facility. Moreover, regardless of what Livingston said, the testimony about his conduct alone supported a reasonable finding that he behaved in a disorderly manner in violation of H-G section 18-325(b)(1). Accordingly, we reject Livingston\u2019s argument that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction for behaving in a disorderly manner while in a placement for tuberculosis treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
