Upon his arrest, Adams asserted that Morris had sought to purchase cocaine from him, but when the two met to complete the sale, Morris had threatened Adams with a knife and attempted to rob him of the cocaine. Adams maintained that he had merely defended himself, but also asserted that he had \u201cblacked out\u201d during the altercation and could not fully recall the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Adams was charged in the Circuit Court for Washington County with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and manslaughter. Defense counsel entered an appearance in his case. When the lead detective in the case subsequently visited Adams in the detention center to serve upon Adams a notice of the State\u2019s intention to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, Adams made inculpatory statements to the detective. Although Adams moved to have those statements excluded at trial, the circuit court denied his motion to suppress the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">At trial, the State introduced evidence of the victim\u2019s numerous wounds, including a wound to the victim\u2019s right hand and various defensive wounds to the victim\u2019s left arm. Over Adams\u2019s objection, the State\u2019s expert witness in \u201ccrime scene reconstruction\u201d noted that the victim was right-handed, and opined that the pattern of the wounds suggested that the victim\u2019s right hand was wounded early in the struggle, forcing him to attempt to defend himself with his non-dominant arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Because Adams alleged that the victim\u2019s murder was precipitated by a robbery attempt that led to mutual combat, he requested that the court instruct the jury on the doctrine of hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation. The circuit court declined to do so, ruling that the evidence presented at trial did not warrant that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The jury convicted Adams of first-degree murder, and the circuit court sentenced Adams to life in prison, with all but 40 years suspended. Adams noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We have rephrased Adams\u2019s questions as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">(1) Did the circuit court err in failing to suppress the statement Adams made on November 29, 2006, in which Adams admitted that he stabbed Morris multiple times, where the State elicited the incriminating statement outside the presence of Adams\u2019s attorney of record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(2) Did the circuit court err in declining to instruct the jury on the rule of hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(3) Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in admitting expert opinion testimony about the probable sequence of the victim\u2019s wounds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Because we hold that the admission of Adams\u2019s second incriminating statement violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial. We also answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 2, and \u201cno\u201d to question 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Early in the morning of April 13, 2006, various residents of Bethel Gardens, a community on Bethune Avenue in Hagerstown, Maryland, were awakened by the sounds of Adams and Morris fighting outside on the sidewalk. The residents testified that they heard someone say \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t kill me man.\u201d None of the residents witnessed which man made those pleas. One of the witnesses, a paramedic, testified that when he reached Morris\u2019s body, Morris had no pulse and Adams had fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Detective Shane Blankenship, of the Hagerstown Police Department, was assigned to investigate the case. Based upon review of images captured by various public security cameras, the investigation focused upon Adams as a suspect. Blankenship had known Adams since 1990, when Adams \u201cwas a little kid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Adams was arrested in Baltimore for a parole violation. Detective Blankenship and another detective drove to Baltimore, and, pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, transported Adams to Hagerstown for questioning. In accordance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), Detective Blankenship advised Adams of his rights, and Adams executed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. Adams made inculpatory statements to the detectives, and acknowledged being involved in a knife fight with Morris on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Part of the interview was recorded on audiotape, and that recording included the following version of the confrontation. Adams said that he had planned to meet with Morris that morning because Morris wished to buy cocaine from Adams. When they met, however, instead of paying Adams for the drugs, Morris drew a knife and demanded the drugs from Adams. In the recorded statement, Adams said that, \u201cwhen [Morris] made the aggressive step, I like grabbed the knife. And we just struggled like after that____ And I blacked out.\u201d Blankenship asked, \u201cSo you blacked out?\u201d Adams replied: \u201cYeah. And one thing led to another.\u201d Blankenship asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d you do then?\u201d Adams said: \u201cAfter I blacked out and everything happens like I seen him step off. And when he stepped off, I was able to get away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Adams was then charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and manslaughter. He was incarcerated in the detention center pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>On November 29, 2006, the prosecutor\u2019s office asked Detective Blankenship to visit Adams in the detention center and personally serve on Adams the notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective Blankenship asked Detective Tammy Jurado to accompany him to the detention center. Explaining his reason for asking another detective to accompany him, Detective Blankenship later testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">The implications of this document are pretty clear, very serious. It\u2019s not something I wanted to do alone. And quite simply I wanted someone else there as a witness in case something happened, in case something was said that would have been unusual. And as a matter of practice we just normally don\u2019t go out by ourselves to serve documents like this, especially for these types of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">Q. [BY PROSECUTOR] Now in your experience as a police officer as well as in the detective bureau, you\u2019ve had \u2014 had you had occasions where suspects just blurt out statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">Q. And therefore Detective Jurado would be a witness to any such blurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">At the detention center, the detectives met with Adams in the library. Detective Blankenship explained during his testimony at the suppression hearing: \u201cThey have other interview rooms but the library is a little more comfortable ... a little more personable.\u201d Adams\u2019s attorney, who had entered an appearance in the case months earlier, was not notified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the detectives intended to meet and confer with Adams, and was not present at the meeting. -</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">At the hearing on Adams\u2019s motion to suppress the statements Adams made during the discussion on November 29, 2006, Detective Blankenship testified as follows regarding the encounter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Q. [BY PROSECUTOR] What was your intention when you went out to the jail that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">A. Just to serve the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Q. Did you give him the paperwork that you were assigned to give him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">A. Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">Q. And uh did you say anything while you were giving it to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">A. Well I asked him to read the documents because if he had any questions about those documents I wanted to be there to answer questions for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">Q. Now after he read the document did he make any statements to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">A. Yes. Something he said was you know \u201cI\u2019m not feeling this.\u201d He was reading the document and he was looking at the document and he just started kind of shaking his head and I could tell he was becoming upset. It appeared to me like he was becoming a little bit angry and he just kind of said several times you know \u201cMan I\u2019m not feeling this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">Q. Did he ask you any questions about what this document meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-15\">A. He wanted to know why the State was coming after</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\">him so hard for this particular case____ I can\u2019t remember</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-17\">his exact words but it was something to that effect, \u2018Why are they coming after me for this so hard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-18\">Q. Did you make any statements as a result of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>A. Well I did. Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">A. Well I was taken \u2014 I didn\u2019t expect that question to come from him and I told him \u201cWell it\u2019s because you stabbed a guy 32 times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">Q. When you said that, did you expect to elicit any other information out of him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">A. No he asked the question, I gave him an answer. That was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Q. As far as you were concerned that was it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">A. It was just an off the cuff answer from me. Probably not very appropriate but it\u2019s what came out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">Q. Based on your understanding of why we were going to go forward with that type\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">Q. \u2014of potential sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">Q. What if anything did Marshall say as a result of that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-18\">A. He said that he didn\u2019t stab the guy 32 times. He said he only stabbed the guy seven times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-19\">Q. And in fact he started to describe where he stabbed the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-20\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-21\">Q. Did you stop him at any point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-22\">A. No I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-23\">Q. Did you question him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-24\">A. No I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-25\">Q. Did you say anything else to him before you left that room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-26\">A. No I didn\u2019t respond to his comments, I sat there silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>During cross-examination at the suppression hearing, Detective Blankenship testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Q. [BY DEFENSE COUNSEL] Mr. Adams never contacted you to come to the jail, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">A. No he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Q. And you knew he had an attorney, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">A. I did yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Q. ... [Y]ou asked him if he had been warned that the police were coming to serve him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Q. Had anyone told you to tell Mr. Adams that his defense attorney should have or could have warned him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">Q. ... Were you directed to contact defense [sic] prior to serving him with that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">A. No I was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">Q. Were there discussions with you about giving notice to his attorney prior to talking to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">Q. You didn\u2019t [M]irandize him at that moment, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-18\">A. He was not [M]irandized nor was he given any kind of warning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-19\">Q. So prior to your asking him a question, you did not tell him he had a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-20\">A. No I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-21\">Q. Nor that he had a right to have his attorney present in any capacity, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-22\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-23\">Defense counsel proffered to the suppression court that the defense attorneys were not \u201ccontacted that someone was going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to the jail to talk to our client.\u201d The prosecuting attorney stipulated, \u201cWe don\u2019t dispute that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The motion to suppress was denied. The suppression court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">I don\u2019t find that Detective Blankenship\u2019s statements to the defendant on November the 29th were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response and I find that the defendant\u2019s statement on the 29th was uncoerced, un-tricked and unexpected by Detective Blankenship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">At trial, the State introduced forensic evidence that Adams stabbed Morris 32 times. The State also introduced Adams\u2019s statement that he had blacked out and did not remember stabbing Morris. Over Adams\u2019s objection, the State also introduced Adams\u2019s contradictory statement that he had stabbed Morris seven times.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We will review the facts giving rise to Adams\u2019s claims that the trial court erred in admitting certain expert testimony and in failing to give a requested jury instruction as part of the discussion of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">As noted above, the jury found Adams guilty of first-degree murder, and the circuit court sentenced him to life in prison with all but 40 years suspended. Adams filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">I. Suppression</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">In <em>Massey v. State, </em>173 Md.App. 94, 917 A.2d 1175 (2007), this Court reviewed the applicable standard of review for a circuit court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress evidence at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">In reviewing the court\u2019s disposition of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe look only to the record of the suppression hearing and do not consider the evidence admitted at trial.\u201d <em>In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691 (1997). In this limited review, we consider the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to the prevailing party, in this instance the State. <em>Id. </em>We review the factual findings of the motions court for clear error. <em>Byndloss v. State, </em>391 Md. 462, 477, 893 A.2d 1119 (2006). Although we defer to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we must make a de novo constitutional evaluation by \u201creviewing] independently the application of the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law[.]\u201d <em>See Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 345, 885 A.2d 785 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 100-101, 917 A.2d 1175. <em>Accord Prioleau v. State, </em>411 Md. 629, 638, 984 A.2d 851 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"AUj\">Adams argues that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statement he made to the detectives the day he was served with the State\u2019s notice to seek a life sentence. It is Adams\u2019s contention that Detective Blankenship\u2019s accusatory comment that the State was seeking a harsh penalty because Adams \u201cstabbed [Morris] 32 times\u201d was the functional equivalent of interrogation outside the presence of counsel, and that it foreseeably prompted Adams to respond with an incriminating statement which the State introduced to contradict earlier statements made by Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Iowa v. Tovar, </em>541 U.S. 77, 87, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (2004): \u201cThe Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all \u2018critical stages\u2019 of the criminal process.\u201d In <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 247-49, 513 A.2d 299 (1986), the Court of Appeals recognized that the right to counsel assured by the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Articles 21, 22, and 24, is similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), the Supreme Court held that the state violated the Sixth Amendment right of an accused who was represented by counsel when the police persuaded a co-defendant to surreptitiously record incriminating statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>while the accused was waiting for trial. The Court observed, <em>id. </em>at 168-69,106 S.Ct. 477 (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">The right to the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments is indispensable to the fair administration of our adversarial system of criminal justice. Embodying <em>\u201ca </em>realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), the right to counsel safeguards the other rights deemed essential for the fair prosecution of a criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In <em>Moulton, </em>the Court recognized the importance of representation prior to trial, noting that \u201cto deprive a person of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 106 S.Ct. 477. The Court stated, 474 U.S. at 177 n. 14, 106 S.Ct. 477 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\"><em>The Sixth Amendment protects the right of the accused not to be confronted by an agent of the State regarding matters as to which the right to counsel has attached without counsel being present. </em>This right was violated as soon as the State\u2019s agent engaged Moulton [the accused] in conversation about the charges pending against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In <em>Michigan v. Harvey, </em>494 U.S. 344, 357-358, 110 S.Ct. 1176, 108 L.Ed.2d 293 (1990), the Court described the Sixth Amendment right as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">The accused\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel is not limited to participation in the trial itself. A defendant is entitled to the aid of his lawyer from the time of arraignment \u201cwhen consultation, thoroughgoing investigation and preparation [are] vitally important,\u201d <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 57, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), through the time of first appeal. <em>See Penson[ v. Ohio], </em>488 U.S. [75], at 85[, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988)]; <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967); <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963). Just as the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>to \u201cthe Assistance\u201d of counsel necessarily encompasses a right to the effective assistance of counsel, see <em>[U.S. v.] Cronic, </em>466 U.S. [648], at 654-655[, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)]; <em>Avery v. Alabama, </em>308 U.S. 444, 446, 60 S.Ct. 321, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940), so too the accused\u2019s right to have counsel \u201cfor his defence\u201d in a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d includes the right to rely on counsel after the government\u2019s role has shifted from investigation to accusation and the \u201cdefendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972) (opinion of Stewart, J.); <em>see also Moran v.

The Court has also applied the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to surreptitious government attempts to deliberately elicit information from the indicted defendant. See <em>Maine v.

Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 635, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986), <em>overruled, Montejo v. Louisiana, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2091, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009), the Supreme Court held that, once an accused has indicated he wants the assistance of counsel, further questioning by the state or its agents is prohibited unless communications are subsequently initiated by the accused, and that any prereported waiver of this right by the accused is invalid. Under the rule expressed in <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 U.S. at 635, 106 S.Ct. 1404, the state could never establish a valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel once it had been invoked. The Court held: \u201cJust as written waivers are insufficient to justify police-initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Fifth Amendment analysis, so too they are insufficient to justify police-initiated interrogations after the request for counsel in a Sixth Amendment analysis.\u201d The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 636, 106 S.Ct. 1404: \u2018We thus hold that, if police initiate interrogation after a defendant\u2019s assertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Court indicated in <em>Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 U.S. 285, 108 S.Ct. 2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988), that the holding of <em>Michigan v. Jackson </em>\u2014 that \u201cany waiver\u201d of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was \u201cinvalid\u201d \u2014 was not etched in stone. After being indicted, Patterson, of his own volition, asked police officers why another person had not also been indicted. After Patterson reviewed and signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, he made incriminating statements. He was interviewed a second time by the prosecutor, who again reviewed the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and had Patterson sign another waiver form, after which Patterson made further incriminating statements. Patterson moved to suppress the statements on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Supreme Court denied Patterson\u2019s claim. Although the Court agreed that \u201c[tjhere can be no doubt that petitioner had the right to have the assistance of counsel at his postindictment interviews with law enforcement authorities,\u201d 487 U.S. at 290, 108 S.Ct. 2389, the Court noted that Patterson had never actually retained or accepted by appointment counsel to represent him. <em>Id. </em>at 290 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. 2389. The Court distinguished <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>stating: \u201cOur decision in <em>Jackson, </em>however, turned on the fact that the accused (ha[d] asked for the help of a lawyer\u2019 in dealing with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 108 S.Ct. 2389. The Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Preserving the integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through counsel is the essence of <em>Edwards </em>and its progeny \u2014 not barring an accused from making an initial election as to whether he will face the State\u2019s officers during questioning with the aid of counsel, or go it alone. If an accused \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d pursues the latter course, we see no reason why the uncounseled statements he then makes must be excluded at his trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Having determined that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel <em>could </em>be waived after indictment, the <em>Patterson </em>Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>examined whether the purported waiver in the ease was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">In the past, this Court has held that waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is valid only when it reflects \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, </em>[304 U.S.] at 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019. In other words, the accused must \u201ckno[w] what he is doing\u201d so that \u201chis choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). In a case arising under the Fifth Amendment, we described this requirement as \u201ca full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986). Whichever of these formulations is used, the key inquiry in a case such as this one must be: Was the accused, who waived his Sixth Amendment rights during postindictment questioning, made sufficiently aware of his right to have counsel present during the questioning, and of the possible consequences of a decision to forgo the aid of counsel? In this case, we are convinced that by admonishing petitioner with the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, respondent has met this burden and that petitioner\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel at the questioning was valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Court emphasized in <em>Patterson </em>that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings provide an adequate basis for an accused to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 299-300, 108 S.Ct. 2389:</p>\n<p id=\"AXi\">So long as the accused is made aware of the \u201cdangers and disadvantages of self-representation\u201d during postindictment questioning, by use of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, his waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at such questioning is \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), the Supreme Court had held that the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during custo-</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>dial interrogation had been violated when the police reinitiated interrogation after the suspect had requested counsel. Because the suspect had not been indicted, the <em>Edwards </em>Court did not address whether the outcome would have been the same under the Sixth Amendment. 451 U.S. at 480-82 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 1880. The Court stated in <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85,101 S.Ct. 1880 (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">[Although we have held that after initially being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the accused may himself validly waive his rights and respond to interrogation, <em>see North Carolina v. Butler, </em>[441 U.S. 369 (1979),] at 372-376[, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286], the Court has strongly indicated that additional safeguards are necessary when the accused asks for counsel; and we now hold that when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. We further hold that an accused, such as Edwards, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">... [I]t is inconsistent with <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Similarly, in <em>Minnick v. Mississippi, </em>498 U.S. 146, 150, 111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990), the Court emphasized that it was not \u201creaching any Sixth Amendment implications in the case,\u201d but held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment protection of <em>Edwards </em>is not terminated or suspended by consultation with counsel.\u201d The Court explained in <em>Minnick, </em>498 U.S. at 153, 111 S.Ct. 486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">In our view, a fair reading of <em>Edwards </em>and subsequent cases demonstrates that we have interpreted the rule to bar police-initiated interrogation unless the accused has counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>with him at the time of questioning. Whatever the ambiguities of our earlier cases on this point, we now hold that when counsel is requested, interrogation must cease, and officials may not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present, whether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In <em>Montejo v. Louisiana, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009), the Supreme Court expressly overruled the waiver language in <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>and held that the procedural safeguards announced in Fifth Amendment cases such as <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Minnick </em>were adequate to protect an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Montejo was a suspect in connection with a murder. When he was arrested, he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and ultimately admitted to shooting the victim. Montejo was brought before a judge and charged with murder. The court ordered the Office of Indigent Defender to represent Montejo on the charges. After the appointment of counsel, but before Montejo had met with any attorney, the police asked him to accompany them to find the murder weapon. The police again advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and Montejo accompanied them on the excursion, during which he wrote a letter of apology to the victim\u2019s wife. Montejo\u2019s court-appointed counsel was upset that the police had talked with his client. But Montejo\u2019s letter was nevertheless admitted in evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The Supreme Court rejected Montejo\u2019s contention that, under <em>Michigan v. Jackson, </em>there was a presumption that his waiver of counsel was invalid. 129 S.Ct. at 2091. Instead, the Court held that, like most other rights, the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel could be effectively waived\u2014 even by an accused already represented by counsel \u2014 \u201cso long as the relinquishment of the right is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The defendant may waive the right whether or not he is already represented by counsel; the decision to waive need not itself be counseled.\u201d <em>Id., </em>129 S.Ct. at 2085 (citations omitted) (footnote omitted). The Court noted that, generally, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings will suffice to provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>accused with the information he needs to know in order for the waiver to be considered \u201ca knowing and intelligent one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Patterson, supra, </em>487 U.S. at 296, 108 S.Ct. 2389). The Court held that the protections afforded by cases decided under the Fifth Amendment were sufficient to protect the accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, stating, 129 S.Ct. at 2089-90:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">[T]he Court has already taken substantial other, overlapping measures toward the same end. Under <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic protection of the right against compelled self-incrimination, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to have a lawyer present if he so requests, and to be advised of that right. 384 U.S., at 474, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. Under <em>Edwa/rds\u2019 </em>prophylactic protection of the <em>Miranda </em>right, once such a defendant \u201chas invoked his right to have counsel present,\u201d interrogation must stop. 451 U.S., at 484,101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378. And under <em>Minnick\u2019s </em>prophylactic protection of the <em>Edwards </em>right, no subsequent interrogation may take place until counsel is present, \u201cwhether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.\u201d <em>[Minnick v. Mississippi,] </em>498 U.S. [146], at 153, 111 S.Ct. 486,112 L.Ed.2d 489 [(1990)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient. Under the <em>Miranda-Edwards-Minnick </em>line of cases (which is not in doubt), a defendant who does not want to speak to the police without counsel present need only say as much when he is first approached and given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At that point, not only must the immediate contact end, but \u201cbadgering\u201d by later requests is prohibited. If that regime suffices to protect the integrity of \u201ca suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer\u2019s presence\u201d before his arraignment, <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S., at 175, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (Kennedy, J., concurring), it is hard to see why it would not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment, when Sixth Amendment rights have attached. And if so, then <em>Jackson </em>is simply superfluous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">It is true, as Montejo points out in his supplemental brief, that the doctrine established by <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>designed to protect Fifth Amendment, not Sixth Amendment, rights. But that is irrelevant. What matters is that these cases, like <em>Jackson, </em>protect the right to have counsel during custodial interrogation \u2014 which light happens <em>to </em>be guaranteed (once the adversary judicial process has begun) by two sources of law. Since the right under both sources is waived using the same procedure, <em>Patterson, supra, </em>at 296, 487 U.S. 285,108 S.Ct. 2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261, doctrines ensuring voluntariness of the Fifth Amendment waiver simultaneously ensure the voluntariness of the Sixth Amendment waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Despite the <em>Montejo </em>Court\u2019s rejection of <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>presumption against waiver of an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, the Court nevertheless held that Montejo should have the opportunity to argue that his waiver was invalid under the rule of <em>Edwards. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">[W]e think that Montejo should be given an opportunity to contend that his letter of apology should still have been suppressed under the rule of <em>Edwards. </em>If Montejo made a clear assertion of the right to counsel when the officers approached him about accompanying them on the excursion for the murder weapon, then no interrogation should have taken place unless Montejo initiated it. <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350. Even if Montejo subsequently agreed to waive his rights, that waiver would have been invalid had it followed an \u201cunequivocal election of the right,\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S., at 176, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">More recently, in <em>Maryland v. Shatzer, </em>559 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1213, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2010), the Supreme Court clarified that the <em>Edwards </em>prohibition against further custodial interrogation after an accused has invoked the Fifth Amendment right to counsel is limited to a period of fourteen days. In <em>Shatzer, </em>as in <em>Edwards, </em>the Court was not considering the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of an \u201caccused\u201d because Shatzer had not been charged with the crime about which he was being questioned by police. The Court explained its reasoning for arbitrarily choosing a period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fourteen days as follows: \u201cThat provides plenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody.\u201d 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1223. The Court noted, 559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1223, that, after the expiration of fourteen days, the State would still bear the burden of demonstrating that there was a valid waiver of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights under the voluntary and knowing standard of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">We assume that the fourteen-day limit announced in <em>Shatzer </em>with respect to subsequent interrogations of a suspect who has not been charged has no application to an accused who is incarcerated while awaiting trial. But, even if <em>Shatzer </em>could be read to suggest that police can approach an accused who is in pretrial custody every fourteen days, neither <em>Shatzer </em>nor <em>Montejo </em>eliminated the requirement that fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given to a suspect who had previously invoked the right to counsel. The Court noted in <em>Shatzer, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1223 n. 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">A defendant who experiences a 14-day break in custody after invoking the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel is not left without protection. <em>Edwards </em>establishes a <em>presumption </em>that a suspect\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is involuntary. <em>See Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 681, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988). Even without this \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis,\u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic protection of <em>Miranda </em>\u2014 arguing that his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was in fact involuntary under <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">In Adams\u2019s case, there clearly were no <em>Miranda </em>warnings given when the detectives met with Adams at the detention center on November 29, 2006. As Detective Blankenship conceded at the suppression hearing: \u201cHe was not [Mjirandized nor was he given any kind of warning.\u201d Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>there is no basis for finding that there was an intentional, knowing, and intelligent waiver of Adams\u2019s right to have his counsel of record serve as the medium for communications with the police and prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The State urges us to find that there was no interrogation and that Adams\u2019s statement was an unanticipated blurt. The undisputed facts simply do not support that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">When Detective Blankenship went to the detention center, he was ostensibly fulfilling the State\u2019s duty under Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 2-203, to notify Adams that the State would seek a life sentence at trial, notwithstanding the fact that the State had already served Adams\u2019s attorney with notice of that intent. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office for Washington County represented that it is that office\u2019s practice to make personal service of the notice upon the defendant even if the defendant is represented by counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Although it is clear that oral notice is insufficient, <em>Gorge v. State, </em>386 Md. 600, 613, 873 A.2d 1171 (2005), and timely notice is essential, <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313, 965 A.2d 912 (2009), the discussion in <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 83, 665 A.2d 223 (1995), suggests that service upon counsel of record in accordance with Maryland Rule 1-321 (a) would satisfy the statutory notice requirement. With respect to the similarly required written notice of intent to seek the death penalty, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Whittlesey, id.: </em>\u201cWhen a defendant is represented by counsel, service of the notice to seek the death penalty is properly made upon the attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In <em>Gorge, supra, </em>386 Md. at 619-20, 873 A.2d 1171, the Court of Appeals suggested two alternatives for complying with the notice requirement of Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 2-203, neither of which required sending a member of the investigative team to the detention center where the defendant was being held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">In a case involving a sentence as serious as life without the possibility of parole, it is entirely reasonable to require the State to follow the letter of the law. We suggest that in order to avoid a problem in the future, the State should prepare and send a written notice with a signed certificate of mailing or service, file it with the court, and retain a copy of it in the State\u2019s own file. Alternatively, the State could present the defendant with the written notice in open court, (at least 30 days before trial), and state on the record that the notice has been handed to the defendant. If either of those methods are used, there will be no question regarding whether the State provided the written notice required by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Despite the purportedly limited purpose for the detectives to meet with Adams on November 29, 2006, Detective Blankenship did not merely hand over the documents and tell Adams to contact his attorney for further explanation. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>stead, the detectives accompanied Adams to a private room and remained with him while he reviewed the notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek an enhanced penalty. Detective Blankenship explained: \u201cI wanted to be there to answer questions for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">When Adams became visibly upset and questioned the severity of the sentence now being sought, the detectives could have simply instructed him to talk with his attorney. Instead, Detective Blankenship confronted him with a statement accusing him of stabbing the victim 32 times. In view of the circumstances surrounding the encounter and Detective Blankenship\u2019s prior relationship with Adams, the detectives should have known that this accusatory statement was likely to elicit a response from Adams. Indeed, Detective Blankenship\u2019s explanation for the presence of the second detective\u2014 that she was present to witness any incriminating blurt-outs\u2014 indicates that the detectives anticipated that an incriminating response was reasonably likely. When Adams began to make substantive statements in response to Detective Blankenship\u2019s accusation, neither detective made any attempt to put a stop to the conversation. Neither detective made any effort to remind Adams of the rights summarized in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Writing for this Court in <em>Prioleau v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 19, 27, 943 A.2d 696 (2008), Judge Mary Ellen Barbera explained that \u201cpolice interrogation\u201d need not involve express questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">Interrogation, for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, is not limited to \u201cpolice interrogation practices that involve express questioning[.]\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 298-99, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). The Supreme Court recognized in <em>Innis </em>that such an approach to interrogation would be inconsistent with the concern in <em>Miranda </em>about the use by law enforcement personnel of various \u201cpsychological ploys\u201d in custodial settings. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The Court concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>equivalent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The Court explained what it meant by the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of interrogation: [T]he term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In <em>Prioleau, supra, </em>411 Md. at 651, 984 A.2d 851, the Court of Appeals affirmed this Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the circumstances, asking \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d was not the functional equivalent of interrogation. The Court of Appeals concluded, after analyzing the totality of the circumstances, that the arresting officer who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?\u201d should not have reasonably expected that that statement was likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR5\">Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, it is clear that the suppression hearing court found that Detective Stach did not intend to ask Petitioner \u201ca question on anything that has to do with illegal activity.\u201d That factual finding was not clearly erroneous. The critical inquiry, therefore, is whether Detective Stach, based on the totality of the circumstances, knew or should have known that greeting Petitioner with the words, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Maurice?,\u201d would be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. From our own independent constitutional appraisal of the record, we hold that it is not reasonable to expect that those words would be likely to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Our independent constitutional appraisal of the totality of circumstances in Adams\u2019s case leads us to the opposite conclusion. This was not a chance encounter with the accused. Nor was the discussion initiated by the accused. Nor was Adams\u2019s incriminating statement blurted out during an exchange of pleasantries. Here, the lead detective in the case, who had known Adams since Adams was a child, arranged for the defendant to be taken from his cell to a more \u201ccomfortable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>area of the detention center. The detective sat down at a table with Adams as if to begin a conference. The detective handed Adams documents specifically dealing with this case, and told the defendant to read the documents in the presence of the two officers. The detective acknowledged that it was his intent to talk with Adams about substantive legal issues: \u201cI wanted to be there to answer questions for him.\u201d When Adams asked the detective a question about the State\u2019s approach to the case (\u201cWhy are they coming after me for this so hard?\u201d), the detective did not simply refer Adams to his own attorney of record. Instead, the detective confronted the defendant with an accusatory statement that contradicted the story Adams had told the detective during their previous interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Under the totality of the circumstances, our independent appraisal leads us to conclude that any reasonable police officer could have reasonably anticipated that Adams would respond to the substance of Blankenship\u2019s accusation, and that the response could be incriminating. Consequently, regardless of whether the detective acted in good faith in initiating this meeting outside the presence of Adams\u2019s counsel, this encounter was the functional equivalent of interrogation. <em>Blake v. State, </em>381 Md. 218, 236, 849 A.2d 410 (2004) (\u201cActions taken by the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect amount to the functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d). In the absence of any basis for finding a knowing and intelligent waiver of Adams\u2019s right to be represented by counsel during such pretrial encounters, the statement should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">But, even though we hold that the statement should not have been admitted during the State\u2019s case in chief, the statement would be admissible for impeachment purposes if Adams were to testify. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Kansas v. Ventris, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1841, 1846, 173 L.Ed.2d 801 (2009), \u201cthe <em>Massiah </em>right is a right to be free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>uncounseled interrogation, and is infringed at the time of the interrogation.\u201d The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">We have held in every other context that tainted evidence\u2014 evidence whose very introduction does not constitute the constitutional violation, but whose obtaining was constitutionally invalid \u2014 is admissible for impeachment. We see no distinction that would alter the balance here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">We hold that the informant\u2019s testimony, concededly elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, was admissible to challenge Ventris\u2019s inconsistent testimony at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">129 S.Ct. at 1847 (citations omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Although we conclude that the circuit court erred in declining to suppress Adams\u2019s second statement during the State\u2019s case in chief, our analysis does not end there. We next ask whether the error was harmless. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 311, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (observing that a confession obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment is a \u201ctrial error\u201d subject to harmless error analysis). The Court of Appeals in <em>Blanks v. State, </em>406 Md. 526, 543, 959 A.2d 1180 (2008) (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)), described the standard for determining whether an error is \u201charmless\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201c[WJhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Detective Blankenship testified at trial that, after Adams asked why the State was coming after him so hard, he replied, \u201cWell, Marshall, you stabbed the guy 32 times.\u201d He then testified as follows about Adams\u2019s response to that assertion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-N\">Q. [BY THE PROSECUTOR] And after you said \u201cWell Marshall you stabbed him 32 times\u201d, what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">A. Well he, he corrected me and said \u201cI didn\u2019t stab him 32 times, I only stabbed him seven times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Q. Did he end with \u201cI only stabbed him seven times\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">A. No he started to go through the seven stab wounds that he inflicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Q. What can you remember from that interview that he told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">A. Well he specifically said that there was one stab wound to the victim\u2019s neck. There was one stab wound to his back. There was an additional stab wound to his finger. And I can\u2019t recall what the other stab wounds were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">Q. Did he at that time give you a location for each of the seven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">A. Yes he did. I think he actually pointed on his body where they were too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Adams\u2019s statement to Detective Blankenship, describing in detail the seven wounds he admitted inflicting upon Morris, contradicted his initial statement contending that he \u201cblacked out\u201d and could not remember the details of the skirmish. The admission of the later statement undermined Adams\u2019s proffered defense that he was not guilty of murder because he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, which had caused him to black out during the combat with Morris. The psychologist who testified for the defense conceded that Adams\u2019s description of seven stab wounds was not consistent with having blacked out due to post-traumatic stress disorder. Accordingly, we cannot say that the admission in evidence of statement made to Detective Blankenship on November 29, 2006, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Because the other two issues raised on appeal are likely to arise again upon retrial, we will also address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">II. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Adams requested that the court give a jury instruction on hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation, specifically, Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>4:17.4 C (2006). The court declined, explaining that, in the court\u2019s view, the evidence was not sufficient to support such an instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In <em>Christian v. State, </em>405 Md. 306, 322-23, 951 A.2d 832 (2008), the Court of Appeals summarized cases in which the Court had recognized the mitigating factor of hot blooded response, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The first defense, commonly referred to as hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation, typically involves passion-creating circumstances, those that provoke action, and therefore, those to which the rule of provocation applies. <em>Girouard v. State, </em>321 Md. 532, 538, 583 A.2d 718, 721 (1991). <em>See also State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 486, 483 A.2d 759, 761 (1984). In <em>Girouard, </em>we stated the test for determining when the defense of provocation may apply as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201c1. There must have been adequate provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">2. The killing must have been in the heat of passion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">3. It must have been a sudden heat of passion \u2014 that is, the killing must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">4. There must have been a causal connection between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\"><em>Girouard, </em>321 Md. at 539, 583 A.2d at 721. We have recognized that the defense may be raised in cases involving mutual affray, assault and battery, discovering one\u2019s spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another, resisting an illegal arrest, witnessing, or being aware of, an act causing injury to a relative or a third party, and anything the natural tendency of which is to produce passion in ordinary men and women. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 583 A.2d at 721. <em>See also Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 486, 483 A.2d at 761-62; <em>Glenn v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 379, 403-04, 511 A.2d 1110, 1123, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 599, 516 A2d 569 (1986); 1 RONALD A. ANDERSON, WHARTON\u2019S CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 276 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">One possible source of adequate provocation is mutual combat. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 551-52, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Mutual combat has been recognized as a possible source of adequate provocation. <em>Carter v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 567, 572, 505 A.2d 545 (1986); <em>Shuck v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 33, 38-40, 349 A.2d 378 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976); <em>Whitehead v. State, supra, </em>9 Md.App. [7] at 11, 262 A.2d 316 [(1970)]; R. Perkins and R. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>88-91 (3d ed. 1982); 2 C. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 159 (14th ed. 1979). The rule of provocation will apply when persons enter into angry and unlawful combat with a mutual intent to fight and, as a result of the effect of the combat, the passion of one of the participants is suddenly elevated to the point where he resorts to the use of deadly force to kill the other solely because of an impulsive response to the passion and without time to consider the consequences of his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990), the Court explained that the defendant need only be able to show that there is \u201csome\u201d evidence to support the mitigation instruction. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says \u2014 \u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not kill in self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals made plain in <em>Sims, supra, </em>319 Md. at 550, 573 A.2d 1317, that a defendant is entitled to \u201csimultaneously advance inconsistent theories of defense.\u201d The Court held, <em>id.: </em>\u201cWe hold that a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that is fairly supported by the evidence, even if several theories offered are inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In this case, we conclude that Adams met the minimal burden of showing that there was \u201csome\u201d evidence in the record to support a potential finding that he reacted in a hot blooded response to a surprising robbery attempt by Leo Morris, who \u2014 according to Adams\u2019s statement that was admitted in evidence \u2014 pulled a knife on Adams, demanded the drugs from Adams, and made an aggressive move toward Adams, which led to mutual combat. To paraphrase the Court of Appeals\u2019s statement in <em>Dykes, </em>it is of no matter that the claim of hot blooded response is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. Because there was some evidence in the record which, if believed, would support Adams\u2019s claim that he acted in hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation, the defendant was entitled to the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">III. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Adams contends that the trial court erred in permitting one of the State\u2019s expert witnesses to express an opinion. Jeffrey Kercheval testified that he is \u201cthe supervisory forensic scientist at the Western Maryland Regional Crime Laboratory located at the Hagerstown Police Department____\u201d He said that, in addition to examining crime scenes, he is sometimes \u201casked to try to reconstruct portions of the crime scene that might have occurred.\u201d Mr. Kercheval explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Basically crime scene reconstruction is using the scientific method and with logical thinking or logical reasoning, applying that to the crime scene environment, the physical evidence that is present at the crime scene environment and that physical evidence is tangible objects \u2014 things you can see, touch or feel, smell, things that respond to your senses, in addition to relevant and pertinent information about the case, to come to the most probable sequence of events which would have occurred in a particular crime scene location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">When the State offered Mr. Kercheval \u201cas an expert in crime scene reconstruction,\u201d defense counsel asked no voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dire questions, and told the court: \u201cI think we\u2019ll accept Mr. Kercheval.\u201d Whereupon, the court ruled that \u201cMr. Kercheval will be accepted as an expert in the field of crime scene reconstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Among the opinions Mr. Kercheval expressed about the sequence of events that took place on the night of the crime was an opinion that Morris\u2019s right hand, which had been cut while it was in his pocket, was probably injured early in the encounter. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">When I look at Mr. Morris\u2019s clothing and the injury to his right hand, the hand was in the right pocket, the pocket was cut through in this location towards the front of the jacket. There were perforations in the back side of the pocket. The fingers were protruding from that uh tear or cut in the uh in the pocket and were kind of intertwined with the fabric.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">That hand was so intertwined that we were afraid to take the coat off. In looking at the autopsy report and evaluating the autopsy report in conjunction with the clothing and uh the obvious trauma to Mr. Morris\u2019s hand in this particular situation and applying human nature and noticing that if we take a look at the autopsy report we see I believe six cutting wounds to the left hand or left arm of Mr. Morris which the medical examiner characterized as uh consistent with defense wounds. And anytime we see wounds on the hands or in the arms of an individual who is a victim in a case, they can be generally characterized as defense wounds, trying to ward off blows or protect yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">On the right hand or the right arm and right hand what we see is we have this cut through the pocket, we have perforations through the back of the pocket, we have the fingers intertwined with the material and we don\u2019t have a lot of cutting or stabbing wounds present on the right arm. Which suggested to me that the left arm was being used to ward off blows or to try to defend Mr. Morris while the right hand was incapacitated. Which would also suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that the right hand wounding occurred rather early in the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">At that point, defense counsel lodged her only objection, stating: \u201cWe object to that [Y]our Honor. That\u2019s conjecture at this point.\u201d The court responded: \u201cHe\u2019s been qualified. This is his opinion. You will certainly be able to cross-examine him on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On appeal, the appellant says little more, arguing that the testimony about timing of the wound \u201cwas incompetent. There was no factual basis or foundation from which he could have formed this opinion.\u201d Appellant cites no authority to support his trial contention that the expert had engaged in impermissible conjecture. We perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY IS VACATED, AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY WASHINGTON COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\">.

The only act that you can find to be adequate provocation under the evidence in this case is [a battery by the victim upon the defendant] [a fight between the victim and the defendant] [an unlawful warrantless arrest of the defendant by the victim, which the defendant knew or reasonably believed was unlawful];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">(3) the defendant was still enraged when [he] [she] killed the victim, that is, the defendant\u2019s rage had not cooled by the time of the killing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">(4) there was not enough time between the provocation and the killing for a reasonable person's rage to cool; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">(5) the victim was the person who provoked the rage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-14\">In order to convict the defendant of murder, the State must prove that the mitigating circumstance of hot blooded provocation was not present in this case. This means that the State must persuade you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at least one of the five factors was absent. If the State has failed to persuade you that at least one of the five factors was absent, you cannot find the defendant guilty of murder, but may find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-15\">In order to convict the defendant of murder, the State must prove that the defendant did not act in hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation. If the defendant did act in hot blooded response to legally adequate provocation, the verdict should be guilty of voluntary manslaughter and not guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
