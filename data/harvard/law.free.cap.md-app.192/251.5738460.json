Following a hearing, the juvenile court granted the Department\u2019s petition for continued detention or shelter care and ordered that appellant remain in the care and custody of the Department. On May 7, 2008, appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u2022 conditionally released from detention, with electronic monitoring, into the custody of her mother, Suzanne N.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">On May 13, 2008, the State filed a juvenile petition, alleging that appellant was a delinquent child for having attempted to possess marijuana. The juvenile court held an adjudicatory hearing on the State\u2019s petition on June 26, 2008, and found appellant involved in the delinquent act of attempted possession of marijuana. At the disposition hearing on July 17, 2008, the juvenile court held that appellant was a delinquent child, placed her in the custody of her older sister, Sara M., and also placed her on supervised probation under the supervision of the Department. Appellant timely appealed to this Court and presents the following three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">1. Did the court below err in denying Appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion to Hold Adjudicatory Hearing within Sixty Days?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">2. Did the juvenile court err in ruling that the State was not required to provide the name of the chemist in discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">3. Was the evidence legally insufficient to sustain the finding that Appellant was involved in the delinquent act of attempted possession of marijuana?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">On April 20, 2008, Patrolman First Class (\u201cPFC\u201d) George T. Larrimore, Jr., of the Easton Police Department, observed appellant with a group of other individuals at approximately 10:03 p.m. in the area of 12 North Washington Street in Easton, Maryland. During the course of his observations, PFC Larrimore heard appellant ask one Brandon Sinclair, \u201chey do you have any weed?\u201d and \u201cyou should let me buy a gram from you. Will you let me buy a gram?\u201d Appellant was then seen retrieving something from her pocketbook and attempting to hand it to Sinclair. Appellant and Sinclair were taken into custody and police recovered 1.8 grams of marijuana from Sinclair\u2019s person during a search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>On April 21, 2008, appellant was placed in emergency detention at the Waxter Children\u2019s Center. The next day, April 22, 2008, the Department filed a Petition for Continued Detention or Shelter Care in the juvenile court pending the possible filing of a juvenile petition. Following a hearing the same day, wherein the Department proffered the underlying bases for its petition, including that appellant attempted to possess a controlled dangerous substance, the juvenile court granted the Department\u2019s petition for continued detention at Waxter Children\u2019s Center or other secure detention facility. The court found that continued detention was necessary in order to \u201cprotect the child or the person and property of others,\u201d and because \u201cthere appears to be no parent, guardian, custodian or other person able to provide supervision and care for the child and return the child to Court when required.\u201d The juvenile court additionally found that appellant \u201chas been [a] habitual runaway, has been implicated in substance abuse, and her mother is currently out of state [until] the weekend, thus there is no supervision and considerable concern for her safety if released[.]\u201d Appellant then was ordered into the care and custody of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">That detention continued until May 7, 2008, when appellant was conditionally released with electronic monitoring to the custody of her mother. The juvenile court\u2019s order provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">Upon the matters presented before the Court in Hearing on the Petition of the State of Maryland, Department of Juvenile Services, for continued detention of [appellant] alleged to be a delinquent child, the Court finds that there is no parent, guardian, custodian or other person able to provide adequate supervision and care of and to the Respondent to the Court when required, without the assistance of electronic monitoring and compliance by respondent with the terms and conditions of a Conditional Release, but that with such monitoring and compliance, such supervision, care and return to Court can be provided by [] [appellant\u2019s] mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Following appellant\u2019s conditional release, on May 13, 2008, the State of Maryland filed a juvenile petition alleging that appellant was a delinquent child for having been involved with the attempted possession of marijuana, a controlled dangerous substance. The petition lists PFC Larrimore as the State\u2019s sole witness in support of the petition. The Office of the Public Defender entered an appearance in the juvenile court on behalf of appellant on May 22, 2008. The record additionally discloses that, although the petition was served on appellant\u2019s mother on May 23, 2008, an attempt to serve appellant with the petition that day was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On June 10, 2008, after the State provided discovery, appellant\u2019s attorney filed a Demand for Presence of Chemist, Analyst, or Person in Chain of Custody, citing Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, appellant\u2019s attorney filed a motion in the juvenile court, entitled \u201cMotion to Hold Adjudicatory Hearing within Sixty Days.\u201d The motion requested that the adjudicatory hearing be set on or before June 20, 2008, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">1. On April 20, 2008 Respondent was arrested and ordered detained by an intake officer, pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, section 3-8A-15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">2. This Honorable Court, sitting as a Juvenile Court, obtained jurisdiction of the Respondent when the State filed a petition alleging that the Respondent is a delinquent child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">3. This Honorable Court then held a hearing on April 22, 2008 on the State\u2019s petition for continued detention. At that hearing, this Court authorized continued secure detention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>4. Also at this April 22nd hearing, Respondent received formal notice of the allegation contained in petition number J-08-5460.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">5. Pursuant to Rule 11-114 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, an adjudicatory hearing shall be held within 60 days after a juvenile petition is served on the respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">6. Respondent\u2019s scheduled adjudicatory hearing for petition number J-08-5460 is June 26, 2008, which is outside the 60-day time requirement mandated by Maryland Rule 11-114. At this time, Respondent has not waived her right to adjudication within 60 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">On June 10, 2008, the State filed a response to this motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">1. The Petition in this case was filed on May 7, 2008 [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">2. The Respondent\u2019s attorney entered her appearance on May 22, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">3. The Respondent has not yet been served with the Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">4. There was a Continued Detention Hearing on April 22, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">5. Rule 11-114 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure provides that an Adjudicatory Hearing shall be held within sixty days after the juvenile Petition is served on the respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">6. Since the Petition has not been served, the currently scheduled date is not in violation of the sixty day time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">On June 11, 2008, the juvenile court entered a written order denying appellant\u2019s Motion to Hold Adjudicatory Hearing within Sixty Days. Thereafter, on June 26, 2008, the adjudicatory hearing was held before the juvenile court. The record reveals that appellant was personally served with the petition at 9:00 a.m. that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Prior to receiving evidence at the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel renewed the motion to hold the adjudicatory hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>within sixty days. Appellant contended that, because the juvenile court had jurisdiction over appellant at the April 22, 2008 detention hearing, the adjudicatory hearing should have been held on June 20, 2008, and that there was no extraordinary cause to hold the hearing on June 26, 2008. Specifically, counsel stated, \u201cwithout the extraordinary cause finding I don\u2019t believe that we can go forward today.\u201d The State responded that the sixty day time period of Rule 11-114 did not begin to run until the petition was served. The State also argued that \u201c[a] continued detention hearing after the juvenile is arrested is not considered filing a petition. It\u2019s not considered a notice of the charges because the charges are not filed until the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office signs the petition and files it with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">After the juvenile court confirmed that appellant actually was served with the petition the day of the adjudicatory hearing, her counsel argued that, pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">a child may be placed in detention for, to protect the child or others, or if the child is likely to leave. And then it talks about how continuation of detention under section (d) if they are not released then they shall immediately file petition to authorize detention and have a hearing. And I think that the rules contemplate at that hearing for continued detention as it\u2019s done in most jurisdictions, the petition is filed at that time. Otherwise I\u2019m just not sure how the Court\u2019s getting to jurisdiction to authorize continued detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Noting that appellant was released on May 7th on electronic monitoring, and after agreeing with appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s suggestion that this was still detention, the juvenile court ruled on this motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">But I think that the time line I have to agree with [the State] begins with the filing of a petition. Why the petition was not filed sooner I can\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know why it was not filed sooner. She was detained on April 22nd. The petition was filed on May 13, she was released on home detention prior to the filing of the petition. Judge Earnest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>denied the motion. I\u2019m going to deny the motion. It\u2019s an interesting question and I\u2019m glad you raised it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">After denying appellant\u2019s renewed motion, the juvenile court then heard argument on a different issue related to appellant\u2019s demand for the presence of the chemist under C.J. \u00a7 10-1003. While the chemist was not listed as a witness on the petition, the State proffered that it sent appellant\u2019s counsel a copy of the drug analysis report on June 9, 2008, and that the name of the chemist was included on that report. After appellant filed the demand pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 10-1003, the State then subpoenaed the chemist to testify. The State informed the court that appellant was now objecting to the chemist\u2019s testimony on the grounds that the State failed to provide notice that the chemist would testify. After learning that the chemist was present and prepared to testify, the court initially ruled that the State satisfied appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Thereafter, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that filing a demand for a chemist was her normal practice, and that such a demand did not \u201cabsolve[] the State of their duty for continued discovery.\u201d After stating that the purpose of the demand was to \u201chave our Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine people,\u201d appellant then moved to exclude the chemist\u2019s testimony because the State failed to comply with its duty of continuing discovery under Maryland Rule 11-109. The following then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">THE COURT: Address the prejudice issue. Tell me how you have been prejudiced. Have you not seen the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have reviewed the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">THE COURT: So have you been prejudiced in anyway [sic] by the late production of the report or the fact that [the State] did not supply that in the normal course of discovery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I didn\u2019t prepare questions for a chemist. I wasn\u2019t anticipating a chemist being here. And for some ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">THE COURT: But aren\u2019t we talking about an issue were the chemist not here, you would be standing here telling me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>another story. You would say, all right, I demanded the chemist, he\u2019s not here, State cannot go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, if the chemist were not here the State would not be able to prove their case. I wouldn\u2019t be objecting to that. I wouldn\u2019t be saying bring the chemist in. If I had gotten notice that the chemist was going to be here and demanded their presence and they weren\u2019t here, the burden\u2019s on the State to produce this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">THE COURT: I agree but the sword cuts both ways. Had [the State] not produced the chemist today you would be standing here in front of me saying something entirely different. You would say to me, Judge, I demanded a chemist to be here, he\u2019s not here, the State cannot go forward and I would agree with you. I\u2019d have to agree with you because you had made the demand. You made the demand, he is here, we will go forward. I\u2019m going to deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The juvenile court then proceeded to hear evidence from the State\u2019s first witness, PFC Larrimore. PFC Larrimore was on duty on April 20, 2008, at approximately 10:03 p.m., in the area of 12 North Washington Street in Easton, Maryland. Conducting surveillance of the area from a concealed position near some bushes in front of the circuit courthouse, PFC Larrimore observed appellant in a \u201cvery well lit\u201d area, near a bench in front of the Courthouse Square shops, with approximately three other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">PFC Larrimore testified that he was approximately 50 feet away from the group, and that he could \u201cabsolutely\u201d hear what this group was saying from his concealed position. He observed this group for approximately forty minutes, and during that time, a person known to PFC Larrimore as Conrad Frederick \u201cRickey\u201d Horney approached. According to PFC Larrimore, appellant told a person in the group named \u201cMushaw,\u201d \u201cask him.\u201d Mushaw then asked Horney, \u201cdo you have any weed?\u201d Horney responded, \u201cno, I\u2019m trying to score some myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>A short time later, Brandon Sinclair approached appellant\u2019s group and began a conversation. During that discussion, PFC Larrimore heard appellant ask Sinclair, \u201chey do you have any weed?\u201d PFC Larrimore then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">At which point Mr. Sinclair said actually I do. Then Mr. Mushaw asked Mr. Sinclair how much do you have. Then Mr. Sinclair replied three grams. He pulled an item out of his pocket and showed it to both [appellant] and Mr. Mushaw. At that point [appellant] stated to Mr. Sinclair, her exact words were, you should let me buy a gram from you. Will you let me buy a gram?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">PFC Larrimore then testified about his observations after this discussion between appellant and Sinclair, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvQ\">[Appellant] continued to clutch whatever item she had retrieved from her pocketbook in her hand. She tried several times. It appeared she tried several times to hand it to Mr. Sinclair. Each time that they tried to do this it was approximately three or four times that this was attempted. Each time that it was attempted, there\u2019s a business two doors down that\u2019s called Scoccia\u2019s that was currently [sic] had clientele out front and folks were walking to and from that restaurant. As they would walk from the restaurant [appellant] would place her hand down and Mr. Sinclair would not approach her. As they would walk away she would attempt to hand him the item again, Mr. Sinclair would approach her and the people would walk away again. [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Appellant, Mushaw, and Sinclair then discussed how to smoke the \u201cweed,\u201d and Mushaw indicated that he would buy a soda, empty the can, and then \u201cthey could all smoke weed by using the can.\u201d At around this same time, Sinclair produced a number of window chalk markers, handed them out to the others, and then, for some unknown reason, appellant, Mushaw, and a person named \u201cFifer\u201d began to write on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>nearby store windows with those markers. At this point, PFC Larrimore had police officers respond, and he emerged from his concealed surveillance location.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After detaining the subjects, PFC Larrimore then searched Sinclair and recovered from his front left hand pocket a clear ziploc baggie containing three smaller ziploc baggies. Those smaller ziploc baggies contained a \u201cgreen vegetable matter.\u201d That substance was packaged and sent to the drug lab for analysis. No marijuana was recovered from appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The State next called Catherine Savage, a forensic scientist with the Maryland State Police Forensics Scientist Division. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court accepted Savage as an expert forensic scientist in the field of controlled dangerous substances. Savage testified that she analyzed State\u2019s Exhibit 1 in this ease, the green vegetable matter seized from Sinclair, and that this substance was 1.8 grams of marijuana, a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">At the conclusion of this evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the charges for failure to prove the chain of custody. Appellant also made a motion for judgment of acquittal, contending that, because no marijuana was recovered from appellant, and no testimony was adduced concerning money, the State had failed to establish that appellant made a substantial step towards possession of the marijuana. The State did not respond to the chain of custody motion, but responded that the facts were sufficient to establish attempted possession of marijuana. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">After appellant exercised her right not to testify, appellant rested her case without producing any evidence. Appellant then renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal, maintaining that the State had failed to prove a substantial step towards the purchase of marijuana. Appellant also questioned the ability of PFC Larrimore to actually hear the conversations from his surveillance location.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The court ruled that appellant was involved in the attempted possession of marijuana. In support of that ruling, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>court found that PFC Larrimore \u201cwas stationed in a location that he could see what was going on and he could hear what was going on. But I have nothing to tell me to the contrary that he was not able.\u201d Further, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">So the Court certainly can conclude from his testimony that he had an opportunity to see and hear what he testified to. And then he testified that he heard [appellant] say to Mr. Mushaw, when Conrad Horney approached the group, Mr. Horney came up [to] the group and [appellant] asked Mr. Mushaw to ask Horney if he had any weed. We don\u2019t know exactly what took place after that but then Mr. Sinclair appears on the scene. And I don\u2019t know whether we have an exit on Horney and an entry of Sinclair but we do know that Sinclair comes on the scene and [appellant] asked Mr. Sinclair if he had any weed. And the next phrase was, let me buy a gram. I think that we all over time learn that the lexicon of the street is something that is unlike what we understood common terms to mean when we were much younger. The phrase weed or the term weed means much, much more than than [sic] it did 10 or 15 years ago. In fact I suspect that when someone uses the word weed it doesn\u2019t refer to crabgrass and lawn growth any longer. Because weed is certainly to younger folks and to this member of the Court having been in courtrooms now for 40 years means exactly what it is intended to mean, and that is marijuana. It doesn\u2019t mean smack or anything but marijuana. And that of course is bolstered and buttressed by the fact that Mr. Sinclair was found to have marijuana on his person by the officer when he apprehended him. So the Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] did in fact attempt to possess marijuana on or about April 20th, 2008. I don\u2019t know what she had in her purse but certainly the evidence is that she had the ability to make the purchase or she would not have approached someone and asked to buy a gram. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go up to someone and say do you have any weed let me buy a gram if one were not in the position to carry it forward [sic] that request. So the Court finds that the evidence of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>does support a finding of involved. And the Court -will find that [appellant] is in fact involved as a result of the occurrence of April 20th, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On July 17, 2008, the juvenile court held a disposition hearing in this case, as well as another case where the court previously found appellant involved in the unauthorized removal of an automobile. After hearing recommendations from the Department and the State, and after hearing from appellant, her mother, Suzanne N., her sister, Sara M., and her counsel, the juvenile court adopted the recommendations of the Department, found appellant to be a delinquent child, and then committed her to the care and custody of her sister, Sara M., under the supervision of the Department. The juvenile court also ordered standard as well as special conditions, including that appellant successfully complete outpatient addictions and mental health treatment programs, and complete her education. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We will include additional facts in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Appellant first contends that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion to hold the adjudicatory hearing within sixty days. Citing generally C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15, and more specifically, Rule ll-114(b), appellant asserts that, when the court granted the Department\u2019s petition for continued detention or shelter care on April 22, 2008, ordering that appellant may be a delinquent child, that \u201c[t]his notice of pending delinquency proceedings should have triggered the start of the 60-day time period for holding an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The State responds that the adjudicatory hearing was held within the proper time frame in this case, pursuant to Rule ll-114(b). The State specifically asserts that, \u201cunder the plain language of the rule, the triggering event is the service of the delinquency petition upon the juvenile.\u201d Because appellant was actually served on June 26, 2008, the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>adjudicatory hearing, the State contends that the juvenile court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion. For the following reasons, we hold that, pursuant to Rule 11 \u2014 114(b)(1), the adjudicatory hearing was held within sixty days after the juvenile petition was served and thus the juvenile court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Maryland has adopted \u201ca separate system for juvenile offenders, civil in nature.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 91, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994); <em>accord In re Areal B., </em>177 Md.App. 708, 714, 938 A.2d 43 (2007) (\u201cJuvenile causes are civil, not criminal proceedings.\u201d).

At that hearing, the allegations against the child must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-18(c); Rule 11-114(e). After the adjudicatory hearing, the court must hold a separate disposition hearing. C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-19(b); Rule 11-115. At disposition, the court should determine: \u201c(1) [w]hether a child needs or requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation; and if so (2) [t]he nature of the guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d C.J. 3-8A-01(p). As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cThe process by which a child is determined to be delinquent consists of a two-step procedure: an adjudicatory hearing, then a disposition hearing. Only after the adjudicatory judge finds that the child has committed a delinquent act and the dispositional judge finds that the juvenile is in need of guidance, treatment or rehabilitation, can a juvenile be classified as a \u2018delinquent child.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>In re Charles K, </em>135 Md.App. 84, 93-94, 761 A.2d 978 (2000) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>In re George V., </em>87 Md.App. 188, 190-91, 589 A.2d 521 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">This issue concerns the scheduling of the adjudicatory hearing under Rule ll-114(b)(l). That rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">b. Scheduling of hearing. 1. Adjudicatory hearing. An adjudicatory hearing shall be held within sixty days after the juvenile petition is served on the respondent unless a waiver petition is filed, in which case an adjudicatory hearing shall be held within thirty days after the court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to retain jurisdiction at the conclusion of the waiver hearing. However, upon motion made on the record within these time limits by the petitioner or the respondent, the administrative judge of the county or a judge designated by him, for extraordinary cause shown, may extend the time within which the adjudicatory hearing may be held. The judge shall state on the record the cause which requires an extension and specify the number of days of the extension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Under the plain language of Rule 11 \u2014 114(b)(1), the adjudicatory hearing is to be held within sixty days after the petition is <em>served </em>on the juvenile. The record in this case shows that service was attempted on appellant on May 23, 2008, but that appellant was not actually served with the petition until June 26, 2008. Therefore, the adjudicatory hearing was held in a timely manner pursuant to Md. Rule 11 \u2014 114(b); <em>see also In Re Ryan S., </em>369 Md. 26, 48-49, 797 A.2d 39 (2002) (stating that juveniles \u201chave a right to have timely and continuous adjudication so that a determination can be made, as quickly as possible, as to whether the juvenile is involved or not involved in the alleged delinquent act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Moreover, even were we to conclude that there was a violation of Rule 11-114(b), dismissal is not an appropriate sanction under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has made clear that \u201c \u2018only the most extraordinary and egregious circumstances should be allowed to dictate dismissal as the sanction for this violation of a procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Timothy C., </em>376 Md. 414, 434, 829 A.2d 1024 (2003) (quoting <em>In re Keith </em>W., 310 Md. 99, 109, 527 A.2d 35 (1987)). As the Court said in <em>In re Keith W.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">As we see it, the foremost consideration in the disposition of a juvenile proceeding should be a course of treatment and rehabilitation best suited to promote the full growth and development of the child. Only the most extraordinary and egregious circumstances should be allowed to dictate dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>missal as the sanction for this violation of a procedural rule. Thus, in determining whether dismissal is an appropriate sanction for a violation of Rule 914 [now Rule 11-114], a judge presiding over a juvenile cause should examine the totality of the circumstances as required by Rule 1-201.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] In doing so, the judge must keep in mind the overriding purpose of the juvenile statute along with the fact that this purpose will ordinarily not be served by dismissal of the juvenile proceeding. Neither the juvenile nor society should be denied the benefits of the juvenile\u2019s rehabilitation because of a technical violation of Rule 914\u2019s scheduling requirements. Nevertheless, we do not foreclose the possibility that under some circumstances dismissal will be a proper sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">310 Md. at 109-10, 527 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim is that she received \u201cformal notice of the allegation\u201d contained in the juvenile petition on April 22, 2008. Accordingly, appellant argues that the adjudicatory hearing should have been held on June 20, 2008. The adjudicatory hearing actually was held six days after appellant\u2019s suggested deadline, on June 26, 2008. We view appellant\u2019s claim as elevating form over substance, because there clearly was no inordinate delay in this case. Further, accepting appellant\u2019s argument that the adjudicatory hearing should have been held six days earlier does little to advance the underlying purpose of treating and rehabilitating juveniles alleged to be involved in the commission of a delinquent act. The juvenile court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Appellant next contends that the juvenile court erred when it permitted the forensic chemist to testify, because the State failed to provide the proper notice pursuant to Maryland Rule ll-109(a)(3)(c). Appellant also maintains that she was denied her constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine the witness, because she was deprived of the opportunity to prepare for the witness\u2019s testimony. The State does not respond to appellant\u2019s constitutional claim, but maintains that there was no discovery violation under the Rule and that the juvenile court properly exercised discretion as the chemist was subpoenaed in response to appellant\u2019s demand pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 10-1003. We hold that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Regarding appellant\u2019s discovery claim under Rule 11-109, that rule requires the State, without the necessity of a request by the juvenile, to provide \u201cthe name and address of each person whom the State intends to call as a witness at any hearing to prove its case in chief or to rebut alibi testimony to the extent then known[.]\u201d Rule ll-109(a)(3)(c). Further, there is a continuing duty to disclose additional information when \u201ca party learns of additional information previously requested and required to be furnished____\u201d Rule 11-109(a)(8). The rule also provides a range of discretionary sanctions for non-compliance. Rule ll-109(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Although Rule 11-109 governs discovery in juvenile proceedings, the criminal counterpart to this rule, Rule 4-263, provides us with guidance. As the Court of Appeals has stated, \u201c[discovery questions generally involve a very broad discretion that is to be exercised by the trial courts. Their determinations will be disturbed on appellate review only if there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Cole v. State, </em>378 Md. 42, 55, 835 A.2d 600 (2003) (internal citations omitted). Further, although factual findings of the trial court are not upset unless clearly erroneous, the question whether a discovery violation occurred under the Maryland Rules is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 56, 835 A.2d 600. \u201cWhere a discovery rule has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>violated, the remedy is, \u2018in the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The exercise of that discretion includes evaluating whether a discovery violation has caused prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 178, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Here, the State initially informed appellant in the petition, filed on May 13, 2008, that PFC Larrimore would be the State\u2019s sole witness. On June 9, 2008, the State provided appellant\u2019s counsel with a copy of the chemist\u2019s drug analysis as well as the chemist\u2019s name. Thereafter, on June 10, 2008, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a demand for the presence of the chemist at trial. The State then subpoenaed the chemist, but apparently did not supplement the discovery by notifying appellant\u2019s counsel that the chemist would now testify. This appears to be a violation of Rule ll-109(a)(8), which requires a party to supplement discovery when that party \u201clearns of additional information previously requested and required to be furnished____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Assuming a discovery violation, the juvenile court nevertheless properly exercised discretion in permitting the chemist to testify because appellant was not prejudiced in this case. Whether to impose sanctions for a discovery violation is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 570, 919 A.2d 49 (2007) (noting that the discovery rule \u201cdoes not require the court to take any action; it merely authorizes the court to act\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Further, \u201c[t]he most accepted view of discovery sanctions is that in fashioning a sanction, the court should impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 919 A.2d 49. \u201cExclusion of evidence for a discovery violation is not a favored sanction and is one of the most drastic measures that can be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 919 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that she had reviewed the chemist\u2019s report concerning the marijuana prior to trial. Although appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that she did not prepare questions for a chemist, we observe that the report was provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>discovery on June 9, 2008, approximately seventeen days prior to the trial on June 26, 2008. Additionally, we note that, when the State raised this issue at trial, appellant did not ask for a continuance to prepare for the chemist\u2019s testimony. Under these circumstances, the trial court could properly conclude that appellant was not prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 919 A.2d 49 (concluding that petitioner was not prejudiced and observing that petitioner did not seek a continuance for the belated disclosure, but instead, sought the windfall of exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">As to appellant\u2019s constitutional claim, we have recognized that the Supreme Court has extended various constitutional protections to juvenile proceedings, including notice of charges; right to counsel; right to confrontation and cross-examination; and the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. <em>In re Appeal No. 977, </em>22 Md.App. 511, 516, 323 A.2d 663 (1974) (citing <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967)). However, \u201ca criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to cross-examination is not boundless.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 399, 426, 970 A.2d 968 (2009). \u201cThe question is \u2018whether the trial judge imposed limitations upon cross-examination that inhibited the ability of the defendant to receive a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 681-82, 831 A.2d 432 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Appellant claims that she was \u201cdeprived of the opportunity to prepare questions for this witness as a consequence of the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d Appellant has not cited any pertinent authority for that premise, and we note that the Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause only protects a defendant\u2019s trial rights, and does not compel the pretrial production of information that might be useful in preparing for trial.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 53 n. 9,107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">[t]he ability to question adverse witnesses, however, does not include the power to require the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that might be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony. Normally the right to confront one\u2019s accusers is satisfied if defense counsel receives wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>latitude at trial to question witnesses. In short, the Confrontation Clause only guarantees \u201can <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 53,107 S.Ct. 989 (citation and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Savage was not extensive and primarily focused on the chain of custody, there is no indication in the record that appellant\u2019s ability or opportunity to question Savage at trial was restricted by the juvenile court. Further, we again note that appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that she had reviewed the chemist\u2019s report, and the record indicates counsel had that report for over two weeks prior to the adjudicatory hearing. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that appellant was not denied her right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">In addition, we also hold that any error, constitutional or otherwise, was harmless. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 616, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003) (\u201c[I]t has long been settled policy of this court not to reverse for harmless error.\u201d (Internal citations omitted).). Based on appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and closing argument, it appears that appellant\u2019s theory of the case primarily focused on (1) the credibility of PFC Larrimore; (2) the fact that no marijuana was recovered from appellant\u2019s person and no one witnessed an exchange of money; and (3) the fact that there may have been a problem in the chain of custody of the drugs recovered from Sinclair. There was no indication that this theory would be adversely impacted by the chemist\u2019s opinion that those drugs were actually marijuana. Indeed, when the chemist\u2019s report was offered into evidence, appellant stated that \u201cmy objection is that all the people in the chain of custody aren\u2019t here.\u201d Given that the actual cross-examination of the chemist focused on chain of custody issues, and not the chemist\u2019s opinions or conclusions, we conclude that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Finally, appellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding that she was involved in the attempted possession of marijuana. The State responds that the evidence was sufficient, because the evidence \u201cestablish[es] several substantial steps towards the commission of the crime of possession of marijuana.\u201d We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As indicated, an allegation that a juvenile has committed a delinquent act must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-18(c); Rule ll-114(e)(l). The evidence is legally sufficient to meet this standard in a juvenile delinquency case if, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [State], <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 388, 681 A.2d 501 (1996) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>accord In re Anthony W., </em>388 Md. 251, 261, 879 A.2d 717 (2005). Further, \u201c[j]udging the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses and resolving conflicts in the evidence are matters entrusted to the sound discretion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. at 379, 681 A.2d 501. Finally, \u201cwe have held that the judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed unless the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Anthony W., </em>388 Md. at 261, 879 A.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 5-601(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) makes it unlawful to \u201cpossess or administer to another a controlled dangerous substance, unless obtained directly or by prescription or order from an authorized provider acting in the course of professional practice.\u201d \u201c \u2018Possess\u2019 means to exercise actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 5-101(u). Thus, in order to support a conviction for a possessory offense, the \u201cevidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited narcotic drug in the sense contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>plated by the statute, <em>ie., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or directing influence over it.\u201d <em>Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 142, 321 A.2d 767 (1974); <em>accord State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 432, 842 A.2d 716 (2004). Further, \u201c[i]t has long been established that the mere fact that the contraband is not found on the defendant\u2019s person does not necessarily preclude an inference by the trier of fact that the defendant had possession of the contraband.\u201d <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 432, 842 A.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This case concerns the attempted possession of a controlled dangerous substance. For the crime of attempt, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Under Maryland common law, the attempt to commit a crime is, itself, a separate misdemeanor. It is, however, an \u201cadjunct crime\u201d that \u201ccannot exist by itself, but only in connection with another crime.\u201d The attempt thus attaches itself to the substantive offense and is committed when a person, with the intent to commit that substantive offense \u201cengages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that crime, whether or not his [or her] intention is accomplished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>State v. North, </em>356 Md. 308, 312, 739 A.2d 33 (1999) (citations omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Here, on April 20, 2008, at approximately 10:03 p.m., appellant was seen in front of 12 North Washington Street, in Easton, Maryland, by PFC Larrimore, with another group of individuals. PFC Larrimore indicated that the area was well lit and that he could hear the individuals\u2019s conversations from his surveillance location. At one point during the course of his forty minutes of observation of this group, PFC Larrimore heard appellant tell Mushaw, \u201cask him,\u201d at which time Mushaw asked Horney, \u201cdo you have any weed?\u201d Horney responded, \u201cno, I\u2019m trying to score some myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">A short time later, Sinclair arrived, and PFC Larrimore heard appellant ask Sinclair, \u201chey do you have any weed?\u201d Further, PFC Larrimore testified that \u201cher exact words were, you should let me buy a gram from you. Will you let me buy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>a gram?\u201d Thereafter, PFC Larrimore observed appellant retrieve an unknown item from her pocketbook, clutch it in her hands, and attempt on three or four occasions to hand it to Sinclair. Appellant, Mushaw, and Sinclair then discussed how to smoke the \u201cweed,\u201d and Mushaw indicated that he would buy a soda, empty the can, and \u201cthey could all smoke weed by using the can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The police then took the individuals into custody. The police recovered 1.8 grams of marijuana from Sinclair\u2019s person. Although no marijuana was recovered from appellant\u2019s person, these facts support a rational inference that appellant engaged in multiple substantial steps towards the commission of illegal possession of marijuana. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the juvenile court\u2019s finding that appellant was involved in the delinquent act of attempted possession of a controlled dangerous substance, to wit, marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">. That section provides, in pertinent part: \"In a criminal proceeding, the prosecution shall, upon written demand of a defendant filed in the proceedings at least 5 days prior to a trial in the proceeding, require the presence of the chemist, analyst, or any person in the chain of custody as a prosecution witness.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 101003(a)(1) Cts. &amp; Jud.

Upon subsequent questioning by the juvenile court, PFC Larrimore testified that he could not see what appellant was clutching in her hand at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">. During argument on her renewed motion in the juvenile court, appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that, generally, a petition is filed at the same time as the hearing for detention or shelter care pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15(d). Wc note that, under that Rule, \u2018\u2018[a]n adjudicatory or waiver hearing shall be held no later than 30 days after the date a petition for detention or community detention is granted.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15(d)(6)(i). Further, that statute provides additional requirements for continued detention or community detention beyond an emergency detention. <em>See </em>C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15(e). Although appellant generally cited C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15 in her motion to the juvenile court, as well in her brief in this Court, appellant does not contend that a thirty-day time limit applies in this case. We also note that we have not been asked to address appellant\u2019s assertion before the juvenile court, and that court's apparent agreement, that appellant\u2019s conditional release remained a form of \"detention.\u201d <em>Cf. Deville v.

Instead, appellant maintains that the adjudicatory hearing should have been held within the sixty-day time limit of Maryland Rule 11-114(b). Accordingly, any argument appellant raised in the juvenile court under different provisions of C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-15 is not before us. <em>See Moosavi v.
