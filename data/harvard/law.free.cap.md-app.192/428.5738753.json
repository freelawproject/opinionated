EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Appellant, James Grove, appeals from an order by the Circuit Court for Garrett County awarding appellee, Ronald George, $2,040.40 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The genesis of the appeal is appellant\u2019s claim for breach of a residential contract of sale (the \u201cContract\u201d) entered into between the parties. By memorandum opinion and order, dated October 24, 2008, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee with respect to the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Over a month after the judgment had been entered, on December 1, 2008, appellee filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs which, among other things, was based on a provision in the Contract entitling the prevailing party in any action on the Contract to recover attorney\u2019s fees. In response, appellant argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs after final judgment on the merits. After a hearing, the circuit court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to appellee based on the provision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Appellant presents a single contention for our review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Did the [circuit] court err in awarding appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">fees and costs post-judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">On December 30, 2005, appellant entered into the Contract to purchase improved real estate owned by appellee. On June 25, 2007, appellant filed a complaint in the District Court of Maryland in Garrett County. In the complaint, appellant asserted claims for negligent and intentional misrepresentation, stemming from appellee\u2019s alleged failure to disclose an infestation of flying squirrels in the attic of the building on the property and the resulting \u201cbiohazard\u201d from the squirrels\u2019 \u201ctoilet sites and fecal matter.\u201d Pursuant to appellee\u2019s request for a jury trial, the case was transferred to circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">After discovery, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, in which he requested the circuit court to enter sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>mary judgment in his favor and to provide \u201csuch other and further relief as the nature of his cause may in justice require.\u201d Appellee did not specifically request an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. By memorandum opinion and order, dated October 24, 2008, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that appellant was unable as a matter of law to prove an essential element of his case. The court did not award attorney\u2019s fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">On December 1, 2008, appellee filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, citing, among other things, a provision in the Contract that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES: In any action or proceeding between Buyer and Seller based, in whole or in part, upon the performance or non-performance of the terms and conditions of this Contract, including, but not limited to, breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation or fraud, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive reasonable attorney\u2019s fees from the other party as determined by the court or arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On March 6, 2009, the circuit court entered a memorandum opinion awarding appellee attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,000 and costs in the amount of $40.40, based on the quoted provision. In that opinion, the circuit court noted that appellee\u2019s \u201cclaim for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs [ ] did not arise until this Court granted [appellee\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Appellant contends the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the post-judgment motion for attorneys fees. More specifically, appellant argues that when a circuit court enters judgment and has neither addressed the issue of attorney\u2019s fees nor reserved the issue for later disposition, the prescribed procedural mechanism to request attorney\u2019s fees is by filing a motion under either Maryland Rule 2-534<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>535(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A 2-534 motion to alter or amend the judgment must be filed, if at all, within ten days after the entry of judgment. A motion to revise the judgment under 2-535(a) must be filed within thirty days after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Because appellee filed his motion for attorney\u2019s fees just over one month after the circuit court had entered a final judgment in the underlying breach of contract action, and therefore, outside the timeliness standards under those rules, appellant contends the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to \u201creview, amend, supplement, or otherwise affect the \u2018final\u2019 order of October 24, 2008\u201d by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to appellee. In making this argument, appellant implicitly assumes the requested attorney\u2019s fees are an integral part of the final judgment, rather than a collateral issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201cGenerally, jurisdiction of a trial court with regard to a specific case ends upon enrollment of a final judgment, which occurs thirty days after its entry.\u201d <em>Mullaney v. Aude, </em>126 Md.App. 639, 650, 730 A.2d 759 (1999); <em>see Chapman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Kamara, </em>356 Md. 426, 435, 739 A.2d 387 (1999) (citing Maryland Rule 2-535). This rule does not, however, preclude a trial court from entertaining a collateral or independent matter. <em>Mullaney, </em>126 Md.App. at 650, 730 A.2d 759 (citing <em>Dent v. Simmons, </em>61 Md.App. 122, 129, 485 A.2d 270 (1985)). \u201cOnly those ... orders which affect the \u2018 \u201cmeat,\u201d or subject matter of [the case]\u2019 have been prohibited.\u201d <em>Mullaney, </em>126 Md.App. at 650, 730 A.2d 759 (quoting <em>Dent, </em>61 Md.App. at 130, 485 A.2d 270).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Because Rules 2-534 and Rule 2-535(a) and their respective timeliness standards are derived from Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(b) and 59(e), <em>Carr v. Lee, </em>135 Md.App. 213, 227, 762 A.2d 142 (2000), we frequently look to the federal courts\u2019 treatment of cases under federal rules. The Supreme Court, in <em>White v. New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec., </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982), considered whether a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, filed four and a half months after the entry of final judgment on the merits, should be categorized as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment and, therefore, subject to the Rule\u2019s ten-day timeliness standard. The Court held that it should not, and consequently, the motion was not untimely. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">Rule 59(e) was added to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1946. Its draftsmen had a clear and narrow aim. According to the accompanying Advisory Committee Report, the rule was adopted to \u201cmake[ ] clear that the district court possesses the power\u201d to rectify its own mistakes in the period immediately following the entry of judgment. The question of the court\u2019s authority to do so had arisen in <em>Boaz v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>146 F.2d 321, 322 (C.A.8 1944). According to their Report, the draftsmen intended Rule 59(e) specifically \u201cto care for a situation such as that arising in Boaz.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Consistently with this original understanding, the federal courts generally have invoked Rule 59(e) only to support reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits. <em>E.g., Browder v. Director, </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). By contrast, a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action \u2014 issues to which Rule 59(e) was never intended to apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">Section 1988 provides for awards of attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Regardless of when attorney\u2019s fees are requested, the court\u2019s decision of entitlement to fees will therefore require an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits \u2014 an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has \u201cprevailed.\u201d Nor can attorney\u2019s fees fairly be characterized as an element of \u201crelief\u2019 indistinguishable from other elements. Unlike other judicial relief, the attorney\u2019s fees allowed under \u00a7 1988 are not compensation for the injury giving rise to an action. Their award is uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoLZ\"><em>Id. </em>at 450-52, 102 S.Ct. 1162 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161,170, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939) (observing that a petition for attorney\u2019s fees in equity is \u201can independent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and not a request for a modification of the original decree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In <em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988), the Supreme Court later applied <em>White </em>when it considered the impact of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees on the finality of a judgment and, hence, the timeliness of an appeal. The Court held that a district court\u2019s decision on the merits of an employment compensation claim was \u201cfinal\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding an unresolved motion for attorney\u2019s fees filed by the prevailing party under a Colorado fee-shifting statute. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 108 S.Ct. 1717. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">As a general matter, at least, we think it indisputable that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain. Such an award does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action, and indeed is often available to the party defending against the action. At common law, attorney\u2019s fees were regarded as an element of \u201ccosts\u201d awarded to the prevailing party, <em>see </em>10 C. Wright, A. Miller, <em>&amp; </em>M. Kane, Federal Practice and Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>dure: Civil \u00a7 2665 (1983), which are not generally treated as part of the merits judgment, cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 58 (\u201cEntry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 201, 108 S.Ct. 1717. <em>See also Cooler &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 395, 110 S.Ct. 2447,110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (recognizing that collateral issues \u2014 such as costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and contempt sanctions are under the jurisdiction of a trial court \u201cafter the principal suit has been terminated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Maryland appellate courts have adopted and applied the <em>White </em>rationale with respect to claims for attorney\u2019s fees that are statute or Rule based and have held that such claims are collateral matters. <em>See, e.g., Blake v. Blake, </em>341 Md. 326, 336, 670 A.2d 472 (1996) (holding that an appeal from a trial court\u2019s judgment on the merits does not deprive the judgment-rendering court of jurisdiction to consider an award of counsel fees under Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-110, 12-103 of the Family Law Article); <em>County Exec. of Prince George\u2019s County v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 451 n. 4, 479 A.2d 352 (1984) (holding that \u201cunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, a claim for an attorney\u2019s fee [by the prevailing party], while an integral part of the remedy under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, is viewed as a collateral matter from the \u00a7 1983 action,\u201d and therefore such a \u201cclaim for an attorney\u2019s fee may be brought following a final judgment in a \u00a7 1983 action.\u201d); <em>Litty v. Becker, </em>104 Md.App. 370, 376-78, 656 A.2d 365 (1995) (holding that a trial court could entertain a motion for sanctions under Rule 1-341, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, even after the judgment had been entered, appealed, and the appeal concluded because \u201ca motion for costs pursuant to Md. Rule 1-341 is an \u2018independent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and a trial court is not deprived of jurisdiction\u2019 whenever costs are sought.\u201d)(quoting <em>Sprague, </em>307 U.S. at 170, 59 S.Ct. 777); <em>Dent, </em>61 Md.App. at 129-30, 485 A.2d 270 (holding that a trial court retained jurisdiction to entertain a motion for sanctions, including attorney\u2019s fees, more than three months after it had entered a final judgment, despite a pending appeal, because the issue of attorney\u2019s fees \u201craised legal issues collateral to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>main cause of action,\u201d which \u201cwould not affect the subject matter of the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>White, </em>and the opinions of the Court of Appeals and this Court, we conclude that appellee\u2019s post-judgment request for attorney\u2019s fees was \u201ccollateral to the main cause of action.\u201d <em>White, </em>455 U.S. at 451, 102 S.Ct. 1162. The attorney\u2019s fee award in this case is not predicated on a statutory prevailing party provision, as in <em>White </em>and <em>Budinich, </em>but on the contractual obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party ... as determined by the court or arbitrator.\u201d For all practical purposes, we see no difference between payment of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party under a statute and payment of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party under a contract when the prevailing party was the defendant and did not make a claim for breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As elaborated upon below, the situation before us is very different from the situation in which the plaintiff in a breach of contract action is the prevailing party. Unlike that situation, the attorney\u2019s fees request in the present matter was not part of a breach of contract claim for damages. Further, it did not, in any way, urge the circuit court to reconsider its holdings of law and fact to determine whether its prior judgment was correct. Appellee\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is therefore not properly categorized as a motion under either Rule 2-534 or 2-535(a), which are treated the same in these circumstances. Like a Federal Rule 59(e) motion, they are usually \u201cinvoked only to support reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>White, </em>455 U.S. at 452, 102 S.Ct. 1162; P.V. Niemeyer and L.M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary, 455 (3rd ed. 2003) (stating that a motion under 2-534 \u201casks the court to reconsider its judgment and to alter, modify, or reverse it, based on arguments made in the motion\u201d). Consequently, the timeliness standards under Rule 2-534 and 2-535(a) are inapplicable to appellee\u2019s motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Because those rules do not apply, \u201cthe only time limitation arises out of those equitable considerations that a[ ] judge may weigh in his discretion,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Southern Md. Health Sys. Agency, </em>805 F.2d 1165, 1167 (4th Cir.l986)(quoted in <em>Litty, </em>104 Md.App. at 376, 656 A.2d 365), and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to appellee just over one month after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Before closing, we note that appellee did not file a brief in this case but suggested by correspondence that the issue before us is controlled by our decision in <em>Monarc Construction, Inc. v. Arts Corporation, </em>188 Md.App. 377, 981 A.2d 822 (2009). In <em>Monarc, </em>the plaintiff in a breach of contract action was the prevailing party. After a judgment on the merits, the plaintiff sought attorney\u2019s fees based on a provision in the contract. Because attorney\u2019s fees awardable pursuant to contract are a part of the contract claim, based on the doctrine of merger, we held that the plaintiff could not recover fees because the contract merged into the final judgment and ceased to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In the case before us, appellant did not prevail, and the contract remained in existence. Appellee made no claim for a breach of contract or damages and was not required to make such a claim. In these circumstances, appellee\u2019s request for fees is similar to a request for fees that is statute or Rule based and, therefore, is a collateral matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
