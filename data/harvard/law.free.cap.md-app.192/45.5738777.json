A jury convicted him of driving a motor vehicle with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>a revoked license, driving without a license, and speeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because appellant was a subsequent offender, the court imposed a sentence of three years\u2019 incarceration for driving on a revoked license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By Order dated August 19, 2009, the circuit court granted appellant\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, reducing that sentence to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">On appeal, appellant presents a quartet of questions, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">1. Did the trial court properly find that appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel when the court failed to advise appellant of the maximum penalties, including subsequent offender penalties, of the crimes for which he was charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">2. Did the trial court illegally sentence the appellant to three years incarceration for driving with a revoked license when the maximum penalty under the statute is two years incarceration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">3. Did the trial court erroneously admit evidence of the speed registered on a laser detector when the State failed to prove that the laser was properly tested and in good working order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">4. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction for speeding?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Trooper Scott Laird was the State\u2019s sole witness. He was on duty in Talbot County on June 6, 2006, monitoring the speed of motor vehicles on westbound Route 50. He testified that at approximately 11:45 a.m., he observed a blue 2002 Ford sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d) that seemed to be traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>faster than the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Accordingly, Trooper Laird activated his laser, a ProLaser III; it indicated a speed of 73 miles per hour for the SUV. The trooper then \u201cstood out in the roadway and signaled for that vehicle to pull over.\u201d Appellant, the driver, complied with the directive and \u201cidentified himself as Deon Arnell Turner----\u201d At trial, Trooper Laird identified appellant as the person he pulled over for speeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Thereafter, the trooper ran a check of appellant\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) records, and learned that appellant\u2019s license was \u201csuspended and revoked.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 1, a copy of appellant\u2019s driving record, showed that appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been revoked on June 4, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His license was also revoked on February 2, 2005, and it was still in revoked status on June 6, 2006. Trooper Laird confirmed that State\u2019s Exhibit 1 corresponded to \u201cwhat dispatch informed [him] about the revocation status of Mr. Turner\u2019s license on June 6, 2006[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On cross-examination, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">[APPELLANT]: ... you said I was driving a ... blue vehicle, right, blue 2000 Ford SUV? [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">[TROOPER LAIRD]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">[APPELLANT]: At this time, Your Honor, I\u2019d like to stop my cross examination and put on my own witness, Terrez Smith on the stand to shoot [sic] his testimony in the matter of the color of the SUV showing that there\u2019s a discrepancy in his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>THE COURT: All right, well, the Court will allow your witness to testify, but we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t do that until the State is finished with this witness----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">After the State rested, appellant called Terrez A. Smith. He stated that he loaned his black Ford Explorer to appellant on June 6, 2006. Appellant showed Smith several photographs of a black SUV. Smith confirmed that it was his vehicle, and that it was the one he loaned to appellant on the date in question. The photographs, Defendant\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 12, were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">After Smith testified, Turner stated that Trooper Laird improperly identified a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">blue vehicle speeding at a high rate of speed, not a black vehicle. And his, and his testimony should be called into question. That\u2019s why I was after the testimony of the witness and I filed ... a motion to the court to dismiss. Because there\u2019s no probable cause for this, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">At the bench, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [T]here are no ownership issues regarding any of the citations Mr. Turner was issued. They all have to do with his license status and his being the operator of a motor vehicle on a day, it doesn\u2019t really matter for purposes of the State\u2019s proof which motor vehicle it was as to how it was titled or to whom it was titled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">THE COURT: ... I understand that, but I ... understand his argument to be that since this vehicle that\u2019s been identified in the photographs is black and the officer testified it was, they\u2019re both 2002 Ford SUV\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">THE COURT: The officer described it as blue and the evidence, at least from this witness would indicate that it was black, so ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, the State accepts Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony that that\u2019s what color his vehicle is and that\u2019s the make and model of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>After further discussion, the court advised the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">THE COURT: ... [W]e arrived at a stipulation ... which is that there\u2019s no issue, everybody agrees, both the prosecution on the one hand and Mr. Turner on the other that the vehicle that\u2019s pictured in those 12 photographs belongs to this gentlemen [sic], Mr. Smith, and that if he were to go out to his car and retrieve a registration and title that it would verify that he is the duly registered owner of the vehicle in the pictures and it\u2019s, it\u2019s a 2002 Ford Explorer and it\u2019s black in color....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Appellant\u2019s uncle, Thomas Frison, was asked \u201cwhat vehicle\u201d appellant \u201cwas in?\u201d He stated: \u201cYou was in I think it\u2019s a 2002 black Ford Explorer.\u201d Frison added that he was \u201c[p]retty much positive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Laird then testified in rebuttal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor asked whether \u201cthe notes that you would have taken about, like the make and model of the vehicle that you testified to earlier, that sort of thing, would that, would I be right in saying that would have been done after you cleared the scene and completed that?\u201d Laird responded, \u2018Yeah, it was done at the barrack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">On cross-examination, Laird confirmed that the tag number for the incident in question was the same as the tag number of Smith\u2019s car, as depicted in the photographs. Laird also stated: \u201cI stopped your vehicle, I shot your vehicle with the laser, I seen your vehicle, I stepped out in the roadway and stopped the vehicle that I shot.\u201d The following dialogue ensued on redirect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Trooper, you write down the notes and then you take the information from your notes for the citations at the barrack, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>[TROOPER LAIRD]: Well, in this case he was placed under arrest. I received the MVA printout of the vehicle information and the driver information and I used that [sic] do my, do my statement of probably [sic] cause, which I did. [PROSECUTOR]: Now, the vehicle information, is that something that was generated by your calling in as your [sic] looking at the vehicle on the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[TROOPER LAIRD]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, so to go back, you make a visual observation that you believe Mr. Turner\u2019s [going] over 55, but then you confirm that by activating your laser, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[TROOPER LAIRD]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you received a 73 in a 55 reading? [TROOPER LAIRD]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: What information did you call into dispatch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">[TROOPER LAIRD]: I called in the vehicle tag number, the Maryland tag number and also his driver\u2019s license information that was given to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">When asked to explain the discrepancy as to the color of the SUV, Laird stated: \u201cI never took notes at the scene, went back to the barrack and I typed up my statement of probable cause. Very, very possible I could have made a mistake [as to the color of the SUV].\u201d But, Laird indicated that he gave the correct information to dispatch as to \u201cthe make, the model, the tag number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Appellant then testified.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He recalled that while he was driving, Laird \u201cjumped out of the middle of the road and pulled me over ...\u201d Appellant also stated \u201cyou know, when somebody, when a person jump out in the middle of the road, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>you ain\u2019t going to hit them.... [Y]ou just gonna stop.\u201d Appellant\u2019s testimony did not include any reference to the color of the vehicle he was driving on June 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant moved \u201cfor dismissal.\u201d He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">Yeah, for, basically lack of probable cause. The identified vehicle that the trooper was not the right vehicle [sic]. He did not identify the proper vehicle. Without probable cause there is no driving on suspended, no driving on revoked, nor exceeding the speed limit. Exceeding the speed limit is what the initial probable cause and the color of the vehicle was the, really the basis the foundation of that. Without that and without the credibility of the officer being called into question by three witnesses, who was duly sworn, that I think the, I think the Court should deem it necessary to dismiss the charges for lack of probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion and the following argument ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[APPELLANT]: Your Honor, if you would look, Your Honor before you make that denial, if you will look, the color the first establishment of that was the blue SUV. If it, if it\u2019s established that I was driving a black SUV and [the] officer acknowledges it was a blue SUV speeding, not the vehicle that I was driving. That was not the vehicle I was driving.... [T]he trooper committed perjury____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">THE COURT: Well, Mr. Turner, I understand your argument, but he has testified that he, he, although he may well have been mistaken about the color of the vehicle, whether it was blue or black, he\u2019s, he\u2019s confident and not mistaken, so he says, about whether you were the man that was driving the vehicle. He\u2019s identified the vehicle by tag number. The tag number matches up with the vehicle that everybody seem [sic] to agree you were driving. So in the Court\u2019s view, that doesn\u2019t amount to a lack of probable cause to stop you in the first place and your motion will be denied----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Appellant first contends that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel. Noting that he had been convicted of driving on a suspended or revoked license in 2005, appellant complains that, prior to his decision to proceed without counsel, the district court and the circuit court \u201cnever advised [him] about potential subsequent offender penalties,\u201d as required by Maryland Rule 4-215. Before setting forth the parties\u2019 contentions in detail, we pause to review additional facts pertinent to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Appellant appeared in the District Court for Talbot County after his arrest on June 6, 2006. On August 14, 2006, appellant again appeared in that court. The court postponed the matter so that appellant could obtain an attorney. Stephanie A. Shipley, Esquire, entered her appearance on September 27,</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">2006. On January 17, 2007, appellant requested a trial by jury, and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Talbot County. In addition, appellant indicated that he wanted to represent himself, with Ms. Shipley acting as his \u201cco-counsel.\u201d The court informed the appellant that this matter would be addressed by the circuit court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">At a pretrial hearing on April 13, 2007, Ms. Shipley moved to strike her appearance, explaining that she \u201chad no way of contacting or communicating with the defendant\u201d and that appellant \u201cfailed to attend the last two scheduled office conferences.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant consented to Ms. Shipley\u2019s motion. The following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>THE COURT: All right, Mr. Turner, you then stand here without counsel this morning. You are advised by the Court that you should seek to have counsel represent you in these three matters. These are serious matters. If you cannot afford to hire a private attorney, you should contact the Public Defender\u2019s Office and I\u2019m going to give you a form right now that gives you the address of the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Either way you should have someone enter his or her appearance in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">[APPELLANT]: I will be entering mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">THE COURT: Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">[APPELLANT]: I will be entering mine, appropriate persona [sic]. I\u2019ll be entering my appearance appropriate persona in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">THE COURT: Wait, wait a minute. I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re staying [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">MS. SHIPLEY: He wants to represent himself. [APPELLANT]: In my private person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">THE COURT: ... [Y]ou want to represent yourself. Well, I\u2019m telling you, sir, that unless you have legal training, representing yourself may not be a good idea. I would suggest to you that you contact an attorney and I\u2019m also suggesting to you that you contact the Public Defender\u2019s Offices [sic], because you\u2019re going to enter a not guilty plea and this case, these three cases are going to be set for jury trials. And that means that you need a lawyer to help you represent yourself in these cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">[APPELLANT]: No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">THE COURT: Well, you may not think so, but I\u2019m telling you, sir, that you do. A lawyer can be of assistance to you in every stage of this proceeding. You\u2019ve never tried a jury trial. You have no legal training, unless you tell me you do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>A jury trial means that we bring a number of people in this courtroom. A jury will be picked by you and your counsel and the State to sit in that jury box over there. That is not something that I think you\u2019ve ever done before and you need the assistance of a lawyer to help you do that. A jury trial also means that you have to prepare for it. You have to know what you[r] defenses are. You have to research the law. There may be some motions that should be made. A lawyer can help you do all that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">I\u2019m telling you to get a lawyer to represent you. To enter his or her appearance within 15 days of today\u2019s date. We\u2019re going to have you back in here for another pretrial ... two weeks from today, the 27th____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The court and appellant signed an \u201cAdvice to Defendant\u201d form, stating that appellant received a copy of the charging documents and was advised of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On April 24, 2007, the State mailed to appellant a \u201cNotice of Intent to Seek Enhanced Penalty,\u201d as required by Maryland Rule 4-245.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Notice, which was silent regarding the particular enhanced penalties that appellant faced, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">The State of Maryland, by Ellen Barry Grunden, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Talbot County, pursuant to the Transportation Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, \u00a7 27-101(h)[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] and Maryland Rule 4-245, serves notice upon the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Defendant of its intent to seek increased punishment as authorized by law, and states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">1. The State alleges that the Defendant has previously been convicted of an offense which qualifies as a predicate offense for enhanced penalty purposes. The following information is provided to substantiate the prior conviction(s): Offense: Driving after License Suspended/Revoked</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Dates of Conviction: August 10, 2005 July 27, 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">2. In the event that the Defendant is convicted of an offense for which the law provides an additional penalty for a second or subsequent offender, the Court will provide said Defendant with an opportunity to be heard and make a determination as to whether the Defendant is a second or subsequent offender as alleged in this notice before imposing a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">On April 27, 2007, appellant appeared for a pretrial hearing, without counsel, and again indicated that he wanted to represent himself. The court asked appellant to state \u201cgenerally what [the] charges are in these three cases,\u201d to which appellant responded, \u201ctwo counts of second degree assault and ... driving on a suspended <em>license.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After appellant was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>vised to obtain counsel, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">THE COURT: Do you know what the penalties are for these charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">THE COURT: Okay. You mind telling me what you think they are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">[APPELLANT]: What is it, what ten years? What is it, what is it since this is a jury trial, what is it what, you know what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">THE COURT: The penalties are the same whether it\u2019s a jury trial or not. If you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">[APPELLANT]: Well, it should be what ten years and then the ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">THE COURT: If you have for each ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">[APPELLANT]: This, I think it\u2019s five. I\u2019m not for sure. I don\u2019t have the paper in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">I mean, I\u2019m, I\u2019m very familiar with my cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ve got to go over it on the record anyway. Let me, let\u2019s deal with 8720 here.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] Okay, are they traffic citations, [Mr. State\u2019s Attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">[THE STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, I, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have the files. I\u2019ll be happy to look at the Court\u2019s file and make a determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">THE COURT: Okay, no I, well, I\u2019ve got them. It\u2019s just going to take me a minute of time to sit down and read through every one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-17\">[THE STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Once again, these are Ms. Grunden\u2019s cases.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>THE COURT: ... Okay, citation, I guess it\u2019s count number one, charge is 16-803, driving without a license on January 17th, '07. That case came up here pretty fast. 16-303(c), is that a year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">[THE STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That is a year, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">THE COURT: Okay so you\u2019re facing a year on that one and/or a fine of a thousand dollars, I think. Okay, here\u2019s another charge, this is driving on a revoked license, 16-303(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">[THE STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That is also a year, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">THE COURT: Yeah. Okay, so that\u2019s a year on that one, possibly. Then there\u2019s driving without a license, which I think is a fined offense only. Same, same date for that. Maximum f\u00edne I think is $500 here. Okay, then there\u2019s a charge of speeding, which is usually not a jailable offense. Charge is 73 in a 55 mile an hour zone. So conceivably you get points on your license and a maximum fine of $500 on that charge. Okay, I think that\u2019s the, that\u2019s the charges in 8720....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">As the above exchange demonstrates, the court did not advise appellant of the enhanced penalties that he faced as a subsequent offender with respect to the underlying charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Michael F. O\u2019Connor, Esquire, entered his appearance for appellant on or about November 26, 2007. Soon after, on December 4, 2007, he filed a Request for Order to Strike Appearance. O\u2019Connor averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">1. The Defendant refused to sign the application for the services of the Office of the Public Defender. Requesting only that the assigned attorney act as his \u201cco-counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">2. The Office of the Public Defender does not have the authority to represent an individual who declines to sign the application nor to act in the capacity as co counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">The court granted O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion to withdraw on December 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>As noted, appellant appeared at trial without counsel. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">THE COURT: ... I understand you\u2019ve been advised of your right to have an attorney in this case. Is that correct? [APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">THE COURT: And Mr. Turner, I understand that you have elected not to have an attorney, is that correct? [APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">THE COURT: And you understand that an attorney could be of help to you in this case, but I gather that it\u2019s your feeling that you would, despite the help you might be able to get from an attorney, you think you\u2019d be better off representing yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict on January 28, 2008, the court immediately proceeded to sentencing. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">THE COURT: ... All right, Mr. Turner I take it that you did receive a copy of this notice of intent to seek enhanced penalty in this particular case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes. But I was wondering do I have to put an objection to it orally or written?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">THE COURT: Well I guess the first thing that I need to know is whether you agree or disagree with what the [MVA] record shows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">The record indicates that there are two prior convictions for driving on a suspended or revoked license. One on August 10, 2005 and another on July 27th, 2005. So the first thing I need to know is whether you agree or disagree ... that that\u2019s your prior record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">[APPELLANT]: I ... don\u2019t have no (inaudible) record to let you know when the convictions was handed down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">THE COURT: Well aside and apart from when they were handed down do you agree that there are two prior convictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>[APPELLANT]: I believe there is one to my recollection. One that I received a year for when I was already serving a year....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">THE COURT: Well Madam State\u2019s Attorney let me ask you this. Under the enhanced penalty provision is one prior conviction the same maximum significance or do we need to be convinced that there are two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: One prior would raise the maximum to two years. Two or more priors would raise it to three years.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The prosecutor then referred the court to State\u2019s Exhibit 1, appellant\u2019s MVA record. Thereafter, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">[The MVA record] appears to show a conviction on July 27 of 2005 ... driving after license refused, cancelled, suspended or revoked for which there was a 12 point assessment. And then on August 10, ... looks like a second conviction for driving after license refused, cancelled, suspended or revoked for which you got another 12 points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The trial court then imposed sentence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">On the conviction of the most serious offense for driving while revoked, because you have two prior convictions for the same offense and because you have a long traffic record of other unrelated offenses, because the State has in my view properly filed the motion for or notice of intent to seek an enhanced penalty, I believe that as the record stands you are eligible for a three year offense, a three year sentence and that\u2019s what the Court is going to impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">On February 4, 2008, appellant, still self-represented, filed a \u201cMotion To Amend Judgment,\u201d pursuant to Rule 2-584. He complained, in part: \u201cThat one of my conviction [sic] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>without counsel, therefore it may not be used against me.... Use of prior conviction without counsel against person to enhance punishment is forbidden.\u201d He noted his appeal on February 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">On July 31, 2009, appellant, through counsel, filed in the circuit court a motion to correct illegal sentence, claiming that his three-year sentence was illegal \u201c[b]ecause the maximum penalty for a subsequent violation of \u00a7 16-303(d) is only two years incarceration.\u201d By Order dated August 19, 2009, the circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[U]pon consideration of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, it appearing that the State and Defendant agree that the sentence imposed on Defendant on Monday, January 28, 2008 exceeded the maximum penalty specified for a violation of Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 16-303(d), and that the sentence imposed did, in fact exceed the maximum penalty specified in the Code, it is this 19th day of August, 2009 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">ORDERED that the sentence imposed on the Defendant on Monday, January 28, 2008 is vacated pursuant to Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 345(a); and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">ORDERED that a sentence of two years be imposed on Defendant for his violation of Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 16-303(d), this sentence to be effective as of January 28, 2008 and to run from June 12, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">With this background, we turn to review the contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Relying on Md. Rule 4-215, appellant argues: \u201cPrior to waiving counsel, the appellant was never advised by the trial court regarding the potential maximum penalty he faced[.]\u201d Therefore, he contends that he \u201cdid not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel. Reversal is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Referring to the State\u2019s pretrial notice that it was seeking enhanced penalties, appellant contends that the \u201cfact that this Notice references [Transp.] \u00a7 27-101(h) does not show that the appellant had actual knowledge that he was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>two years incarceration\u201d for driving on a revoked license. (Boldface in original). He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">A trial judge does not comply with Rule 4-215 by simply referring a criminal defendant to the applicable statute so that he may look up the penalties for himself. As such, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the statutory provision did not serve to give the appellant actual knowledge of the maximum penalties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Moreover, the statute to which the appellant was referred spans a full nine pages in the \u201cPertinent Provisions\u201d section of Appellee\u2019s Brief. By no means is this a simple statute for a layperson to read. In fact, both the trial judge and the prosecutor misread the statute at sentencing and thought that the appellant was subject to three years incarceration rather than two years____ (Boldface in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The State observes that the circuit court\u2019s \u201cadvisement regarding the sentence was correct for a first offense of driving on a revoked license,\u201d but concedes that this case involves a subsequent offender, for whom transp. \u00a7 27-101(h)(2) authorizes imprisonment \u201cfor not more than 2 years----\u201d It also recognizes that Rule 4-215 refers to an advisement by the court, not the State, and acknowledges that the court\u2019s advisement did not specify the correct penalty that appellant faced. According to the State, however, \u201cthe record shows that Turner had actual notice of a possible subsequent offender penalty.\u201d Therefore, it argues that his waiver of counsel was \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d and \u201cany error in advising [appellant] that he faced a 1-year sentence rather than a 2-year sentence was harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">To establish appellant\u2019s actual knowledge, the State looks to the pretrial notice it sent to appellant, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-245.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It posits: \u201cIn this case, the record shows that Turner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>received the subsequent offender notice before trial, and it was mailed three days before the hearing at which he waived counsel. Because of that actual notice, Turner had his \u2018eyes open.\u2019 <em>See Knox [v. State], </em>404 Md. [76,] 88, 945 A.2d 638 [(2008) (internal quotations and citations omitted)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As the State points out, \u201creview of every opinion of the Court of Appeals citing Rule 4-215 reveals no case in which the Court addressed actual notice provided to the defendant by the prosecutor.\u201d Nevertheless, it argues that \u201cthe harmless-error argument in this appeal is quite different from previous arguments that the Court of Appeals has addressed.\u201d It elaborates: \u201cIn this case ... the State is not asking this Court to speculate as to what notice Turner might have received. Instead, the State is asking this Court to rely on record evidence as to what notice he did receive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Moreover, the State suggests that any error is of no legal consequence, because it is clear that Turner would not have obtained counsel, even if he knew of the actual penalty. It reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">... Turner was informed that he faced sentences of 10 years for assault, or an unlimited sentence for false imprisonment, in the [unrelated] cases that were discussed at that hearing. If Turner did not obtain counsel after being informed that he faced a 10-year sentence, it seems quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>unlikely that he would have obtained counsel if he knew he was facing a 2-year sentence rather than a 1-year sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In suggesting that its subsequent offender notice was sufficient to satisfy Rule 4-215, the State maintains that its position is \u201cconsistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019s focus on the defendant\u2019s knowledge and understanding in analyzing Rule 4-215.\u201d It also claims that its view is \u201cconsistent with analysis in civil cases indicating that actual notice may be sufficient despite a technical defect in the required notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In reply, appellant insists that \u201cthe State is unable to establish that the appellant actually knew the penalties he faced when he waived counsel.\u201d He contends: \u201cWithout actual knowledge, the State\u2019s \u2018harmless error\u2019 argument fails.\u201d Further, Turner asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">Nowhere in this Notice does the State inform the appellant that he is subject to two years incarceration (instead of a maximum of one year incarceration). It is unclear from the record whether the appellant received this notice prior to the April 27, 2007 waiver hearing. Even assuming that the appellant received this notice prior to the April 27, 2007 waiver hearing and even assuming further that, as a result of the notice, the appellant had actual knowledge that he could be subjected to two years incarceration as a subsequent offender, the fact that the trial judge and the prosecutor subsequently advised him on the record that he was only subject to one year in prison ... negated any prior advisement by the prosecutor that he was subject to more than one year as a subsequent offender. (Boldface in original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">With these contentions in mind, we undertake our analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">A defendant\u2019s right to counsel in a criminal case is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> made applicable to the states through the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>teenth Amendment, and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Walker v.

The right to assistance of counsel in criminal proceedings is a fundamental right; therefore, we indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver \u2014 whether such waiver is expressly made by the defendant or implied through his or her refusal or failure to obtain counsel. Maryland Rule 4-215 exists as a safeguard to the constitutional right to counsel, providing a precise \u201cchecklist\u201d that a judge must complete before a defendant\u2019s waiver can be considered valid; as such, it mandates strict compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The Court\u2019s unwillingness to deviate from strict compliance mandates reversal when Rule 4-215 is not satisfied. <em>Brye, </em>410 Md. at 637, 980 A.2d 435; <em>see Webb, </em>144 Md.App. at 741, 800 A.2d 42 (\u201cThe failure of a trial court to conduct a thorough and proper Rule 4-215 inquiry mandates a reversal of the conviction.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Smith v.

Similarly, a violation of Rule 4-215(a)(3) is not harmless error. In <em>Richardson v. State, </em>381 Md. 348, 367, 849 A.2d 487 (2004), the Court said: \u201cNot only is [Rule 4-215] mandatory and subject to strict compliance, its violation cannot be \u2018harmless error.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted); <em>see also Parren, </em>309 Md. at 280-82, 523 A.2d 597; <em>Moten, </em>339 Md. at 411-13, 663 A.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In this case, it is clear that the court did not satisfy Rule 4-215, because it never accurately advised appellant of the penalties he faced. Nevertheless, the State urges that because appellant had actual notice of the penalties, any error was harmless. We reject the State\u2019s suggestion that its pretrial subsequent offender notice, produced pursuant to Rule 4-245, can satisfy the court\u2019s mandatory obligations under Rule 4-215. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the State\u2019s pretrial notice could satisfy Rule 4-215, the record here does not support the State\u2019s contention that appellant had actual notice of the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\"><em>Brye, </em>410 Md. 623, 980 A.2d 435, is useful in providing a framework for our analysis. The State charged Brye, <em>inter alia, </em>with second-degree assault, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. <em>Id. </em>at 627-28, 980 A.2d 435. The two handgun crimes constituted violations of Md.Code (2002, 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 4-204(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 638, 980 A.2d 435. C.L. \u00a7 4-204(b) provides for a maximum possible penalty of twenty years, as well as a mandatory minimum of five years without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Two different judges gave conflicting advisements to Brye regarding the penalties for the handgun charges. At Brye\u2019s arraignment, held over two months before trial, the court overstated the possible penalty for each handgun charge as twenty-five years without parole. <em>Id. </em>at 628, 980 A.2d 435. On the morning of trial, Brye sought to discharge counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 980 A.2d 435. Before accepting Brye\u2019s waiver, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>circuit court incorrectly advised him of the possible penalties for the two handgun charges, underestimating the range of the potential penalty for each charge. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 980 A.2d 435. The trial court then accepted Brye\u2019s waiver of counsel. <em>Id. </em>When Brye requested <em>\u201ca </em>clarification of the charges against him,\u201d the court reiterated, in part, that each handgun offense carried a maximum sentence of five years. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 632, 980 A.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Brye was subsequently convicted of second degree assault, for which he had been correctly advised of the penalties. On the other hand, he was acquitted of the handgun offenses, for which he had been incorrectly advised. Nevertheless, Brye claimed on appeal that his waiver of counsel was invalid because of the incorrect and conflicting advisements he received as to charges for which he was ultimately acquitted. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 980 A.2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Court concluded that the flawed advisements were \u201can insufficient predicate under Maryland Rule 4-215 to sustain the court\u2019s acceptance of Brye\u2019s waiver of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 980 A.2d 435. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 640-41, 980 A.2d 435:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">Sifting through this litany of confusing and conflicting advisements, we have little confidence that Brye had a clear understanding of the nature of the charges, and their allowable penalties, when he waived his right to counsel. At his first appearance in the Circuit Court, over two months before trial, Brye was advised that he faced twenty years for one of the handgun violations, and twenty-five years for the other. At his next appearance, he was advised that he faced up to twenty-five years \u201cin this case.\u201d Finally, immediately before his trial commenced, Brye was advised by the trial judge that the maximum sentence he faced for a handgun violation was five years. While a layperson may be expected to comprehend accurate advisements given cumulatively at separate appearances, we draw the line at expecting a layperson to be able to discern which is the correct advisement from a series of conflicting and often incorrect advisements from different judges. On this record, Brye is not deemed by us as having \u201ceffectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>waive[d] counsel\u201d because these advisements did not give him a valid and clear basis from which \" \u2018apprehension ... of the range of allowable penalties\u2019 \u201d may be inferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\"><em>Knox v. State, </em>404 Md. 76, 945 A.2d 638 (2008), also provides guidance, because the Court expressly considered the relationship between Rule 4-215 (\u201cWaiver of counsel\u201d) and Rule 4-245 (\u201cSubsequent offenders\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute controlled dangerous substances and possession of controlled dangerous substances. The State served Knox with a \u201c \u2018Revised Notice of Intent to Seek Enhanced Punishment for Subsequent Offender,\u2019 \u201d notifying him that it was seeking enhanced punishment, \u201c \u2018as authorized by law,\u2019 \u201d and listing his prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 945 A.2d 638 (quoting the State). However, as in this case, the notice did not specify the particular enhanced penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">At his initial appearance, the court sought to advise Knox of his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 945 A.2d 638. After Knox\u2019s first attorney withdrew from the case, Knox appeared for trial without counsel.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 945 A.2d 638. Regarding the \u201c \u2018allowable penalties\u2019 advice required by Rule 4-215,\u201d the trial court stated that the charge of possession with intent to distribute \u201c \u2018carries a maximum penalty of incarceration of up to 20 years, a fine of up to $25,000 or both,\u201d\u2019 and that possession of controlled dangerous substance, not marijuana, \u201c \u2018carries a maximum penalty of incarceration of up to four years, a fine of up to $25,000 or both,\u2019 \u201d while possession of marijuana \u201c \u2018carries a maximum penalty of incarceration of up to one year, a fine of up to a thousand dollars, or both.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 945 A.2d 638 (quoting the trial court). However, because Knox was a subsequent offender, he was actually subject to a ten year mandatory minimum period of incarceration, with parole limitations. Yet, the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>advise him of the additional penalties to which he was exposed as a result of his subsequent offender status. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 945 A.2d 638. After determining that Knox waived his right to counsel, the trial court convicted him of the charges and sentenced him to twenty years incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 945 A.2d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">On appeal, Knox argued that he did not validly waive his right to counsel because the trial court failed to advise him of the mandatory penalties he faced as a subsequent offender, as required by Rule 4-215. The Court of Appeals held, <em>id. </em>at 88, 945 A.2d 638: \u201c \u2018[A]llowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any,\u2019 as stated in Rule 4-215, includes notice of subsequent offender penalties.\u201d The Court reasoned: \u201cAbsent information as to mandatory or enhanced penalties, it could hardly be said that a defendant makes a knowing and voluntary decision to waive counsel with eyes open or with full knowledge of the ramification of the choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Broadwater, </em>401 Md. at 181, 931 A.2d 1098).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">To satisfy Rule 4-215, said the Court, a trial court must \u201cadvise the defendant that <em>if </em>the defendant is a subsequent offender, that there may be enhanced penalties, and [must] recite the possible enhanced penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 945 A.2d 638 (emphasis in original). Concluding that a defendant cannot effectively waive counsel without an \u201c \u2018apprehension ... of the range of allowable penalties,\u2019 \u201d <em>Knox, </em>404 Md. at 91, 945 A.2d 638 (citation omitted), the Court said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">A defendant cannot have full understanding of the consequences of the waiver of counsel if the defendant is unaware of the more severe potential penalties because of prior convictions. A chilling effect, if any, is <em>de minimis </em>compared to the surprise at the end of the day when a defendant learns of the mandatory penalty, after trial and just before sentencing. Moreover, the fact that a defendant has prior convictions should not surprise the defendant and advice of enhanced penalties as a result of prior convictions could hardly chill an election to waive counsel and proceed <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>A valid waiver of counsel presumes that defendant makes the decision \u201cwith eyes wide open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">Of import here, the Court also said, <em>id. </em>at 88-89, 945 A.2d 638 (emphasis added):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\"><em>The purpose of Rule 4-245 is closely related to the purpose of Rule 4-215, but it does not substitute for Rule 4-215\u2019s requirement to inform a defendant of the penalties. </em>We have stated that the purpose of Rule 4-245 is \u201cto permit a realistic assessment of the consequences of defending the current offense at trial or pleading guilty.\u201d <em>King v. State, </em>300 Md. 218, 229, 477 A.2d 768 (1984). Although Rule 4-245 is aimed at fully informing a defendant of the risks inherent at trial, it is not targeted towards the specific goal of insuring that a defendant understands the risks inherent in proceeding without counsel. Rule 4-245 only requires that the State\u2019s Attorney \u201cserve a notice of the alleged prior conviction\u201d on the defendant. <em>In contrast, Rule 4-215 requires that the admonishments be given by a judge, even </em>if they were given previously by the District Court Commissioner. <em>Rule 4-245 cannot be a substitute for Rule 4-215 because it does not provide for advice from a judge or advice of the actual severity of the penalties a defendant may face as a result of a prior conviction....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The cases discussed above lead us to conclude that there is no merit to any claim of harmless error based on the State\u2019s subsequent offender notice issued to appellant under Rule 4-245. Based on <em>Knox, </em>such notice is not a substitute for a proper advisement by the court under Rule 4-215, nor can it cure an erroneous advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that a notice under Rule 4-245 could satisfy the advisement as to penalties required under Rule 4-215, the notice would have to set forth the potential penalties with precision, instead of merely reciting the statute. The State\u2019s notice here was wide of that mark. Moreover, there is no basis in the record to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>State\u2019s factual claim that appellant had \u201cactual notice\u201d of the potential penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Of appellant\u2019s many appearances in court, possible penalties were only discussed once prior to sentencing, on April 27, 2007. To be sure, Turner stated that he was \u201cvery familiar with [his] cases\u201d and knew the penalties. But, when asked to specify the penalties, he did not correctly articulate them. Thereafter, the court proceeded to misinform Turner as to the potential sentences he faced, incorrectly advising him that he faced one year on the charges of driving with a suspended license and driving with a revoked license, as well as ten years for an unrelated charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">That appellant previously had a lawyer does not alter our view. Prior representation does not give rise to a presumption that counsel informed Turner of the allowable penalties. In <em>Moten, supra, </em>339 Md. at 412, 663 A.2d 593, the Court said: \u201cAlthough it is perhaps true that attorneys routinely inform their clients of the charges and penalties they face, we cannot fairly assume that this happens in all cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Nor are we persuaded that appellant validly waived counsel because, as to the charge of assault in an unrelated matter, he was advised that he faced ten years of incarceration, yet he still waived counsel. As we have seen, in <em>Brye </em>the appellant\u2019s conviction was reversed because of inaccurate and conflicting advisements about the potential penalties for charges for which he was ultimately <em>acquitted. </em>If confusing advisements on corollary charges in the same case are sufficient to establish an ineffective waiver of counsel, then appellant\u2019s decision to waive his right to counsel in another case, where he faced a longer potential prison sentence, is not a sufficient basis to find waiver in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">For these reasons, we shall reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In light of our disposition, we need not address appellant\u2019s contentions as to an error in sentencing or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>respect to the admission of certain evidence. We shall, however, address his sufficiency claim, because \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed by an appellate court on the sole ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a retrial on the same charge.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 39, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988) (citation omitted). In other words, the \u201cDouble Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978); <em>see Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 324-25, 765 A.2d 97 (2001) (concluding that, if evidence was legally insufficient, double jeopardy bars a retrial); <em>Markham v.

In particular, he maintains that Laird\u2019s testimony was not credible because he claimed appellant was driving a blue SUV when, in fact, appellant proved that he was driving a black SUV. Appellant states: \u201c[IJnasmuch as the trooper, who was the sole witness for the State, could not be sure of the color of the car he targeted with his laser, his testimony must be discredited.\u201d Asserting that \u201c[t]he evidence suggests that the Trooper may not have stopped the correct car for speeding,\u201d appellant asks us to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The standard of review for the sufficiency of evidence is well settled. We must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original); <em>see Rivers v. State, </em>393 Md. 569, 580, 903 A.2d 908 (2006); <em>Moye v.

Jolley, </em>153 Md. 343, 351, 138 A. 244 (1927)). As the State points out, <em>Kucharczyk </em>has been narrowly interpreted. <em>See Bailey v.

The teen, \u201cwho was the only person that testified as to any overt act on the part of the appellant,\u201d provided conflicting and inconsistent testimony in response to questions concerning the defendant\u2019s culpability. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 201 A.2d 683. The Court reversed Kucharczyk\u2019s conviction, holding \u201cthat there was a lack of credible evidence either to show directly, or to support a reasonable inference of, guilt on the part of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, and that therefore the lower court was clearly in error in finding the evidence sufficient to convict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained, <em>id.: </em>\u201cOur conclusion flows from the fact that the testimony of the prosecuting witness ... was so contradictory that it lacked probative force and was thus insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts required to be proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Writing for the Court in <em>Bailey, </em>16 Md.App. 83, 294 A.2d 123, Judge Moylan addressed the contours of <em>Kucharczyk. </em>He stated, <em>id. </em>at 96, 294 A.2d 123 (internal quotations and citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where the testimony of a witness is equivocal, doubtful and enigmatical as to surrounding detail....

Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a State\u2019s witness is contradicted by other State\u2019s witnesses. Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a State\u2019s witness is contradicted by defense witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Similarly, in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 556-58, 276 A.2d 214 (1971), the Court of Appeals held that a witness\u2019s testimony, which wholly contradicted the statement the witness gave to the police, was not barred by <em>Kucharczyk. </em>The Court explained: \u201cThe jury was well aware of the prior inconsistent statement of the witness ... and was faced with judging her credibility in the light of such inconsistency. That, of course, is a task for the jury rather than the appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>at 558, 276 A.2d 214. Almost thirty years after <em>Wilson, </em>261 Md. 551, 276 A.2d 214, in <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000), the Court of Appeals again rejected the extension of <em>Kucharczyk.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">More recently, in <em>Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 183, 957 A.2d 654 (2008), this Court highlighted that the lone witness in <em>Kucharczyk </em>gave <em>\u201cinternally </em>inconsistent\u201d testimony. (Emphasis in original). The <em>Brown </em>Court said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">The <em>[Bailey] </em>Court noted that, \u201c[djespite the limited utility of the doctrine, the life of <em>Kucharczyk </em>has been amazing for the number of occasions on which and the number of situations in which it has been invoked in vain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 294 A.2d 123. Of import here, in reciting a variety of situations in which citation to <em>Kucharczyk </em>was inapposite, we began with the example that <em>\u201cKucharczyk </em>does not apply simply because a witness\u2019s trial testimony is contradicted by other statements which the witness has given out of court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(eight supporting citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We are satisfied that <em>Kucharczyk\u2019s </em>narrow holding does not extend to the facts of appellant\u2019s case. To be sure, the evidence showed that appellant drove a black 2002 Ford Explorer, which he borrowed from Smith. The make and model of Smith\u2019s vehicle matched the information on Laird\u2019s citation. Laird conceded that he might have been mistaken in recalling that the SUV was blue. He explained that he did not write down the color of the vehicle until he returned to the police barracks. By that point, his memory of the color may have been faulty. But, Laird testified that he did not have to specify the color of the vehicle on the ticket. Notably, he was unequivocal in claiming that Laird operated the SUV that he stopped for speeding, and that he correctly recorded the license plate number of the vehicle on the citation. That number matched the tag on Smith\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Moreover, the jury was aware of the discrepancy in the color of the vehicle. It was for the jury to assess Laird\u2019s credibility in light of the discrepancy. The jury was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to conclude that the issue of the color \u2014 whether black or blue \u2014 was little more than a red herring.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY REVERSED.
