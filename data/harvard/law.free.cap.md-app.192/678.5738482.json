He was convicted by a jury of that offense and received a mandatory five-year sentence. The jury acquitted appellant of first-degree assault and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The main issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether we should reverse this case under the plain error doctrine because the trial judge instructed the jury that a \u201cfirearm\u201d is defined \u201cas a handgun such as a pistol, revolver, or starter pistol.\u201d Walker contends that this instruction was erroneous because a weapon can only be characterized as a \u201cfirearm\u201d if it \u201cexpels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d Walker contends that this instruction prejudiced him in light of the fact that although he admitted to the jury that he possessed a starter pistol, the State\u2019s own evidence demonstrated 1) the starter pistol he possessed could not expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, 2) that his starter pistol was not designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, and 3) the starter pistol he possessed could not be readily converted into a weapon capable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Set forth in part I below is a brief summary of the evidence produced in the trial court that is relevant to the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">On October 1, 2007, appellant and his wife, Donna Walker, lived in Essex, Maryland. Residing with them were three children from Mrs. Walker\u2019s previous relationship with one Nathaniel Gale and two of appellant\u2019s children. On the after<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>noon of October 1, 2007, Mr. Gale came to the Walker home to take his three children to football practice. Mr. Gale and appellant got into an argument that arose because Mr. Gale had heard that appellant had \u201cput his hands on\u201d Gale\u2019s youngest son. According to Gale, appellant was standing nearby while he (Gale) was looking in the direction of his children when he heard a loud gunshot sound. Gale ducked behind a nearby car, and heard appellant say, \u201cSee what you did? You sent me to jail.\u201d Gale then got into his truck and drove off with his children. Appellant did likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">A few hours after Gale heard a gunshot fired, appellant returned to his residence and consented to a search of his home by the police. During the consent search, the police recovered a starter pistol in appellant\u2019s kitchen. Appellant was later to testify that the starter pistol recovered by the police was the one he used when he fired the gun in Nathaniel Gale\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The State called a firearm expert who examined the starter pistol recovered from appellant\u2019s house. He told the jury that the starter pistol had several physical characteristics that did not allow it to fire or to be readily modified to fire a projectile by the action of an explosive. In the expert\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">The chambers on this cylinder is so short that it doesn\u2019t have any room to put a bullet, a bullet and a cartridge in. There are blocks in each one of those chambers that prevent anything longer going into it. Now, on that cylinder, the front of the cylinder is hollowed out. That would prevent someone from modifying that and putting a bulleted cartridge in and getting it to be able to fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">Also there\u2019s a block that\u2019s cast into the barrel that goes from one side to the other and the full length that would prevent the bullet from coming out this barrel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The State\u2019s theory at trial was that Walker had fired a fully operational handgun to scare Mr. Gale. There was ample evidence to support that theory, including the testimony of appellant\u2019s neighbors, Michael Wiatrowski and Steven Wilson. Wilson testified that the starter pistol, which appellant claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>he used, was not the weapon he saw appellant with immediately after he heard the shot. Wilson said that he could tell the weapon was \u201ca handgun,\u201d \u201ccould see the silverness of it,\u201d and could also see the \u201clittle revolver part of it.\u201d Wilson also said that immediately after the shooting he saw a bullet hole in the side panel of a vehicle that was parked in the vicinity of the shooting. Near that car, the police recovered a spent bullet, later determined to be a .22 caliber bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The owner of the vehicle damaged by the bullet testified that he had parked the car a few hours before the shooting, at which time it had no bullet holes in it. When he examined the vehicle shortly after the shooting, he saw the bullet hole that was also observed by Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Michael Wiatrowski saw appellant immediately after the shooting holding what looked like \u201ca small caliber automatic handgun.\u201d Appellant was holding the weapon \u201cin his hand, aiming like, in a 45 degree angle down towards the back of a neighbor\u2019s vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Appellant testified that when Gale came to his house on the morning in question, he and Gale got into an argument. He (appellant) went inside his house and retrieved a starter pistol, then came outside and fired it to frighten Gale. According to appellant, the starter pistol he fired was the same one the police found in his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In argument to the jury, the State\u2019s primary theory was that appellant had used a functional handgun, but as a secondary theory, the prosecutor argued to the jury that even if appellant had used a starter pistol he was still guilty of illegal possession of a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The trial judge instructed the jury that a starter pistol met the definition of a handgun but appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to that instruction. This failure to object is somewhat puzzling in light of the fact that prior to trial, counsel for appellant argued that a <em>motion in limine </em>should be granted to prevent the prosecutor from arguing to the jury that it could convict appellant of unlawfully possessing a regulated firearm even if the jury were to find that the starter pistol was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>weapon \u201cthat expels and is designed to expel or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d The court denied the <em>motion in limine, </em>saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">I think the statute is abundantly clear. They got [sic] a firearm, in quotations, includes a starter gun. Under 5-101(h)(2) it\u2019s abundantly clear. They intended to include starter guns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">As already mentioned, appellant maintains that the trial judge committed plain error when he told the jury, without qualification, that a starter pistol was a firearm. Appellant contends that the court should have told the jury that a starter pistol could only be a \u201cfirearm\u201d if it expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. We agree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The statute under which appellant was convicted was Md. Code (2003 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-133(c)(l), of the Public Safety Article (\u201cPS\u201d), which provides: \u201cA person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person was previously convicted of\u2019 certain drug felonies. Appellant had previously been convicted of a drug felony that disqualified him from possessing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Appellant points out, correctly, that if his testimony was believed he merely possessed a starter pistol; that testimony, coupled with the testimony of the State\u2019s ballistic expert, showed that the starter pistol he possessed was not a weapon that \u201cexpels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">During closing argument the prosecutor argued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">His Honor told you that whether it is a starter pistol, or a handgun, or a revolver, they\u2019re all considered handguns in the State of Maryland. If he simply pointed the starter pistol and shot it, that still counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>You\u2019ve heard the law that a <em>starter pistol is a firearm </em>in this case. Whether you believe the Defendant used a handgun or revolver or a starter pistol when committing this assault on Mr. Gale, he\u2019d be guilty of being in possession of a firearm. By his own admission, he\u2019s guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">He admits being in possession of that starter gun, at the very least, which is a crime because of his prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">But by his own admission, him owning the starter pistol, possessing the starter pistol, ... without any doubt makes him guilty of ... being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The first issue we must address is whether a starter pistol is a \u201cfirearm\u201d even if it is incapable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive or is designed to expel an explosive in that fashion or may readily be converted so that it is capable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">PS section 5-101(p) reads, in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(p) \u201cRegulated firearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">(1) a handgun; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">(2) a firearm that is any of the following specific assault weapons....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The portion of the definition set forth in section 5-101 (p)(2), dealing with certain assault weapons, is here irrelevant. Thus we turn to the definition of \u201chandgun\u201d as defined in subsection (n) of PS, section 5-101, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">(n)(l) \u201cHandgun\u201d means a firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches in length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">(2) \u201cHandgun\u201d includes signal, starter, and blank pistols. Section 5-101(h) defines a firearm as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">(h)(1) \u201cFirearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>(1) a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">(ii) the frame or receiver of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">(2) \u201cFirearm\u201d includes a starter gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In interpreting the definitions of the word \u201chandgun\u201d and \u201cfirearm\u201d it is important to bear in mind that both definitions use the word \u201cincludes.\u201d Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">The definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d in 5-101 is clear and unambiguous on its face. A firearm is \u201ca weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-101(h). Contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion [when ruling on the <em>motion in limine </em>] the General Assembly\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201cincludes a starter gun\u201d does not mean that every gun described as a \u201cstarter gun\u201d is a firearm. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5-101(h)(2). Rather, \u201cwhen the drafters use the term \u2018includes\u2019 it is generally intended to be used as \u2018illustration and not ... limitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 648 [943 A.2d 1260] (2008) (citing Md.Code Ann., Art. 1, \u00a7 30 (1957, 2005 Repl. Vol.)). Thus, the reference to \u201cstarter gun\u201d is merely an illustration of an instrument that will constitute a firearm provided that it meets the definition of a \u201cfirearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument is fully supported by <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 943 A.2d 1260 (2008). In <em>Tribbitt, </em>the Court of Appeals was called upon to interpret Md. Code (2002, 2007 Cum. Supp.), Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), section 3-602, which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">Sexual abuse of a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">(a) Definitions. \u2014 (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">(2) \u201cFamily member\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">(3) \u201cHousehold member\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>(4)(i) \u201cSexual abuse\u201d <em>means </em>an act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">(ii) \u201cSexual abuse\u201d <em>includes:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">1. incest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">2. rape;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">3. sexual offense in any degree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">4. sodomy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">5. unnatural or perverted sexual practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Tribbitt\u2019s interpretation of section 3-602(a)(4) was that the items following the word \u201cincludes\u201d limited the definition of sexual abuse to the five enumerated criminal acts set forth in subsection (a)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 648, 943 A.2d 1260. The <em>Tribbitt </em>Court rejected that argument. It first interpreted the word \u201cmeans\u201d as used in CL, section 3-602(a)(4), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">As in <em>Hackley [v. State, </em>389 Md. 387, 885 A.2d 816 (2005) ], however, the term \u201cmeans\u201d is exhaustive. The words following \u201cmeans\u201d form the broad definition of \u201csexual abuse.\u201d Therefore, \u201csexual abuse\u201d is defined by the Legislature as \u201can act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a minor, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 943 A.2d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">The <em>Tribbitt </em>Court then explained the meaning of the word \u201cincludes\u201d when used in a criminal statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">The list in \u00a7 3-602(a)(4)(ii) merely provides examples of acts that come within that definition. <em>See United States, v. Gertz, </em>249 F.2d 662, 666 (9th Cir.1957) <em>(\u201cThe likelihood that \u2018includes\u2019 is used in this sense in \u00a7 11 is fortified by the fact that in one of the definitions set out in chapter 1 of title 18(\u00a7 9) U.S.C.A., \u2018means\u2019 is used instead of\u2018includes,\u2019 and in another such section (\u00a7 6) both \u2018means\u2019 and \u2018includes\u2019 are used. It would therefore appear that in chapter 1, \u2018means\u2019 is used when the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and \u2018includes\u2019 is used when it is desired to eliminate any doubt as to the inclusion in a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>larger class of the particular class specifically mentioned. \u201d); Fed.

The natural distinction would be that where \u2018means\u2019 is employed, the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and that the verb \u2018includes\u2019 imports a general class, some of whose particular instances are those specified in the definition.\u201d); <em>Guar.

In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d set forth in PS, section 5 \u2014 101(h)(2) the word \u201cincludes\u201d was used to \u201celiminate any doubt as to the inclusion in a larger class of the particular class specifically mentioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 943 A.2d 1260 (quoting <em>United States v. Gertz, </em>249 F.2d 662, 666 (9th Cir.1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">There is no doubt that some starter pistols are readily susceptible to being converted into a weapon that can expel a projectile by the explosion of a projectile. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mullins, </em>446 F.3d 750 (8th Cir.2006). But, as the testimony in this case illustrated, not all starter pistols can be so converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In its brief, the State provides a very weak retort to appellant\u2019s contention that the word \u201cincludes\u201d is merely illustrative of those weapons that meet the definition of a firearm. The State\u2019s entire response is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">[A] starter gun need only satisfy the second, disjunctive clause of the first paragraph. Under that second clause, frame and receiver parts are considered a \u201cfirearm\u201d without limitation that the part expel, be designed to expel, or readily be convertible to expel a projectile. Pub. Safety \u00a7 5 \u2014 101(h)(l)(ii). Because the statute covers the frame of a starter pistol, the State validly pursued this legal theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We agree with the State that to meet the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d a starter gun need only satisfy the \u201csecond, disjunctive clause of the first paragraph\u201d of PS, 5-101(h)(l). We disagree, however, with the second and third sentence of the State\u2019s argument. The second disjunctive clause of the first paragraph of subsection (h) uses the phrase \u201csuch a weapon.\u201d The term \u201csuch a weapon\u201d means, obviously the type of weapon referred to in PS, section 5-101(h)(l)(i), i.e., \u201ca weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d Nothing in the record supports a finding that the starter pistol found by the police in appellant\u2019s kitchen was \u201csuch a weapon\u201d as that described in the first disjunctive clause of the first paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>of PS, section 5-101(h). Nor was there any evidence that the frame of the starter pistol met that definition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The appellant\u2019s argument that no words used in 5 \u2014 101(h)(2) can be construed to support the State\u2019s argument is strongly bolstered by the Legislative history of PS, section 5-101(h), which was discussed in detail in <em>Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 983 A.2d 583 (2009). In <em>Moore, </em>Judge Paul Alpert, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">The Revisor\u2019s Note to P.S. \u00a7 5-101(h) indicates that \u201c[tjhis subsection is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 27 \u00a7 441(i).\u201d Former Section 441(i) provided as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">(i) \u201cFirearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">(1) Any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">(2) The frame or receiver of any such weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Md.

Stewart Allen, Special Agents in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on the progress of the DISARM Program, a program designed to \u201ccombat gun-related violence in Maryland by seeking federal prosecution for felons who are arrested with a gun and who have a substantial record of convictions for violent and/or drug trafficking crimes\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Section 441(i) appears to be based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3), which defines a \u201cfirearm\u201d as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">The term \u201cfirearm\u201d means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (making it unlawful for certain individuals, including those convicted of a crime punishable by incarceration exceeding a year, as well as unlawful users of controlled dangerous substances, from possessing a firearm).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 102-104, 983 A.2d 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The federal cases interpreting the statute from which PS subsections 5-101(h) and (n) were modeled, all support appellant\u2019s argument that a starter pistol may only be considered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>be a \u201cfirearm\u201d if the starter pistol expels, or is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel projectiles. <em>See Mullins, </em>446 F.3d 750; <em>United States v. Burnett, </em>16 F.3d 358 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. 16,179 Molso Italian .22 Caliber Winlee Derringer Convertible Starter Gum, </em>443 F.2d 463 (2d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In <em>Mullins, supra, </em>there was testimony from an expert that the starter gun possessed by the defendant \u201ccould readily be converted to expel a projectile.\u201d 446 F.3d at 755. Here, the expert testimony was the exact opposite. For the aforegoing reasons, we hold that the trial judge erred when he told the jury, without qualification, that a starter pistol was a firearm. He should have told the jurors that if they believed appellant\u2019s testimony that the weapon he displayed was a starter pistol, the defendant should be acquitted of the charge of possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The State argues that even if the trial judge erred in its instruction concerning the definition of a firearm, the error was unpreserved. The State is correct in this regard. Nevertheless, appellant relies on the last sentence of Maryland Rule 4-325(e). Section (e) of Maryland Rule 4-325 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">(e) Objection. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. <em>An appellate court, on its own initiative or on tibe suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The instructional error in this case was indisputably \u201cmaterial to the rights\u201d of appellant. If the jury had been correctly instructed and if the jurors believed appellant\u2019s testimony that he was in possession of the starter pistol found in his house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the jury would have been obliged to acquit him of the firearm charge. This error was important, because it allowed the prosecutor to tell the jury in closing arguments that the law in Maryland was that \u201ca starter pistol is a firearm\u201d and therefore even if appellant\u2019s testimony was believed, he still would be guilty of the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Recently, in <em>Diggs and Ramsey v. State, </em>409 Md. 260, 286, 973 A.2d 796 (2009) the Court of Appeals set forth a brief explanation as to when plain error review should be granted, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">Plain error is \u201cerror which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 211 [582 A.2d 521] (1990), citing <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 202 [411 A.2d 1035] (1980). We have recognized the boundaries of that error to which we apply our review as that which is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 327 [893 A.2d 1018] (2006), quoting <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 236 [623 A.2d 630] (1993) (citations omitted). <em>See also Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 588 [602 A.2d 677] (1992); <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203 [411 A.2d 1035]. We will \u201cintervene in those circumstances only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial.\u201d <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 397 [478 A.2d 1143] (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985). In each case, we will \u201creview the materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203 [411 A.2d 1035].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 286-87, 973 A.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The error here at issue was not \u201cpurely technical\u201d because the instruction made it impossible for the appellant to succeed in his defense as to the one charge of which he was convicted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Nor was the error \u201cthe product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention.\u201d It is very likely that defense counsel made no objection to the instruction because trial counsel felt that it would have been useless to object in light of the fact that the trial judge, when confronted with this exact point, had earlier said: \u201cI think the statute is abundantly clear.... [A] \u2018firearm,\u2019 includes a starter pistol. Under 5-101(h)(2) it\u2019s abundantly clear. They [the Legislature] intended to include starter pistol guns. Motion is denied.\u201d That interpretation of the word \u201cincludes\u201d is in direct contradiction to what the Court of Appeals said in <em>Tribbitt v. State, supra, </em>and in <em>Hockley v. State, </em>389 Md. 387, 885 A.2d 816 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Our discretion to recognize or disregard plain error is plenary. <em>Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 261, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992). To recognize or disregard plain error, one of the factors to be considered is judicial efficiency. If we were to deny plain error review in this case, even though we agreed with appellant\u2019s contention that the court error might well have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, the inevitable result would be a post-conviction action based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction. If such an action were brought, it would likely be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Another factor influencing our decision to recognize plain error is the fact that the trial judge had a chance to consider the same issue presented in this appeal, when he denied appellant\u2019s <em>motion in limine. </em>Therefore, unlike the situation presented in many cases where we are asked to recognize plain error, the point raised is not the product of pure appellate afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Lastly, as to the only charge of which he was found guilty, the instruction given denied appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">For the aforegoing reasons, we grant appellant\u2019s request to recognize the plain error in the court\u2019s instructions. Accordingly, we shall vacate appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm by a disqualified individual and remand this case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a new trial as to that charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In his brief, appellant makes two arguments which we have thus far not discussed. Appellant contends that the trial judge erred when he denied the <em>motion in limine </em>that sought to prohibit the prosecutor from arguing that a starter pistol is a regulated firearm <em>per se </em>under the applicable statute. In light of what we have said in Part II, <em>supra, </em>that issue is moot because it will not recur upon re-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Appellant also argues that, \u201c[ajssuming that the court adopts\u201d the State\u2019s position that a starter pistol is a firearm, regardless (as to) whether it can expel, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive then the statute is \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d We need not decide that issue because we do not adopt the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE CHARGE OF POSSESSION OF A FIREARM BY A DISQUALIFIED PERSON; COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\">. Recently, in <em>Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 101 n. 3, 983 A.2d 583 (2009), we briefly discussed PS section 5-101(h)(l)(ii) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAR\">Although \u201cframe or receiver\u2019\u2019 is not defined in the Maryland statutes, we note that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms regulations with respect to commerce in firearms and ammunition defines \u201cframe or receiver\u201d as \u201c[tjhat part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel.\u201d 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. A new trial is warranted because the State presented sufficient evidence, if credited, to prove appellant guilty as to the possession of a firearm offense. Appellant did not argue to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
