(\u201cCBF\u201d) and the Magothy River Association, Inc. (\u201cMRA\u201d), appellants, opposed two zoning variance applications filed by David and Diana Clickner, appellees, for property located in Anne Arundel County (the \u201cCounty\u201d). The variance applications were initially considered by a County administrative hearing officer (the \u201cAHO\u201d), who granted them. Appellants appealed that decision to the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The Board dismissed appellants\u2019 appeal on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ground that appellants lacked standing to appeal. On July 14, 2008, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Appellants now appeal the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Appellants present the three issues, which we have reworded for purposes of this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">1. Did the Board apply the wrong standard for administrative standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">2. Was the Chesapeake Bay Foundation or the Magothy River Association aggrieved by the decision of the administrative hearing officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">3. Did the Board of Appeals err in denying intervention to an MRA member who resided in close proximity to the subject property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">We will answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question. In light of our disposition of that issue, it is necessary for us to remand this case to the Board so that it can address the second question. The third issue is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Appellees own Big Dobbins Island (\u201cthe Island\u201d), which is located in the Magothy River in Anne Arundel County. The Island is located within the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area and is subject to those provisions of the Anne Arundel County Zoning Ordinance that restrict development activities in the Critical Area. Appellees applied for variances from provisions of the County\u2019s zoning regulations to permit them to construct a driveway, a storm water management structure, septic tanks and a well, all to be located within the Island\u2019s shoreline buffer area<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to build a pier on the Island even though there was no residence on the Island. Following a hearing before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Office of Administrative Hearings, the presiding AHO conditionally granted the variances on December 18, 2006. Appellants appealed that decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Prior to a hearing on the merits, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appellants were not \u201caggrieved,\u201d as that term has been defined in Maryland cases, most prominently, <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289 (1967). Appellees contended that the Anne Arundel Code provided that only persons aggrieved by a decision of an administrative hearing officer had the right to appeal such a decision to the Board. Therefore, reasoned appellees, CBF and MRA lacked standing. The Board held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss that extended over two evenings. At the hearing, appellants advanced two arguments. First, they contended that the \u201caggrievement\u201d standard did not apply to appeals to the Board. Second, they presented evidence and argument to demonstrate that they were, in fact, aggrieved. The following pertinent evidence was adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Appellees presented the testimony of Wayne A. Newton, a professional civil engineer, in support of their motion to dismiss. Newton identified twenty-two properties located within one-half mile of the Island, located those properties on an aerial photograph and prepared a list of those properties. He testified that neither CBF nor MRA owned property located \u25a0within one-half mile of the Island. His testimony was unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Appellants called Mark Mclnnes, a member of both CBF and MRA, who testified that he owned property located approximately 50 feet from the mainland portion of appellees\u2019 property. Mr. Mclnnes stated that the grant of the variances would aggrieve him because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">[He and his wife] bought this custom home and paid a lot of money for it because of its view, looking out on Dobbins Island.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>[He] believe[s] that with [the] pier and [the] pontoon boat and all the other things that [appellees are] proposing doing there, [his] house could drop $200,000 in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">[He and his kids] fish in the pond there where [appellees] want[ ] to put a pier.... [T]he wildlife is there that [he and his family] bought [their] house to enjoy. [They\u2019re] concerned about what [appellees are] going to do with the septic system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Board sustained appellees\u2019 objection to further testimony regarding how Mr. Mclnnes would be personally aggrieved since he was not a party to the AHO proceeding or the appeal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">MRA also presented the testimony of David Radford, another member of both MRA and CBF. Mr. Radford stated that he owned property located about 10 feet from the mainland portion of appellees\u2019 property, within sight of the Island. Although Mr. Radford was a party to the AHO proceeding, he was not allowed to testify as to his special harm because he did not appeal the AHO\u2019s decision, and was thus not a party to the proceeding in front of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The dive coordinator of MRA\u2019s diving team, Richard Carey, testified that, since 2000, MRA\u2019s diving teams have planted oysters purchased by the MRA on eight oyster reefs located in the Magothy River. Carey testified that, during the summer, MRA\u2019s divers are on the river \u201cat least two to three times a week.\u201d An aerial photograph was introduced, identifying specific reefs and their locations. Carey testified that significant erosion and runoff into the river would damage the oysters on the reefs. He stated that MRA has a license from the State to sample the oyster reefs, which are otherwise closed to the harvest of oysters. On cross-examination, he admitted that MRA did not own the oyster reefs. In response to a question from a Board member, Carey stated that MRA\u2019s oyster projects, if conducted by a commercial enterprise, would cost over one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Paul Spedero, the president of MRA, testified that MRA, working in conjunction with, among other organizations, Ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ryland Department of Natural Resources, is a party to a five-year plan to restore oysters in the Magothy River. As part of this effort, the MRA negotiated an agreement with watermen to close the Magothy River to oyster harvesting. He testified that the MRA provided technical and volunteer assistance to the DNR and County agencies in order to improve water quality in the Magothy River. He testified that MRA had spent $126,990 and expended 31,212 volunteer hours in improving water quality in the Magothy River between 1992 and the date of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">CBF presented testimony from three staff members and one volunteer to support its allegations of special damage to the corporation and as a representative of its members\u2019 interests. Amelia Koch, director of membership, testified that six CBF members live within one-half mile of the Island. The director of CBF\u2019s oyster restoration program, Stephanie Reynolds, testified that, while CBF does not own or lease any land from the State, it has worked on four reef sites in the River. The director of education operations, Matthew Mullen, testified that CBF takes students and teachers on field trips to the River. Volunteer Karl Treff testified that CBF planted submerged grasses at two sites located approximately three fourths of a mile from the Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">At the beginning of the second day of the hearing, August 1, 2007, Mr. Mclnnes moved to intervene in the appeal. His counsel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">[H]e relied on the Magothy River Association to represent his interest in this appeal and he entered into an agreement for this with Magothy River in the spring. However, if the challenge to the standing of the Magothy River and Chesapeake Bay Foundation is successful, that will leave his interest in the matter unprotected....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Appellees opposed the motion, arguing that it was premature because the Board had not yet determined whether MRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>or CBF had standing. The Board denied Mr. Mclnnes\u2019 motion to intervene without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">At the close of the hearing and after discussion on the record, the Board voted four to three to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing. On November 29, 2007, the Board issued a written Memorandum Opinion setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The following findings and conclusions of the majority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Board are pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">The Anne Arundel County Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) provides that a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by a decision of the Office of Planning and Zoning may appeal to this Board. <em>See, </em>Code, Section 3-l-14(e) and <em>see also </em>Section 18-16-402. The status of aggrievement has been the subject of numerous judicial rulings, which have sought to define the term. <em>See e.g., Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289 (1967). For an appellant to be deemed \u201caggrieved\u201d, the appealed decision must affect the appellant in a personal and special way that is different from that suffered by the public generally. <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 213 A.2d 487 (1965). However, an adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima, facie, </em>to be specially damaged. <em>Bryniarski....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">To challenge the fact of aggrievement of a nearby property owner, the party challenging such fact has the burden to show that the appellant is not specially aggrieved. <em>Id. </em>Here, the Petitioners have convinced us that the Protestants are not prima facie aggrieved or specially aggrieved. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Protestants presented witnesses and evidence to show that they are each specially aggrieved; but we are not persuaded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">$ $ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">The subject property is an island____ We believe ... that owners of parcels within sight, sound or smell of this island would have sufficient standing to maintain an appeal ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">* # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">While acknowledging that they do not own or lease real property within sight or sound of the subject island, both the CBF and the MRA urged the Board to consider them specially aggrieved \u2014 different from the public at large. There is no question that both the CBF and the MRA have been and are engaged in oyster bed and [aquatic] grass planting activities on the Magothy____ We have assumed that the oyster and vegetation planting efforts ... occur within sight, sound[,] taste and smell of Dobbins Island. However, we do not believe that the conduct of these activities result in the Protestants[\u2019] being aggrieved, specially, from the public at large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">Any citizen can access the waters of the Magothy. The waters surrounding this island are State owned and regulated---- So long as an individual obeys all laws and regulations, any individual has as much right to be on the Magothy, and next to this island, as the CBF or the MRA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">The CBF and the MRA provide opportunities to raise and release oysters and grasses into the Magothy River. However, we fail to see how the release of items of personalty into the public waters results in the CBF and MRA being specially aggrieved by development activities on this island. Once a grass or oyster is released into the wild (or at least State owned waters), there cannot be a continuing property interest in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">$ * * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">The Protestants\u2019 argument that they have sufficient standing to maintain an appeal before this Board pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to the principles of <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Association v. Dept. of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 686 A.2d 605 (1996) is off point. The <em>Sugarloaf </em>case provides that the requirements for administrative standing are relatively lenient and not very strict, but only in the absence of a statute or regulation specifying criteria for administrative standing. The Anne Arundel County Code has a clear statute that requires parties to an appeal to be aggrieved. <em>See, </em>Code, Section 3-l-104(c) and <em>see also </em>Section 18-16-402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The Board then dismissed the appeal for lack of standing. Appellants filed a timely petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. At the conclusion of a hearing on July 14, 2008, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s dismissal for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Appellants now appeal the decision of the circuit court affirming the Board\u2019s dismissal. We will discuss additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">When this Court reviews the decision of an administrative agency, such as the Board, we look through the circuit court\u2019s decision and evaluates the decision of the agency. <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007) (citing <em>Mastandrea v. North, </em>361 Md. 107, 133, 760 A.2d 677 (2000)). In doing so, an appellate court \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for the administrative agency\u2019s in matters where purely discretionary decisions are involved, particularly when the matter in dispute involves areas within that agency\u2019s particular realm of expertise, so long as the agency\u2019s determination is based on \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 681, 929 A.2d 899 (citing, among other cases, <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999); and <em>Mayor of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 398, 396 A.2d 1080 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We will uphold the agency\u2019s findings of fact if they are \u201cfairly debatable\u201d upon the evidence before the agency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 682, 929 A.2d 899; <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Cecil County v. Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 216-17, 550 A.2d 664 (1988). However, \u201c \u2018[generally, a decision of an administrative agency, including a local zoning board, is owed no deference when its conclusions are based upon an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Loyola College in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 68, 956 A.2d 166 (2008) (quoting <em>Belvoir Farms Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. North, </em>355 Md. 259, 267-68, 734 A.2d 227 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the specific contentions raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Before this Court, appellants argue that the Board of Appeals applied the incorrect standard for determining standing in an administrative proceeding. They contend that State law is clear that the requirements for standing for participation in administrative proceedings are relaxed and informal. They point to the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 286-87, 686 A.2d 605 (1996), as authority for that proposition. They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">To require a different standard will not only be contrary to law but also discourage citizen involvement in the administrative process. A citizen or organization needs to be able to adequately protect its personal and property rights or those of its members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">^ \u00ed \u00edS \u00edH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">Despite being advised by CBF and MRA of the ruling in <em>Sugarloaf </em>and the lessened standard of standing review in administrative proceedings, the Board ignored the ruling of the Court of Appeals and misapplied the law of standing. The Board held that because the Anne Arundel County Code has a statute that requires parties to an appeal to be aggrieved, <em>Sugarloaf </em>does not apply. The Board\u2019s decision is incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">For their part, appellees do not quarrel with appellants\u2019 position that <em>Sugarloaf </em>accurately summarizes the current Maryland law on administrative standing. However, they correctly point out that the <em>Sugarloaf </em>opinion recognizes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a specific statute or regulation may impose a more restrictive test. <em>See Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 286, 686 A.2d 605. Appellees contend that \u00a7\u00a7 3-l-104(a) and 18-16-402 of the County Code provide that a would-be appellant must be both \u201caggrieved\u201d by the AHO\u2019s decision as well as a party to the proceeding before the AHO. Appellees then analyze the evidence adduced at the Board hearing to support their contention that the Board\u2019s decision that CBF and MRA were not aggrieved by the AHO\u2019s decision to grant the variance was based on substantial evidence. Appellees state that the analysis employed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 144-5, 230 A.2d 289, is controlling and that the Board correctly applied it to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">As the parties note in their briefs, Maryland land use cases draw a distinction between an \u201cinterested party\u201d and an \u201caggrieved party\u201d for purposes of standing in administrative proceedings. The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The requirements for administrative standing under Maryland law are not very strict. Absent a statute or a reasonable regulation specifying criteria for administrative standing, one may become a party to an administrative proceeding rather easily. In holding that a particular individual was properly a party at an administrative hearing, Judge J. Dudley Digges for the Court in <em>Morris v. Howard Res. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>278 Md. 417, 423, 365 A.2d 34 (1976), explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">He was present at the hearing before the Board, testified as a witness and made statements or arguments as to why the amendments to the zoning regulations should not be approved. This is far greater participation than that previously determined sufficient to establish one as a party before an administrative agency. <em>See, e.g., Baxter v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 111, 113, 235 A.2d 536 (1967) <em>(per </em>curiam) (submitting name in writing as a protestant); <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., </em>247 Md. 137, 143, 230 A.2d 289, (1967) (testifying before agency); <em>Her</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>telendy v. Montgomery Cty., </em>245 Md. 554, 567, 226 A.2d 672 (1967) (submitting into evidence letter of protest); <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 184, 213 A.2d 487 (1965) (identifying self on agency record as a party to proceedings); <em>Brashears v. Lindenbaum, </em>189 Md. 619, 628, 56 A.2d 844 (1948) (same). Bearing in mind that the format for proceedings before administrative agencies is intentionally designed to be informal so as to encourage citizen participation, we think that absent a reasonable agency or other regulation providing for a more formal method of becoming a party, anyone clearly identifying himself to the agency for the record as having an interest in the outcome of the matter being considered by that agency, thereby becomes a party to the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">More recently, Judge McAuliffe for the Court in <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l v. Smith, supra, </em>333 Md. at 10, 633 A.2d 855, summarized Maryland law relating to status as a party in administrative proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\"><em>Morris </em>and other cases of this Court indicate that the threshold for establishing oneself as a party before an administrative agency is indeed low. [W]e have said that one\u2019s presence at the hearing and testimony in favor of an asserted position is sufficient____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 286-87, 686 A.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The concept of \u201caggrievement\u201d is considerably less expansive. In order to be \u201caggrieved\u201d by an administrative decision, a person must have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">[a]n interest \u201c\u2018such that he is personally and specifically affected in a way different from ... the public generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 611 n. 9, 612 A.2d 241 (1992) (quoting <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Co., 247 </em>Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289). <em>See DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 185, 213 A.2d 487 (1965) (\u201cthe [administrative] decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a specific interest or property right but his interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>therein must be such that he is personally and specially affected in a way different from ... the public generally\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 288, 686 A.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Bryniarski </em>is the landmark case in Maryland on \u201caggrievement\u201d as a requirement for standing in land use appeals. The <em>Bryniarski </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Generally speaking, the decisions indicate that a person aggrieved by the decision of a board of zoning appeals is one whose personal or property rights are adversely affected by the decision of the board. The decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a specific interest or property right but his interest therein must be such that he is personally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.... The circumstances under which this occurs have been determined by the courts on a case by case basis, and the decision in each case rests upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case under review. Certain principles, however, have evolved. They are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">2. In cases involving appeals under the provisions of a zoning ordinance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">(b) An adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved. The person challenging the fact of aggrievement has the burden of denying such damage in his answer to the petition for appeal and of coming forward with evidence to establish that the petitioner is not, in fact, aggrieved....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">(c) A person whose property is far removed from the subject property ordinarily will not be considered a person aggrieved But he will be considered a person aggrieved if he meets the burden of alleging and proving by competent evidence \u2014 either before the board or in the court on appeal if his standing is challenged \u2014 the fact that his personal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>property rights are specially and adversely affected by the board\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><em>% </em>s\u00a1* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">4. If any appellant is a person aggrieved, the court will entertain the appeal even if other appellants are not persons aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">247 Md. at 144-45, 230 A.2d 289 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">As we have indicated, a majority of the Board applied the \u201caggrievement\u201d standard in deciding that neither CBF nor MRA had standing to appeal the AHO\u2019s decision. This portion of the Board majority\u2019s analysis was based upon two provisions of the Anne Arundel County Code. Section 18-16-402 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">A person aggrieved by a decision of the Administrative Hearing Officer who was a party to the proceedings may appeal to the Board of Appeals within 30 days after the date upon which the memorandum [of the AHO\u2019s decision] was filed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Similarly, County Code \u00a7 3-l-104(a) provides that a \u201cperson aggrieved by a decision of the [AHO] who was a party to the proceedings may appeal the decision to the Board.\u201d For the purpose of our analysis, we will assume, without deciding, that, in order to have standing to appeal the AHO\u2019s decision to the Board, either the MRA or the CBF must have been aggrieved by the AHO\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our review of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>in this case leads us to the conclusion that the Board misinterpreted the \u201caggrievement\u201d test. In its decision, the majority of the Board focused upon the fact that neither CBF nor MRA asserted a property interest in the vicinity of Big Dobbins Island. First, the Board majority correctly noted that, since neither appellant owned real property in close proximity to the Island, neither was <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">[B]y MRA and CBF\u2019s own admission, they neither own nor lease any real property in or near the Magothy River. They do not own or lease any oyster beds or beds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>aquatic grasses. The Protestants are not <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The Board majority proceeded to evaluate the evidence to determine if the appellants were nonetheless aggrieved. The Board noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">There is no question that both the CBF and the MRA have been and are engaged in oyster bed and [aquatic] grass planting activities on the Magothy____ We have assumed that the oyster and vegetation planting efforts ... occur within sight, sound taste and smell of Dobbins Island. However, we do not believe that the conduct of these activities results in the Protestants being aggrieved, specially, from the public at large.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The Board concluded that the appellants were not aggrieved because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">we fail to see how the release of items of personalty into the public waters results in the CBF and MRA being specially aggrieved by development activities on this island. Once a grass or oyster is released into the wild (or at least State owned waters), there cannot be a continuing property interest in it.... [T]hese animals are owned by the citizens of the State of Maryland, once released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">^ \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">The CBF and MRA are noble organizations whose goals include the best interest of the citizenry through their work on environmental health for the Magothy and the Chesapeake. However, any member of the public, with sufficient assets, could do the same. <em>These activities do not represent an ownership interest in property that render the Protestants more aggrieved than the public at large.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">In focusing exclusively upon property rights, the Board erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">In <em>Bryniarski, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">[A] person aggrieved by the decision of a board of zoning appeals is one whose <em>personal or property rights </em>are ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>versely affected by the decision of the board. The decision must not only affect a matter in which the protestant has a <em>specific interest or property right </em>but his interest therein must be such that he is <em>personally and specially affected </em>in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqo\"><em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d 289 (citing <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 185, 213 A.2d 487 (1965)) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to the Board\u2019s analysis, property ownership is not a prerequisite to aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><em>Jordan v. Hebbville, </em>369 Md. 439, 442, 800 A.2d 768 (2002), is instructive in that it is an aggrievement case that did not involve an assertion of property ownership. In that case, the Court of Appeals considered whether a holder of a Baltimore County towing license had standing to appeal the issuance of a towing license to another entity. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">At the administrative level appellees were \u201caggrieved\u201d under the relevant Baltimore County Code section because their businesses are directly affected by the issuance of an additional towing license in the geographical area where they alone hold licenses. A party is aggrieved and there is standing if the party suffers some \u201cspecial damage ... differing in character and kind from that suffered by the general public.\u201d In <em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 295, 686 A.2d 605, this Court discussed aggrievement and emphasized that standing does not depend on the type of issue raised or its likelihood of success and stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cTherefore, standing to challenge governmental action, and the merits of the challenge, are separate and distinct issues.... \u2018The fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a ... court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated\u2019.\u201d [Citations omitted [[by <em>Jordan\\\\.\\</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">369 Md. at 442-43, 800 A.2d 768. (Footnote and some citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Therefore, in order to demonstrate standing to the Board, appellants must demonstrate that they have \u201ca specific interest ...\u201d that will be affected \u201cpersonally and specially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>... in a way different from ... the public generally\u201d by the proposed development. Because the Board majority focused exclusively on the question of property ownership, the Board, analyzing the facts of the case under an incorrect definition of aggrievement, did not make findings sufficient for us to determine whether or not appellants have a personal interest that will be affected personally and specially in a way distinct from the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">There is a great deal of evidence in the record that is not contested. Appellants presented evidence to the Board that they have invested substantial amounts of volunteer time, as well as money, on various submerged aquatic vegetation and oyster reef restoration projects in the Magothy River. The appellants also obtained permits from the State of Maryland in order to further their objectives. CBF has a scientific collection permit from the State of Maryland Department of Natural Resources (\u201cDNR\u201d). That permit allows CBF the right to go back, inspect and retrieve some oysters and reefs in the Magothy River. MRA has a scientific license from the State of Maryland, which permits MRA to take oyster samples, seed the reefs and dive off the reefs in the Magothy River as part of a monitoring program. The testimony from the appellants was that there are few, if any, other such licenses for the River. This evidence was unchallenged by appellees. On remand, the Board must determine whether these investments of time and money and the permits the appellants hold<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the test for aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">As to the second part of the test, i.e. whether appellants\u2019 interests would be affected in a way different than those of the general public, the Board majority concluded that, since the State owns the submerged aquatic vegetation and the oysters planted by appellants, appellants had no ownership interest in them and thus could not be aggrieved. The majority\u2019s logic is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>faulty \u2014 ownership is not required to establish aggrievement. The proper question for the Board is whether the appellants would be affected differently than the general public by the grant of the variances. That the public generally has an interest in minimizing or avoiding sediment or other run-off in the State\u2019s waters is not, by itself, dispositive. <em>See Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 295, 686 A.2d 605 (The concept of standing \u201c \u2018concerns ... the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Assn. <em>of Data Processing Service Org. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970)). We will, therefore, reverse the decision of the Board and remand the matter to it to determine whether either party<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> meets the correct definition of \u201caggrieved.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the parties may present argument and evidence regarding the matters discussed in footnote 4 of this opinion in order to establish an adequate record for an eventual judicial resolution of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Whether the Board erred in refusing to permit Mr. Mclnnes to intervene in the proceedings before it is not before us as he did not appeal the Board\u2019s ruling. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY IS REVERSED AND THIS CASE IS REMANDED TO IT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE SAME TO THE ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY BOARD OF APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
