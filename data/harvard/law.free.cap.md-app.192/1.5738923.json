Did the sentencing court err when it did not merge appellant\u2019s first-degree assault sentences into the corresponding sentences for robbery and attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">With respect to the sentences imposed on appellant for the assault and robbery crimes committed against Tina Bussard and Frank Fultz, we conclude that the circuit court erred by failing to merge the first degree assault convictions into the corresponding armed robbery and attempted armed robbery convictions. We affirm the judgments in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">On January 26, 2006, Officer Wroten was fatally shot at Washington County Hospital in Hagerstown while guarding appellant, an inmate of the Roxbury Correctional Institution (\u201cRCI\u201d). Officer Wroten was shot with the gun that had been issued to him for guard duty at the hospital. Less than an hour after Officer Wroten was shot, appellant was seen throwing that gun aside as law enforcement officers surrounded him in an open field near a trucking terminal. Because appellant has challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>certain of the convictions, we will summarize, in some detail, pertinent facts introduced at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">On the afternoon of January 25, 2006, appellant complained of a wound that he would not allow the prison nurse to examine and was sent to the hospital with two armed escort guards. When an x-ray revealed that a sewing needle lodged under appellant\u2019s skin had punctured his liver, the emergency-room physician removed the needle and admitted appellant to the hospital for observation overnight. Appellant told the physician that he had been injured when someone bumped him that day, but, because it had healed over, the physician did not believe that the wound was new.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Upon learning that appellant would be admitted to the hospital for the night, RCI assigned Correctional Officer Glen Barnes to guard appellant at the hospital. Officer Wroten was assigned to relieve Officer Barnes at 11:00 p.m. Officer Barnes relieved the escort guards at the emergency room and waited with appellant for a private room for approximately three hours. While they waited, appellant, who was on a gurney, complained of nausea and asked to go to the bathroom five or six times. At about 9:30 p.m., the hospital assigned Room 5006 to appellant. Room 5006 had one bed and was located on the fifth floor, one room away from the nurses\u2019 station. An inmate from another correctional institution, who was also being guarded, had been admitted to an isolation room down the hall from Room 5006.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In accordance with RCI procedure, Officer Barnes was armed with one of the two 38-caliber revolvers which RCI stored in a vault at the hospital when not in use. RCI\u2019s protocols required officers to keep their revolvers in their holsters, which were equipped with thumb snaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Officer Barnes spent about two hours with appellant in Room 5006. During that time, appellant was in bed with one leg shackled to the bed. Appellant appeared drowsy but he remained awake and asked Officer Barnes when the shifts changed and who would guard him next. He also asked to go to the bathroom several times. To accommodate those re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>quests, Officer Barnes shackled appellant\u2019s legs together, unshackled appellant\u2019s leg from the bed, and accompanied him to the bathroom. On one occasion, appellant jumped up while Officer Barnes was re-shackling his leg to the bed. Officer Barnes was startled and told appellant to lie down. After initially refusing, appellant complied. When appellant asked to go to the bathroom at 10:30 p.m, Officer Barnes refused the request because the shift was about to change. Officer Wroten arrived at 10:45 p.m., and Officer Barnes told him that appellant felt nauseated and was going to the bathroom often.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">When Denise Hudson, the registered nurse assigned to care for appellant, came in after midnight to administer antibiotics, she saw appellant returning to bed from the bathroom without shackles. She observed Officer Wroten re-shackle appellant\u2019s leg to the bed. At around that time, appellant complained that his bandage had come off, and Kristi Miller, also a registered nurse, came in to change it. At 2 a.m., Dorothy Reed, the nursing assistant assigned to appellant, entered Room 5006 to take appellant\u2019s vital signs. Officer Wroten was sitting in a chair with his gun holstered, and the television was on. Appellant appeared to be asleep, and, when she woke him, he sat up suddenly and startled her. He laid back down when Officer Wroten told him, \u201cIt is okay, Brandon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">At some point, Diane Reid, another nursing assistant, entered the room and reconnected appellant\u2019s IV tube, which had become disconnected from his arm and was leaking. At 2:30 a.m., Hudson returned because appellant\u2019s IV alarm had sounded. His tubing, which was attached by a lever, lock, and screw system, was again dislodged from his arm. She disconnected the machine and left the catheter in. At 3:30 a.m., Hudson noticed that appellant was awake and that the television was on. Also, during the evening, appellant yelled out to Rachael Yeagy, a registered nurse, that his bandage had come off, and she came in to change it. During the night, someone in the room called to Miller to pull the door further shut.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">At around 5 a.m., Yeagy was across the hall in Room 5007 when she heard what sounded like the bed and a chain banging against the wall of Room 5006. At about the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>time, Melissa Sestak, a nursing supervisor, was in the room almost directly below Room 5007. She heard noises from above that sounded like fighting and furniture being moved around and ran upstairs. Meanwhile, Yeagy walked across the hall to listen further, but could not see anything because the door was closed. She heard heavy breathing and pushing and heard the guard say, repeatedly, \u201cThat is enough[.] [S]top that[.] [T]hat is enough.\u201d She called to the nurses\u2019 station that there was a fight and opened the door slowly because the noise was loud and she thought the people in the room were fighting near the door. When she looked into the room, Yeagy saw appellant crouching over Officer Wroten, who was \u201con the ground and [ ] leaning back on his right arm[.] [H]e looked up at [her,] just for a split second, and was back down, looking up to the inmate.\u201d Describing what she had seen, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">The inmate was crouched over top of [Officer Wroten]. [Officer Wroten] kind of had, he had his left arm above head, trying to guard himself.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">[T]he inmate had the gun in his right hand. He had the gun to the left side of his head.....To his temple.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">Q. [PROSECUTOR]: To the guard\u2019s head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">A. Yes, yes, and he had \u2014 he crouched, was crouched down, and he was pushing, kind of had him pushed down with his right hand, was holding him down. He was crouched over top of him, and he \u2014 he did not yell it, but he said it in a very deep, like he was very angry, in a deep voice he stated\u2014 Q. Who is he, ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">A. The inmate stated to the guard. He got down, right in his face, and he said, \u201cI am going to kill you, you motherfucker,\u201d and he shot him immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">Q. Was the guard saying anything before he got shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">A. When he was laying on the ground, the only thing I could hear him saying was, [\u201cP]lease don\u2019t[. P]lease don\u2019t!\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">When Yeagy saw appellant pull the trigger, she screamed that the guard had been shot and told the people who had been running towards her to run away.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Meanwhile, Miller, who was standing in the nurses\u2019 station, looked out when she heard noise from Room 5006. Miller saw Yeagy listening in the hallway, heard Yeagy call for help, and ran to Yeagy. Miller could hear Officer Wroten say something to the effect of \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d or \u201cKnock it off.\u201d Miller could see Officer Wroten\u2019s shoes through the partly-closed door. She could not see as much of the room as Yeagy saw, but she did not question that Yeagy saw what she described. Miller was uncertain of her own location when she heard the gunshot and did not know whether Yeagy had opened the door further after Miller started to run away. Reed believed that Yeagy had opened the door and entered the room far enough that Yeagy could not be seen from the nurses\u2019 station. The officer who was guarding the other prisoner on the floor heard Yeagy scream that Officer Wroten had been shot. After telephoning for help, that officer went to Room 5006 and saw Officer Wroten on the floor, being treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Tina Bussard, visiting her daughter Shelly Bussard, a patient in Room 5007, heard the noises from Room 5006 at the same time Yeagy heard them. When Yeagy left Room 5007 to investigate, Tina looked out into the hall, heard a popping noise, and saw Yeagy run into the hall saying that the guard had been shot. As Tina retreated into Room 5007, appellant entered the room, seized her from behind, waved the gun at her and Shelly, demanded her car keys and her pocketbook, and pulled Tina through the door, into the hall. Tina, still holding her pocketbook, jerked away, losing a clump of hair in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Reed, who had come out into the hall upon hearing a gunshot, saw appellant, with a gun in his hand, holding Tina by the arm. After Tina broke free and ran back into Room 5007, where Shelly had remained, Reed saw appellant run out the double doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Security Officer Hutzell, who was outside on patrol in his car, saw a man in a hospital gown run out of the hospital and towards a taxicab. The taxi driver, Frank Fultz, was waiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>for a fare when a man jumped into his cab with a gun and said, \u201cDrive, motherfucker[. Y]ou belong to me or I\u2019ll shoot ya.\u201d Appellant held the gun to Fultz\u2019s side, ordered him to drive to Pennsylvania, and demanded his money. Fultz handed appellant about fifty one-dollar bills and drove. Hutzell and his colleague followed and directed the police to the cab\u2019s location. When a police car attempted to pass the cab, appellant ordered Fultz to collide with the police car and then tried to grab the steering wheel. The cab hit a wall. Appellant was seen crawling out of the cab, holding a revolver. He fled into a field and eluded the police in the dark.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Appellant later appeared at a trucking terminal, clad only in boxer shorts, holding cash, claiming that he had been robbed, and asking terminal employees to call a taxicab. When police cars arrived, appellant ran. The police surrounded him and told him to drop the gun. He put the gun to his head, walked away, lowered the gun to his side, and kept walking. He then threw the gun to the ground and the cash in the air. The police arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Blood from two individuals was found on the gun. A forensic chemist concluded that the DNA profiles of those samples was thirty-five thousand times more likely to have originated from appellant and Officer Wroten than from other individuals within their respective populations. Other expert testimony connected the gun and appellant to the shooting in Room 5006.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Officer Wroten\u2019s body concluded that Office Wroten had died of a close-range gunshot wound to the head. He had also suffered blunt force injury to the side of his head, caused by one or more blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Appellant was indicted by a Washington County grand jury for thirty-six crimes, including the premeditated murder, felony murder, and robbery of Officer Wroten; escape; the kidnapping, assault, and armed robbery of Tina Bussard; the kidnapping, assault, and armed robbery of Fultz; car theft; numerous handgun offenses; and fleeing the police. The defense requested removal on the grounds of prejudicial pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>trial publicity. After the prosecution served the defense with notice of its intention to seek the death penalty, the circuit court deemed the request for removal to be an exercise of appellant\u2019s automatic right to remove his death-penalty case under the Maryland Declaration of Rights and removed the case to the Circuit Court for Howard County. There, the defense moved to strike the death penalty as illegal. This Court dismissed appellant\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the denial of that motion. In the meantime, the trial scheduled for May 31, 2007, was postponed after appellant attempted to flee the courtroom during <em>voir dire, </em>and the trial judge recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Appellant\u2019s trial was finally set for January 2008. At a motions hearing shortly before trial, defense counsel stated three issues that appellant would contest at trial: first, \u201cWhat exactly happened in [Room 5006] and was it a premeditated murderf;]\u201d second, \u201cDid [appellant] physically by force rob Officer Wroten of his gun prior to the shooting which would make it felony murder[;]\u201d and third, \u201cDid [appellant] seize the gun and shoot Officer Wroten for the purpose of escaping?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The trial court conducted <em>voir dire </em>over three days. The defense indicated that it was satisfied with the jury and alternates.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">After the jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder and multiple other crimes, he elected to be sentenced by the court. The court sentenced him to serve life without parole for the murder of Officer Wroten and numerous other periods of incarceration, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We shall recite additional facts as the need arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Whether the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s request to strike the prosecution\u2019s notice of its intention to seek the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">Appellant contends that the motions court committed reversible error by denying his motion to strike the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tion\u2019s notice of its intent to seek the death penalty. According to appellant, the death penalty is now an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d because the Court of Appeals, in <em>Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 914 A.2d 25 (2006), <em>cert. denied sub nom, Grandison v. Maryland, </em>470 U.S. 1034, 105 S.Ct. 1411, 84 L.Ed.2d 795 (1985), struck down Maryland\u2019s regulations on execution protocols. Relying on cases in which courts have ordered the dismissal of indictments for crimes for which the legislature has provided no penalty, appellant argues that the invalidity of the execution protocols removed the death penalty as a penalty that could be imposed on appellant and precluded capital proceedings in his case. Even though he was not sentenced to death, appellant contends, generally, that he was prejudiced because his trial strategy was affected by the possibility of a death sentence. Additionally, citing studies for the proposition that jurors selected for capital cases \u201care more likely to convict than non-death qualifiers,\u201d appellant argues that he was prejudiced by the selection of a jury which had undergone <em>voir dire </em>for a death-penalty proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The State contends that the issue is moot because appellant was not sentenced to death. The State adds that the appellant waived any argument that the jury was tainted by the <em>voir dire </em>because appellant did not raise that argument at trial. The State alternatively argues that the <em>Evans </em>Court did not declare the death penalty to be an illegal sentence, but, instead, held that the penalty could only be administered under properly-promulgated regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We begin by addressing whether the fact that appellant was not sentenced to death rendered moot his argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion to strike the prosecution\u2019s death-penalty notice. An issue is moot when \u201c[t]here is no longer an existing controversy when the case comes before the Court or when there is no longer an effective remedy the Court could grant.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>409 Md. 648, 674, 976 A.2d 349 (2009) (citations and quotation marks omitted). As a general rule, when an appellant establishes that the trial court committed a legal error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that was both prejudicial and preserved, we have the power to grant a remedy, such as a new trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-604; <em>see also, e.g., Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 714, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979) (remanding case for new trial on lesser and greater counts, although claimed error pertained only to the greater counts, because of possibility of merger). Accordingly, were we to agree with appellant that the prosecution filed an illegal death-penalty notice which prejudiced his defense in the guilt phase of the trial, we could remedy the error in the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to strike that notice. In short, the mootness doctrine would not apply. As we shall explain, however, appellant faces other hurdles.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Appellant challenges the legality of the death penalty \u201cpost-<em>Evans.\u201d </em>In <em>Evans, </em>the appellant requested that the Department of Corrections be enjoined from executing him under its protocols for administering lethal injections. 396 Md. at 271, 914 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1999 Repl.Vol.) Title 3, subtitle 9 of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cCorr.Serv.\u201d) sets forth the procedures for executing a sentence of death. Corr. Serv. \u00a7 3-905(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">The manner of inflicting the punishment of death shall be the continuous intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate or other similar drug in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until a licensed physician pronounces death according to accepted standards of medical practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Corr. Serv. \u00a7 3-906, Administration of Lethal Injection, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">(a) <em>Duties of Commissioner. </em>\u2014 The Commissioner shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">(1) provide a suitable and efficient place, enclosed from public view, in which an execution may be carried out;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">(2) provide all of the materials that are necessary to perform the execution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">(3) subject to subsection (c) of this section, select the individuals to perform the execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(b) <em>Supervision. </em>\u2014 The Commissioner or the Commissioner\u2019s designee shall supervise the execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">(c) <em>Lethal </em>injection.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">(1) An execution shall be performed by individuals who are selected by the Commissioner and trained to administer the lethal injection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">(2) An individual who administers the paralytic agent and lethal injection need not be licensed or certified as any type of health care practitioner under the Health Occupations Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">These provisions were enacted by the General Assembly in 1994. <em>Evans, </em>396 Md. at 337, 914 A.2d 25 (citing 1994 Md. Laws, ch. 5). \u201cAfter enactment of Ch. 5, the [Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) ] adopted an Execution Operations Manual (EOM) to govern virtually all aspects of implementing the death sentence by lethal injection.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Maryland Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.), Title 10, subtitle 1 of the State Government Article (\u201cState Gov\u2019t\u201d), which is part of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), sets forth certain requirements for the adoption of regulations by executive agencies subject to the statute, including the DOC. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 914 A.2d 25 (citing <em>Massey v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>389 Md. 496, 499, 886 A.2d 585 (2005)). The statute provides that a regulation that is subject to the statute can be adopted only if it is in compliance with State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 \u00a7 10-110 and 10-111. <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 914 A.2d 25. The <em>Evans </em>Court held that \u201c[njone of the procedures mandated by those statutes were followed by DOC prior to adopting or, from time to time, amending the EOM.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 914 A.2d 25. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">[W]e hold that those aspects of the EOM that direct the manner of executing the death sentence \u2014 the Lethal Injection Checklist-constitute regulations under SG \u00a7 10-101(g) and, because they were not adopted in conformance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>requirements of the APA, are ineffective and may not be used until such time as they are properly adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 350, 914 A.2d 25.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">The Mandate provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">...

Safety &amp; Correctional Servs. v. Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 890 A.2d 310 (2006). In <em>Demby, </em>the Court of Appeals explained how the <em>ex post facto </em>clause applied to the adoption of administrative regulations adopted by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cDPSCS\u201d). At issue were amendments to the Code of Maryland Regulations, concerning special housing credits. The Court quoted <em>United States v. Ellen, </em>961 F.2d 462, 465 (4th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 875, 113 S.Ct. 217, 121 L.Ed.2d 155 (1992), where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">When Congress has delegated to an agency the authority to make a rule instead of making the rule itself, the result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ing administrative rule is an extension of the statute for purposes of the <em>[ex post facto </em>] clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The <em>Demby </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Our next determination must focus on whether this regulation is legislative or merely interpretive in nature. We find that the amendments in the instant case are not merely guides that may be discarded where circumstances require. The amendments here are substantive, pursuant to properly delegated authority in Md.Code (1999), \u00a7 2109(c) of the Correctional Services Article, and have the force of law as they effectively create a new law governing who shall receive special project credits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">390 Md. at 607-08, 890 A.2d 310.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">Based on <em>Demby, </em>appellant argues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">The regulations adopted by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services that direct the manner of implementing the death penalty would be \u201csubstantive, pursuant to properly delegated authority ... and have the force of law as they effectively create a new law governing how to carry out capital punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">We do not read the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Demby </em>so broadly. Though the regulations created in the EOM by the DOC have been deemed substantive, <em>Evans, </em>396 Md. at 345, 914 A.2d 25, they do not \u201ccreate a new law governing how to carry out capital punishment.\u201d Instead, they provide specific directions to implement the law created by the legislature in some detail. The procedures the DOC established to be followed when carrying out a lethal injection, though subject to the APA, do not rise to the level of \u201cnew laws,\u201d such that a gap in their effectiveness would result in an invalidation of the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Appellant also cites <em>McCurdy v. State, </em>151 Md. 438, 135 A. 161 (1926), where the defendant was convicted of \u201cmanufacturing for sale intoxicating liquors in Washington County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442,135 A. 161. In that case, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cIf an indictment contains allegations which constitute an offense, for which no penalty is provided by the statute or common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>law, the proper method of raising the question relied upon is by demurrer....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, appellant argues, the Court of Appeals \u201crecognized that where a statute has no penalty provision, that statute is subject to challenge, if raised properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We view <em>McCurdy </em>as inapplicable, for, in this case, the statute under which appellant was convicted has a penalty provision. Maryland Code (1957, 2009 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 2-201 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrim.Law\u201d) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">(b) Penalty.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">(1) A person who commits a murder in the first degree is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">guilty of a felony and on conviction shall be sentenced to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">(i) death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">(ii) imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">(iii) imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Furthermore, Corr. Servs. \u00a7 3-905(a) explains, in some detail, the manner of carrying out a sentence of death as approved by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">The mandate in <em>Evans </em>clearly indicates that the Court did not reverse Evan\u2019s death sentence. The Court simply remanded the case to the circuit court to enjoin enforcement of the lethal injection checklist until such time as the contents of the checklist were adopted as regulations in accordance with the APA or until the General Assembly exempts the check list from the APA. It follows, then, that the Court did not view enjoining the current Lethal Injection Checklist as invalidating the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">Appellant argues that, after <em>Evans, </em>\u201cthe Circuit Court would have been unable to render a legal death sentence, had the penalty been imposed. The Circuit Court could not have issued a warrant of execution that commanded the Commissioner of Corrections to perform an unauthorized execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">The State responds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Maryland Legislature provide[s] the statutory authority for the Circuit Court to issue a warrant of execution pursuant to Section 3-902 of the Correctional Services Article. That statute also provides that: \u201cA warrant of execution is stayed during the direct review process and the State postconviction review process.\u201d Consequently, even if the Circuit Court issued an execution warrant had Morris actually received the death penalty, any such warrant would be stayed pending automatic direct appeal to the Court of Appeals, and post conviction proceedings, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We agree with the State that the statutory authority provided to the circuit court to issue a warrant of execution pursuant to Corr. Serv. \u00a7 3-902 was not invalidated by the Court in <em>Evans. </em>Once the procedures outlined in the Lethal Injection Checklist are adopted as regulations under the APA, the warrant of execution could be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Moreover, the Court of Appeals addressed the constitutionality of the death penalty statute after <em>Evans </em>in <em>State v. Borchardt, </em>396 Md. 586, 914 A.2d 1126 (2007). Under the principle of constitutional avoidance, constitutional issues are not reached needlessly. <em>See In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 667-668, 967 A.2d 776 (2009) (\u201c \u2018[T]his Court has regularly adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Had the Court invalidated the death penalty in <em>Evans, </em>it would have had no reason to reach the constitutional issue in <em>Borehardt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In 2009, the General Assembly declined to repeal the death penalty. Instead, it amended Crim. Law \u00a7 2-202(a) and (c) to condition the imposition of the penalty on the admission of specific types of evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>We are persuaded that the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Evans, </em>that the Lethal Injection Checklist was \u201cineffective,\u201d did not act to preclude the State from seeking or the court from imposing the penalty of death. As the death penalty statute was not illegal at the time appellant received notice that the State would seek the death penalty, we hold that the trial court did not err by denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the death penalty notice based on appellant\u2019s assertion that the death penalty was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Because we have held that the death penalty has not been invalidated by <em>Evans, </em>we need not address in any detail appellant\u2019s argument that the notice of the State\u2019s intention to seek the death penalty prejudiced him. He contends that a \u201cdeath-qualified\u201d jury is more likely to convict, and, second, that his trial strategy was based on the possibility of a death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sentence and would have differed in the absence of that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The Court of Appeals has twice rejected the argument that seating a \u201cdeath-qualified\u201d jury denies a defendant the Constitutional right to an impartial jury at the guilt or innocence stage of the trial. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 727, 506 A.2d 580, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986); <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 466, 499 A.2d 1236 (1985), <em>cert. denied sub nom, Maryland v. Foster, </em>464 U.S. 1073, 104 S.Ct. 985, 79 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984). Although appellant claims that the defense strategy was prejudicially affected by the possibility of a death sentence, he has not identified how the defense strategy would have shifted in any way were that not the case, nor is it apparent from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Whether the circuit court abused its discretion with regard to the admission of Ms.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Wroten\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Officer Wroten\u2019s former wife, Tracy Wroten, to identify an autopsy photograph of him and to testify about his activities with their children before he went to guard appellant on the night of January 25. Appellant argues that Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony was not probative of any fact in issue and was unduly prejudicial. The State responds that Officer Wroten\u2019s activities that evening were relevant to show how he came into contact with appellant and that the autopsy photograph was admitted later without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Shortly before the prosecution called Ms. Wroten as its first witness, defense counsel requested a bench conference so that in-chambers discussions about her testimony could be put on the record. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, in chambers we discussed the testimony of the first witness, the ex-wife of Officer Wroten, Tracy Wroten. And, after hearing what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>State proposes to elicit from her, there was a single objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">As we understand it, the State will show Ms. Wroten a copy of a photograph, Officer Wroten with a bullet hole. It was a photograph, as I understand it, that was taken at the autopsy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">Objection to that is that the witness \u2014 there is no dispute as to the autopsy was conducted upon [sic], who that photograph depicts, and, therefore, our position was the testimony of Ms. Wroten was not necessary under 5-403. We think there is a potential prejudice in her identifying her ex-husband, and that the prejudice would outweigh any probative value it has. That was our position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, the State has shown the photograph it will show the witness to the defense. It is one of the black and white photographs of the decedent\u2019s face. That is part of the State\u2019s Exhibit that will be \u2014 we will seek admission, or at least will be referred to by Doctor Ali this afternoon. And, she will simply identify this as her ex-husband. They divorced in the summer of 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">THE COURT: Okay, all right, I am going to overrule the defense\u2019s objection. There is, I think, a balancing test, but the picture has been agreed to, and I think it important that it be identified, and I do not have a problem with letting her testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The State then called Ms. Wroten to the stand. She testified without objection to the ages of the four children she and Officer Wroten had together and then to the date of their marriage. Responding to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, she then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">Q. Did you see Jeffery frequently after your marriage ended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">A. Every day, every day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Q.

Yes, he was there when I got home from work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-17\">Q. What was happening when you got home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-18\">A. He and the girls were disco dancing in the kitchen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-19\">Q. And, did you speak with him after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-20\">A. Sure, sure we laughed about dancing and rocking the refrigerator, and put the girls to bed, and he stayed and talked to me later. And, he left and called me about an hour later, and said he had been called in for \u2014 grab an overtime shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-21\">Q. Was he supposed to work that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-22\">A. No, it was his night off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-23\">Q.

It was the next morning, they called to tell me he had been hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-19\">Q. Okay, I am showing you what has been marked as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2.

Exhibit 2 shows a discrete wound to the officer\u2019s upper cheek, near his temple. That photograph is also included in the autopsy photographs later admitted without objection as State\u2019s Exhibit 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">Generally, evidence is admissible when: 1) it is relevant, and 2) \u201cits probative value is [not] substantially outweighed by the danger\u201d that the evidence will prejudice a party, confuse the issues, or mislead the jury. <em>Smith v. State, </em>371 Md. 496, 504, 810 A.2d 449 (2002) (citing Rules 5-402 and 5-403). Evidence is relevant if it \u201ctend[s] to establish or refute a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Merzbacher v.

Nor do we reverse evidentiary decisions when, \u201cupon [our] independent review of the record,\u201d we are \u201cable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict____\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>407 Md. 137, 165, 963 A.2d 197 (2009) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Addressing Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony concerning the autopsy photograph, the circuit court acknowledged, and, presumably, conducted, a \u201cbalancing test\u201d between the need for identification of the photograph for purposes of establishing an evidentiary foundation and any unfair prejudice created by the testimony of an emotional witness. The judge concluded that it was \u201cimportant that [the autopsy photograph] be identified\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and did not \u201chave a problem with letting [Ms. Wroten] testify.\u201d Having found a need for the testimony, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Ms. Wroten to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">As to Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony concerning the activities of Officer Wroten before he arrived at the hospital, appellant did not specifically object to this testimony. As appellant objected to having Ms. Wroten testify generally concerning Officer Wroten\u2019s death, we shall assume, without deciding, that the issue of letting Ms. Wroten testify as to the victim\u2019s identity and activities prior to the hospital has been adequately preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">Nothing about the testimony of Tracey [sic] Wroten had any rational relationship to the issue of whether Mr. Morris was, in fact, the individual who took the life of Officer Wroten. The testimony of Ms. Wroten provided background information about Officer Wroten and what Officer Wroten did before he arrived at Washington County Hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tal. This information was utterly irrelevant to the jury. The testimony had \u201cno natural tendency\u201d to prove any fact in issue, nor was it probative of the proposition in issue; rather it was more likely to \u201cdivert the minds of the jur[ors] from the real point in issue, and may arouse their prejudices.\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We are not persuaded. Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony concerning the prior activities of Officer Wroten before he arrived at the hospital established that Officer Wroten was alive prior to his shift at the hospital. This evidence was generally relevant to the identification of the autopsy photograph and establishing the identity of the victim. We are persuaded that the court acted within its discretion by letting in the testimony of Ms. Wroten. Moreover, we are persuaded that, in light of the State\u2019s evidence in this case, the admission of Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Appellant also argues that he was unduly prejudiced by Ms. Wroten\u2019s testimony because she \u201c[broke] down crying on the stand\u201d during her testimony. Though not specifically objected to, we will address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The transcript neither supports nor contradicts appellant\u2019s assertion that Ms. Wroten cried during her testimony. In <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 501, 540 A.2d 1125 (1988), in addressing the defendant\u2019s claims that he was prejudiced by the victims\u2019 relatives\u2019 displays of emotion, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cWithout the incident in the record, we cannot speculate as to what transpired.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Yet, even if Ms. Wroten did cry during her testimony, some display of emotion does not necessitate the exclusion of her testimony. In <em>Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 207 A.2d 456 (1965), the defendant claimed that the court\u2019s admittance of the testimony of the murder victim\u2019s mother, during which the mother cried, created undue prejudice and an unfair trial. The Court of Appeals, in addressing the defendant\u2019s complaint, stated: \u201cIt is true that the witness cried upon the stand, but the trial judge cannot, at times, control the emo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tions of witnesses, and every emotional outburst of a witness does not entitle an accused to a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 207 A.2d 456; <em>see also Hunt, </em>312 Md. at 501, 540 A.2d 1125 (\u201cEmotional responses in a courtroom are not unusual, especially in criminal cases, and manifestly the defendant is not entitled to a mistrial every time someone becomes upset.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Whether the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to premeditated murder, felony murder based on escape, robbery, and felony murder based on robbery. With respect to the premeditated murder and robbery convictions, appellant argues that the prosecution did not introduce direct evidence of what occurred in Room 5006. With respect to escape and robbery, appellant argues that the prosecution\u2019s evidence varied from the crimes charged in the presentment. We shall begin with the issues regarding the sufficiency of the evidence and then turn to the issues regarding the alleged variance between the presentment and the prosecution\u2019s proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>A. The sufficiency of the evidence of first-degree premeditated murder and of robbery.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution in order to determine whether \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tichnell v.

We defer to the fact-finder\u2019s decisions on which evidence to accept and which inferences to draw when the evidence supports differing inferences. <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 430-31, 842 A.2d 716 (2004). In other words, we \u201c \u2018give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>finder draws, regardless of whether ...

In our independent review of the evidence, we do not distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence because \u201c[a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Burlas, </em>185 Md.App, at 569, 971 A.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We turn first to appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence of first-degree premeditated murder was insufficient. He argues that Yeagy\u2019s testimony was contradicted by Miller and, therefore, the prosecution introduced no direct evidence of what occurred before the shot was fired in Room 5006. The State argues that Yeagy\u2019s testimony was itself sufficient to convict appellant of first degree premeditated murder, and, also, that Miller did not contradict Yeagy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cMurder in the first degree,\u201d as defined in Crim. Law \u00a7 2-201(a)(l),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> includes \u201ca deliberate, premeditated, and willful killing.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>To prove premeditated first-degree murder, the State must adduce evidence \u201cthat the defendant possessed] the intent to kill (willful), that the defendant ha[d] conscious knowledge of that intent (deliberate), and that there [was] time enough for the defendant to deliberate, <em>i.e., </em>time enough to have thought about that intent (premeditate).\u201d <em>Willey v. State, </em>328 Md. 126,133, 613 A.2d 956 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Here, the prosecution introduced Yeagy\u2019s testimony that appellant held a revolver to Officer Wroten\u2019s temple before pulling the trigger, in addition to photographic and medical evidence that Officer Wroten was killed by a bullet wound to the upper cheek, near his temple. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably find that appellant used a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of Officer Wroten\u2019s body and reasonably infer the requisite willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Court of Appeals summarized the \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cpremeditated\u201d requirements in <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 148-49, 767 A.2d 844 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">For murder \u201cto be \u2018deliberate\u2019 there must be a full and conscious knowledge of the purpose to kill; and to be \u2018premeditated\u2019 the design to kill must have preceded the killing by an appreciable length of time, that is, time enough to be deliberate.\u201d <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980). We added in <em>Tichnell, </em>however, that \u201c[i]t is unnecessary that the deliberation or premeditation shall have existed for any particular length of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 415 A.2d at 842. \u201cAppreciable length of time\u201d simply means \u201cany amount of time sufficient to convince the trier of fact that the purpose to kill was not \u2018the immediate offspring of rashness and impetuous temper,\u2019 but was he product of a mind \u2018fully conscious of its own design.\u2019\u201d <em>Willey v. State, </em>328 Md. 126,133, 613 A.2d 956, 959 (1992)[.] ... [W]e confirmed in <em>Willey </em>that \u201c[i]f the killing results from a <em>choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act, </em>it is sufficient to characterize the crime as deliberate and premeditated murder.\u201d <em>Willey, supra, </em>328 Md. at 133, 613 A,2d 956 [(emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The time needed to establish deliberation can be brief. For instance, in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>the Court held that the time it took the defendant to prepare his weapon to fire a second time was \u201cenough time for reflection and decision to justify a finding of premeditation.\u201d 345 Md. 122, 161, 691 A.2d 1255, <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1131, 117 S.Ct. 2536, 138 L.Ed.2d 1036 (1997). The Court listed the \u201cdeliberate and conscious actions\u201d taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>that defendant to make his gun operational: \u201cHe pulled the hammer of the weapon toward him. He pointed the weapon at [the victim], and he pulled the trigger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected the notion that the weapon in question, a single-action revolver, could be \u201cfired in any other but a deliberate manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88,108-09, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984), the Court of Appeals held that the time in which it took a burglar to take a knife from the kitchen to the stairway where he attacked the victim to be sufficient to establish deliberation. <em>Id. </em>at 108-09, 472 A.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In this case, Yeagy testified that, while struggling with Officer Wroten and before shooting him, appellant held Officer Wroten down with one hand, held a revolver to the officer\u2019s temple with the other hand, and told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, you motherfucker.\u201d According to her testimony, Officer Wroten looked at her and away from her and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d before appellant pulled the trigger. Yeagy\u2019s testimony supports an inference that appellant had sufficient time in which to deliberate the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The jury was entitled to credit Yeagy\u2019s testimony and to reject an alternative inference based on Miller\u2019s testimony that Yeagy could only have seen the officer\u2019s shoes from her vantage point. <em>See Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 430, 842 A.2d 716 (the fact-finder may choose among differing inferences). Therefore, we are persuaded that the prosecution introduced sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict for first-degree premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conviction of felony murder based on the robbery of the weapon from Officer Wroten. Robbery is \u201ca larceny from the person accomplished by either an assault (putting in fear) or a battery (violence).\u201d <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 618, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991). The prosecution introduced testimony from which the jury could infer that the revolver used by appellant was the revolver seen in Officer Wroten\u2019s holster, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>to evidence of a struggle over the weapon. The jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that appellant took the revolver from the person of Officer Wroten by violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">To establish felony murder, the prosecution was required to prove that the murder was \u201ccommitted in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate ... robbery under [Crim. Law] \u00a7 3-402 or \u00a7 3-403____\u201d Crim. Law \u00a7 2-201(a)(ix). As codified at Crim. Law \u00a7 2-201, \u201cthe intent to commit the underlying felony must exist prior to or concurrent with the performance of the act causing the death of the victim.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>387 Md. 389, 402, 875 A.2d 724 (2005). Accordingly, an \u201cafterthought felony will not suffice as a predicate for felony-murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the jury could reasonably infer from the fight and ongoing struggle, that appellant took the weapon from Officer Wroten and shot him in the course of doing so. The evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for felony-murder committed during the crime of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>B. The sufficiency of the presentment to charge the predicate robbery and escape crimes of which appellant was convicted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">As part of his sufficiency argument, appellant asserts that the prosecution\u2019s evidence varied from the felony murder/robbery and the felony murder/escape crimes charged in the presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">As to robbery, he argues that the presentment charged a robbery \u201cas defined in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-402,\u201d and that \u00a7 3-402 does not contain a definition of that crime. Count Three lists Crim. Law \u00a7 2-201(a)(4)(ix) as its basis and states that appellant \u201c... feloniously, willfully, and with deliberate premeditated malice did kill and murder one Jeffrey Wroten, in the perpetration of a felony to-wit: Robbery as defined in Criminal Law Article 3-402 ..., contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly----\u201d Crim.

Law \u00a7 3-402(a), clearly refers to robbery as defined by \u00a7 3-401(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s argument that the prosecution\u2019s proof of his escape from the hospital as a predicate for felony murder did not prove his escape from a \u201ccorrectional institution,\u201d as charged in the indictment for felony-murder. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>He draws a distinction between Count Seven, which charges a first-degree escape under Crim. Law \u00a7 9-404 from a \u201cState Correctional Facility, a place of confinement,\u201d terms which would include the hospital, and Count Two, which cites as the predicate crime for felony murder only an escape from \u201ca correctional institution[.]\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Arguing that a \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d excludes the hospital, appellant contends that the prosecution, for purposes of Count Two, did not place him on notice of a charge of escape from a \u201cplace of confinement\u201d and, therefore, did not prove the predicate felony for the felony murder alleged. The State responds that, insofar as appellant challenges the sufficiency of notice given by the presentment, he waived that issue by not requesting a bill of particulars under Rule 4-241. Moreover, the State argues that the prosecution sufficiently proved an escape from the correctional institution that had constructive custody over appellant while he was in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Not only was this issue not preserved for our review, it would fail on the merits. Crim. Law \u00a7 9-404 addresses \u201c[e]scape in the first degree.\u201d Section 9-404(a), at the pertinent subpart, provides, \u201cA person may not knowingly escape from a place of confinement.\u201d Crim. Law \u00a7 9-401(f) defines \u201cplace of confinement\u201d as, among other things, \u201ca correctional facility\u201d and \u201cany other facility in which a person is confined under color of law.\u201d Crim. Law \u00a7 9-401(a) provides, \u201c \u2018Escape\u2019 retains its judicially determined meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Under Maryland law, \u201cthe physical act of escape is the unauthorized departure from lawful custody.\u201d <em>Farris v. State, </em>351 Md. 24, 29, 716 A.2d 237 (1998) (citing <em>Stewart v. State, </em>275 Md. 258, 273, 340 A.2d 290 (1975)). The Court of Appeals has construed \u201clawful custody\u201d to include both actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>custody and \u201cconstructive custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 716 A.2d 237. A person is in \u201cconstructive custody\u201d when \u201ctemporarily permitted to leave while still lawfully committed to that institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 716 A.2d 237 (citing <em>Stewart, </em>275 Md. at 272, 340 A.2d 290). Accordingly, \u201ca person\u2019s departure from constructive custody is the legal equivalent of an escape from the actual place of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 716 A.2d 237. In other words, \u201cMaryland draws no distinction between an escape from within the prison walls and one effected when the prisoner, while still in legal custody, was physically outside the prison area.\u201d <em>Ford v. State, </em>237 Md. 266, 270, 205 A.2d 809 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In <em>Best v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 633, 201 A.2d 490 (1964), where an inmate escaped from a hospital while his guard was arranging transport back to the penitentiary, the \u201cescape from the hospital was an escape from the penitentiary where he had been committed.\u201d <em>Slagle v. State, </em>243 Md. 435, 437, 221 A.2d 641 (1966) (summarizing <em>Best, </em>supra). In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>196 Md. 672, 75 A.2d 843 (1950), an inmate who walked away from the private farm where he had been assigned to work without a guard was similarly held to have escaped from the institution to which he had been committed because \u201cescape from the farm had no legal significance different from an escape from the Reformatory itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 75 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Taylor v. State, </em>229 Md. 128, 182 A.2d 52 (1962), an inmate who escaped from a work detail while assigned by the House of Correction to a \u201cCorrectional Camp\u201d was charged \u25a0with escaping the House of Correction. The Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe prisoner continued to be under confinement at [the Correctional Camp] and escape therefrom would, therefore, constitute escape from the House of Correction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 182 A.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Here, the prosecution proved that appellant, an inmate of RCI, was still in legal custody while at the hospital. The prosecution also proved facts from which the jury could reasonably infer that appellant killed Officer Wroten in his effort to escape legal custody, and, for the period of time between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the shooting and the time when appellant was apprehended, did escape that custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Whether the trial court correctly instructed the jury on escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that, for purposes of first-degree escape, \u201ca correctional facility includes a hospital to which the defendant has been transported for medical treatment during his lawful confinement.\u201d He offers the same argument he asserted in support of his motion for acquittal on his conviction for felony-murder based on escape. As we have explained, the trial court\u2019s instructions reflected the state of the law and were not incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Whether the sentencing court erred by failing to merge appellant\u2019s conviction for the first-degree assault of Tina Bussard into the conviction for attempted armed robbery and the first-degree assault of Fultz into the conviction for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Appellant asserts that the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated when he was sentenced for both the first-degree assaults of Tina Bussard and Fultz and for the armed robbery of Fultz and the attempted armed robbery of Tina Bussard. As to each victim, appellant argues that the acts of assault and robbery were part of the same transaction and that the \u201crule of lenity\u201d required the sentencing court to merge each assault conviction into its corresponding robbery conviction. The State responds that appellant committed each assault in a transaction separate from the corresponding act of robbery and that the sentencing court, therefore, did not violate appellant\u2019s right to be sentenced only once for each crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the common law of Maryland guard against \u201cmultiple punishments for the same conduct, unless the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 141,156, 742 A.2d 493 (1999). To evaluate the legality of the imposition of separate sentences for the same act, we look first to whether the charges \u201carose out of the same act or transaction,\u201d then to whether \u201cthe crimes charged are the same offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 157, 742 A.2d 493, and then, if the offenses are separate, to whether \u201cthe Legislature intended multiple punishment for conduct arising out of a single act or transaction which violates two or more <em>statutes....\u201d Id. </em>at 163, 742 A.2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The \u201csame act or transaction\u201d inquiry often turns on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cone single and continuous course of conduct,\u201d without a \u201cbreak in conduct\u201d or \u201ctime between the acts.\u201d <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 698, 827 A.2d 68 (2003). The burden of proving distinct acts or transactions for purposes of separate units of prosecution falls on the State. <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 618, 583 A.2d 1056 (1991). Accordingly, when the indictment or jury\u2019s verdict reflects ambiguity as to whether the jury based its convictions on distinct acts, the ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>Williams v. State, </em>187 Md.App. 470, 477, 979 A.2d 184, <em>cert. denied, </em>411 Md. 602, 984 A.2d 245 (2009); <em>Jones v.

The dispositive inquiry is whether appellant\u2019s first-degree assault convictions were distinct acts or whether they arose out of the acts of armed robbery against Tina Bussard and Fultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>A. The sentence for the assault and robbery of Tina Bussard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Count Fourteen of the presentment charged appellant with \u201cassaulting] Tina Marie Bussard in the first degree in violation of [Crim. Law \u00a7 ] 3-202----\u201d Count Sixteen charged him with attempting to rob her with a dangerous weapon, \u201cto wit: [a] revolver,\u201d in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 3-403. The court instructed the jury on first-degree assault as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">The defendant is charged with a crime of first degree assault. In order to convict the defendant of first degree assault, the State must prove all the elements of second degree assault, and must also prove that the defendant used a firearm to commit the assault, or the defendant intended to commit serious physical injury, in the commission of the assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The court instructed the jury on armed robbery and attempt as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">In order to convict the defendant of robbery, the State must prove that the defendant took ... the property from the victim\u2019s control.

[a]nd that the defendant intended to \u2014 to commit the crimes of attempted robberyf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The verdict sheet posed the following questions pertaining to the first-degree assault and attempted armed robbery charges relating to Bussard:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>Question </em># <em>H</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">First degree assault on Tina Bussard: X</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Not Guilty Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">If you find the defendant guilty on Question # 14, go on to Question # 16. <em>Question #16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Attempted Armed Robbery of Tina Bussard: X</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Not Guilty Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">We have addressed similar facts as we have here in cases involving the merger of the common-law crime of assault (now superseded by statute, <em>Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 702, 728 A.2d 698 (1999)), into the crime of robbery. In <em>Beard v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 276, 399 A.2d 1383 (1979), the defendants broke into a house, held one occupant at gunpoint, bound both occupants, and stole property. We concluded that the assaults were \u201cpart and in furtherance of\u2019 the robbery convictions and noted that there was no evidence of \u201cany independent assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 399 A.2d 1383. Therefore, we held that the convictions for assault should have been merged under those of the robbery and reversed the convictions and sentences for assault. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Melville v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 118, 268 A.2d 497 (1970), in which the defendant and the victim, a draft board employee, struggled over a basket of induction files, we noted that the \u201celement of violence in the robbery\u201d was the same act from which the conviction for the assault arose and held that the offenses merged. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 268 A.2d 497. Similarly, the offense of assault with a dangerous weapon merged into armed robbery in <em>Baynard v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 701, 704, 237 A.2d 71 (1968), where the defendant robbed a liquor store owner and then left the premises. In contrast, the crimes did not merge in <em>Matthews v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 282, 303, 511 A.2d 548, <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 238, 517 A.2d 1121 (1986), where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>defendant instructed his cohorts to take property from one room while he assaulted the victim in another. Here, the record does not reflect a break in appellant\u2019s acts with regard to Bussard, who testified that appellant threatened her with a gun, demanded her money and keys, and pulled her from Room 5007 while she was holding her pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The State argues that the jury could have inferred from evidence introduced at trial that appellant\u2019s assault of Tina Bussard was an act distinct from his attempt to rob her at gunpoint. However, we have explained that \u201cany ambiguity in the indictment or as to how the jury understood the charges must be resolved in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Gerald, </em>137 Md.App. at 312, 768 A.2d 140 (citing <em>Snowden, </em>321 Md. at 618-19, 583 A.2d 1056). In <em>Gerald, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">The court instructed the jury on the elements of each charge, but it did not explain how the assault and robbery charges related to one another, how they differed, and what the jury needed to find to convict under both charges. <em>See Graham v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 280, 289, 699 A.2d 1204 (1997) (no ambiguity where the court clearly explained the difference between the two counts at issue); <em>Cortez v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 358, 369, 656 A.2d 360 (1995) (advising courts on how to instruct juries to avoid merger problems). With an ambiguity in the indictment, and non-curative instructions, the first degree assault conviction must indeed merge into the robbery conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">We addressed this argument again in <em>Williams, </em>187 Md. App. at 477, 979 A.2d 184, where the evidence established that the defendant pointed his gun at the victim in her house, hit her with his gun, ordered others to tie her up, continued to point his gun at her while others went through her possessions downstairs for ten to fifteen minutes, threatened her not to call the police, and left. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 979 A.2d 184. The <em>Williams </em>indictment did not charge assault based upon acts separate and distinct from the acts upon which the robbery charge was based, nor did the jury instructions require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>jury to make separate findings of fact as related to each charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">In <em>Williams, </em>the State contended that, \u201cbecause \u2018there was evidence from [which] the jury could infer that [the victim] was assaulted in the first degree based on conduct separate and distinct from the conduct that established the ... robbery\u2019 with a dangerous and deadly weapon, the offenses do not merge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 979 A.2d 184. Finding the State\u2019s argument \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d <em>id., </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">[Defendant\u2019s] charging document is ambiguous as to the particular act for which he was charged with first degree assault of [victim]. <em>See Gerald, </em>137 Md.App. at 312, 768 A.2d 140 (a conviction for first degree assault merges into a conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon when the charging document is ambiguous as to the particular act alleged to have constituted first degree assault). Moreover, the court did not instruct the jury as to \u201chow the assault and robbery charges related to one another, how they differed, and what the jury needed to find to convict under both charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In light of the court\u2019s failure to give curative instructions, and the ambiguity of [defendant\u2019s] charging document, we must resolve the question of whether the charges of robbery and assault of [victim] were based upon the same conduct in [defendant\u2019s] favor. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[A]ny ambiguity in [a charging document] or as to how the jury understood the charges must be resolved in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d (citation omitted)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">On the other hand, in <em>Graham v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 280, 699 A.2d 1204, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 206, 703 A.2d 147 (1997), we upheld separate assault sentences because the trial court had instructed the jury on the two distinct assaults with which the defendant had been separately charged, and the verdicts on the separate counts evidenced the jury\u2019s finding of distinct acts. <em>Id. </em>at 288-90, 699 A.2d 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Here, neither the charging document <em>nor the jury </em>instructions made clear that the charges of assault were based upon separate and distinct acts from those upon which the robbery charges were based. In accordance with <em>Gerald </em>and <em>Williams, </em>and in light of similar ambiguities reflected in the record, we hold that appellant\u2019s first degree assault of Tina Bussard merged into the attempted armed robbery conviction, and the sentence imposed for the first degree assault must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\n<em>B. The sentences for the assault and robbery of Fultz</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Count Twenty-Four of the presentment charged appellant with \u201cassaulting] Frank Fultz in the first degree in violation of [Crim. Law \u00a7 ] 3-202____\u201d Count Twenty-Five charged appellant with robbing Fultz of money with a dangerous weapon, \u201cto wit: [a] revolver,\u201d in violation of Crim. Law \u00a7 3-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The verdict sheet posed the following questions pertaining to the charged crimes against Fultz:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\"><em>Question </em># <em>2i</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">First degree assault on Frank Fultz: X</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Not Guilty Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">If you find the defendant guilty on Question # 24, go on to Question # 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\"><em>Question </em># <em>26</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Armed Robbery of Frank Fultz: X</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">Not Guilty Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">The evidence might have permitted the jury to find that appellant continued his assault of Fultz after the robbery, but the presentment did not allege an assaultive act separate from that done in furtherance of the robbery, the jury was not instructed to reach a verdict on a separate act of assault, and the verdict form conditioned the robbery verdict on the assault verdict. Here, like the <em>Williams </em>and <em>Gerald </em>charging documents, the presentment \u201cis ambiguous as to the particular act for which he was charged with first degree assault of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>victim].\u201d <em>Williams, </em>187 Md.App. at 477, 979 A.2d 184. Again, we must resolve the conflict in appellant\u2019s favor and merge the assault into the armed robbery and vacate the sentence imposed for the assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">SENTENCES FOR THE FIRST DEGREE ASSAULT OF VICTIMS BUSSARD AND FULTZ VACATED; JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.
