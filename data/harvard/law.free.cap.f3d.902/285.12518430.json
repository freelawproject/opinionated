The three defendants in these consolidated cases pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute, and possess with intent to distribute, the drugs on board the Mistby, in violation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070501\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. Each defendant was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants now appeal on two grounds. First, they argue that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their prosecutions because they were not on board the Mistby when it was intercepted. In the defendants' view, Colombia's assent to U.S. jurisdiction over individuals associated with the Mistby was limited to persons found on board the vessel. Second, the defendants contend that their offense of conviction is covered by the so-called safety-valve provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). That provision, in certain circumstances, exempts covered offenses from mandatory-minimum sentences such as the 10-year sentences imposed against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the defendants' prosecutions, but that the defendants' offense is covered by the safety-valve provision. We therefore vacate the defendants' sentences and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Coast Guard first spotted the Mistby on the high seas about 70 nautical miles off the coast of Panama. When the Coast Guard approached, the Mistby fled, and its crew began to dump cargo overboard. The cargo turned out to be 22 bales of drugs, containing more than 220 kilograms of cocaine and more than 120 kilograms of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Coast Guard eventually overtook the Mistby and boarded it to determine its nationality, at which point the Mistby's captain claimed the vessel was registered in Colombia. The United States and Colombia have agreed by treaty to \"cooperate in combating illicit traffic by sea.\" Agreement to Suppress Illicit Traffic by Sea, Colom.-U.S., art. 2, Feb. 20, 1997, T.I.A.S. No. 12,835. Pursuant to that treaty, the Coast Guard asked the Colombian Navy (i) to verify that the Mistby was registered in Colombia, and (ii) to grant the Coast Guard permission to search the vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 7. The Colombian Navy granted both requests. The Coast Guard then searched the Mistby and arrested the people on board, but the defendants were not among them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, the Coast Guard asked the Colombian Navy to confirm that, under Article 16 of the treaty, the United States had jurisdiction over the Mistby. The Colombian Navy did so on June 26, stating that, under the \"agreement signed by the governments of the United States and Colombia, [the United States could] exercise their jurisdiction.\" Ardila M.

The government's theory as to each defendant's involvement was as follows: that Chang-Rendon (a civilian employee of the Colombian Navy) knew the patrol routes of Colombian and American law-enforcement vessels and passed that information along to Mosquera-Murillo; that Mosquera-Murillo in turn conveyed the information to the people transporting the drugs; and that Moreno-Membache helped move the drugs to the Colombian coast and then load them onto the Mistby. At the time the defendants were charged, all three of them were still in Colombia. The United States thus requested extradition, which Colombia granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Chang-Rendon and Mosquera-Murillo moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their prosecutions. The government claimed that the district court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070502\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(C), which applies if the vessel on which an MDLEA offense was committed is \"a vessel registered in a foreign nation [and] that nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of United States law by the United States.\" The defendants responded that, as shown by the Coast Guard's certification, Colombia waived objection to the United States exercising jurisdiction over the \"MISTBY, all associated contraband, and persons on board\"-but not persons like the defendants who never set foot on the vessel. Coast Guard Certification \u00b6 4.e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court rejected that argument. The court held that \"a foreign government's waiver of jurisdiction over a particular vessel ... establish[es a district] court's subject-matter jurisdiction over a subsequent prosecution of any land-based co-conspirators.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mosquera-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290799\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/130/#p158\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (D.D.C. 2015). And in any event, the court explained, the notion that Colombia had not consented to the defendants' prosecutions was difficult to square \"with the Colombian government's subsequent extradition of the defendants to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290799\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/130/#p158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290799\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/130/#p158\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants then pleaded guilty. In their plea agreements, they acknowledged that, given the quantity of cocaine involved, the district court ordinarily would be required to impose a mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). But the defendants reserved their rights (i) to argue they were eligible for relief from that mandatory-minimum sentence under the safety-valve provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), and (ii) to appeal any contrary determination by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The safety-valve provision states that sentencing relief is available only \"in the case of an offense under\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844, 846, 960 or 963.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The government argued that, because that list does not include any provision of the MDLEA, the defendants' offense was not covered. The defendants responded that, because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) supplied the penalties for their MDLEA violation, the violation qualified as \"an offense under\" \u00a7 960.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court agreed with the government, holding that the defendants were ineligible for safety-valve relief.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mosquera-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346318\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/24/#p38\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (D.D.C. 2016). The court thus sentenced each defendant to the mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this appeal, the defendants renew two arguments they pressed unsuccessfully in the district court: that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their prosecutions, and that they were eligible for safety-valve relief from the 10-year mandatory-minimum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite the defendants' guilty pleas, they have not waived or forfeited either argument. Challenges to a district court's subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived by plea.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055881,4073978\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1185/\">\n    780 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1188 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Nor can such challenges be forfeited, so Moreno-Membache's failure to contest subject-matter jurisdiction in the district court does not preclude him from raising the challenge now. And although sentencing challenges can be waived, all three defendants entered conditional pleas reserving their right to appeal the district court's determination that they were ineligible for safety-valve relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055881,4073978\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1185/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Fed.

And the statute, as explained, nonetheless reaches land-based co-conspirators\n   because, pursuant to \"well-established principle[s] of conspiracy law,\" the acts of a person who is on board the vessel can be attributed to a co-conspirator who remains on land.\n   <em>\n    Ballestas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786653,4288269\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/138/\">\n    795 F.3d at 145-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the same token, the certification's reference to \"persons on board\" does not exclude persons who remain on land: the acts of persons on board the Mistby would be attributed to land-based co-conspirators like the defendants, such that they too would effectively be considered to have committed a prohibited act on board. The indictment correspondingly charges the defendants with \"conspir[ing], and agree[ing] to ... distribute, and possess with intent to distribute,\" cocaine and marijuana \"\n   <em>\n    on board a vessel\n   </em>\n   subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In theory, a foreign nation could say-and thus a certification from the Coast Guard could report-that the nation consented to U.S. jurisdiction over a vessel with respect to persons on board, but denied consent with respect to co-conspirators not on board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, though, the certification concludes by reporting, without qualification, that \"the Government of the United States determined the go-fast vessel MISTBY was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070502\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(C).\" Coast Guard Certification \u00b6 4.f. And the certification does not indicate that Colombia denied consent with respect to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   particular class of MDLEA proceedings-including proceedings against co-conspirators not on board the Mistby. Rather, the certification confirms that Colombia's consent to U.S. jurisdiction encompasses persons on board the Mistby, whose conduct on board the vessel is attributable to co-conspirators like the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a fallback argument, the defendants suggest that we should look behind the Coast Guard's certification and examine Colombian law for ourselves. If we do so, the defendants submit, we will find the following: (i) that the treaty contemplates the application of U.S. law only if Colombia's domestic law allows for it, T.I.A.S. No. 12,835 art. 16; and (ii) that Colombian law envisions the application of U.S. law only in the case of persons who are \"on board\" a Colombian vessel. C\u00f3digo Penal (Criminal Code) [C. Pen.] tit. II, \u00a7 217 (Colom.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even assuming, arguendo, that we should scrutinize Colombia's domestic law, we note that one provision of that law, introduced by the government in support of subject-matter jurisdiction, says that a \"punishable act shall be deemed to have occurred\" in \"the place where the effect was produced or should have been produced.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 201. That language mirrors the conspiracy-law principle under which a land-based conspirator in an enterprise that engages in prohibited conduct on board a vessel will be treated as having himself participated in the acts on board the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Our understanding of the Coast Guard's certification (and of Colombian law) is reinforced by Colombia's decision to grant the United States' extradition request concerning the defendants. If Colombia had in fact intended to deny consent to U.S. jurisdiction over the Mistby with respect to proceedings against persons who never came on board the vessel, Colombia could have given effect to that intention by declining\n   to extradite the defendants. Colombia did not do so, however. That is not to say that the extradition itself gave rise to subject-matter jurisdiction. It is instead to say that the extradition fortifies our interpretation of the Coast Guard's earlier certification; and that certification substantiates the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction by demonstrating that the Mistby is a \"vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" for purposes of the defendants' prosecutions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070502\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Colombia's waiver of objection to U.S. jurisdiction over the Mistby covers the defendants' MDLEA prosecutions. The district court therefore had subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendants next argue that the district court erred by holding that they were ineligible for safety-valve relief from the 10-year mandatory-minimum term to which they were sentenced. The safety-valve provision is entitled \"Limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

Rather, the court deemed the defendants ineligible for safety-valve relief at the threshold, ruling that they had not been convicted of \"an offense under\" any of the five enumerated provisions. The court rejected the defendants' argument that their cases involved \"an offense under\" one of those provisions, namely\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The sole question we face here is whether the defendants' crime is \"an offense under\" \u00a7 960 within the meaning of the safety-valve provision.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).

The first, subsection (a), lists certain \"unlawful acts\" by reference to drug offenses set out elsewhere in the code-e.g., \"bring[ing] or possess[ing] on board a vessel, aircraft, or vehicle a controlled substance\" \"contrary to section 955.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The second subsection, subsection (b), sets out the penalties for the offenses listed in subsection (a) based on drug-type and drug-quantity-e.g., \"[i]n the case of a violation of subsection (a)\" involving \"1 kilogram or more of ... heroin,\" the \"person committing such violation shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years and not more than life.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   According to the government, the safety-valve provision's reference to \"an offense under\" \u00a7 960 means only those specific offenses listed in \u00a7 960(a) -not other offenses defined in part by the drug-type and drug-quantity elements set out in \u00a7 960(b). And because no MDLEA offense is listed in \u00a7 960(a), the government argues, the defendants' cases do not involve \"an offense under\" \u00a7 960 within the meaning of the safety-valve provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The government's reading of the safety-valve provision is unpersuasive. The statute speaks in terms of an \"offense under\" \u00a7 960 without limitation-not an offense under only \u00a7 960(a). Plus, the structure of \u00a7 960 demonstrates that the defendants' crime qualifies as \"an offense under\" \u00a7 960 no less than the crimes listed in \u00a7 960(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Subsection (a) of \u00a7 960 does not lay out any element of-and thus does not define in whole or in part-any criminal offense. Instead, \u00a7 960(a) merely lists certain offenses established elsewhere in the code. It does so for one reason: to identify a set of offenses for which \u00a7 960(b) supplies the drug-type and drug-quantity elements, and, accordingly, the range of potential penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The MDLEA offense of which the defendants were convicted interacts with \u00a7 960(b) in exactly the same way as the offenses listed in \u00a7 960(a). Just as those offenses are established outside of \u00a7 960 and \"shall be punished as provided in subsection (b)\" of \u00a7 960,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 960(a), the MDLEA also establishes offenses outside of \u00a7 960, which likewise are punished under the penalty scheme set out in \u00a7 960(b). Indeed, the MDLEA uses precisely the same wording in linking certain of its offenses to \u00a7 960(b) as \u00a7 960(a) does in linking its listed offenses to \u00a7 960(b) : the MDLEA states that, for first-time offenders\n   of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2070503\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), the defendant \"shall be punished as provided in\" \u00a7 960.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070506\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2070506\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   If both the offenses listed in \u00a7 960(a) and the relevant offenses under the MDLEA are (i) established outside of \u00a7 960, and (ii) make use of the drug-type and drug-quantity elements and associated penalties set forth in \u00a7 960(b), then there is no reason to conclude-as the government would-that the former qualify as \"offenses under\" \u00a7 960 for purpose of safety-valve eligibility whereas the latter do not. Nothing in the statutory text supports drawing such a distinction. Rather, just as a person who commits one of the offenses listed in \u00a7 960(a) violates both the provision establishing the offense (e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20955\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and \u00a7 960(b), the defendants in these cases violated both the MDLEA and \u00a7 960(b). The government was right to describe the defendants' offenses in that manner in the indictment and plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, treating the defendants as having violated \u00a7 960, and thus as eligible for safety-valve relief, would align with Congress's nearly unbroken pattern of setting identical penalties for drug crimes committed in domestic waters and drug crimes committed on the high seas. When Congress criminalized opium possession on the high seas in 1914, it set the maximum penalty at two years, which at the time was the maximum penalty for importing opium into the United States. Act of Jan. 17, 1914, Pub. L. No. 63-46, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Stat.%20275\">\n    38 Stat. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276. In 1922, Congress simultaneously raised the maximum penalties for both offenses from two to ten years. Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, Pub. L. No. 67-227, \u00a7 2(c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Stat.%20596\">\n    42 Stat. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596 (1922). Then, in 1951, Congress simultaneously decreased the maximum penalties for both offenses from ten to five years. Boggs Act, Pub. L. No. 82-255, \u00a7 2(c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Stat.%20767\">\n    65 Stat. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (1951).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In 1970, Congress overhauled the drug code, repealing the statutes that define the offenses discussed above, and establishing a new prohibition-codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20955\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -against importing drugs via the customs waters of the United States. Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, \u00a7 1007,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Stat.%201236\">\n    84 Stat. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1288. Congress provided that the penalties applicable to that offense were those set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1010, 84 Stat. at 1290. Shortly thereafter, Congress enacted what is now known as the MDLEA, including its prohibition against possession with intent to distribute on the high seas. Pub. L. No. 96-350, \u00a7 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Stat.%201159\">\n    94 Stat. 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159 (1980). And Congress provided that \u00a7 960 also supplied the penalties for that offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Stat.%201159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(g)(1), 94 Stat. at 1159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In light of the century-long pattern of identical penalties for drug offenses committed in domestic waters and on the high seas, it is notable that, as both parties agree, offenders who violate \u00a7 955 are eligible for safety-valve relief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20960\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (listing violations of \u00a7 955 as offenses punishable under \u00a7 960(b) ). So if offenders who violate the MDLEA were ineligible for safety-valve relief, then, by enacting the safety-valve provision, Congress would have broken its 100-year pattern of penalty parity. We do not understand Congress to have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Two other circuits have considered whether MDLEA offenses penalized under \u00a7 960(b) qualify as \"offenses under\" \u00a7 960 for purposes of the safety-valve provision. Both courts have concluded that such offenses do not qualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pertuz-Pertuz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876667\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/1327/#p1329\">\n    679 F.3d 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1329 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gamboa-Cardenas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046668\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/491/#p496\">\n    508 F.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (9th Cir. 2007). We respectfully reach the opposite\n   conclusion. Neither of those decisions expressly assesses whether the drug-type and drug-quantity facts supplied by \u00a7 960(b) constitute offense elements, such that an MDLEA offender penalized under \u00a7 960(b) should be considered someone who has violated both the MDLEA and \u00a7 960. That consideration, as we have explained, is pivotal to our conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Our decision today, we note finally, does not necessarily resolve whether the safety valve covers a different provision to which both parties have directed our attention:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20860\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In defining the offense of \"[d]istribution or manufacturing in or near schools and colleges,\" \u00a7 860 incorporates both the unlawful-act elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and the drug-type and drug-quantity elements of \u00a7 841(b). So one could argue that a violation of \u00a7 860 is an \"offense under\" \u00a7 841, in which case offenders who violate \u00a7 860 would be eligible for safety-valve relief, given that the safety valve lists \u00a7 841 as a covered provision. That said, \u00a7 860 restates in full the unlawful-act elements of \u00a7 841(a), and then modifies the penalties prescribed by \u00a7 841(b) by doubling or tripling them. That might mean that all the elements of an \u00a7 860 violation are supplied by \u00a7 860 itself, rather than by a combination of \u00a7 860 and \u00a7 841. If that is the case, then offenders who violate \u00a7 860 would be ineligible for safety-valve relief, given that the safety valve does not list \u00a7 860 as a covered provision. We need not decide the issue now; we simply note that today's decision does not necessarily answer the \u00a7 860 question either way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the defendants' sentences and remand for resentencing, at which the district court should consider whether the defendants meet the five remaining safety-valve requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
