The company responded by removing the case to federal court under the so-called \"complete preemption\" doctrine. The district court exercised jurisdiction, dismissed some of the claims, and remanded the remainder to state court. We reverse and remand for the entirety of this dispute to be returned to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Karen Hansen and Bette Joram are mental health providers who live and work in Washington (collectively, \"Providers\"). Group Health Cooperative (\"GHC\"), now known as Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, is a health insurance company with its principal place of business in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2015, the Providers filed a class action complaint against GHC in a Washington state superior court. According to the complaint, in January 2007 GHC adopted screening criteria for mental healthcare coverage called the Milliman Care Guidelines. GHC allegedly uses these guidelines as the \"primary criteria\" for authorizing psychotherapy treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Providers claim that GHC's use of the Milliman Care Guidelines has injured their practices in violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019.86.020\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 19.86.020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute makes unlawful \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019.86.020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three of the Providers' allegations are at issue in this appeal. First, the Providers allege that GHC's licensing of the guidelines is inherently unfair and deceptive because the treatment guidance is biased against mental healthcare. Second, the Providers allege that GHC deceptively uses the guidelines to avoid paying for mental healthcare coverage required by Washington's Mental Health Parity Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2048.44.341\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 48.44.341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And third, the Providers assert that GHC unfairly competes by employing its own psychotherapists who strictly adhere to the guidelines and by discouraging patients from seeking treatment from therapists who do not work for the company. The Providers bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all Washington psychotherapists who are not employed by GHC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2015, GHC removed this case to federal court. GHC determined\n   that Hansen and Joram had been assigned benefits by three of their patients who were insured under employer-sponsored health plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). The patients made these assignments so that their therapists could appeal adverse benefit determinations on their behalf. GHC argued that the benefit assignments caused the Providers' claims to be completely preempted by ERISA, meaning there was subject matter jurisdiction in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A month later, the Providers moved to remand the case to state court, while GHC moved to dismiss the complaint. In a consolidated order, the district court denied the motion to remand and granted the motion to dismiss in part, concluding that the Providers' claims were subject to conflict and express preemption to the extent that they concerned GHC's business practices in administering ERISA plans. The court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Providers' claims as to GHC's administration of non-ERISA plans, and remanded that part of the case back to Washington state court. The Providers appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In our federal system, the States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government, limited only by the Supremacy Clause.\n   <em>\n    Tafflin v.

And while a plan may define \"medically necessary\" differently from the Washington statute, that has no bearing on the contours of the statutory duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   GHC also contends that the statutory duty is not independent because it relies on the existence of a health benefit plan in the first place. The relevant inquiry, however, focuses on the\n   <em>\n    origin\n   </em>\n   of the duty, not its relationship with health plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marin Gen. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755294\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/941/#p944\">\n    581 F.3d at 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state laws at issue in\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   , for example, did not impose an independent legal duty to provide benefits because they excluded treatments not covered by a plan's terms.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n    542 U.S. at 212-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the denials of treatment in that case turned on the terms of the specific health plans, not the requirements of state law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, Washington's Mental Health Parity Act does impose an independent coverage requirement, mandating that health plans for medical and surgical care cover mental health treatment as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O.S.T. ex rel. G.T. v. BlueShield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356601\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/181/691/\">\n    181 Wash.2d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=335%20P.3d%20416\">\n    335 P.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (2014). If the terms of a plan exclude this treatment, they may violate the state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=335%20P.3d%20416\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This statutory duty is unlike those in\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   because it does not piggyback on, and is thus independent of, the specific rights \"established by the benefit plans.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n    542 U.S. at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525905\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/200/#p210\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   , the state law applied only when a benefit plan covered treatment, while here the state law applies to how all benefit plans cover mental health treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The next claim at issue is the Providers' contention that GHC unfairly competes in the marketplace by discouraging its patients from seeking treatment by rival practitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   GHC argues that it has no duty to \"encourage\" patients to seek care elsewhere, but that misses the point. Any duty for GHC to refrain from unfairly harming its competitors arises under state law, not under the terms of an ERISA plan. Indeed, because this claim concerns GHC's actions as an employer of psychotherapists, this claim could exist whether or not GHC administered any health benefit plans at all, let alone any ERISA plans. So this claim is based on an independent legal duty too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the Providers' three claims for unfair and deceptive business practices are based on independent duties beyond those imposed by three of their patients' ERISA plans. These claims do not satisfy the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Davila\n   </em>\n   , and hence this case was improperly removed to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Our federalism requires that federal courts refrain from adjudicating state-law claims between non-diverse parties unless a purported state-law claim is really a poorly disguised federal claim. But here, the Providers' claims for unfair and deceptive business practices are not federal claims improperly cloaked in the language of state law. Those claims are basically that, as mental health professionals, the Providers are unfairly being cut out of the market of suppliers of mental health services by GHC's unfair and deceptive use of treatment guidelines. To state their claims under Washington law, the Providers have alleged \"(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) occurring in trade or commerce, (3) affecting the public interest, (4) injury to a person's business or property, and (5) causation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Panag v.
