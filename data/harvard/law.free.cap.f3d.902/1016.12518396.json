The district court concluded that Peterson's prior conviction for first-degree robbery was a \"crime of violence\" as that term is defined by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\"Sentencing Guidelines\" or \"U.S.S.G.\") section 4B1.2(a) which, along with a prior controlled substance offense, increased his base offense level to 24 under U.S.S.G. section 2K2.1(a)(2). The district court also concluded that his conduct warranted a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. section 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight. Finding that Peterson's prior conviction for first-degree robbery was not a \"crime of violence,\" we affirm in part and reverse in part. Accordingly, Peterson's sentence is vacated, and this matter remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 14, 2015, King County police officers arrested Peterson on outstanding warrants. At the time of the arrest, the arresting officer instructed Peterson to remove his backpack so that he could be handcuffed. The officer waited to search the backpack until after he had handcuffed and secured Peterson in the back of the patrol car. Upon opening the backpack, the officer discovered a handgun, which officers on the scene soon determined was stolen. The officers informed Peterson of additional charges for possession of the firearm, and then transported him to King County Jail, where Peterson was booked on charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm, both felony offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm, Peterson filed a motion to suppress evidence of the handgun discovered in his backpack. The district court denied the motion, finding that the gun inevitably would have been discovered during an inventory search of the backpack during Peterson's booking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 19, 2017, at the close of a stipulated-facts bench trial, the district court found Peterson guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Before sentencing, the United States Probation Office submitted a Presentence Report and a Sentencing Recommendation. The Probation Officer's calculation of Peterson's base offense level incorporated, among other things, a finding that Peterson's prior Washington state felony conviction for first-degree robbery constituted a crime of violence under the Guidelines, and a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Peterson objected to the sentencing recommendations, but the district court overruled his objections and applied the recommended base offense level. Peterson timely appealed the district court's denial of his motion to suppress and its application of sentencing enhancements under sections 2K2.1(a)(2) and 3C1.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Peterson raises several arguments on appeal. First, he claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule is inapplicable. Second, Peterson challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court improperly found his first-degree robbery conviction constituted a crime of violence under sections 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2, and\n   in applying a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight under section 3C1.2. We address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Peterson presented sufficient evidence of his ability to post a bail bond in that amount. Accordingly, had the officers arrested Peterson only on the misdemeanor warrants, and had they complied with section 10.31.030, Peterson would have been able to post bail, thereby avoiding the booking and inventory search process altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Peterson's ability to post bail on the misdemeanor warrants, however, has no bearing on whether his backpack would have been subject to an inventory search had he been booked on charges of obstructing law enforcement officers or resisting arrest because bail had not yet been set on those charges at the time Peterson was booked. The district court credited the arresting officer's testimony that he \"absolutely\" would have booked Peterson on obstruction of law enforcement officers and resisting arrest charges had he not searched the backpack and discovered the handgun. During the arrest, Peterson twice broke away from officers and tried to escape on foot. Although Peterson was not charged with these crimes at booking, the district court credited officer testimony that it was standard practice to book arrestees only on felony charges when both felony and misdemeanor charges are available. Because the officers would have booked Peterson on obstruction or resisting arrest charges absent discovery of the gun, and because bail had not yet been set on those charges, Peterson would have been taken into custody upon booking. The evidence demonstrates that it is standard procedure to inventory a defendant's possessions at the time of booking if the King County jail will not accept the item and the arrestee will be taken into custody. The district court did not err in denying Peterson's motion to suppress because the handgun inevitably would have been discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the base offense level for that offense varies depending on whether the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions for a \"crime of violence\" or a controlled substance offense. U.S. Sentencing Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    Guidelines Manual\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2K2.1(a) (Nov. 2015). The district court determined that Peterson had two such convictions under Washington law: (1) first-degree robbery and (2) delivery of cocaine. On appeal, Peterson challenges only whether his first-degree robbery conviction constitutes a \"crime of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review de novo a district court's interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Aug. 23, 2018) (holding that California robbery is \"no longer a categorical match\" under the new definition). Washington's robbery statute therefore is not a categorical match because it allows for a conviction to rest on fear of injury to property alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, Washington first-degree robbery is not a categorical match under the enumerated offenses clause of section 4B1.2(a)(2). We therefore find that the district court erred in treating Peterson's first-degree robbery conviction as a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Reckless Endangerment During Flight Sentencing Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion in applying a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight under section 3C1.2 when calculating Peterson's guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reyes-Oseguera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7654343\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/1481/#p1483\">\n    106 F.3d 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1483 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"We review the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts for an abuse of discretion.\"). This enhancement may be applied if the defendant \"recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious\n   bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer ....\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. \"During flight\" is construed broadly, and includes conduct \"in the course of fleeing,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7654343\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/1481/#p1483\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , in \"preparation for flight,\" and \"in the course of resisting arrest.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 cmt. n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court found that Peterson's actions during transport to the jail were \"very dangerous and created a substantial risk of harm\" to the officers. Specifically, Peterson, who was in double restraints, began violently kicking the windows in the rear compartment of the patrol car. Peterson failed to heed commands to stop kicking and was pepper sprayed. This subdued him only temporarily, however, and he soon resumed violently kicking the rear windows. Fearing that Peterson would kick out the rear window and attempt to escape, thereby potentially causing a collision on the interstate, the officer moved across multiple lanes of traffic to pull off the interstate and reapply Peterson's restraints. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the sentencing enhancement because Peterson's actions reasonably can be construed as being \"in preparation of flight,\" and because these actions reasonably could be viewed as presenting a substantial risk of harm to the officers and others on the interstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Peterson's motion to suppress, reverse the district court's finding that Washington first-degree robbery constitutes a crime of violence under sections 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2, and affirm the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight under section 3C1.2. Accordingly, we vacate Peterson's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The officers testified that Peterson's backpack would have been searched during the booking process, written policies supported their testimony, and the policies were sufficiently detailed regarding the situation at hand. For instance, Sergeant Michael Allen of the King County Jail testified that the arresting agency takes custody of backpacks because the jail does not accept backpacks from arrestees awaiting booking. Consistent with this testimony, section 5.05.001 of King County Jail's General Policy Manual states that intake officers at the county jail shall \"[s]creen all property upon receipt from the outside agencies\" and \"return oversized items,\" like backpacks to the transporting officer for return \"to their department's safe keeping area.\" Detective Clayton Minshull of the King County Sheriff's Office testified that, in such situations, the arresting officer conducts an inventory search to determine whether an item contains perishables, contraband, or valuables and places the backpack into evidence for safekeeping. Minshull's testimony is supported by section 8.05.000 of the General Orders Manual for the King County Sheriff's Office, which provides that, \"[i]tems not accepted by the jail should be inspected by the deputy prior to booking.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Peterson argues in his opening brief that neither section 4B1.2(a)(1) nor section 4B1.2(a)(2) applies to his first-degree robbery conviction. Because the government has not responded to Peterson's section 4B1.2(a)(1) argument, it has waived reliance on the elements clause.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v. Castillo-Marin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882157\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/914/#p919\">\n     684 F.3d 914\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 919 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that the government waives an argument when it does not make that argument at the time it filed its answering brief). Notwithstanding the government's waiver, we have serious doubts that Washington first-degree robbery is a categorical match under the elements clause because Washington's robbery offense includes force directed at property, which is not covered in the elements clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Edling\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/#p1157\">\n     895 F.3d 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1157 (9th Cir. 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
