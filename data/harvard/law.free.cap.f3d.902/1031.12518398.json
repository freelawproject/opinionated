Each plaintiff alleges that, between 2007 and 2009, he or she was cited by Boise police for violating one or both of two city ordinances. The first, Boise City Code \u00a7 9-10-02 (the \"Camping Ordinance\"), makes it a misdemeanor to use \"any of the streets, sidewalks, parks, or public places as a camping place at any time.\" The Camping Ordinance defines \"camping\" as \"the use of public property as a temporary or permanent place of dwelling, lodging, or residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The second, Boise City Code \u00a7 6-01-05 (the \"Disorderly Conduct Ordinance\"), bans \"[o]ccupying, lodging, or sleeping in any building, structure, or public place, whether public or private ... without the permission of the owner or person entitled to possession or in control thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All plaintiffs seek retrospective relief for their previous citations under the ordinances.

According to the Point-in-Time Count (\"PIT Count\") conducted by the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, there were 753 homeless individuals in Ada County - the county of which Boise is the seat - in January 2014, 46 of whom were \"unsheltered,\" or living in places unsuited to human habitation such as parks or sidewalks. In 2016, the last year for which data is available, there were 867 homeless individuals counted in Ada County, 125 of whom were unsheltered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PIT Count likely underestimates the number of homeless individuals in Ada County. It is \"widely recognized that a one-night point in time count will undercount the homeless population,\" as many homeless individuals may have access to temporary housing on a given night, and as weather conditions may affect the number of available volunteers and the number of homeless people staying at shelters or accessing services on the night of the count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are currently three homeless shelters in the City of Boise offering emergency shelter services, all run by private, nonprofit organizations. As far as the record reveals, these three shelters are the only shelters in Ada County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   One shelter - \"Sanctuary\" - is operated by Interfaith Sanctuary Housing Services, Inc. The shelter is open to men, women, and children of all faiths, and does not impose any religious requirements on its residents. Sanctuary has 96 beds reserved for individual men and women, with several additional beds reserved for families. The shelter uses floor mats when it reaches capacity with beds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because of its limited capacity, Sanctuary frequently has to turn away homeless people seeking shelter. In 2010, Sanctuary reached full capacity in the men's area \"at least half of every month,\" and the women's area reached capacity \"almost every night of the week.\" In 2014, the shelter reported that it was full for men, women, or both on 38% of nights. Sanctuary provides beds first to people who spent the previous night at Sanctuary. At 9:00 pm each night, it allots any remaining beds to those who added their names to the shelter's waiting list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The other two shelters in Boise are both operated by the Boise Rescue Mission (\"BRM\"), a Christian nonprofit organization. One of those shelters, the River of Life Rescue Mission (\"River of Life\"), is open exclusively to men; the other, the City Light Home for Women and Children (\"City Light\"), shelters women and children only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   BRM's facilities provide two primary \"programs\" for the homeless, the Emergency Services Program and the New Life Discipleship Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Emergency Services Program provides temporary shelter, food, and clothing to anyone in need. Christian religious services are offered to those seeking shelter through the Emergency Services Program. The shelters display messages and iconography on the walls, and the intake form for emergency shelter guests includes a religious message.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Homeless individuals may check in to either BRM facility between 4:00 and 5:30 pm. Those who arrive at BRM facilities between 5:30 and 8:00 pm may be denied shelter, depending on the reason for their late arrival; generally, anyone arriving after 8:00 pm is denied shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Except in winter, male guests in the Emergency Services Program may stay at River of Life for up to 17 consecutive nights; women and children in the Emergency Services Program may stay at City Light for up to 30 consecutive nights. After the time limit is reached, homeless individuals who do not join the Discipleship Program may not return to a BRM shelter for at least 30 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Participants in the Emergency Services Program must return to the shelter every night during the applicable 17-day or 30-day period; if a resident fails to check in to a BRM shelter each night, that resident is prohibited from staying overnight at that shelter for 30 days. BRM's rules on the length of a person's stay in the Emergency Services Program are suspended during the winter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Discipleship Program is an \"intensive, Christ-based residential recovery program\" of which \"[r]eligious study is the very essence.\" The record does not indicate any limit to how long a member of the Discipleship Program may stay at a BRM shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The River of Life shelter contains 148 beds for emergency use, along with 40 floor mats for overflow; 78 additional beds serve those in non-emergency shelter programs such as the Discipleship Program. The City Light shelter has 110 beds for emergency services, as well as 40 floor mats to handle overflow and 38 beds for women in non-emergency shelter programs. All told, Boise's three homeless shelters contain 354 beds and 92 overflow mats for homeless individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs Robert Martin, Robert Anderson, Lawrence Lee Smith, Basil E. Humphrey, Pamela S. Hawkes, and Janet F. Bell are all homeless individuals who have lived in or around Boise since at least 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, each plaintiff was convicted at least once of violating the Camping Ordinance, the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance, or both. With one exception, all plaintiffs were sentenced to time served for all convictions; on two occasions, Hawkes was sentenced to one additional day in jail. During the same period, Hawkes was cited, but not convicted, under the Camping Ordinance, and Martin was cited, but not convicted, under the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff Robert Anderson currently lives in Boise; he is homeless and has often relied on Boise's shelters for housing. In the summer of 2007, Anderson stayed at River of Life as part of the Emergency Services Program until he reached the shelter's 17-day limit for male guests. Anderson testified that during his 2007 stay at River of Life, he was required to attend chapel services before he was permitted to eat dinner. At the conclusion of his 17-day stay, Anderson declined to enter the Discipleship Program because of his religious beliefs. As Anderson was barred by the shelter's policies from returning to River of Life for 30 days, he slept outside for the next several weeks. On September 1, 2007, Anderson was cited under the Camping Ordinance. He pled guilty to violating the Camping Ordinance and paid a $25 fine; he did not appeal his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff Robert Martin is a former resident of Boise who currently lives in Post Falls, Idaho. Martin returns frequently to Boise to visit his minor son. In March of 2009, Martin was cited under the Camping Ordinance for sleeping outside; he was cited again in 2012 under the same ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho in October of 2009. All plaintiffs alleged that their previous citations under the Camping Ordinance and the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and sought damages for those alleged violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322325\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1118/#p1138\">\n    444 F.3d at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Anderson and Martin also sought prospective declaratory and injunctive relief precluding future enforcement of the ordinances under the same statute and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After this litigation began, the Boise Police Department promulgated a new \"Special Order,\" effective as of January 1, 2010, that prohibited enforcement of either the Camping Ordinance or the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance against any homeless person on public property on any night when no shelter had \"an available overnight space.\" City police implemented the Special Order through a two-step procedure known as the \"Shelter Protocol.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the Shelter Protocol, if any shelter in Boise reaches capacity on a given night, that shelter will so notify the police at roughly 11:00 pm. Each shelter has discretion to determine whether it is full, and Boise police have no other mechanism or criteria for gauging whether a shelter is full. Since the Shelter Protocol was adopted, Sanctuary has reported that it was full on almost 40% of nights. Although BRM agreed to the Shelter Protocol, its internal policy is never to turn any person away because of a lack of space, and neither BRM shelter has ever reported that it was full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   If all shelters are full on the same night, police are to refrain from enforcing either ordinance. Presumably because the BRM shelters have not reported full, Boise police continue to issue citations regularly under both ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In July 2011, the district court granted summary judgment to the City. It held that the plaintiffs' claims for retrospective relief were barred under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and that their claims for prospective relief were mooted by the Special Order and the Shelter Protocol.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

We held that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs' claims under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 897.

The City had not met its \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating that the challenged conduct - enforcement of the two ordinances against homeless individuals with no access to shelter - \"could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 898, 901 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

We noted that, on summary judgment, the plaintiffs \"need not establish that they in fact have standing, but only that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the standing elements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On remand, the district court again granted summary judgment to the City on the plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims. The court observed that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   requires a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff seeking damages for \"harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\" to demonstrate that \"the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal ... or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the district court, \"a judgment finding the Ordinances unconstitutional ... necessarily would imply the invalidity of Plaintiffs' [previous] convictions under those ordinances,\" and the plaintiffs therefore were required to demonstrate that their convictions or sentences had already been invalidated. As none of the plaintiffs had raised an Eighth Amendment challenge as a defense to criminal prosecution, nor had any plaintiff successfully appealed their conviction, the district court held that all of the plaintiffs' claims for retrospective relief were barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   . The district court also rejected as barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs' claim for prospective injunctive relief under \u00a7 1983, reasoning that \"a ruling in favor of Plaintiffs on even a prospective \u00a7 1983 claim would demonstrate the invalidity of any confinement stemming from those convictions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the district court determined that, although\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   did not bar relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Martin and Anderson now lack standing to pursue such relief. The linchpin of this holding was that the Camping Ordinance and the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance were both amended in 2014 to codify the Special Order's mandate that \"[l]aw enforcement officers shall not enforce [the ordinances] when the individual is on public property and there is no available overnight shelter.\" Boise City Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-01-05, 9-10-02. Because the ordinances, as amended, permitted camping or sleeping in a public place when no shelter space was available, the court held that there was no \"credible threat\" of future prosecution. \"If the Ordinances are not to be enforced when the shelters are full, those Ordinances do not inflict a constitutional injury upon these particular plaintiffs ....\" The court emphasized that the record \"suggests there is no known citation of a homeless individual under the Ordinances for camping or sleeping on public property on any night\n   or morning when he or she was unable to secure shelter due to a lack of shelter capacity\" and that \"there has not been a single night when all three shelters in Boise called in to report they were simultaneously full for men, women or families.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440537\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/938/#p947\">\n    306 F.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947 (9th Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In dismissing Martin and Anderson's claims for declaratory relief for lack of standing, the district court emphasized that Boise's ordinances, as amended in 2014, preclude the City from issuing a citation when there is no available space at a shelter, and there is consequently no risk that either Martin or Anderson will be cited under such circumstances in the future. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although the 2014 amendments preclude the City from enforcing the ordinances when there is no room available at any shelter, the record demonstrates that the City is wholly reliant on the shelters to self-report when they are full. It is undisputed that Sanctuary is full as to men on a substantial percentage of nights, perhaps as high as 50%. The City nevertheless\n   emphasizes that since the adoption of the Shelter Protocol in 2010, the BRM facilities, River of Life and City Light, have never reported that they are full, and BRM states that it will never turn people away due to lack space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiffs have pointed to substantial evidence in the record, however, indicating that whether or not the BRM facilities are ever full or turn homeless individuals away\n   <em>\n    for lack of space\n   </em>\n   , they\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   refuse to shelter homeless people who exhaust the number of days allotted by the facilities. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege, and the City does not dispute, that it is BRM's policy to limit men to 17 consecutive days in the Emergency Services Program, after which they cannot return to River of Life for 30 days; City Light has a similar 30-day limit for women and children. Anderson testified that BRM has enforced this policy against him in the past, forcing him to sleep outdoors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiffs have adduced further evidence indicating that River of Life permits individuals to remain at the shelter after 17 days in the Emergency Services Program only on the condition that they become part of the New Life Discipleship program, which has a mandatory religious focus. For example, there is evidence that participants in the New Life Program are not allowed to spend days at Corpus Christi, a local Catholic program, \"because it's ... a different sect.\" There are also facts in dispute concerning whether the Emergency Services Program itself has a religious component. Although the City argues strenuously that the Emergency Services Program is secular, Anderson testified to the contrary; he stated that he was once required to attend chapel before being permitted to eat dinner at the River of Life shelter. Both Martin and Anderson have objected to the overall religious atmosphere of the River of Life shelter, including the Christian messaging on the shelter's intake form and the Christian iconography on the shelter walls. A city cannot, via the threat of prosecution, coerce an individual to attend religion-based treatment programs consistently with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Inouye v.Kemna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949798\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/705/#p712\">\n    504 F.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712-13 (9th Cir. 2007). Yet at the conclusion of a 17-day stay at River of Life, or a 30-day stay at City Light, an individual may be forced to choose between sleeping outside on nights when Sanctuary is full (and risking arrest under the ordinances), or enrolling in BRM programming that is antithetical to his or her religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The 17-day and 30-day limits are not the only BRM policies which functionally limit access to BRM facilities even when space is nominally available. River of Life also turns individuals away if they voluntarily leave the shelter before the 17-day limit and then attempt to return within 30 days. An individual who voluntarily leaves a BRM facility for any reason - perhaps because temporary shelter is available at Sanctuary, or with friends or family, or in a hotel - cannot immediately return to the shelter if circumstances change. Moreover, BRM's facilities may deny shelter to any individual who arrives after 5:30 pm, and generally will deny shelter to anyone arriving after 8:00 pm. Sanctuary, however, does not assign beds to persons on its waiting list until 9:00 pm. Thus, by the time a homeless individual on the Sanctuary waiting list discovers that the shelter has no room available, it may be too late to seek shelter at either BRM facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   So, even if we credit the City's evidence that BRM's facilities have never been \"full,\" and that the City has never cited any person under the ordinances who could not obtain shelter \"due to a lack of shelter capacity,\" there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether homeless individuals in Boise run a credible risk\n   of being issued a citation on a night when Sanctuary is full and they have been denied entry to a BRM facility for reasons other than shelter capacity. If so, then as a practical matter, no shelter is available. We note that despite the Shelter Protocol and the amendments to both ordinances, the City continues regularly to issue citations for violating both ordinances; during the first three months of 2015, the Boise Police Department issued over 175 such citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The City argues that Martin faces little risk of prosecution under either ordinance because he has not lived in Boise since 2013. Martin states, however, that he is still homeless and still visits Boise several times a year to visit his minor son, and that he has continued to seek shelter at Sanctuary and River of Life. Although Martin may no longer spend enough time in Boise to risk running afoul of BRM's 17-day limit, he testified that he has unsuccessfully sought shelter at River of Life after being placed on Sanctuary's waiting list, only to discover later in the evening that Sanctuary had no available beds. Should Martin return to Boise to visit his son, there is a reasonable possibility that he might again seek shelter at Sanctuary, only to discover (after BRM has closed for the night) that Sanctuary has no space for him. Anderson, for his part, continues to live in Boise and states that he remains homeless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude that both Martin and Anderson have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether they face a credible risk of prosecution under the ordinances in the future on a night when they have been denied access to Boise's homeless shelters; both plaintiffs therefore have standing to seek prospective relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Heck v.

As applied to them this statute is in effect a law which bans a single act for which they may not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment - the act of getting drunk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 551,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 2145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (White, J., concurring in the judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The four dissenting Justices adopted a position consistent with that taken\n   by Justice White: that under\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , \"criminal penalties may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless to change,\" and that the defendant, \"once intoxicated, ... could not prevent himself from appearing in public places.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 567,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 2145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fortas, J., dissenting).

As\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   reasoned, \"[w]hether sitting, lying, and sleeping are defined as acts or conditions, they are universal and unavoidable consequences of being human.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322325\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1118/#p1138\">\n    444 F.3d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
