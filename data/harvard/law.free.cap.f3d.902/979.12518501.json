Lucero, also known as \"Lil Man\" and \"Manos,\" shared a twelve-person cell with two codefendants, Armando Lopez, also known as \"Soldier,\" and Paul Lopez. Another one of Lucero's cellmates was the victim and key witness in this case, Kenneth Lindsay, also known as \"Psycho\" and \"Psychs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the day of the attack, Lindsay found and sold balloons containing heroin. According to Lindsay's testimony at trial, Lucero approached Lindsay in the evening and invited him to play cards. After a group began to play, Armando Lopez, Paul Lopez, and Lucero assaulted Lindsay. Armando Lopez hit him in the chest, Paul Lopez punched him in the face, and Lucero kicked him from behind; Lindsay felt a number of other kicks and hits. Several custodial deputies heard Lindsay yell and came to the cell. When they arrived, Lindsay was nonresponsive, and there was blood on the floor and the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, Paul Teso, a sheriff's deputy in a gang unit in Stanislaus County, investigated the attack. When interviewing one inmate, Teso, after directing the inmate to \"lift his trouser legs,\" uncovered a tiny handwritten gang memo inside the inmate's sock. The memo, as later explained by the California Court of Appeal, \"detailed the assault on Lindsay and named those who participated in the attack and provided the motive for the attack-Lindsay's failure to follow the gang's code of conduct.\" The parties referred to this memo and others like it as \"huilas.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the joint trial for Lucero, Armando Lopez, Paul Lopez, and one other codefendant, the huila found in the inmate's sock was entered into evidence in a zoomed-in and redacted form. It was admitted only against its author, Armando Lopez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teso read the huila out:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Okay. It says, \"To Manos from Soldier: RE,\" or reason, \"IR,\" incident report. Date is 10-20-06. Says: \"Buenos dia[s]. Following will consist of removal that occurred yesterday night, 10-19-6, that I assisted in. Kenneth Lindsay, booking No. 1168261, was removed for degenerate acts, use of drugs, heroin, promoting it, and spreading negativity amongst our people.

During this time, we found three balloons of heroin in the interview room. Psychs found two fat bindles. I found one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"After returning from the M tanks back to our cell, I forwarded heroin balloons to my proper channels. Psychs didn't forward the two balloons he found. Instead, he took it upon himself to sell it to the whites on our tier without the permission to do so for his own personal gain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"I seen him dip his finger into both balloons more than necessary to find out if the heroin was chafa, was good, I mean real. Also another\"-it says, \"another\"-I can't read what it says, \"see him indulging on it some more by sniffing it up his nose. I said that Psychs tried to get him to do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"During this time, around 9:30, Psychs was showering, was showing symptoms of being high on heroin and admitted it to me before program shut down.\" Then it's blocked out. It says, \"I was the hitter. After I hit psychs a few times, in the chest area, I went for the neck. I then noticed my piece broke, and I flushed it.a\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Psychs called, 'man down,' and then the K9's arrived. Gracias. Now with that said, excuse me. I excuse myself with strength and honor. ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After reading out the huila, Teso explained that the huila was written by Armando Lopez, or \"Soldier,\" to Lucero, or \"Manos.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Further, Teso noted that gang unit investigators find huilas \"quite often,\" and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Huilas, they use huilas for a bunch or a couple different reasons. The main reason is [to] transfer information from person-to-person from facility-to-facility, from the prisons to the streets, from the streets to the jail, from the jails to the prisons back and forth ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   They're also used as a form of discipline. If somebody violates one of the bonds, one of the rules ... they might have to write an essay on the rule that they broke .... Say they violated one of the rules about security, they might have to write a 1500 word essay in huila form on security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With regard to huilas, Lindsay, the victim, testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: How is it written?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: Usually with hand, pen, pencils. ... Mini writing, usually really small, trying to say a lot in a little piece of paper, try to make it small to secure it so it's more, it's more easy to get from point A to point B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: Now, these-the writings on these huilas, is this shared with the guards?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: In Stanislaus County?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: More often than not guards do get it. That's not the point, not supposed to be caught by the guards. It's supposed to be interoffice. ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After Lucero and his codefendants Armando and Paul Lopez were convicted, they filed a joint appeal. Among other claims, they challenged the introduction of the huila on various state and federal grounds. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment as to all three defendants in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court of Appeal held that the huila's introduction violated Lucero's confrontation rights under\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, at least as to Lucero's conviction for active participation in a criminal street gang,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20186.22\">\n    Cal.

It was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, a preliminary issue: Lucero maintains that we should not reach whether the huila was a testimonial statement. He posits that the government did not argue in the state courts or in the district court that the huila was nontestimonial, and so either has forfeited, or should be judicially estopped from making, any argument as to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The government did argue in the district court that the huila was not testimonial. The district court acknowledged the argument but found it unnecessary to resolve. There was no forfeiture in the federal habeas proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The government did not address the testimonial nature of the huila in state court proceedings. But judicial estoppel against the government with regard to arguments it now makes concerning the Confrontation Clause's inapplicability is not appropriate. One factor in considering whether judicial estoppel applies is whether \"the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p751\">\n    532 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p751\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p751\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, by assuming in the state court that the Confrontation Clause applied, the government did not gain any advantage or impose a detriment on Lucero. Instead, the government made its case more challenging. As no other equitable considerations support the application of judicial estoppel here, there is no impediment to considering whether the contested huila is testimonial.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ah Quin v.

Concluding otherwise would not be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, the gang expert's testimony was that gang members were supposed to have access to\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   weapon at all times, but not to the sort of weapon Lucero was charged with having control over-a \"dirk or dagger or sharp instrument.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204502\">\n    Cal.

And it was reasonable to regard the evidence as sufficient to conclude that a sharp instrument was used in the attack. But, as California courts have made clear, constructive possession, custody, or control is distinct from aiding and abetting a codefendant's control and possession.
