The Prison Officials are entitled to qualified immunity because at the time of Grissom's confinement there was no clearly established law that would have alerted them that his asserted constitutional rights were being violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After being convicted in 1989 of a number of crimes, including the murders of three women and aggravated kidnapping, Grissom began serving four consecutive life sentences. He spent six years in general population until he was placed in solitary confinement in 1996 based on allegations that he was trafficking drugs. (Grissom uses the term\n   <em>\n    solitary confinement\n   </em>\n   . The Prison Officials speak of\n   <em>\n    administrative segregation\n   </em>\n   , a less emotive term. For convenience, we will generally use Grissom's nomenclature.) Grissom remained in solitary at several Kansas prisons-Lansing Correctional Facility (LCF), El Dorado Correctional Facility (EDCF), and Hutchinson Correctional Facility (HCF)-for nearly 20 years before being returned to general population in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is Grissom's second lawsuit challenging his solitary confinement. In his first lawsuit the district court granted summary judgment against him, holding that there had been no constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grissom v. Werholtz\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-3302-SAC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203732895\">\n    2012 WL 3732895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

He later filed an amended complaint expanding on his allegations and adding an Eighth Amendment claim, and then he filed a supplemental complaint adding new defendants who allegedly retaliated against him. The district court considered both his amended and supplemental complaints and again granted summary judgment against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grissom v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-3221-JTM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203130591\">\n    2017 WL 3130591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D. Kan. July 24, 2017) (\n   <em>\n    Grissom III\n   </em>\n   ). For our purposes the amended complaint is the relevant pleading, as Grissom does not raise on appeal any of the additional claims from his supplemental complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This standard arises from balancing two important but contrary interests. On the one hand, \"an action for damages may offer the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees.\"\n   <em>\n    Harlow v.

On the other hand, exposing public officials to liability for damages presents its own \"social costs[,] includ[ing] the expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, perhaps most significantly, \"there is the danger that fear of being sued will dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible public officials, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194865\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/800/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when a defendant has raised qualified immunity as a defense, the plaintiff must establish (1) that the defendant's action violated a federal constitutional or statutory right; and (2) that the right violated was clearly established at the time of the defendant's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomson v.

If the plaintiff fails to satisfy either part of the two-part inquiry, a court must grant the defendant qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

When we say \"on point,\" we do not mean that the precedent has merely stated a general proposition of applicable law. The Supreme Court has repeatedly advised the lower courts \"not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Supreme Court precedent \"does not require a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\n   <em>\n    beyond debate\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The role of an unpublished nonprecedential opinion in this enterprise depends on whether the opinion is being used to show that the plaintiff's proffered proposition is clearly established law or to show that the proposition is unsettled. We have held that \"[a]n unpublished opinion ... provides little support for the notion that the law is clearly established on [a] point.\"\n   <em>\n    Mecham v. Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699896\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1200/#p1206\">\n    500 F.3d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1206 (10th Cir. 2007). But an unpublished opinion can be quite relevant in showing that the law was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   clearly established. If we make the collegial, and quite legitimate, assumption that panels of this court render reasonable decisions, we would be hard pressed to say that a proposition of law was clearly established at a time when an unpublished opinion by a panel of this court said the opposite. To do so we would have to say that the panel's decision was contrary to clearly established law at the time it was rendered. Our assumption does not require us to credit the unpublished opinion as being correct, only as being debatably correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   And there is perhaps a more important reason to presume that an unpublished decision was not contrary to clearly established law at the time. The purpose of the qualified-immunity test is to limit liability to those public officials who are \"plainly incompetent or ... knowingly violate the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). This purpose would be ill served if liability were imposed on an official for conduct that had been held to be lawful, even in an unpublished opinion, by the federal appellate court with jurisdiction over the conduct, at least in the absence of later contrary authority issued before the official acted. Could we properly say that an official was plainly incompetent for taking guidance from an unpublished appellate opinion?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apodaca v.

He was able to use library materials only if he made a written request; his cell was always more or less lighted, even at night; he spent 23 to 24 hours a day in his cell and ate all his meals alone; and visitation was restricted to one hour by video on Saturdays and Sundays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grissom asserts\n   that he has \"suffered significant psychological and physiological injury\" because of these conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   He has become emotionally detached, non-emotive, and bitter.

He placed in the record the forms for 25 consecutive monthly segregation reviews (for December 2013 through December 2015), all of which gave just one reason justifying Grissom's continued segregation: \"Placement facts still apply.\" Aplt.

There is a great hurdle in his path, and he has not persuaded us that he surmounted it. That hurdle is this court's decision in his earlier challenge to his solitary confinement. In\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159044\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/524/467/\">\n    524 F. App'x. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we affirmed the district court's summary judgment (based on its analysis of the\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factors) rejecting his claim that his solitary confinement from June 2005 to the time of our decision had violated his right to due process. In particular, we held that his solitary confinement did not infringe a protected liberty interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159044\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/524/467/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159044\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/524/467/\">\n    at 474-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   True, our prior opinion was not published precedent of this circuit. But, as explained above, even an unpublished opinion can demonstrate that the law was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   clearly established at the time the opinion was issued, at least within the circuit of the court issuing the opinion, and particularly when considering qualified immunity\n   for the same conduct impacting the same plaintiff. The question before us therefore boils down to whether something significant has happened since our opinion was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   One matter of significance would be Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit precedent postdating our prior decision that has now clearly established law that had not been previously so established. But Grissom points to no such recent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similar significance could attach to a substantial change in the facts concerning Grissom's solitary confinement between his prior appeal and this case. We therefore examine whether any of the facts relevant to the\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factors are different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factor is the relationship between the nature of Grissom's confinement and the penological interests asserted by the prison. In his prior appeal we noted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Grissom has been in administrative segregation since August 4, 1996. He was initially placed in segregation while incarcerated at LCF, pending an investigation into his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking at the prison. In October of that year, his status was changed to \"Other Security Risk\" after the investigation found that he was responsible for the procurement and trafficking of contraband drugs at LCF. In December 1996, Mr. Grissom was transferred from administrative segregation at LCF to administrative segregation at EDCF. When Mr. Grissom asked for an explanation for his continued retention in segregation, he was informed of the results of the investigation and told that \"[d]ue to the elaborate method used to traffic [the] contraband drugs, you are considered a threat to the security of this facility if released to general population.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On February 15, 2001, Mr. Grissom's status was changed to \"Extreme Escape Risk\" after prison officials intercepted a letter from an outside source in which the sender indicated a desire to aid Mr. Grissom in escaping LCF once he was released back into general population. His status was changed back to \"Other Security Risk\" on June 6, 2003. He remained in administrative segregation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   On November 25, 2003, while Mr. Grissom was in administrative segregation at EDCF, prison officers found several contraband items, including a cellular phone with extra batteries and accessories, in his cell. He was charged with trafficking in contraband in a correctional institution, a felony. He pled no contest and was placed in disciplinary segregation for thirty days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   On January 26, 2005, while in administrative segregation at EDCF, a cellular telephone was found on the floor near Mr. Grissom during a strip search. He was charged with a violation of Kansas administrative regulations prohibiting the possession of dangerous contraband by inmates. He pled no contest and was placed in disciplinary segregation for thirty days. In February, he was transferred to administrative segregation at LCF.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   On June 1, 2005, while Mr. Grissom was in administrative segregation at LCF, prison officers discovered numerous items of contraband in his cell, including: two cellular telephones, chargers for the phones, sandpaper, razors, a soldering iron, box cutter blades, a screw driver and drill bits. Mr. Grissom pled not guilty to the charge of possessing dangerous contraband. He participated in a disciplinary hearing and was found guilty. He was given forty-five days in disciplinary segregation. A week later he was transferred to administrative segregation at HCF.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Because of the seriousness of Mr. Grissom's three contraband violations while\n   he was in administrative segregation, Defendant Louis E. Bruce, the warden at HCF during that time, felt compelled to develop a more restrictive protocol to manage Mr. Grissom. Mr. Bruce stated in his affidavit that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Cell phones are one of the most concerning devices an inmate can possess. Not only do cell phones permit the inmate to communicate beyond the ability of the correctional facility to monitor him, but an inmate with a cell phone can actually execute an escape plan with those on the outside, which was another serious concern about [Mr. Grissom] possibly attempting an escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159044\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/524/467/\">\n    524 F.

Br. at 20. But we held that those interests sufficed in 2013 (eight years after the last reported incident). And Grissom has pointed to no authority clearly establishing that the underlying facts could not continue to suffice for another three years, until his release from solitary in 2016. Moreover, Grissom engaged in significant misconduct during that three-year period. In October 2015 he propositioned a female correction officer in a sexually explicit note passed to her. The note gave her instructions on how to communicate with him using a nontraceable cell phone maintained for him by an acquaintance on the outside. The warden submitted to the district court an affidavit saying that Grissom's history \"show[ed] a pattern of influencing and compromising staff and other offenders who will supply him with contraband, including cell phones. This type of behavior is one of the primary reasons that he remained in administrative segregation.\" Aplt. App. Vol. 2 at 315. Specifically with respect to the note to the female officer, the affidavit stated: \"I was very disappointed to learn that he continued to try to manipulate staff by attempting to compromise the staff member. Had the staff member responded to his suggestions and put her response in writing, he would have a compromising letter that could have been used as leverage against the staff member.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159044\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/524/467/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to the second\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factor, Grissom argues that conditions of solitary confinement generally are harsh and atypical, but he does not argue that the conditions of his confinement have become more severe since\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grissom III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203130591\">\n    2017 WL 3130591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"the segregation experienced by Grissom is similar to that addressed in\n   <em>\n    Grissom I\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   And regarding the fourth\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factor, Grissom does not rely on any material change in the facts since our prior decision. The reasons he gives for viewing his solitary confinement as indefinite apply equally to the circumstances at the time of his prior appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given Grissom's failure to point to any controlling Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit precedent that would change the established law since his prior appeal, and his failure to point to any factual changes since that appeal that would be decisive under clearly established law, we are compelled to hold that the Prison Officials are entitled to qualified immunity on his due-process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Grissom, who is an African-American, also complains that his placement in solitary confinement violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because he was treated worse than white prisoners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\"No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"). The Equal Protection Clause directs \"that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne v.

To decide whether they should be subject to the same conditions of confinement, it would be important to know the history of their conduct in prison, including the specifics of any infractions they have committed; the criminal offenses that placed them in prison; and even the time remaining on their terms of imprisonment. It is not the responsibility of this court to scour the record to see what information is available on these matters. To obtain relief, appellant's counsel should present the relevant facts in the opening brief and explain why the selected prisoners should have been treated the same. The opening brief in this case utterly fails in that regard. The sole comment on the factual background presented in the argument section of Grissom's opening brief simply states that the district court \"ignore[d] the various facts proffered by Grissom that support his racial-discrimination claim.\" Aplt. Br. at 51. A citation after the sentence directs the reader to the brief's Statement of the Facts, which includes one paragraph that itself falls far short of providing the necessary specifics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Aplt.

And even if we turn to the portions of the record cited by Grissom without further explanation, we need substantially more information to make a proper comparison.

Nothing has changed in our jurisprudence since\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   that would mandate a different conclusion, and thus I join in the judgment reached by the majority. I write separately because it is important to establish that the prolonged term of solitary confinement before us-twenty consecutive years-based on what appears to be marginal justification, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   During much of the twenty years Grissom spent in solitary confinement, he received only rote repetition of the reason for his treatment. Prison officials merely indicated that the reason for his initial placement, suspected involvement in drug trafficking, remained valid. For half the time Grissom was subject to solitary confinement, from 2005 to 2015, he had a single disciplinary report: the control on a hot pot in his cell was set too high. I am disturbed by such flimsy rationale for the extension of the duration of such a term in solitary confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Assuredly, as the majority notes, Grissom is serving four consecutive life sentences for three separate murder convictions. He has no possibility of parole. Grissom was placed in solitary confinement on August 4, 1996. He did not return to the general prison population until December 5, 2016. Grissom spent more than seven thousand days alone in a cell about the size of a parking space. That cell was constantly illuminated with florescent light. The solid metal doors were intended to block out any sights or sounds, and they remained closed at all times. The walls of his cell were required to be kept plain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   During those years, Grissom was permitted to leave his cell for one hour, five days per week, for solitary exercise in an eight-by-twenty foot cage.

In 2003 and 2005 he was discovered with cell phones. And in 2015, he was found with other contraband. From 2005 to 2010, Grissom remained in solitary confinement without further disciplinary issues. In 2010, Grissom received a disciplinary report because a hot pot in his cell exceeded the authorized temperature. Grissom's reports reflect that his disciplinary and management history were \"very good\" between 2010 and 2015. In October of 2015, Grissom received a disciplinary report for passing a sexually explicit note to a female officer. In 2016, Grissom was placed in the Behavior Modification Program, and was later returned to general population. He remains there today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Grissom seeks damages for having been kept in solitary confinement for twenty years on what he describes as \"stale\" and disproportionate justifications. Noting the\n   limited opportunities he had to leave his cell, the majority states that Grissom's argument paints an incomplete picture of his confinement. (Majority Op. 1169-70.) The majority concludes that Grissom was able to communicate with other inmates through vents in his cell, place phone calls, and had the biweekly video visitations noted above. But what the majority fails to appreciate is that the fundamental parameters of his life remained the same. He lived in a cell designed to maximize sensory deprivation. He spent between 23 and 24 hours a day alone in that cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Our society has long understood that extended periods of isolation take a significant toll on the human psyche.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Medley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299147\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/134/160/#p168\">\n    134 U.S. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299147\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/134/160/#p168\">\n    10 S.Ct. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299147\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/134/160/#p168\">\n    33 L.Ed. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890) (\"A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition, from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently insane; others still, committed suicide; while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally reformed, and in most cases did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Norval Morris &amp; David Rothman, eds.,\n   <em>\n    The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society\n   </em>\n   (Oxford University Press 1998) (charting the emergence of solitary confinement and providing discussion of the historical understanding of its risks through modern history).

His reviews lasted one or two minutes. Grissom repeatedly requested guidance as to any steps he might take to return to the general population but was given no useful information. Perhaps most damningly, eight consecutive reviews included the same awkward syntax, providing only one reason for the recommendation to keep Grissom locked in solitary confinement after nineteen years: \"Retain; Placement facts still apply.\" Such a denial of meaningful consideration contravenes our bar on prison officials \"relying on a meaningless, repetitive, and rote response.\"\n   <em>\n    Toevs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901588\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/903/#p916\">\n    685 F.3d at 913-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Given the severe consequences of long-term placement in solitary confinement, such conditions must be treated as a last resort, used in only the most extreme of cases. And even then, prison officials must meaningfully consider on a periodic basis whether solitary remains necessary. There appears to be no evidence of proportionality between the prison's interest in confining Grissom and the length of his solitary confinement. A factfinder could certainly determine that the reviews he received were inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's demand for due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I am compelled to conclude that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   , in which Grissom was before us as an indigent without the benefit of counsel, incorrectly analyzed the\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   factors. The injustice that error has wrought-to wit, Grissom's twenty years of unjustified solitary confinement-is severe. But for our unpublished order and judgment in\n   <em>\n    Grissom II\n   </em>\n   , I would conclude\n   that the appellant has shown, under clearly established law and the facts presented in this appeal, that the twenty years he was forced to spend in solitary confinement violated his due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The description in Grissom's brief does not paint a complete picture of the conditions of his confinement. He was not totally isolated from fellow inmates. Inmates stated in affidavits submitted by Grissom that inmates in segregation communicated by speaking through vents and even played chess that way. In an improper note to a guard, Grissom wrote, \"I'm extremely prudent and that's why I talk so quietly sometimes to avoid nosy neighbors.\" App., Vol. 2 at 374. And Grissom's administrative-segregation-review forms in 2013 and early 2014 stated that he \"continue[d] to mentor inmate Nguyen in speaking and writing English\" and \"continue[d] to help inmate Nguyen with homework assignments.\" App., Vol. 1 at 75-84.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Also, inmates in administrative segregation in EDCF-where Grissom was housed when he filed his complaint in this case-are permitted outdoor recreation with other inmates up to four times per week, weather permitting. They are permitted to use electronic audio-visual devices with the use of headphones, they have telephone privileges from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and they are permitted two one-hour no-contact visits every week, using video equipment in booths within the prison. Grissom lived for most of the time between his appeals to this court in EDCF cellhouse C. His complaint states that cellhouse C is less restrictive than the other cellhouses at EDCF used for administrative segregation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The record shows, however, that Grissom never requested mental-health services. He responded to frequent walk-throughs by mental-health professionals by saying that he was fine and did not need anything.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Our affirmance of the judgment in favor of the Prison Officials does not constitute an endorsement of the conduct of reviews of prisoner segregation status, as described by Grissom. If the description is accurate, the practices are troubling. True, it would be hard to say that the practices violate clearly established law, because the Supreme Court has expressed great deference to the judgment of prison officials and has set only minimal due-process standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wilkinson v.
