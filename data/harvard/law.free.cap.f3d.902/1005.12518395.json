It turned out that McCray's union had negotiated with Marriott and agreed to waive the ordinance's minimum-wage requirement so that it could bargain for other benefits for its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McCray sued Marriott in state court. He says that the ordinance doesn't allow for waiver, and so Marriott owes him the difference between what he was paid and the new minimum wage. Marriott removed the case to federal court on the basis that McCray's claims are preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (the \"LMRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that McCray failed to first exhaust his claim through a required grievance process and granted summary judgment to Marriott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Whether McCray's claims were exhausted or not, the district court was without jurisdiction to hear this case. While we recognize the strong preemptive force of \u00a7 301, McCray's lawsuit amounts to an interpretive challenge to the San Jose ordinance, not one that requires substantial analysis of his union's collective-bargaining agreement. We therefore vacate the district court's denial of remand and grant of summary judgment. We remand this case so that it may be returned to state court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, voters in San Jose, California, considered a ballot initiative that would establish a new minimum wage for most of the city's workers. Under the proposed ordinance, employees would be paid a minimum wage of $10 an hour, subject to cost-of-living adjustments over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   San Jose, Cal., Mun. Code \u00a7 4.100.040. The ordinance also purported to give employers and employees the ability to waive the minimum wage requirements through collective bargaining. \"To the extent required by federal law,\" the proposed law provided, \"all or any portion of the applicable requirements of this Chapter may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement, provided that such waiver is explicitly set forth in such agreement in clear and unambiguous terms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.100.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meanwhile, Ian McCray was employed at the Marriott Hotel in San Jose. There, he performed several hospitality-related jobs, including working as a busser, then later a server, in the hotel's restaurant. As a busser, McCray received an hourly wage of $10.80. When McCray became a server, his hourly wage decreased to $9, but he generally wound up taking home more pay than he had as a busser because of tips he received from customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Throughout his employment with Marriott, McCray was represented by the union Unite Here, Local 19. The terms of McCray's employment were governed by a collective-bargaining agreement (a \"CBA\") entered into between Unite Here and Marriott. Anticipating the passage of San Jose's minimum wage ordinance, Marriott and the union executed an addendum to the CBA, prospectively opting out of the minimum wage requirement. The waiver explained that should the ordinance become law, the \"Employer and the Union, through collective bargaining, have agreed to explicitly waive as part of the parties['] collective bargaining agreement, all provisions and requirements of the City of San Jose Minimum Wage Ordinance.\" EOR 119. The ballot initiative passed, and the ordinance and waiver took effect in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly thereafter, McCray, then earning $9 an hour as a server, spoke with a Marriott human resources employee and a representative from his union and asked why he was being paid less than the new\n   minimum wage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCray was told that the union had opted out of the minimum wage ordinance so that it could secure other benefits, such as healthcare, for its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Apparently not satisfied with that answer, McCray filed this lawsuit in state court in Santa Clara County. McCray seeks to represent himself as well as similarly situated Marriott employees in a class action. His complaint asserts a bevy of wage and hour claims that flow from a single, simple theory: the San Jose ordinance requires Marriott to pay its employees a minimum wage of $10 an hour; McCray and others received less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Marriott removed this case to federal court. In support of removal, Marriott argued that \u00a7 301 of the LMRA preempts McCray's claims and thus jurisdiction to hear this case lies in federal court. The district court agreed and denied McCray's motion to remand. Next, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Marriott. It held that McCray couldn't pursue his claims in court because he had failed to exhaust the mandatory administrative grievance procedure set forth in the CBA. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin with the issue of preemption. The question here is whether the LMRA preempts McCray's state law claims, thus allowing this case to be heard in federal court.

McCray's theory of liability goes like this: The San Jose ordinance establishes a $10 minimum hourly wage. Marriott paid McCray and other workers less than that. The CBA (which governs McCray's employment) purports to waive the minimum wage requirement. But the ordinance only allows waiver \"[t]o the extent required by federal law\"-and no federal law requires the minimum wage requirement to be waivable. So, McCray argues, the waiver is ineffective (no matter what it says), and McCray is owed the difference between what he was actually paid and what the ordinance requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At bottom, this case is a matter of statutory interpretation. The primary task of\n   the court deciding this case will be to determine whether the minimum wage established by the ordinance is waivable. If the court determines it can't be waived, then it's irrelevant whether the CBA contains a waiver. On the other hand, if the minimum wage is subject to waiver, the court will need only \"look to\" the CBA to determine whether it contains a valid waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[R]eliance on and reference to CBA-established or CBA-defined terms of employment do not make for a CBA dispute if there is no disagreement about the meaning or application of any relevant CBA-covered terms of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Alaska Airlines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203636431\">\n    2018 WL 3636431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518019\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/904/\">\n    898 F.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So far, there's been no dispute about the waiver's validity. Aside from claiming that the waiver conflicts with the ordinance, McCray has pointed to no defect in the document itself. This would be a different case if, for example, McCray had argued that the text of the waiver was not sufficiently \"clear and unambiguous\" to satisfy the ordinance or suffered some other flaw that rendered it invalid. But McCray has made no such argument. Since the case he's brought will only require a court to check and see whether the CBA contains a waiver, this isn't a case where a court must do \"more than 'consider,' 'refer to,' or 'apply' \" the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Balcorta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455658,11455531\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/208/1102/\">\n    208 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The degree of analysis of the CBA this case requires isn't altogether different from checking an agreement to identify, for example, an employee's pay rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livadas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/\">\n    512 U.S. at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in many respects, it presents the inverse of the issue in\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   : there, we said that looking at a CBA to see whether it contained a valid waiver didn't require \"interpreting\" the agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3468428\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/491/1053/#p1059\">\n    491 F.3d at 1066-68, 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But that speculative possibility isn't enough to warrant preemption at this early stage.

In\n   <em>\n    Allis-Chalmers\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"when resolution of a state-law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an agreement made between the parties in a labor contract, that claim must either be treated as a \u00a7 301 claim [of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ], ... or dismissed as pre-empted by federal labor-contract law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p211\">\n    471 U.S. at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p211\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Avco Corp. v.

The majority does so on the basis of Plaintiff McCray's theory that we must first interpret the City's ordinance to determine whether it means, as McCray argues, that it can only be waived by some overarching federal law, rather than by a CBA. The majority concludes that because that initial question involves interpretation of the ordinance under state law, the entire case must be resolved in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even assuming that would be a plausible result in some cases, in this case that initial issue concerning interpretation of the ordinance raises no serious question. The ordinance on its face refers to waivers in CBAs; it states, \"all or any portion of the applicable requirements of this Chapter may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement, provided that such waiver is explicitly set forth in such agreement in clear and unambiguous terms.\" And the explanatory material accompanying\n   the ordinance even provides sample language that can be used in CBAs to accomplish a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Federal labor law does not require unions and employers to agree to specific substantive provisions in CBAs, such as a minimum wage opt-out. Federal labor law merely requires unions and employers to engage in the collective bargaining process to reach agreement on terms. They did so here. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   , \"The [National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\") ] is concerned primarily with establishing an equitable process for determining terms and conditions of employment, and not with particular substantive terms of the bargain that is struck when the parties are negotiating from relatively equal positions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208156\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/724/#p753\">\n    471 U.S. 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208156\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/724/#p753\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208156\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/724/#p753\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.

Furthermore, similar opt-out provisions have been uniformly upheld under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Livadas v. Bradshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/\">\n    512 U.S. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131-32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (recognizing validity of state and federal laws allowing opt-outs in CBAs of minimum labor standards). As the Union, UNITE HERE Local 19, points out in its amicus brief, McCray's reading would nullify the opt-out provision altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The essence of McCray's claim is that the employer is required to pay the City's minimum wage. Thus, he contends the opt-out contained in the CBA is not to be given effect. Of course McCray's complaint does not discuss the CBA because he wishes the claim to be litigated in state court, but the District Court correctly recognized that the dispute is actually about the CBA. We should similarly reject the pretense that this case is about state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When state law claims require analysis of the provisions in a CBA, the claims are preempted by the LMRA's exclusive federal jurisdiction. The District Court saw that the issue is not whether the complaint frames the case in terms of the CBA, but whether resolution of the claims will depend on analyzing the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Allis-Chalmers\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 220,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199648\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/202/#p211\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Elec.
