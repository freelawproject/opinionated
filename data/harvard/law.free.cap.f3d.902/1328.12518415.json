Kim Minix represented Mr. Williams at trial. At the time of trial, Mr. Minix was also representing Tyree Bennett, a government witness who was then appealing his own sentence after pleading guilty to federal narcotics charges. Although Mr. Minix knew that Mr. Bennett had been found to have obstructed justice in his own criminal case, he did not ask him about the obstruction scheme at Mr. Williams' trial. In fact, Mr. Minix asked Mr. Bennett no questions whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Williams-represented by different counsel-contends that he is entitled to a new trial because Mr. Minix, due to his simultaneous representation, passed up a valuable opportunity to cross-examine and impeach Mr. Bennett.

The information alleged that the conspiracy, which was based in southern Georgia, lasted from sometime in 2009 to December of 2011. After entry of\n   the plea, the district court appointed Mr. Minix to represent Mr. Bennett at sentencing. One month later, in November of 2013, a grand jury charged Mr. Williams with participating with others (including Mr. Toombs) in a conspiracy to possess cocaine and crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The conspiracy, according to the indictment, was based in Albany, Georgia, and spanned from January of 2010 to December of 2012. The district court appointed Mr. Minix to represent Mr. Williams. The sentencing hearing for Mr. Bennett took place in early 2014. At the hearing, the district court imposed an obstruction of justice enhancement on Mr. Bennett pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 and denied him an acceptance of responsibility adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. These two decisions were based on a letter that Mr. Bennett sent in July of 2013 to Mr. Toombs-Mr. Williams' alleged co-conspirator-asking him to cooperate on Mr. Bennett's behalf as a third party in exchange for a substantial payment, and to market a cooperation-for-hire scheme to inmates seeking sentence reductions. The district court sentenced Mr. Bennett to 156 months' imprisonment, and he appealed. Mr. Bennett's appeal, which was handled by Mr. Minix, was pending in the Eleventh Circuit at the time of Mr. Williams' trial in October of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The joint trial of Mr. Williams-still represented by Mr. Minix-and Mr. Toombs lasted seven days. The jury heard testimony from more than a dozen witnesses, including a number of persons who had been charged with narcotics offenses and were cooperating with the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The evidence presented by the government showed that from approximately 2010 through 2012 a group of individuals-with one Curtis Donaldson at the center-agreed to work together to distribute cocaine to their overlapping customer bases. To further this goal, the co-conspirators took on various and shifting roles in fulfilling the scheme's necessary tasks, including lending money to each other to purchase cocaine from suppliers, making purchases of cocaine, transporting the cocaine to a \"headquarters\" and cooking it there, monitoring for and communicating about law enforcement activity to avoid detection, selling cocaine and crack cocaine, and conducting accountings of relevant financial transactions. Mr. Williams and Mr. Donaldson bought and transported drugs and paraphernalia together numerous times. Mr. Williams acted as a marketer for Mr. Donaldson's crack cocaine, and he once went alone, on behalf of Mr. Donaldson, to deliver an ingredient for another individual to use in cooking crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Bennett, still represented by Mr. Minix, was one of the government witnesses at Mr. Williams' trial. Just before Mr. Bennett took the stand, Mr. Minix, the prosecutor, and the district court engaged in the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MS. McEWEN: Government calls Tyree Bennett, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   MR. MINIX: Your Honor, may we approach real quick?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (Bench conference as follows.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR. MINIX: As the Court is aware, I'm representing Mr. Bennett on an appeal. I was his second counsel, and he's been sentenced. I think we had an agreement that there wasn't going to be any questions that would create a conflict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MS. McEWEN: The government is not going to ask him any questions about Mr. Williams, Mr. Minix's client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MR. MINIX: I just wanted to be sure the government wasn't going to ask him about anything I represented him on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   MS.

In his testimony on direct examination, Mr. Bennett did not mention Mr. Williams by name. But he supported the government's case against both Mr. Williams and Mr. Toombs by directly describing (and by corroborating other witnesses' testimony concerning) the drug-distribution conspiracy alleged in the indictment. For example, Mr. Bennett testified about the general way that a drug-distribution conspiracy operates, about the types and quantities of drugs distributed in connection with the charged conspiracy, and about the roles or duties of certain individuals in that conspiracy. Mr. Bennett further explained that he obtained drugs from Mr. Donaldson, among others. He also said that he had known Mr. Toombs since the two were about 12 years old; that he and Mr. Toombs dealt drugs that they obtained from Mr. Donaldson and others named in the Donaldson-led conspiracy until he was arrested in late 2011; and that Mr. Toombs and Mr. Donaldson continued selling drugs to his customers when he was incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On direct examination, Mr. Bennett made no mention of his letter to Mr. Toombs or how he had received an obstruction of justice enhancement at sentencing. When Mr. Toombs' counsel cross-examined Mr. Bennett, he did not ask about any of these topics either. Mr. Minix declined to cross-examine Mr. Bennett on behalf of Mr. Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The government, in its re-direct examination, posed about a dozen questions to Mr. Bennett concerning the letter and the obstruction of justice enhancement. Mr. Bennett's testimony concluded with this exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   BY MR. HAMILTON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q: So you lost that three level reduction; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q: And that was as a result of a letter that you wrote?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: To Toombs?

That witness testified that Mr. Williams drove her to work each day for several years. Between her direct examination and cross-examination, the witness' testimony spanned just over five of the roughly 1,000 pages in the trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The jury found Mr. Williams guilty of the \u00a7 846 conspiracy charge.

First, at the time of Mr. Williams' trial, Mr. Minix represented both Mr. Williams and Mr. Bennett (whose appeal on the obstruction of justice issue was pending before the Eleventh Circuit). Second, Mr. Bennett testified on behalf of the government in Mr. Williams' trial. So Mr. Minix simultaneously represented a defendant in a criminal trial and a witness for the prosecution at that trial.

James McConico was charged with the murder of his brother-in-law, Ricky Morton, and claimed self-defense. James' wife, Brenda-who was Ricky's sister-retained the same attorney who was representing James on the murder charge to recover insurance proceeds from Ricky's insurance policy. That policy, however, contained an exclusion that denied payment if the death was related to Ricky's commission of an assault or felony-such as what would have prompted James to kill Ricky in self-defense. Prior to trial, the insurance company paid Brenda and the attorney some of the proceeds from the policy. After James' trial, Brenda and her other brother Rodney signed a document releasing the insurance company from any further liability arising out of the insurance claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245085\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1543/#p1546\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245085\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1543/#p1546\">\n    at 1544-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At James' trial, the attorney argued that James shot Ricky (who was allegedly the aggressor) in self-defense.

Mr. Williams argues that the conflict faced by Mr. Minix adversely affected his performance, and his argument proceeds as follows: Mr. Minix failed to cross-examine Mr. Bennett; cross-examination was a viable option, given that, for example, Mr. Bennett left himself open to impeachment based on his post-detention criminal activity, which reflected a willingness to lie to the government; and it would have been impossible for Mr. Minix to cross-examine Mr. Bennett on this matter without both violating his duty of loyalty to Mr. Bennett and undermining his ongoing attempt to obtain a reduced sentence in the pending appellate proceedings (or, the reason that Mr. Minix did not cross-examine Mr. Bennett was\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   that he did not wish to violate his duty of loyalty to him, or that he did not wish to undermine Mr. Bennett's ongoing attempt to reduce his sentence).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11779681\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/839/#p858\">\n    165 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As noted earlier, an adverse effect resulting from a conflict is not the same thing as prejudice in the run-of-the-mill\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mickens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353765\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/162/#p174\">\n    535 U.S. at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353765\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/162/#p174\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/#p350\">\n    446 U.S. at 349-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/#p350\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Freund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11779681\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/839/#p858\">\n    165 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that, on the existing record, Mr. Williams has made out a strong case of adverse effect. Mr. Minix chose not to cross-examine Mr. Bennett and, in the words of\n   <em>\n    Freund\n   </em>\n   , cross-examination appears to have \"possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative\" given the facts that led to Mr. Bennett's obstruction of justice enhancement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11779681\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/839/#p858\">\n    165 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, cross-examination appears to have been \"inherently in conflict with ...

As a result, says the government, there was \"nothing to be gained\" from cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. for the United States at 33. This argument mistakenly applies the general\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice standard to Mr. Williams' conflict of interest claim. What matters is whether cross-examination \"possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Freund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11779681\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/839/#p858\">\n    165 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government's argument also overlooks the fact that Mr. Bennett's testimony helped establish the existence of the charged conspiracy (one of the key elements of the \u00a7 846 offense) and the role of various players in the scheme. Impeaching Mr. Bennett with his obstructive conduct (which involved deception)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   would have at least served the purpose of undermining his credibility (and possibly a portion of the government's case). The government's argument might be on more solid footing if Mr. Williams were required to show\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice, but that is not a burden that he shoulders. The same goes for the fact that the government, on re-direct examination, asked Mr. Bennett some questions about the obstruction of justice enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/#p350\">\n    446 U.S. at 349-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182598\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/335/#p350\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nevertheless, we do not award Mr. Williams the relief he seeks-a new trial-at this time.
