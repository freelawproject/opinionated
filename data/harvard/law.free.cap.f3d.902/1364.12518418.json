A response to the petition was invited by the court and filed by respondent Department of Transportation. The petition was first referred as a petition for rehearing to the panel that heard the appeal, and thereafter the petition for rehearing en banc was referred to the circuit judges who are in regular active service. A poll was requested, taken, and failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon consideration thereof,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IT IS ORDERED THAT :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The petition for panel rehearing is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) The petition for rehearing en banc is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) The mandate of the court will issue on September 7, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lourie, Circuit Judge, with whom Chen, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I concur in the decision of the court not to rehear this appeal\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   . The dissent suggests that we grant rehearing to determine whether the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") violated Justin Grimsrud's due process rights by not producing an aliquot of his urine specimen to him for identity and cocaine testing. Consideration of that question in this case, however, does not meet the standard for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review because it is not \"necessary to secure or maintain the uniformity of the court's decisions,\" and does not \"involve[ ] a question of exceptional importance.\" Fed. R. App. P. 35(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, that Grimsrud did not raise this issue in the petition for rehearing underscores the lack of necessity of\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review in this case. The full court need not reconsider an unraised issue that does not satisfy the standard for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Grimsrud appealed from the Merit Systems Protection Board's (\"MSPB\") decision sustaining his removal as an Air Traffic Control Specialist following a positive drug test. Prior to the events at issue in this appeal, Grimsrud entered into an agency-approved and monitored Treatment and Rehabilitation Plan for alcohol abuse pursuant to which he was regularly screened for alcohol and drug use. In accordance with DOT Order 3910.1D and the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C858\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. 71,858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 25, 2008) (\"HHS Mandatory Guidelines\"), Grimsrud's urine was collected by a trained collector and split into two bottles (A and B). Following notification that Bottle A tested positive for cocaine, Grimsrud asked that Bottle B be tested. Bottle B was tested by a different independent laboratory and also tested positive. DOT removed Grimsrud based on the positive drug test results. On appeal to the MSPB, the AJ sustained his removal following a hearing. The AJ rejected his challenges based on alleged procedural errors in the specimen collection process, negative drug test results performed on specimens obtained at later dates, and his polygraph test for lack of credibility. That is the history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the dissent's suggestion that our precedent, MSPB precedent, and the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Banks v. FAA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461249\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/92/\">\n    687 F.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1982), demonstrate Grimsrud's entitlement to additional testing of his urine specimen for drugs and DNA. We have never held that due process requires such testing. In sustaining the employee's removal in\n   <em>\n    Meza v. Department of Homeland Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665336\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/275/987/\">\n    275 F. App'x 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2008), we noted that the AJ had granted a motion to compel the agency to provide an aliquot of the urine specimen for DNA testing, but the propriety or necessity of the AJ's grant of the motion was not passed on by the panel. In\n   <em>\n    Storm v. Department of Army\n   </em>\n   , while the MSPB recognized that \"an agency's procedural error may constitute harmful error when it effectively destroys, or precludes an appellant from acquiring, the only available evidence by which he can show that the agency likely would have reached a different conclusion in the absence of its error,\" it did not find any such error had occurred.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20M.S.P.R.%2014\">\n    64 M.S.P.R. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (citing\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461249\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/92/\">\n    687 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   96 ). In\n   <em>\n    Ivery v. Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20M.S.P.R.%20119\">\n    96 M.S.P.R. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), the MSPB did not sustain the employee's removal where the agency failed to follow the prescribed split-specimen protocol. It is undisputed that the agency followed that protocol in Grimsrud's case.\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   , which was decided prior to the implementation of the split-specimen protocol, is factually distinguishable, and subsequent decisions demonstrate that no testing beyond that performed was required here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that we should apply\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   , the DOT complied with its requirements in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   , two air traffic controllers contested their removal based on a single positive drug test conducted by a private laboratory that had not preserved the samples for retesting. The Fifth Circuit held that \"due process required an opportunity by the controllers to test on their own behalf to evaluate the accuracy of the government-sponsored tests.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461249\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/92/\">\n    687 F.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In contrast, Grimsrud's specimen was not destroyed, and he availed himself of the agency's procedure permitting additional drug testing of the specimen following a positive result. Grimsrud could have selected any HHS certified laboratory to perform the testing on Bottle B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOT Order 3910.1D, Chp. VII, \u00b6 8 (J.A. 504) (permitting \"an employee with a verified positive ... test result\" to \"request[ ] that another HHS certified laboratory be used, other than the laboratory under contract to DOT for the purposes [of] split-specimen analysis\" to test Bottle B). The parties stipulated that the laboratory personnel who tested Bottles A and B were qualified and followed proper procedures in testing and processing the specimen. J.A. 12-13. Thus, Grimsrud had \"an opportunity ... to test [the sample] on [his] own behalf to evaluate the accuracy of the government-sponsored tests.\"\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461249\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/92/\">\n    687 F.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Due process does not require unlimited testing, and\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   did not hold to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moreover, subsequent case law counsels against applying the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bank\n   </em>\n   s to find a due process violation here. In\n   <em>\n    California v. Trombetta\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that due process \"does not require that law enforcement agencies preserve breath samples in order to introduce the results of breath-analysis tests at trial\" to prove the defendant was driving while intoxicated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n    467 U.S. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The Court explained that \"[e]ven if one were to assume that the Intoxilyzer results in this case were inaccurate and that breath samples might therefore have been exculpatory, it does not follow that respondents were without alternative means of demonstrating\n   their innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Similarly, Grimsrud had \"alternative means of demonstrating [his] innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He took advantage of those means by presenting evidence and cross-examining witnesses at the MSPB hearing, including challenging the chain of custody in an attempt to raise doubt as to whether the specimen was his and \"attempt[ing] to raise doubts in the mind of the factfinder whether the test was properly administered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202648\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/479/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trevino v.

The AJ's rejection of Grimsrud's fact-specific challenges and credibility determinations are not an appropriate subject for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Due process also does not require the agency to make Grimsrud's specimen available for DNA testing. The relevant regulations, HHS Mandatory Guidelines, and DOT drug testing procedures make clear that DNA testing of DOT urine specimens is not permitted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2040.13\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"[A] laboratory is prohibited from making a DOT urine specimen available for a DNA test or other types of specimen identity testing.\"); Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2079%2C462\">\n    65 Fed.

DOT has \"two main reasons\" for this policy: (1) \"a properly completed chain of custody conclusively establishes the identity of a specimen\"; and (2) \"the only thing a DNA test can do is to determine, to a high level of probability, whether a specimen and a reference specimen were produced by the same individual.\" Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2079%2C462\">\n    65 Fed.

Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   even if a DNA test were conclusively to prove the positive sample does not belong to [employee], the DoT could not determine whether the mismatch was due to an error in handling or to the tested employee's substitution of someone else's urine in the original sample, the reference sample, or both. Because a properly preserved chain of custody renders the first possibility very unlikely, and the second possibility would arise only if a guilty employee was trying to defeat the test, the DoT quite reasonably-in view of the risk to airline safety-wants to avoid reinstating a pilot's license on the basis of a DNA mismatch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Swaters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327237,12310510\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/507/\">\n    826 F.3d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has thus upheld DOT's policy of denying the requests of employees who test positive for drugs to obtain the urine sample for DNA testing, including rejecting a due process challenge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327237,12310510\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/507/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 514 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Dist.

The D.C. Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Swaters\n   </em>\n   is persuasive, especially in light of the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Trombetta\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The dissent asserts that this case involves a matter of exceptional importance. While certainly it does involve a matter of exceptional importance to Grimsrud, in the context of a court of appeals deciding whether to rehear a case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   on an issue concerning how many times he is entitled to have his sample retested, and what means will be used to establish that the sample is his, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the decision of the court not to rehear this appeal\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Newman, Circuit Judge, with whom Wallach, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting from denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court has declined to rehear this case, although it endorses a practice that violates due and fair process. Here the fired employee sought to confirm that an incriminating specimen of urine - the basis for his being fired - was indeed his urine. The agency refused to permit the test, but nonetheless implemented the penalty. I write because of the importance of administrative practices on whose fairness public employees can rely. The government's obligation of fair dealings with its employees is beyond compromise. Here the disregard of routine evidentiary process cannot be condoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Grimsrud failed a routine drug test. On learning that his urine tested positive for cocaine, Mr. Grimsrud stated that he never took cocaine. He promptly went to an independent laboratory (LabCorp) for blood, urine, and hair follicle tests for cocaine-all were negative. He passed a polygraph test asserting that he never took cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The DOT fired Mr. Grimsrud, relying solely on the positive urine test. Mr. Grimsrud requested an aliquot of the sample for retesting. The DOT responded: \"The Agency is not in possession of the specimen samples. Upon information and belief, the specimen samples no longer exist.\" J.A.1288 (DOT's Response to Discovery, Oct. 6, 2014). Mr. Grimsrud then moved the MSPB to suppress evidence for spoliation. The DOT then told the MSPB that it \"discovered, upon further investigation, that the specimens do still exist at the laboratories, in storage,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A.1434 (\"Agency Response to Appellant's Motion to Dismiss/Suppress Evidence Based on Spoliation of Evidence,\" Oct. 30, 2014). The DOT then refused to produce the sample for retesting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The DOT stated that Mr. Grimsrud is not entitled to retest the specimen, but is entitled only to the results of the tests conducted by the DOT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Agency Response to Appellant's Motion to Dismiss/Suppress Evidence Based on Spoliation of Evidence,\" Oct. 30, 2014. (J.A.1432) (\"Pursuant to HHS Mandatory Guidelines, Appellant is not entitled to the specimen samples but is only entitled to records relating to the results of his drug tests which have been provided.\"). The DOT also stated that Mr. Grimsrud never filed a formal motion to compel; Mr. Grimsrud responded that he had relied on the agency's prior response that the specimen samples no longer exist. The DOT also stated that the split specimen in Bottle B had been tested by an independent laboratory and that this was all that he was entitled to, pursuant to the HHS Mandatory Guidelines and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2040.13\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr.\n   Grimsrud stated concern about the chain of custody, and argued that he should be allowed to have the sample tested to determine whether the urine specimen (and sole evidence supporting his firing) is actually his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In its briefs, the DOT stresses issues such as Mr. Grimsrud's reported refusal of \"rehabilitation.\" The DOT does not explain its refusal to permit re-testing of the specimen, other than to say that Grimsrud had no basis to challenge the chain of custody and no right to access the specimen for retesting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The question is not whether the DOT can fire an employee who used drugs. The question is whether the DOT procedure, in refusing to permit retesting of the urine sample that was the basis for firing the employee, meets the fundamentals of due process. Precedent has well considered this aspect, and uniformly rejects the government's position. In\n   <em>\n    Banks v. F.A.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461249\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/687/92/\">\n    687 F.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1982), the court referred to \"the most rudimentary standards of due process\" when the test specimens were not preserved and there was no other evidence of drug use:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In the instant case, by contrast, the presence or absence of cocaine in the samples alone determined the ultimate issue. The results of the laboratory tests were the only credible evidence supporting the FAA's charges. While it may be difficult to mark an exact balance between relevance and the attendant procedural burdens in an administrative proceeding, even the most rudimentary standards of due process require here that the claimants have access to the solitary piece of incriminating evidence. Perhaps, the government's failure to preserve and produce such relevant and material evidence might be excusable upon a showing of good faith and reasonable effort. But the FAA's procedures show no attempt to preserve this evidence.
