Information Center argues that Montana's 1994 Revised Implementation Plan did not comply with the Clean Air Act, because the DEQ interprets \"actual emissions\" less stringently than federal standards would allow. The DEQ's interpretation, Information Center contends, carries the force of law. Information Center maintains that Montana's 1994 Revised Implementation Plan was therefore deficient, and that the Agency should not have approved the 2008-2015 revisions until the state definition of \"actual emissions\" complied with federal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Information Center relies on\n   <em>\n    Go v.

But reliance on\n   <em>\n    Go\n   </em>\n   is misplaced in the circumstances of this case. It is well settled that once the Agency approves either an Implementation Plan or a Revised Implementation Plan, that plan becomes federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Committee for a Better Arvin\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 1174.

Thus, the DEQ's interpretation of \"actual emissions\" could not invalidate Montana's 1994 Revised Implementation Plan. And, where the Agency has officially interpreted a vague regulatory term, the Agency's interpretation prevails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auer v.

Therefore, the language at issue is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NRDC v.

We do so here: Where the plain meaning of an Implementation Plan cannot be readily discerned from the text, we think it appropriate to give deference to the Agency's reasonable interpretation. This approach is consistent with the deference given under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   to the Agency's rulemaking authority, and with how we have reviewed the Agency's interpretation of Implementation Plan-related documents.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    El Comite Para el Bienestar de Earlimart\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 696 (\"Because the plain language of the relevant documents is ambiguous, we defer to the EPA's interpretation if it is reasonable, i.e., if it 'sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.' \") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Agency's interpretation of the two-year period immediately preceding the commencement of construction is consistent with the tenor of the regulation to fix a finite period for the measurement of baseline emissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2051.24\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). In any event, we agree with the Agency that Information Center's comment raises a question of implementation of a program rather than approval of a plan. As such, DEQ's statements in the\n   <em>\n    Talen\n   </em>\n   case need not be resolved at the approval phase of the state plan. As explained above, DEQ's policy interpretations do not carry the force of law, contrary to Information Center's contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Committee for a Better Arvin\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 1174 (\"Once approved by [the Agency, an Implementation Plan] becomes federal law, and cannot be changed unless and until [the Agency] approves any change. ...\") (citation, alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). At this point, we are not even sure if Montana will adhere to its interpretation of the plan language at issue should the occasion arise to implement that language. As matters\n   currently stand, Montana still has the option to change course and adopt the Agency's interpretation that \"a 2-year period which precedes the particular date\" means \"the 2 years immediately preceding the proposed change.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20Fed.%20Reg.%2032%2C314\">\n    57 Fed.

As a result, we cannot say at this juncture that the Agency acted arbitrarily in approving the 1994 Revised Implementation Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At bottom, we conclude that the Agency's interpretation of the regulation was a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/#p461\">\n    519 U.S. at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/#p461\">\n    117 S.Ct. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Talen\n   </em>\n   , Montana argued that this interpretation is irreconcilable with the text because the text employs the indefinite article \"a,\" not the definite article \"the.\" Although the Agency's interpretation does incorporate a definite article, the fact that the language is ambiguous, as discussed, gave the Agency leeway to pose a reasonable interpretation of the language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comite Para el Bienstar de Earlimart\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 696.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because the Agency's interpretation of ambiguous text in the 1994 Revised Implementation Plan was a permissible one, and because the Agency's interpretation controlled, its approval of the succeeding 2015 Implementation Plan was not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Committee for a Better Arvin\n   </em>\n   , 786 F.3d at 1174-75.

Accordingly, the Agency's approval of Montana's 2015 Implementation Plan was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and Information Center's comment regarding Montana's interpretation of the language in question raised a question of implementation, better addressed at a different time. As the Agency mentioned in its response to Information Center's comment, \"there are multiple statutory tools that the [Agency] can use to rectify problems with state implementation of its [Implementation Plan].
