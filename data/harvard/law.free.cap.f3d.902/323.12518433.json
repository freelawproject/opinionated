The claim was that they shielded themselves from patient demand for the seller's device by agreeing to deny coverage\n   as \"not medically necessary\" or \"investigational,\" even while the medical community, other insurers, and independent arbiters viewed it as befitting the standard of care. The District Court dismissed the claim. For the reasons that follow, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We base our analysis, as we must on review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, on the allegations in the operative complaint-here the Third Amended Complaint (for convenience, the \"Complaint\"). According to it, cardiovascular disease and disorders are the leading cause of death in the United States. Plaintiff LifeWatch Services, Inc. (\"LifeWatch\") is one of the two largest sellers of telemetry monitors. They are one of several types of outpatient cardiac monitoring devices used to diagnose and treat arrhythmias, or changes in heart rate or rhythm, which may signal or lead to more serious medical complications. An arrhythmia can be without noticeable symptoms; hence the patient may not know it is occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Other outpatient cardiac monitors include Holter monitors, various forms of event monitors, and insertable monitors. All record the electrical activity of a patient's heart to catch any instance of an arrhythmia. But they vary in price, method of data capture, and mechanism by which the data are transmitted to an analyst or physician for diagnosis. For example, telemetry monitors are about three times as expensive as event monitors. They record up to 30 days of a patient's cardiac activity and automatically transmit the data to an analyst center. Event monitors, by contrast, record short windows of data (in some cases no more than a minute), which the patient must then take some action to transmit. Many event monitors also require the patient to trigger the data capture, creating a risk that asymptomatic arrhythmias go undetected. Insertable monitors, which are surgically implanted and less frequently used, are the most expensive; they cost eight to ten times more than event monitors. While the Complaint quotes from medical studies that recommend only telemetry monitors to treat some patients with certain conditions, in other cases telemetry and other monitors are all appropriate treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   LifeWatch brought suit against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (the \"Association\") and five of its member insurance plan administrators\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Blue Plans\"; together with the Association, \"Blue Cross\") for violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It claims the Blue Plans have impermissibly conspired with each other and the Association to deny coverage of telemetry monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Association, which is not an insurer itself, owns the rights to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield trademarks and trade names. It licenses the right to the Blue Cross brand to 36 insurers nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   These Blue Plans are allegedly the largest commercial health insurance group in the country, collectively insuring 105 million Americans, with a national network that covers 96% of hospitals and 92% of doctors. As a group, they are a major purchaser of medical devices and services nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Association maintains a model medical policy that recommends to the Blue Plans which treatments, devices, or services to cover. Each Blue Plan participates in the development of these recommendations by voting on them. A panel of some kind-the Complaint is vague-then meets several times a year to finalize the model policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For more than a decade the model policy has recommended against covering prescriptions for telemetry monitors, explaining that in some cases they are not \"medically necessary\" and in the rest they are \"investigational.\" This provision of the model policy has been adopted in near lockstep\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by the Association's member Blue Plans. Though the Plans' language denying coverage is not always identical, the reasoning is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurers, including Aetna, cover telemetry monitor prescriptions. Multiple medical studies-the Complaint references 10-have reviewed telemetry monitors and found them to be effective, superior to other treatments in some cases, or medically necessary. In at least 20 cases brought between 2010 and 2012 by patients appealing a denial of telemetry monitor coverage, independent, expert review boards overturned the insurers' denials; the review board frequently determined that telemetry monitors were a standard of care or clinically necessary. Blue Plans were parties to several, if not all, of those appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nonetheless, with near uniformity, and for a decade, the Blue Plans have declined to cover telemetry monitors. As a result, LifeWatch claims both its sales and cardiac monitoring treatment in general have suffered. It seeks treble damages for its losses and an injunction under Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 26, which authorize private plaintiffs to sue for Sherman Act violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes illegal \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Blue Cross moved the Court to dismiss LifeWatch's Sherman Act Section 1 claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It argued that the Complaint fails to allege either agreement or anticompetitive effects in the relevant product market, that LifeWatch lacks antitrust standing because it could not show antitrust injury, and that Blue Cross's telemetry monitor coverage decisions are immune from antitrust challenge under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The District Court dismissed for failing to allege anticompetitive effects, and therefore failing to establish the restraint was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    LifeWatch Servs., Inc. v.

In particular, Blue Cross cites the alleged\n   higher price of telemetry monitors relative to event monitors (but lower price relative to insertable monitors) as providing all the Plans an independent basis for denying coverage. Indeed, if LifeWatch had alleged\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   that the Association and the Plans reached the same telemetry monitor coverage decisions\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   multiple years in a row, and that telemetry monitors are more expensive than some other treatment options, Blue Cross might have the better argument. However, LifeWatch also pled something \"more\": evidence implying a traditional conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As an initial matter, the Complaint states that the Association's model policy is set during meetings several times a year, where a panel reviews the votes of all Blue Plans regarding whether to cover particular treatments. As noted, this model policy, which the Blue Plans participate in creating, recommends denying coverage of telemetry monitors as either not medically necessary or investigational. Blue Cross does not dispute this description of the model policy or its creation. Instead, it argues that its member Plans are not bound to follow the model policy; in fact, it explicitly disclaims that notion in its text. Thus, according to Blue Cross, the Plans must make wholly independent decisions regarding which treatments are medically necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This argument apparently misunderstands the nature of the alleged agreement, which is not contained within the model policy's text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   LifeWatch claims instead that the Blue Plans agreed with each other and the Association that they would\n   <em>\n    substantially comply with\n   </em>\n   the model policy. It dubs this agreement the \"Uniformity Rule.\" The Association then allegedly enforces the Plans' conformance with the model policy through audits. If a Plan strays too far from the model, it could face sanctions, including losing the right to use the Blue Cross name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even if these allegations were too conclusory to tip the scales in favor of plausibility, the Complaint then provides a particular example of the Uniformity Rule's enforcement. Highmark initially contracted with LifeWatch to deem telemetry monitors medically necessary and cover prescriptions for them. Under that contract, Highmark covered claims for telemetry monitors submitted both by Highmark subscribers and by subscribers to other Blue Plans; those Blue Plans would then reimburse Highmark in some fashion. However, allegedly under pressure by the other Blue Plans and the Association, it stopped paying for claims from non-Highmark subscribers. As we and other courts have observed, \"[c]oncerted action is established ... [by] proof of a causal relationship between pressure from one conspirator and an anticompetitive decision of another conspirator.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

As noted, according to the Complaint, other large insurers, including Aetna as well as Medicaid and Medicare, cover telemetry monitors as medically necessary. Multiple medical studies reached similar conclusions. In states that mandate independent, expert review of appeals of insurance coverage denials, LifeWatch also funded many costly patient appeals of telemetry monitor denials. It allegedly prevailed in an overwhelming number of cases; the Complaint identifies 20 successful appeals between 2010 and 2012 decided by at least six different independent review boards. The Complaint indicates that many, if not all, were appeals of a Blue Plan's denial. The review boards in several cases determined that telemetry monitors were clinically necessary or a standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to LifeWatch,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices &amp; Prod.

The Complaint asserts several relevant markets here: national and regional markets for the sale of\n   health insurance plans and a national market for the purchase of outpatient cardiac monitors. However, LifeWatch forfeited its insurance-market theories by not fully briefing them on appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Barna v. Bd. of Sch. Directors of Panther Valley Sch.

Patients nationwide suffer arrhythmias that may require treatment with cardiac monitors. Telemetry device firms and other unspecified monitoring-device firms allegedly sell their products nationwide. Insurers on the buyer side that allegedly compensate sellers of cardiac monitors also operate nationally, including Medicaid and Medicare. The Association's model policy recommending that Blue Plans not pay for telemetry monitors is distributed nationally to each Blue Plan. And, as noted, the Blue Plans operating across the country allegedly cover 105 million Americans collectively, purportedly about half of all Americans with private insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, the parties vigorously dispute whether LifeWatch has pled a relevant product market. The focus of the parties' briefing on appeal is whether telemetry monitors compete with other types of monitors. According to LifeWatch,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   outpatient cardiac monitor sellers compete within the same market. The Complaint repeatedly references an \"outpatient cardiac monitor\" market and describes the four categories of monitors that compete within it: telemetry, Holter, event, and insertable monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although its opinion does not say so outright, the District Court seemingly rejected that market when it dismissed LifeWatch's claim. It reasoned that the Blue Plans' alleged refusal to purchase telemetry monitors had no anticompetitive effects\n   <em>\n    among telemetry monitor providers\n   </em>\n   because it treated them all equally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LifeWatch Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274423\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/641/#p648\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Blue Cross argues the District Court implicitly, and correctly, held that LifeWatch's claimed product market was implausible and therefore adopted a telemetry-monitor-only market for purposes of its anticompetitive-effects analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Read in the light most favorable to LifeWatch, however, the Complaint alleges competition among all outpatient cardiac monitors such that they are plausibly within the same product market. All four of the alleged categories of monitors capture the same type of data from a patient's heart. They capture it for the same purpose: to identify and treat cardiac arrhythmias. The principal harm LifeWatch alleges is that Blue Cross is shifting demand to other outpatient cardiac monitors-presumably conduct that would be impossible if the monitors were not interchangeable to some relevant degree. Indeed, LifeWatch claims many doctors have given up prescribing telemetry monitors and instead rely exclusively on other cardiac monitors to treat their patients. The Complaint also quotes a medical study by the American Heart Association recommending telemetry monitors alongside other cardiac monitors to treat certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Undoubtedly the Complaint alleges that certain monitors are less able to function in some areas than others, while others are costlier. It describes telemetry monitors as superior to Holter and event monitors in their ease of use, greater data capture, and ability to diagnose infrequent or incapacitating arrhythmias. It asserts that only\n   telemetry monitors ought to be prescribed for patients with certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Blue Cross argues these allegations are fatal to LifeWatch's claim because they establish that telemetry monitors are not reasonably interchangeable with other cardiac monitors. But differentiation is often present among competing products in the same market. For example, as we have long observed, different brands of cars may compete to provide a consumer's main transportation to and from work-and, depending on the circumstances, they may also compete with other modes of travel.\n   <em>\n    Queen City Pizza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11903544\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/430/#p437\">\n    124 F.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Many machines performing the same function-such as copiers, computers, or automobiles-differ not only in brand name but also in performance, physical appearance, size, capacity, cost, price, reliability, ease of use, service, customer support, and other features.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    Fundamentals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5.11[A]. \"Nevertheless, they generally compete with one another sufficiently that the price of one brand is greatly constrained by the price of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Beyond the question of competition among cardiac monitors, however, there is apparently a more fundamental problem with the District Court's reasoning and Blue Cross's arguments on appeal. The underlying question driving the unreasonable-restraint analysis in a buyer-side conspiracy case is whether the defendants'\n   <em>\n    purchasing power\n   </em>\n   is constrained by competition from other purchasers in the relevant market. Thus, from the perspective of a seller, the interchangeability that matters is for\n   <em>\n    purchasers\n   </em>\n   of outpatient cardiac monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Once again, as LifeWatch argues, the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss. It notes that sellers of medical devices like LifeWatch \"are often small and highly dependent on a limited number of products,\" suggesting they cannot easily change their products or expand their offerings to induce a disinterested buyer to purchase from them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 63. It also plausibly alleges that health insurers are gatekeepers controlling patient purchases in the market. According to the Complaint, it is exceedingly rare for a patient to pay for a medical device out of pocket. It describes in detail the difficulties patients face in obtaining outpatient cardiac monitors not covered by their insurers, including the opaque, costly appeals process for coverage denials and that patients are often locked into whatever health plan their employer sponsors. Thus it is fair to infer that individual consumers do not constrain the Blue Plans' ability to control purchases or purchase prices. The Complaint acknowledges that other insurers like Aetna, Medicaid, and Medicare also fund patient purchases of outpatient cardiac monitors. It also describes the prohibitively high entry barriers to the health insurance business. According to these allegations, only established insurers effectively control purchases of outpatient cardiac monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In this context, we conclude the Complaint plausibly states that the Blue Plans compete with other insurers, but not individual consumers, in a national market for\n   the purchase of outpatient cardiac monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Anticompetitive Effects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Armed with the proper market definition, the unreasonable-restraint analysis becomes straightforward. The Complaint alleges various \"actual anticompetitive effects,\" which, as noted, could include \"reduction of output, increase in price, or deterioration in quality of goods and services.\"\n   <em>\n    Deborah Heart &amp; Lung Ctr. v. Virtua Health, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352523\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/399/#p403\">\n    833 F.3d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Angelico v.

We have held in similar cases that it is \"certainly plausible\" for this sort of agreement to \"unreasonably restrain[ ] trade.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072723\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/85/#p99\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Such shortchanging poses competitive threats similar to those posed by conspiracies among buyers to fix prices ... and other restraints that result in artificially depressed payments to suppliers-namely, suboptimal output, reduced quality, allocative inefficiencies, and (given the reductions in output) higher prices for consumers in the long run.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072723\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/85/#p99\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Indeed, these are the anticompetitive effects LifeWatch claims. According to the Complaint, Blue Cross's concerted denial of telemetry monitor coverage has harmed consumers by reducing demand for and output of more effective devices, by interfering with a patient's choice of medical treatment, and by reducing the quality of cardiac monitors in general. LifeWatch alleges the restraint artificially shifts demand from telemetry monitors to lower quality substitutes. It discourages physicians and their patients from choosing the most appropriate treatment. Further, physicians, who typically do not know which insurance a patient has, are allegedly deterred from prescribing telemetry monitors altogether, even if it is the preferred treatment for patients whose insurance would cover it. They simply prescribe a cardiac monitor that will certainly be covered, rather than risk discovering later that the patient cannot afford a telemetry monitor. And because the restraint reduces current and anticipated demand for telemetry monitors in favor of older technology, it hinders research, development, and innovation in the market for cardiac monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The District Court's reasoning that there can be no anticompetitive effects from a restraint that treats all sellers of telemetry monitors equally rests on a telemetry-monitor-only product market that was not alleged. A concerted refusal to deal with all sellers of telemetry monitors, regardless of its equality, may still restrain competition in the alleged market for the purchase of outpatient cardiac monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The District Court also attempted to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    457 U.S. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). But with our understanding of the alleged product market, those distinctions disappear. In\n   <em>\n    McCready\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff patient denied coverage for psychological treatment brought a class action against Blue Shield health insurance companies and a group of psychiatrists for allegedly agreeing \"to exclude and boycott clinical psychologists from receiving compensation under the Blue Shield plans.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    457 U.S. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
