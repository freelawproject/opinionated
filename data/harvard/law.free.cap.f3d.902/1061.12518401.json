This time, we are asked to consider whether two reforms adopted by the County in 2006 deprived the plaintiffs of vested employment benefits, in violation of the County's contractual obligations, and constituted age discrimination, in violation of\n   California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm the district court's dismissal of the FEHA claim, but conclude that the district court erred in dismissing certain of Retirees' contract claims. We accordingly reverse in part and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of the restructuring of two benefits the County provided to its retirees: the Retiree Premium Subsidy and the Grant Benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Retiree Premium Subsidy\n   </em>\n   . The County began offering group medical insurance to its retired employees in 1966. Initially, premiums were calculated separately for active and retired employees. The County paid a large portion of the premiums for active employees, but retirees paid most of their own premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1985, the County combined active and retired employees into a single unified pool for purposes of calculating premiums. Because retired employees are, on average, older and more expensive to insure for medical coverage than active employees, retirees, if pooled separately, pay higher premiums. By allowing retirees to participate in a single unified pool, the County effectively established a health insurance subsidy for retirees, lowering their premiums while raising active employee premiums (largely paid by the County) above the actual cost of covering active employees as a separate group. For purposes of the present litigation, this benefit is called the \"Retiree Premium Subsidy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Grant Benefit\n   </em>\n   . From 1993 through 2007, retired employees also received a monthly grant (the \"Grant Benefit\") to defray the cost of health care premiums. The terms of the Grant Benefit were set forth in Memoranda of Understanding (\"MOUs\") between the County and its union-represented employees. The monthly grant for retirees was calculated by multiplying an employee's years of service at retirement by a fixed-dollar amount (\"the Grant Multiplier\"). The initial Grant Multiplier was $10, but it increased every year by up to 5%, to reflect inflation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Grant Benefit was established in 1993 after years of negotiations between the County and its labor unions. In return for the Grant Benefit, the unions and the Orange County Employee Retirement System (\"OCERS\") agreed to allow the County to access $150 million in surplus investment earnings controlled by OCERS. The County intended the Grant Benefit to induce employees to retire early, allowing the County to reduce its workforce. The Benefit was funded by a mandatory contribution from active employees of 1% of their gross monthly wages,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as investment earnings from a portion of the OCERS surplus. Under the agreements governing the 1993 Grant Benefit, the County was obligated to \"step in\" if the 1% contribution and investment earnings were insufficient to cover program expenses. In addition, any employee who left County employment before becoming eligible for a Grant Benefit would receive a lump sum cash rebate of his 1% salary contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Retirees attach to their complaint the 1993B94 MOU and the Board of Supervisors resolution formally adopting it, as an \"exemplar\" of the agreements reached between the County and its main labor union each year between 1993 and 2007. The MOU provides that \"[e]ffective August 1, 1993[,] the County shall administer a Retiree\n   Medical Insurance Grant plan for employees who have retired from County service and who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in\" other provisions of the MOU. It further provides that \"[u]pon ... County retirement, an eligible retiree ... shall receive a\" Grant Benefit. Retirees allege that \"[t]he terms contained in the remaining MOUs in effect between 1993 and 2007 ... are materially the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2008 Benefits Reductions\n   </em>\n   . Beginning in 2004, the County negotiated with its labor unions to restructure the retiree medical program, which was underfunded. Two years later, the Board of Supervisors approved an agreement with the labor union that made the following relevant reductions in benefits for retirees: (1) the County would split retired and active employees into separate pools to set premiums; (2) the maximum increase for the Grant Multiplier would be reduced from 5% to 3%; and (3) once a retiree became eligible for Medicare (at age 65), the Grant Benefit would be reduced by 50%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Retirees allege that the County's decision to eliminate the Retiree Premium Subsidy and to reduce the Grant Benefit increased their health care costs significantly. Some retirees cannot afford the increases and have had to abandon their County-sponsored health insurance for plans with lesser benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Litigation\n   </em>\n   . On November 5, 2007, the Retired Employees Association of Orange County, Inc. (\"REAOC\"), a non-profit representing County retirees and their spouses, filed suit challenging the County's decision to eliminate the Retiree Premium Subsidy. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County in the\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   case, holding that the County was not obligated to provide the Retiree Premium Subsidy for the duration of Retirees' lives because there was no evidence of \"any explicit legislative or statutory authority\" requiring the County to do so, and because that obligation could not arise by implication from past practices or the parties' course of dealing.\n   <em>\n    Retired Emps.

While the\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   case was pending, Plaintiffs, on behalf of thousands of retired Orange County employees (collectively, \"Retirees\"), filed this class action, which was assigned to the same district judge presiding over the\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   litigation. The complaint alleged\n   that the County breached its contractual obligations to Retirees by eliminating the Retiree Premium Subsidy and reducing the Grant Benefit, and that the elimination of the Retiree Premium Subsidy also constituted age discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act. The\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   litigations overlap to the extent both seek declaratory and injunctive relief related to the County's elimination of the Retiree Premium Subsidy. But this class action,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , also seeks damages, pleads claims relating to the reduction of the Grant Benefit, and asserts a FEHA claim not alleged in\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   , this case has a lengthy procedural history, including a prior trip to this Court. In 2011, the district court granted the County's motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding, inter alia, that Retirees' contract claims relating to the Grant Benefit should be dismissed because Retirees had not identified any \"explicit legislative or statutory authority\" that required the County to provide the Grant Benefit in perpetuity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While an appeal was pending, the California Supreme Court issued its answer to the certified question in the\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   litigation. In light of\n   <em>\n    REAOC III\n   </em>\n   , we reversed the district court's Rule 12(c) dismissal, concluding that although \"there was no explicit legislative or statutory authority requiring the County to provide the Grant [Benefit] in perpetuity,\" the \"district court should have granted the Retirees leave to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Cty. of Orange (Harris I)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3891442\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1126/#p1134\">\n    682 F.3d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (9th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On remand, Retirees filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). The allegations in the SAC mirrored those in the prior complaint with regard to the Retiree Premium Subsidy claims. With regard to the Grant Benefit claims, Retirees alleged that the County\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   promised to provide the Grant Benefit for life, as shown in the express terms of the relevant MOUs\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   by extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 30, 2013, the district court granted the County's motion to dismiss the SAC. The court dismissed the contract claims relating to the Grant Benefit with prejudice \"because there is no explicit legislative or statutory authority requiring the County to provide the retirement benefits associated with the Grant,\" and because \"the minimal changes made in the[ ] SAC still fail to address the problems previously identified by this Court and the Ninth Circuit.\" The FEHA claim was dismissed as well, on the ground that \"Plaintiffs have provided no legal authority that FEHA prohibits this action\" - splitting the premium pool into separate retiree and active pools - \"which is based on retirement status and is facially neutral to age.\" But because the application of FEHA in this context was a \"somewhat murky area of law[,]\" the district court granted leave to amend that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Less than a month later, another panel of this Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sonoma Cty.

Noting that the district court in that case \"did not have the benefit of\" the California Supreme Court's answer to the certified question in the\n   <em>\n    REAOC\n   </em>\n   litigation - \"that a public entity in California can be bound by an implied term in a written contract under specified circumstances\" - this Court reversed the dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   complaint so that the retirees could attempt \"to plausibly allege that the County\n   used resolutions or ordinances to ratify or approve MOUs that created contracts for healthcare benefits and included implied terms vesting those benefits for perpetuity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540725\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/1109/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540725\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/1109/\">\n    at 1119-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   briefly discussed the\n   <em>\n    Harris I\n   </em>\n   appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   , Retirees moved for reconsideration of the district court's January 30, 2013 order dismissing the SAC, asserting that\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   made clear that \"retired county employees could premise claims to vested retirement health benefits on an implied contract theory, supporting their claim to vesting solely ... by extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent.\" The district court denied the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Retirees then filed a Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\"), reasserting all claims, and the County again moved to dismiss the complaint. At the hearing on the County's motion, Retirees described and offered to submit additional evidence purporting to show that the County's reason for eliminating the Retiree Premium Subsidy was based on Retirees' age. The district court, taking the proffered evidence into account, once more dismissed the contract-based claims for the reasons given in the January 30, 2013 order. The court also dismissed the FEHA claim, this time with prejudice, concluding \"that 'splitting the pool' between retired employees and active employees is not actionable age discrimination under FEHA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Retirees moved for reconsideration, seeking leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that included the evidence they had described at the hearing regarding the motion to dismiss the TAC. The district court denied the motion, stating that it had already considered the new allegations and evidence presented at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After judgment was entered in favor of the County on all claims, Retirees timely appealed. The appeal challenges the dismissal of three categories of claims: (1) contract claims related to the reduction of the Grant Benefit; (2) contract claims related to the elimination of the Retiree Premium Subsidy; and (3) the FEHA claim related to the elimination of the Retiree Premium Subsidy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    REAOC V\n   </em>\n   directly addressed the second set of claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071512\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1137/\">\n    742 F.3d at 1142-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This allegation suffices to meet the first two elements of\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   's first requirement. Retirees further allege that they \"had an implied contractual right to receive the Grant Benefit ... throughout their retirement.\" In support, the TAC makes specific allegations regarding the basis for this implied right, including allegations regarding the course of negotiations for the Grant Benefit. Retirees' allegations plausibly support the conclusion that the County impliedly promised a lifetime benefit, which could not be unilaterally eliminated or reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, as evidence that the Grant Benefit was part of a bargained-for exchange, Retirees point to the agreement allowing the County to access $150 million in disputed surplus investment earnings controlled by OCERS. Retirees allege that the County \"estimated in 1993 that the mechanism as arranged and implemented,\" including the $150 million OCERS fund and the 1% wage contribution, \"would cover the costs of the Grant program for at least 30 years.\" The establishment of a long-term funding mechanism, including the commitment of a large sum of money that could have been used for other purposes, undermines the County's contention that there was no promise to provide the Grant Benefit beyond the duration of any single one-year MOU. The logical extension of the County's argument is that it could have terminated the Grant Benefit in 1994, notwithstanding the receipt of the $150 million OCERS funds, an inference considerably less plausible than the converse inference - that the commitment of the OCERS funds indicates a continuing obligation, and so refutes the County's year-by-year description of its obligation. The complaint thus contains, at a minimum, sufficient \"factual content [to] allow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference\" that the County promised to provide the benefit for a longer term than the period covered by each MOU.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, that active employees were required to contribute 1% of their wages to fund the Grant Benefit supports the notion that the parties intended the benefit to be available for employees throughout their retirements, rather than eliminated or reduced before employees could fully benefit from their earlier contributions. This understanding is strongly reinforced by the MOU's rebate provision, which allowed active employees to recoup any wages they contributed if they separated from County service before becoming eligible to receive the Grant Benefit. The rebate provision suggests that the contributions made by active employees were tied to future eligibility for the Grant Benefit, constituting a form of deferred compensation assured to those employees who continued working until they became eligible for retirement. To reduce the benefit during the retirements of the same employees who had funded it breaches that implicit commitment. The SAC thus sufficiently alleges that the County \"entered into a contract that included implied terms providing healthcare benefits to retirees that vested for perpetuity.\"\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540725\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/1109/\">\n    708 F.3d at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    Sonoma\n   </em>\n   requires, finally, that Retirees allege that\n   the County \"created that contract by ordinance or resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The County does not, among retirees, charge more to older than younger retirees. From the outset, the County treated employees differently from retirees for purposes of medical benefits, most notably by paying for most of the medical benefits of active employees but requiring retired employees to pay for most of their own, with some help from the Grant Benefit. That fundamental differentiation has not been challenged here - not surprisingly, as, under California law, retirees need not be provided medical benefits at all. By adopting the split-roll for the purpose of calculating premiums for medical insurance, the County was simply following through on its determination that already retired persons, who have ceased providing any services to the County, are a separate \"force\" - in\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   terms - from the \"force\" of active employees. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   prohibits considering retirees as a separate group for purposes of calculating the cost of benefits, and making cost determinations related to that separate group on the basis of the age of the cohort as a whole - just as employee medical plans can calculate the\n   <em>\n    equal\n   </em>\n   premiums charged to every active individual employee by actuarially taking into account the age and gender distribution of all active employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Retirees have not cited any case to the contrary.

Actually retired workers who are not working and not seeking to work are simply not similarly situated to the County's active employees as to whom they seek equal treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Under California law, public employees need not provide retired employees medical benefits. Here, the County has chosen to provide some access to retiree medical care, albeit on different terms, and at different premium rates from those applicable to active employees. Active employees eligible for retirement - a substantial number of whom are older than many retirees - receive the medical benefits paid by other active employees, without regard to age. Under these circumstances, calculating the rates charged to retirees separately from those applicable\n   to active employees, taking into account the higher medical costs of the older cohort of retirees, does not constitute impermissible discrimination against the retirees based on age. The overall distinction between the medical plans covering active employees and retirees is, under\n   <em>\n    Hazen\n   </em>\n   , not itself discrimination based on age, and calculating the rate charged every retiree, regardless of age, by taking average age into account is not, under\n   <em>\n    Manhart\n   </em>\n   , discrimination against any individual retiree based on a protected category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In short, where employers are not required to provide post-retirement benefits\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , and particularly where retirees as a force are covered by separate benefit terms, the County does not violate the FEHA by treating retirees as a separate force and making cost calculations accordingly, taking into account the age distribution of the retiree group as a whole.
