On appeal, Kechedzian contends that the district court erred by: (1) refusing to dismiss a prospective juror for bias where the juror never unequivocally stated she could be fair and impartial; (2) allowing certain expert testimony; (3) allowing a prosecutor to improperly cross-examine him; (4) failing to adequately rule on his objections to the presentence report; and (5) imposing restitution. Although issues two through four are troubling, we will not reach them because we reverse on the basis of the first issue, concluding that the challenged juror should have been excused for cause under an actual bias theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual and procedural background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving a tip that Kechedzian was linked to a fugitive operating a large credit card fraud ring, federal agents conducted a trash pull from Kechedzian's residence. In his trash, they found two counterfeit credit cards and, based on this, the agents obtained a search warrant. The resulting search of Kechedzian's residence and cars uncovered two USB drives containing 1,451 stolen credit card numbers in text files, a Bluetooth-enabled \"skimming device\" commonly used to steal credit card information from gas station pumps, and several cards with stolen data re-encoded on the magnetic strips. Bank records revealed that many of the stolen card numbers had been used fraudulently at gas stations and other retail establishments across the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A grand jury returned a four-count indictment, charging Kechedzian with two counts of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201029\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and two counts of aggravated\n   identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the beginning of jury selection, the district court read a general statement of the case, laying out the charges against Kechedzian. It then asked: \"[D]oes anyone feel, just based on the charges in this case, based on what this case is about, that they could not be fair and impartial to both sides? Does anyone feel that way at this point in time?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Juror # 3 (Juror Rose) raised her hand and had the following colloquy with the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   JUROR # 3: Yes. ... [A]bout five years ago I had ... my social security number [stolen.] ... I might be able to put that aside and just go by what I hear here in the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: \"Might\" is a significant word. Let's follow up with it a little bit. Obviously you couldn't be a juror on the person who stole your identity and social security card. You'd be a bit upset-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   JUROR # 3: Absolutely not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: You would be quite upset about that. But I guess the question becomes not just maybe. We need to know whether or not you are going to decide this case based on what happened to you and your social security number. What do you think?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   JUROR # 3: Well, I would want to put my personal stuff aside, but I honestly don't know if I could.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: So will you tell us if you can't, if all of a sudden you go through this case and you say you know what? My social security number is popping up in my head, and I'm going to decide this case based on what happened to me? Would you tell us that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   JUROR # 3: No, I would try to be fair ... and put my personal experience aside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: But if it turns out you're going through this process and you feel you can't-it's not working, would you tell us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   JUROR # 3: Yes, I would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after this interaction with Juror # 3, the court asked all jurors the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The first principle, as Mr. Kechedzian sits there at counsel table, he is presumed to be innocent. Second, the defense doesn't have to prove anything in this case, does not have to present any evidence. Next, the government has the burden of proof in this case, and that is to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Does everybody understand those principles and could follow those principles? Raise your hand if you at this point are of the mindset that you could not follow those principles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Juror # 3 did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Later, at sidebar, defense counsel sought to have Juror # 3 excused for cause, stating: \"I'm concerned that No. 3 did not answer your question ... about whether she could ... put ... this social security theft five years ago out of her mind. She said she might be able to. I don't think that's sufficient. So I would challenge [her].\" The district court denied the motion, stating \"I think at the end of the day she confirmed or committed to the principles of the presumption of innocence and burden of proof. I would deny [the motion] as to 3.\" Juror # 3 sat on Kechedzian's jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury ultimately returned a guilty verdict, and Kechedzian was sentenced to 65 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. The district court also ordered $114,134.76 in restitution. Kechedzian timely appealed, arguing that he is entitled to a new trial or, in the\n   alternative, that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Kechedzian contends that Juror # 3 should have been disqualified because of both actual bias and implied bias. Rulings on actual bias are reviewed for manifest error or abuse of discretion, because the determination of impartiality may be based on the district court's evaluation of a prospective juror's demeanor.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Unlike Juror Austin, Juror # 3 never affirmatively stated that she could be impartial. In fact, Juror # 3 was asked three times-the same number of times as Juror Camacho in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   -if she could be impartial. And each time, she replied equivocally: (1) \"I might be able to put that aside\"; (2) \"I would want to put my personal stuff aside, but I honestly don't know if I could\"; and (3) \"I would try to be fair.\" Likewise, we reject any argument that Juror # 3's final response-\"I would try to be fair\"-is an unequivocal statement of impartiality. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , a response of \"I'll try\" is not an unequivocal statement.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974261\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/1109/#p1112\">\n    214 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1113 n.5 (\"Despite the government's best efforts to characterize the response 'I'll try' as unequivocal, we cannot agree .... If a parent asks a teenager whether he will be back before curfew, that parent is highly unlikely to find 'I'll try' an adequate, satisfactory, or unequivocal response.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Government next suggests that Juror # 3 is more akin to Juror Kenny in\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   than Juror Camacho in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , because the colloquy here resembles the \"curative\" questioning of Juror Kenny. Not so. Juror Kenny was ultimately asked if she could \"set aside [her] feelings, and act impartially and fairly to both sides of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413378\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/1477/\">\n    48 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1483 n.2.

In fact, not only were all of Juror # 3's responses equivocal, but she explicitly noted that she was unsure if she could put her personal biases aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As previously noted, we find this case to be more like\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   . For example, like Juror Camacho in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , Juror # 3 was asked three times if she could remain impartial. And like Juror Camacho, Juror # 3 responded equivocally each time. The Government nonetheless attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   by highlighting two differences. For the following reasons, we conclude that these differences do not compel a different result than the one we reached in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the Government notes the following exchange between the district judge and Juror # 3:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   COURT: But if it turns out you're going through this process and you feel you can't-it's not working, would you tell us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   JUROR # 3: Yes, I would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   COURT: Okay. All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Government suggests that this answer-\"Yes, I would\"-was an \"unqualified affirmative\" statement of impartiality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974261\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/1109/#p1112\">\n    214 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a juror's ultimate \"answer with an unqualified affirmative or negative\" is \"appropriate for purposes of indicating ... ability to serve impartially\"). We disagree. The question that Juror # 3 was answering was if she would let the district judge know (after the trial began) if \"it's not working\"; she was not affirming that she would be impartial. This is especially important when viewed in context. Here, when asked if she could be fair and impartial, Juror # 3 not only repeatedly answered equivocally, but she explicitly expressed doubt that she could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, there was nothing particularly curative about this arrangement (in which Juror # 3 was to tell the judge later if she felt biased). Juror # 3 noted she would let the court know if she was feeling that \"it\" was \"not working.\" What this exactly means-and when and how she would communicate this to the judge-is largely unclear. And this arrangement provided no assurance that Juror # 3 would-or could-actually put aside her prejudices, let alone speak up once trial began. That the Government does not cite any authority to support this type of arrangement is unsurprising; putting the onus on a juror to speak up, after a trial starts, undermines the very purpose of voir dire and its indispensable role in preserving for the accused an impartial jury. Indeed, part of the reason voir dire is conducted before the presentation of evidence is to isolate a prospective juror's biases from what they hear at trial. Especially given the investment jurors feel in their role and their commitment to seeing the process through, it seems unrealistic to expect that a juror could fairly make constant assessments of whether her feelings towards the accused were the justifiable consequence of the evidence presented so far or due to her earlier life experiences. Ultimately, voir dire is one of the \"important mechanism[s] for ensuring impartiality,\"\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714329\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/970/\">\n    151 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   973 ; this type of arrangement is an unacceptable substitute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A second difference noted by the Government is that, here, the district judge asked the entire venire if they could follow the principles of presumption of innocence and burden of proof. No prospective juror-including Juror # 3-responded by saying they could not. According to the Government, Juror # 3's failure to respond to this question suggests that she was committed to deciding the case impartially. Again, we disagree. That Juror # 3 failed to speak up does not indicate that she could be impartial, nor did this interaction amount to a curative instruction. Presumption of innocence and the burden of proof are distinct legal principles from impartiality. A juror can understand the presumption of innocence and burden of proof, yet still let personal prejudice infect her ability to be impartial. In sum, although there are some factual differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , none are of consequence because, at bottom, Juror # 3's statements do not provide any assurance that she was, or could have been, impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   IV.
