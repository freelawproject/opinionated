The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") concluded that Diaz was removable because he made a false claim of United States citizenship to obtain private employment, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). The BIA dismissed Diaz's appeal, writing that \"an alien who represents himself as a citizen on a Form I-9 to secure employment with a private employer has falsely represented himself for a purpose or benefit under the Act.\" There is no basis in the record for concluding that Diaz \"represent[ed] himself as a citizen on a Form I-9.\" Because we conclude that removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) because of a false representation for a \"purpose or benefit\" under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a must be based on such a representation on a Form I-9, we grant Diaz's petition for review and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Diaz is a native and citizen of Mexico. In July 2013, he was served a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\"), alleging illegal entry into the United States on or about September 15, 1993. The NTA charged four grounds of removal: (1) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i), for being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled, or for having arrived in the United States at a \"time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General\"; (2) under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), for \"falsely represent[ing]\" himself to be a citizen of the United States for a \"purpose or benefit\" under federal or state law; (3) under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude; and (4) under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), for seeking to procure a benefit under the INA \"by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Diaz conceded before an IJ that he was removable under the first ground, but denied removability under the others. The IJ held that Diaz was removable under the first and second charges-unlawful entry and false claim of citizenship. The IJ refused to sustain the third charge-conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. Finally, the IJ wrote that it \"necessarily follow[ed]\" from the second charge that Diaz was inadmissible under the fourth\n   charge-fraudulent or willful misrepresentation for a benefit under the INA. The IJ denied Diaz's application for voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Diaz appealed to the BIA, contending that the IJ had erred in concluding that he was removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) for making a false representation of citizenship for a purpose or benefit under state or federal law. The BIA dismissed Diaz's appeal. It wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Diaz's] sole contention is that he is not removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(ii), inasmuch as a false claim to United States citizenship to obtain employment does not fall with[in] the statute. However, the Board held subsequent to the hearing that an alien who represents himself as a citizen on a Form I-9 to secure employment with a private employer has falsely represented himself for a purpose or benefit under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20437\">\n    26 I&amp;N Dec. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2014).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The BIA noted that the IJ had not sustained the third charge, and concluded that the IJ had not ruled on the fourth charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Diaz's only contention before us is that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ's decision that he was removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). He concedes that he is removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (unlawful entry). However, his petition is not moot because different and more severe consequences flow from being found removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) (false claim of citizenship).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The section of the INA at issue,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Any alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter (including section 1324a of this title) or any other Federal or State law is inadmissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before the IJ and in his brief to the BIA, Diaz principally argued that private employment is not a \"purpose or benefit\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). Diaz also argued to the BIA, in the alternative, that a false representation of citizenship under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) for the purpose of obtaining private employment requires that the representation be made \"under penalty of perjury\" on a \"designated or established\" form, as provided under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b)(2). As described above, the BIA responded that \"an alien who represents himself as a citizen on a Form I-9 to secure employment with a private employer has falsely represented himself for a purpose or benefit under the Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Diaz makes both arguments to us. We discuss them in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Private Employment as a \"Purpose or Benefit\" under the INA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Diaz argues that private employment is not a \"purpose or benefit\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) referred only to a \"purpose or benefit under ... Federal or State law,\" we would conclude that \"purpose or benefit\" does not include private employment. However, \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) contains an additional clause-\"(including section 1324a of this title)\"-specifying a particular \"purpose or\n   benefit\" that would not otherwise have been within the scope of the statute. \"[S]ection 1324a of this title\" refers to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a, entitled \"Unlawful employment of aliens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 1324a makes it unlawful to knowingly hire an \"unauthorized alien.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(1)(A). An \"unauthorized alien\" is an alien who at the time of employment is neither lawfully admitted for permanent residence nor authorized to work in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1324a(h)(3).

Section 1324a covers federal employment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(7), but its principal concern is private employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We conclude that by specifically referencing \u00a7 1324a in the text of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), Congress expressed an intent to make private employment a qualifying \"purpose or benefit.\" In so concluding, we join other circuits that have reached the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552590\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/773/#p777\">\n    519 F.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that \"the explicit reference to \u00a7 1324a in \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) indicates that private employment is a 'purpose or benefit' of the Act\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dakura v.

The BIA also so concluded in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20437\">\n    26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (BIA 2014), holding that \"an alien who represents himself as a citizen on a Form I-9 to secure employment with a private employer has falsely represented himself for a purpose or benefit under the Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B. False Representation of Citizenship under \u00a7 1324a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Diaz further argues that even if private employment qualifies as a \"purpose or benefit,\" he has not made a false representation of citizenship for purposes of \u00a7 1324a. Section 1324a(b)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Individual attestation of employment authorization\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The individual [seeking employment] must attest, under penalty of perjury on the form designated or established for purposes of paragraph (1), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien who is authorized under this chapter or by the Attorney General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment. Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or an electronic signature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b)(2). No other subsection of \u00a7 1324a imposes an obligation on a person seeking employment, and no other subsection refers to a representation of citizenship. Diaz argues that he is removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) only if he made a false representation of citizenship on \"the form designated or established\" under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2). For the reasons that follow, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1. Exhaustion Before the BIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before reaching the merits of Diaz's argument, we must determine whether he has \"exhausted all administrative remedies available ... as of right.\"\n   <em>\n    Puga v.

In his brief to the BIA, he contested his removability under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), writing, \"[T]he purpose of this legal brief is to determine if the respondent's false claim to U.S. Citizenship for employment makes him inadmissible and hence, removable.\" Diaz principally argued that private employment was not a \"purpose or benefit\" within the meaning of the section. However, he also pointed out that \"the purpose of [ \u00a7 1324a ] is to make it: '... unlawful for a person or other entity to hire ... an alien, knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien.' This applies only to employers, not to unlawful aliens.\" He specifically noted that \u00a7 1324a(b)(2)\"is the only wording in section [1324a] that places any liability on an unauthorized alien.\" Diaz did not make the precise argument we now consider, but he gave the BIA an adequate opportunity to pass on the issue. We therefore consider the argument on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2. False Representation of Citizenship\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 1324a(b)(2) requires a person seeking employment to attest to United States citizenship on \"the form designated or established\" for that purpose. Diaz argues that an alien can make a false representation of citizenship under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2) only by making the false representation on that form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.

To qualify \"under\" a statutory provision, the regulated person or act must satisfy the criteria specified by the provision. For example, to be \"inadmissible under\" \u00a7 1182, an alien must fit within one of the described classes of inadmissible aliens. Similarly, to be \"unlawful under the laws of the place\" where an activity is committed, the activity must be prohibited by the terms of a law of the local jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zumel v.

The question is whether making a false representation on a Form I-9 is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   false representation of citizenship to procure private employment that qualifies as a false representation under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We are assisted in answering the question by the BIA's decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bett\n   </em>\n   , where the BIA held that \"an alien who represents himself as a citizen\n   <em>\n    on a Form I-9\n   </em>\n   to secure employment with a private employer has falsely represented himself for a purpose or benefit under the Act.\" 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 440 (emphasis added). In support of its conclusion, the BIA cited four decisions from different circuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Three of them were the decisions cited above, all of which addressed private employment obtained through a false representation of citizenship on a Form I-9.\n   <em>\n    See Ferrans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kechkar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The fourth was\n   <em>\n    Castro v.

The\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   court concluded, \"There is no question that \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) encompasses false claims of U.S. citizenship made during the employment eligibility verification process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873347\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873347\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/356/\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, in its\n   <em>\n    Bett\n   </em>\n   opinion, which contains a thorough discussion of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), the BIA sustained the charge against Bett based only on his false representation of citizenship on a Form I-9. Bett had also presented an altered social security card as part of his application for employment, but the BIA considered this irrelevant. Although the altered card could be considered in assessing Bett's credibility, the BIA concluded that \"altered social security cards are not evidence of a false claim to citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    Bett\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 443.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We are further assisted by the legislative history of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), which reflects a narrow focus on false representations under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2). The reference to \u00a7 1324a was added as an amendment to \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) to penalize false attestations of citizenship under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2). 142 Cong. Rec. 10,030 (1996). Senator Alan Simpson explained that he introduced the amendment in response to the \"obvious weakness\" of the attestation system, namely, \"the potential for false claims of citizenship\" by persons seeking employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Senator Simpson, the amendment addressed this weakness by \"creating a new disincentive for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship, which will be a new ground of exclusion and of deportation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Considering the language of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), the BIA's decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bett\n   </em>\n   , and the legislative history, we conclude that an alien can violate \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) by a false representation of citizenship for the \"purpose or benefit\" of obtaining private employment under \u00a7 1324a only when such a representation is made under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2) on a Form I-9. We emphasize that while a false representation of citizenship for a purpose or benefit under \u00a7 1324a must be on a Form I-9, this is not so for false representations for other purposes or benefits under other laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valadez-Munoz v.

There is therefore nothing in the record to show that he made a false representation of citizenship under \u00a7 1324a(b)(2), and that, as a consequence, he made a false representation of citizenship within the meaning of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Petition\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
