With fault shared among the Uniontown Police Department, the Fayette County Public Defender's Office and later, private counsel, the Fayette County District Attorney's Office, the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, and the mental health infrastructure of Pennsylvania, Craig Geness's criminal case was inadequately investigated, inadequately defended, and inadequately monitored and supervised as Geness languished in various detention facilities. All the while, his petition for habeas relief remained pending. And when a hearing was finally held on that petition, the District Attorney's Office voluntarily dismissed the charges out of concern for its \"ability to meet its burden of proof, even if the defendant were competent.\" App. 205a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from Geness's subsequent lawsuit against the arresting officer,\n   then-Detective Jason Cox,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and various other defendants, claiming they violated his civil rights through reckless investigation, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that they denied him due process and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12131. But at this point-nearly a dozen years after Geness's arrest and with the performance of his various counsel marred by inexcusable delays and dilatory discovery efforts-most avenues of relief are now closed to him. For the reasons explained below, we will affirm the District Court's dismissal of Geness's \u00a7 1983 claims but will reverse its denial of leave for Geness to amend his complaint and will remand for him to reinstitute his due process and ADA claims against the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Incident at the McVey Personal Care Home\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2006, Craig Geness lived at the McVey Personal Care Home, an assisted living facility for intellectually disabled people, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. In October of that year, another resident, Ronald Fiffik, fell from the front porch of the building and sustained serious injuries. Hearing the resulting commotion, James McVey, the son of the owner and the supervisor then on duty, walked out to the porch to find Fiffik lying on the ground. He called for an ambulance, informing the dispatcher that a resident had fallen, and Fiffik was taken by an emergency medical services (\"EMS\") unit to Uniontown Hospital where he was treated before being discharged to the McVey Home later that day. That evening, however, Fiffik's pain intensified and he returned to the hospital where his condition continued to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in his death a few weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Three contemporaneous records from the day of the incident indicated that Fiffik had merely fallen in an unfortunate accident. First, the initial EMS record noted that the ambulance was dispatched \"in response to a fall\" and also reflected that Fiffik's wife had witnessed the incident and that she \"stated that [Fiffik] walked out on porch and fell down approx[.] 5 steps head first.\" App. 193a. Next, a Uniontown police officer who responded to the scene filled out an incident report, stating that a \"[c]aller ... reported that a male fell off of a porch\" and that the officer took \"[n]o further police action ... [because] no one onscene [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] could provide[ ] any information as to what happened other than [that] Fiffik fell off of the porch.\" App. 140. Finally, Fiffik's hospital admission records reflected that Fiffik was \"alert, cooperative in no distress,\" that his \"chief complaint\" was that he \"FELL,\" that he reported he \"fell down approximately five stairs[,] ... [h]as [mental retardation ] and is unsteady and is not supposed to go near the stairs but he did and then he fell down them. It was witnessed. No loss of consciousness. Patient says he feels fine and he wants to go home.\" App. 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Notwithstanding these reports by Fiffik and his wife, once Fiffik's condition deteriorated to the point that he was on life support, his daughter reached out to the Uniontown Police Department to report her suspicion that her father might have been shoved. As a result, on November 16, 2006, Cox conducted a one-day investigation,\n   which involved speaking to Fiffik's daughter and hospital personnel, interviewing James McVey, and then interviewing and obtaining a confession from Geness. Soon thereafter, Cox swore out a criminal complaint against Geness for aggravated assault, later upgraded to murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his November 16th interview, with the prospect of a personal injury lawsuit, if not wrongful death suit looming, McVey reported for the first time that immediately prior to Fiffik's fall he heard Geness scream \"shut up\" from nearby and then saw Geness walk quickly inside to his bedroom. App. 141. McVey also said he then followed Geness to his room and asked if he pushed Fiffik, but Geness did not answer and instead \"responded by laying in a fetal position on the bed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, McVey reported, again for the first time, that during the brief interlude between Fiffik's return to the McVey Home and his being readmitted to the hospital, Fiffik had told McVey that \"someone\" pushed him. App. 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With Geness now a suspect in an alleged crime, Cox proceeded to interview him. At that point, for reasons not apparent from the record, Geness had been transferred from the McVey Home to the Highlands Hospital where he had been admitted in the past and was then living as an in-patient. According to Cox's report, he had Geness brought to a room to meet with him, read Geness his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and asked if Geness would speak with him concerning \"the day that Ronald Fiffick fell from the wall.\" App. 141. Once Geness agreed and signed the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver, Cox asked him the date, the day of the week, if he had gone to high school, and who was President of the United States. Geness correctly answered these questions and then, according to the report, provided a confession closely tracking McVey's account of events. That is, he admitted that on the day Fiffik was injured, Fiffik \"said something\" to him; he then \"screamed at Fiffik 'Shut Up' \" and \"voices inside his head told him to push Fiffik over the wall\"; and he \"shoved Fiffik hard ... went up to his bedroom, and shut the door.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his Affidavit of Probable Cause in support of the arrest warrant, Cox recounted James McVey's allegations against Geness and Geness's confession, and on that basis, a magisterial district judge issued a warrant for Geness's arrest. From that point forward, according to the affidavit he filed in support of his motion for summary judgment in the District Court, Cox \"no longer maintained an active role in the prosecution of Mr. Geness,\" \"heard very little from the prosecution regarding this case for approximately seven years,\" \"did not have any role in the subsequent decision making in the prosecution,\" and \"was never contacted by [the] Public Defender ... or [Geness's private counsel] for information relating to [his] investigation....\" App. 165. Also according to that affidavit, Cox did not reference the exculpatory evidence in the EMS report and the hospital admission records in his Affidavit of Probable Cause because he \"ha[d] no recollection of ever having seen [them] prior to the filing of this lawsuit,\" and to obtain them, he would have required a search warrant, which he also \"ha[d] no recollection of ever having obtained.\" App. 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon his arrest, Geness was taken into custody, where, between Fayette County Prison and a locked-down mental institution, he would remain for over nine years without any further investigation, a hearing on his habeas petition, or a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Geness's Incarceration and Eventual Civil Commitment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The administration of justice went awry for Geness from the outset. After he was\n   arraigned in November 2006, Geness did not receive a preliminary hearing in magisterial district court for over five months. The Public Defender filed a habeas motion in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County in June 2007, asserting that Geness's confession was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and that Cox lacked probable cause to arrest. Yet that motion was not ruled upon as Judge Leskinen, to whom the case was assigned, opined that Geness was \"not at the present time competent to stand trial,\" App. 147, and the Defender agreed to continue any hearing on the petition \"until [d]efendant is competent,\" App. 148\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to Section 402 of the Pennsylvania Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7402, Geness was ordered to be transferred to Mayview State Hospital, for no more than 60 days, to receive a psychiatric evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That transfer, however, was not carried out, and almost two months later, the court issued a second order for a psychiatric examination to be performed. Still no action was taken. Finally, in September 2007, nearly ten months after Geness's arrest and after yet a third order was issued, Geness received his first examination. He was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with the Psychiatric Forensic Center at Mayview State Hospital with mild mental retardation with an IQ of 51 and schizoaffective bipolar disorder, and was found \"incompetent to stand trial\" because he was unable \"to understand the concept of trial,\" App. 194, or \"to recognize the role of personnel in the court system ... [or the] various outcomes from his pending charges,\" App. 198. His prognosis for improvement was deemed \"poor.\" App. 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notwithstanding that prognosis, however, Judge Leskinen merely instructed counsel to request a hearing on the habeas petition \"at such time as def. is deemed competent to proceed,\" App. 148, and it appears that neither the Public Defender, nor the DA's Office, nor the court paid particular heed to the case again for another three years. Instead, Geness was returned to prison where he remained until November 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At that point, for reasons not apparent from the record, the Public Defender requested that the court order Geness's involuntary commitment and residential treatment. In response, Judge Leskinen ordered a second psychiatric examination, noting that upon \"a report containing a determination that the def. would not regain competency within a reasonable period of time ... upon motion of counsel, the Court will schedule an additional hearing on that issue.\" App. 149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Still, the cycle of indifference continued. This second examination was inexplicably delayed for nearly a year, and in the interim, counsel took no action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even after the examination was completed and concluded (as the court had anticipated) that Geness remained incompetent and was \"not likely to respond to any additional treatment interventions,\" App. 203, Geness's counsel did not request a hearing on his long-pending habeas petition, nor did the prosecutor or the court raise the matter. Instead, in September 2011-five years after Geness's arrest and with his criminal charges still pending-Judge Leskinen ordered him transferred to involuntary commitment in a long term structured residence (\"LTSR\") where he would be fitted with an ankle monitor and would \"remain without contact with the general public.\" App. 151. He further ordered that Geness be returned to Fayette County\n   Prison \"upon completion\" of his civil commitment or upon \"a determination that he is competent to stand trial, whichever comes first.\" App. 151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In March 2012, Geness had a change of counsel but, sadly, no change of fortune. According to the affidavit his new counsel, Bernadette Tummons, filed in connection with the underlying summary judgment proceeding, she made numerous and repeated discovery requests of the District Attorney's Office over a two-year period that were simply ignored. Tummons, however, opted not to seek the court's intervention because she was concerned that \"doing so would have flaunted [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the common practice of Fayette County ..., would not have been successful, and would have assuredly soured [her] already tenuous relationship with the Office of the District Attorney.\" App. 331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June 2014, Tummons received a limited document production, including Cox's affidavit and the Public Defender's omnibus pretrial motion that asserted the confession was illegal. Those documents prompted her to think Geness's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver and confession might not have been voluntary. By her account, when she next met with Geness, he told her he confessed because \"the police told him [to say] that he pushed Mr. Fiffik.\" App. 332. Rather than acting on this information, however, Tummons opted to await further discovery, if forthcoming, from the DA's Office. In fact, she waited nearly another year before filing her first of three motions to compel in May 2015. Contrary to her earlier assumption, all were successful. In September 2015, with the additional support in the psychiatric reports for her hypothesis that the confession was involuntary, Tummons filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and renewed motion for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Hearing on Geness's Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Two months later, nearly nine years to the day after his arrest, Geness finally received a hearing in the Court of Common Pleas. Unsurprisingly, the DA's Office advised the court that it did not intend to proceed to trial as it anticipated it would be \"unable to prove the case,\" App. 174, and the court agreed, noting that \"if there is a reasonable possibility that the decedent just fell then it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" App. 177. But despite those observations and the protracted proceedings in this case, Judge Leskinen declined to reach the merits of Geness's motion to dismiss or his habeas petition, instead inviting the Commonwealth to abandon the charges by submitting a request for\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequi\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    nol pros\n   </em>\n   \"), and advising he would just \"sign it\" if submitted. App. 177-78. As the court observed, that approach would \"moot consideration of [the] Motion for Habeas Corpus.\" App. 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The DA's Office readily agreed that it would \"rather be in a position to present the Nol Pros today,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and thus, over the repeated objection of Tummons, the court postponed ruling on Geness's motions\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The court also rejected Tummons's entreaty that it at least require the prosecutor to put \"the reasons for the\n   <em>\n    nol pros\n   </em>\n   ... on the record,\" but it did instruct the prosecutor to include those reasons \"in the\n   <em>\n    nol pros\n   </em>\n   when he brings it up.\" App. 189. And when it did-not that day as promised, but two weeks later-the DA's office acknowledged its reason was not only that the \"Commonwealth believes that the defendant is and remains incompetent for trial,\" but also that there were \"substantive evidentiary issues in this matter that likely could and would impair the Commonwealth's ability to meet its burden of proof,\n   even if the defendant were competent.\" App. 205a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When it came to entering the\n   <em>\n    nol pros\n   </em>\n   order, however, the court declined to mention the prosecution's inability to sustain its evidentiary burden, referencing only Geness's incompetence. And although not argued or requested by the prosecution, the court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   offered its opinion that \"there was clearly sufficient probable cause to file the criminal complaint and to pursue the matter,\" App. 191, and that the charges, which it dismissed \"without prejudice,\" \"may be refiled in the event evidence justifying such refiling is developed and discovered,\" App. 193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In mid-December 2015, Geness was finally released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Proceedings in the District Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2016, represented by his third and current attorney, Geness filed a complaint against Cox, James McVey and his parents (the owners of the McVey Home), the County of Fayette, and the City of Uniontown. As relevant to this appeal, he asserted claims for malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment, and reckless investigation, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and claims for violation of due process and the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ruling on the defendants' motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the District Court dismissed Geness's malicious prosecution claim on the ground that the\n   <em>\n    nol pros\n   </em>\n   order, by its terms, did not satisfy the element of \"favorable termination\" of the charges against him. Sometime thereafter, realizing he had erroneously filed his ADA and due process claims against the City of Uniontown and the County of Fayette instead of the Commonwealth, Geness sought leave to amend. But the District Court denied that request, reasoning that amendment would be futile because the ADA claim also would be barred under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine as \"a direct challenge to a state court's orders and judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Geness v.

Pa. Mar. 21, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With Geness having voluntarily dismissed all defendants but Cox, the parties proceeded with discovery. And once that was completed, the District Court granted summary judgment on Geness's reckless investigation, false arrest, and false imprisonment claims, concluding that Geness \"fail[ed] to adduce evidence sufficient to proceed to trial\" on any of them, and that the claims were also barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Geness v.

We consider, in turn, Geness's argument concerning the time-barred claims, the District Court's dismissal of his malicious prosecution claim, and the Court's denial of leave to amend with regard to his due process and ADA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Those failures point up the essential role of each player in that system-whether law enforcement officer, prison official, mental health professional, defense counsel, prosecutor, or judge-and the devastating consequences that can follow when one or more of them fails to diligently safeguard the civil rights with which they are entrusted. With the complexities at the intersection of the criminal justice and mental health systems, those risks are only compounded and require vigilance at a systemic level. As for the case before us, we will reverse the District Court's denial of leave to amend, remanding for Geness to reinstate his claim against the Commonwealth, and we will affirm the District Court in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Appellee Jason Cox is now Chief of Police for the Uniontown Police Department.
