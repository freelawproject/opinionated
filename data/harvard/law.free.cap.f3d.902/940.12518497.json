The answer, we conclude, is a procedural morass and a remand to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   G&amp;G Productions, LLC (\"G&amp;G\"), a California limited-liability company, appeals the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Rita Rusic, a citizen of Italy, in G&amp;G's suit asserting various state-law claims. G&amp;G alleges that sometime in 1999 or 2000, Rusic stole\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   -a large, valuable oil painting by the late American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat-from Rusic's former husband and G&amp;G's predecessor-in-interest, Vittorio Cecchi Gori. The district court held that G&amp;G's claims were barred by California's borrowing statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20361\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the applicable ten-year Italian statute of limitations would bar those claims in an Italian court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm the district court's order with respect to G&amp;G's conversion claim because the district court properly determined that this claim accrued sometime in 2000 and was time-barred under both the Italian and California statutes of limitations. We vacate and remand the district court's order with respect to G&amp;G's replevin and unjust enrichment claims, however, because there is no indication that the district court determined when those claims accrued. We also vacate and remand the district court's order with respect to G&amp;G's claim for declaratory relief because the disputed facts on this claim defeat summary judgment in favor of Rusic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vittorio Cecchi Gori is a well-known film producer and former Italian politician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1983, Gori married Rita Rusic, a Croatian-born actress, singer, and film producer who is now a citizen of Italy. At the time they married, Gori and Rusic agreed to keep their assets separate under Italian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 1998 Gori purchased a large oil painting entitled\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   (1984) by the late American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat from the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York for $330,000. In late 1998 or early 1999, the Shafrazi Gallery shipped the painting to Gori and Rusic's residence in Rome, Italy, where it hung with other artworks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mere months later, the marriage deteriorated. Rusic filed for divorce from Gori in May 1999, accusing Gori of physical abuse and infidelity. Around the time that Rusic filed for divorce,\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   vanished from the couple's home. Gori contends that Rusic smuggled the painting out of the residence and stashed it elsewhere. Rusic counters that she did not take-and, because of a head injury allegedly caused by Gori, could not have taken-the painting, which actually disappeared \"when Mr. Gori caused movers working for him to remove numerous items of personal property from [the residence] in 1999 or possibly 2000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the meantime, Basquiat's works have continued to appreciate in value. In 2017, for example, Basquiat's 1982 oil-stick and spray-paint creation,\n   <em>\n    Untitled\n   </em>\n   , set a record for any work by a U.S. artist sold at auction, fetching $110.5M at Sotheby's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gori has never wavered in his belief that Rusic took\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   . On several occasions, he initiated legal action in Italy to recover the painting. On May 16, 2000, Gori's attorney sent Rusic a letter demanding the painting's return. Two months later, Gori's attorney filed a brief in Italian court in connection with the divorce proceedings, petitioning for the painting's return. The Italian court rejected Gori's petition in an August 2006 divorce decree, which found Gori at fault for spousal abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Undeterred, Gori's attorneys sent another letter to Rusic on February 24, 2009 threatening to initiate criminal proceedings if Rusic failed to return the painting. Gori's attorneys sent similar letters to Rusic later in 2009 and in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When nothing came of the letters, Gori filed a criminal complaint against Rusic in Italian court on March 22, 2010. On February\n   13, 2014, the court ruled in Rusic's favor and acquitted her of the charges. The court first determined that Rusic and Gori had not legally separated when Gori filed his complaint, thus barring the criminal action under Italian law. The court further determined that because Gori suspected Rusic stole the painting as early as 2000, Rusic's purported crime was \"subject to the Statute of Limitations\" of seven years and six months, which expired on January 10, 2008-over two years before Gori initiated the criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 22, 2010-one month before Gori filed his criminal complaint in Italy-Gori assigned any rights that he held in\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   to his long-standing Italian attorney, Giovanni Nappi, to settle a \u20ac2M debt for unpaid legal fees. Nappi then assigned his rights to the painting to G&amp;G, in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in the newly formed limited-liability company. The remaining interest in G&amp;G is held by an Italian businessman and longtime friend of Gori. G&amp;G took title to the painting \"subject to any running statute of limitations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to G&amp;G,\n   <em>\n    Wine of Babylon\n   </em>\n   was most recently observed in the Milan apartment of Canio Mazzaro, an Italian businessman who is Rusic's former boyfriend. G&amp;G cites the testimony of Paola Ruffolo, who purportedly saw the painting during a party at Mazzarro's apartment in 2011. Ruffolo supposedly conveyed that fact to Nappi sometime in 2014. Ruffolo testified that Mazzaro claimed he had obtained the painting from Rusic in 2011 as part of the settlement of Mazzaro's lawsuit against Rusic for breaching a profit-sharing agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rusic, however, submitted a declaration by Mazzaro flatly denying Ruffolo's allegations, each of which Mazzaro dismissed as \"a lie.\" According to Mazzaro, he has never met Ruffolo, has never lived in the apartment where Ruffolo claimed to have seen the painting, has never had possession of the painting, and has never claimed that he obtained the painting from Rusic or from any other party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. DISTRICT COURT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2015, G&amp;G filed suit against Rusic in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting state-law tort claims of conversion, replevin, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in Rusic's favor. The court first determined that California's borrowing statute governed G&amp;G's claims, all of which \"arose\" from Rusic's alleged theft of the painting in Italy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20361\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that \"[w]hen a cause of action has arisen\" in a jurisdiction other than California and is time-barred under the law of that jurisdiction, the claim is also time-barred in California).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a result, the district court proceeded to analyze whether G&amp;G's claims were time-barred under Italian law. On this question, Rusic offered the declaration of Carlo Arnulfo, an experienced attorney who is licensed to practice law in Italy. Arnulfo explained that Article 2946 of the Italian Civil Code prescribes a generic, ten-year statute of limitations for any cause of action that is not subject to a shorter limitations period under a different statute. Arnulfo stated that no other statute prescribes a shorter limitations period for conversion or replevin claims, concluding that G&amp;G's tort claims are subject to a ten-year limitations period in Italy. Notably, Arnulfo supported his declaration with exactly the sort of materials that a court would need to decide an issue of foreign law, including relevant Italian statutes and case law in translation (in this case, by a\n   bilingual attorney who is admitted to both the Italian and California bars).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   G&amp;G's submission was a different story. G&amp;G conceded that Article 2946 governed its claims in Italy, and claimed only that Gori's various attempts to recover the painting from Rusic tolled the limitations period under Italian law. The district court rejected this argument for three reasons. First, G&amp;G's tolling argument was \"entirely unsupported\" by any citations to Italian law. Second, G&amp;G's only support was a declaration of Giovanni Nappi, who concededly is not an expert in Italian law and owns 50% of G&amp;G. Third, even if the court had accepted Nappi's claim that Gori's actions tolled the statute, Nappi failed to quantify the duration of any tolling or the length of any suspension, \"rendering it impossible\" for the district court to determine whether G&amp;G's tort claims were timely filed. Unsurprisingly, the court agreed with Rusic that G&amp;G's tort claims expired in Italy ten years after those claims accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the district court, G&amp;G's tort claims accrued no later than May or July 2000, when Gori first sent a demand letter to Rusic demonstrating that he \"clearly knew of his claim\" and that he \"was entitled to sue.\" The court explicitly made this determination under California law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Deirmenjian v.

Cal. July 30, 2010) (\"Under California law, a cause of action generally accrues at the moment that the party who owns it is entitled to file and prosecute an action.\"). If the tort claims accrued in 2000, of course, G&amp;G would have had \"to file [those] claim[s] before July 10, 2010 at the latest\" in Italian court. Because G&amp;G did not file suit until 2015, the district court held that G&amp;G's tort claims were time-barred under the Italian statute of limitations, and thus barred by California's borrowing statute. The court granted Rusic's motion for summary judgment on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the district court held that G&amp;G's declaratory judgment claim was moot \"because G&amp;G ... maintained in its pleadings and at the summary judgment stage that Mazzara [sic], not Rusic, now owns the Painting pursuant to the alleged settlement agreement [with Mazzaro] in 2011.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. COURT OF APPEALS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, G&amp;G's strategy changed dramatically-and often. For starters, G&amp;G's opening brief presented an entirely new argument that G&amp;G's tort claims are not subject to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   statute of limitations under Italian law. According to G&amp;G, Article 2934 of the Italian Civil Code provides that claims for \"recovery\" of property, as defined by Article 948, are exempt from any\n   statute of limitations. G&amp;G argued that because it sought a declaration as to the legal owner of the painting, an Italian court would not consider this an action for \"restitution\" under Article 2037, which is subject to the ten-year statute of limitations. Rather, the court would consider it an action for \"recovery\" of property under Article 2934, which is exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Once again, the only support G&amp;G provided for its argument was a declaration, this time of Michele Nappi. Although Michele Nappi can be considered an expert on Italian law-he is a former \"divisional President\" of Italy's Court of Cassation and longtime \"senior magistrate\" with more than forty years of experience-the family resemblance is no coincidence: he is also Giovanni Nappi's father. While Michele Nappi's declaration included some excerpts of Italian law, none of them were translated. More fatally, Nappi's declaration spoke exclusively in terms of whether G&amp;G's \"action\" is one for \"restitution\" or \"recovery\" of property under Italian law. G&amp;G's complaint, however, asserted four\n   <em>\n    distinct\n   </em>\n   causes of action. Three of those claims do not seek to recover any \"property\" at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   And there was more. Mere days before oral argument, G&amp;G filed a motion to admit\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   an Italian attorney-previously unheard of in the litigation-to \"discuss and otherwise answer any questions which [the] Court may have regarding the interpretation of Italian law.\" Unsurprisingly, we denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At no point, we stress, did G&amp;G attempt to explain why it could not have presented these experts, legal theories, and citations to Italian law to the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reason is simple: G&amp;G could have. Instead, G&amp;G attempts to use Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1-which treats an issue of foreign law as a question of law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1 -as a permission slip for unlimited do-overs. The rule does not extend that far. We decline to consider G&amp;G's untimely and undeveloped arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because our jurisdiction rests on the parties' diversity of citizenship, we apply substantive state law, including state law regarding statutes of limitations and tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albano v.

After all, both parties relied overwhelmingly on California law to support their arguments as to when G&amp;G's tort claims accrued, and neither suggested that California and Italian law differ with respect to accrual.

Here, the potentially relevant facts are hotly disputed. G&amp;G and Rusic disagree, for example, about the original legal owner of the painting, the current whereabouts of the painting, and whether the painting was conveyed to a third party. With no briefing or discussion by the district court on the appropriate test-or tests-governing the accrual of each of G&amp;G's claims under either Italian or California law, we cannot determine with any confidence whether the resolution of disputed facts is necessary to decide when the Italian statute of limitations began to run on the remaining claims. We therefore vacate the judgment of the district court with respect to G&amp;G's replevin and unjust enrichment claims and remand for answers to these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DECLARATORY RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, we vacate and remand the judgment of the district court with respect to G&amp;G's claim for declaratory relief. The district court held that \"G&amp;G's request for a declaration of the Painting's ownership against Rusic is moot because G&amp;G has maintained in its pleadings and at the summary judgment stage that Mazzara [sic], not Rusic, now owns the Painting pursuant to the alleged settlement agreement in 2011.\" In doing so, the district court ignored that the parties disagree as to the original owner of the painting, meaning that even if Mazzaro acquired the painting from Rusic as part of a settlement agreement, Rusic may have lacked the authority to convey the painting to him in the first place. Additionally, Mazzaro flatly denied Ruffolo's allegations that he currently has\n   the painting, which he dismissed as \"a lie.\" According to Mazzaro, he has never met Ruffolo, has never lived in the apartment where Ruffolo claimed to have seen the painting, has never had possession of the painting, and has never claimed that he obtained the painting from Rusic or any other party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For this reason alone, it was improper to grant summary judgment on G&amp;G's claim for declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolan v.

Therefore, we need not address Rusic's argument that G&amp;G's claim for declaratory relief is constitutionally unripe for adjudication.

Civ. Pro. Code \u00a7 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language indicates that the question of accrual should be determined under the law of the foreign jurisdiction, just as the limitations period is so determined. That is wholly consonant with the purpose of Section 361, which is to prevent \"residents of other states with claims that are barred in the jurisdiction in which they arose\" from reviving an untimely claim in a California court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Cossman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"282399\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/108/370/#p376\">\n    108 Cal. App. 4th at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20376\">\n    133 Cal.Rptr.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It makes little sense to decide whether a claim that arose in Arkansas is untimely by using California law to fix the date of accrual. That would not be a determination of whether a claim were stale \"by the laws\" of Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Another concern is that mixing and matching jurisdictions in applying Section 361 is bound to lead to unpalatable results. Let's say a plaintiff sued in California in 2015 on a claim that arose in Italy and accrued, when measured under California law, in 2010. Let's also say the applicable Italian statute of limitations is 5 years. Under the current case law, that claim would not be barred by the borrowing statute. But what if under Italian law the claim accrued in Italy in 2005 and so would have been barred there? In that situation, the plaintiff would get away with exactly what Section 361 is intended to prevent-suing in California on a claim that would have been time-barred in Italy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Fortunately, that is not what happened here. In my view, the district court made sure to analyze accrual under the laws of both California and Italy, which turned out to be the same and yielded the same accrual period of May or July 2000. Rusic's conversion claim was properly dismissed under Italy's 10-year statute of limitations whether the accrual was measured under Italian law or California's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   But the day will come when the laws of California and the foreign jurisdiction do not align so neatly. In my view, the date of accrual for Section 361 purposes should be determined by the foreign jurisdiction at issue, rather than California law. With these additional observations, I concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
