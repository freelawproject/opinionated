Plaintiff-Appellant Empire Merchants, LLC (\"Empire\"), a distributor of alcoholic beverages, is New York State's exclusive distributor for popular brands like Johnnie Walker, Grey Goose, and Seagram's Gin. Empire alleges that from at least 2008 to 2014, Defendant-Appellee Reliable Churchill LLLP (\"Reliable\") and (non-party) Republic National Distributing Company (\"RNDC\"), two of Maryland's largest liquor distributors, conspired with retail liquor stores in Cecil County, Maryland (\"Cecil County retailers\") and New York City (\"New York retailers\") to smuggle liquor from Maryland to New York, in violation of New York liquor law. Empire sued Reliable and several Cecil County and New York retailers under RICO, alleging that their bootlegging directly harmed Empire \"because every case of alcohol smuggled into New York from Maryland was a lost sale by New York's authorized distributors-of which Empire was the largest.\" J.A. 172. The defendants moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing in part that the smuggling operation did not directly cause Empire to lose sales, and therefore that Empire had not adequately alleged proximate cause under RICO. The district court agreed and dismissed the case, and Empire appealed. Because Empire failed to allege proximate cause adequately, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As relevant here, the American alcohol industry consists of three different groups of entities: (1) suppliers, who produce the alcohol in breweries, vineyards, and distilleries;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) distributors, who purchase liquor from suppliers in bulk and sell it to retail liquor stores, restaurants, and bars; and (3) retailers, the liquor stores, restaurants, and bars that ultimately sell liquor to consumers. Many suppliers and distributors enter into contracts with one another, giving the distributors \"the exclusive right to distribute that supplier's products in-state.\" J.A. 200. Both the federal government and New York State license suppliers and distributors, and many states and municipalities tax the sale of liquor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    27 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n    N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law \u00a7 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Empire is the largest liquor distributor in the New York metropolitan area and has exclusive distribution contracts for that area with some of the world's leading liquor suppliers, giving it exclusive rights to distribute popular brands like Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff. It alleges that from at least 2008 to 2014, Reliable and RNDC conspired with the Cecil County and New York retailers to smuggle liquor from Maryland to New York, thus violating state and federal law, interfering with Empire's exclusive New York distribution rights, and depriving Empire of millions of dollars in lost sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The scheme was simple. The New York retailers would make interstate phone calls and send interstate faxes and emails to Cecil County retailers requesting liquor, and the Cecil County retailers passed on the orders to Reliable and RNDC. Reliable and RNDC sold the requested products to the Cecil County retailers at discount. The New York retailers paid for the liquor in cash (sometimes up to $20,000 at a time) and smuggled it in vans and trucks from Maryland to New York. The Cecil County retailers deposited the cash into bank accounts and wrote checks from those accounts to pay Reliable and RNDC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Empire alleges that Reliable knew about the smuggling and that many of its employees encouraged and even helped coordinate the scheme. Some Reliable employees helped Cecil County retailers remove Maryland stickers from its liquor crates to help smugglers evade detection, at least one Reliable salesman lied to a Cecil County retailer who expressed concern that Reliable was encroaching on Empire's exclusive rights, and Reliable may have even been in direct contact with the smuggling New York retailers. Both Reliable and RNDC also track retailers' weekly sales and would have noticed the large purchasing discrepancies in rural Cecil County. And many Cecil County and New York retailers, according to the Amended Complaint, have admitted to smuggling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At all relevant times during the alleged smuggling operation, Maryland's excise liquor tax was $1.50/gal, and the total excise tax in New York City (state and local tax included) was $7.44/gal. In both Maryland and New York, distributors are responsible for paying alcohol excise taxes. The operation \"was predicated on\" this $6/gal tax difference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Smuggling allowed the New York retailers to buy liquor at a discount and then sell it at New York prices. For the Cecil County retailers, Reliable, and RNDC, the bootlegging scheme opened a much larger market, as Cecil County has a population of 78,000 people, about 0.3% the population of metropolitan New York. Profits soared. One Cecil County retailer sold $300,000 of liquor to New York in a nine-day period. Reliable alone sold over 272,000 cases (5.8 million bottles) as part of this smuggling operation, \"resulting in gross revenues of more than $40 million.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n    at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But the operation cost New York State, New York City, and, according to the Amended Complaint, Empire. \"By willfully avoiding the payment of the much higher New York State and New York City excise tax on alcohol,\" the Amended Complaint alleges, the defendants deprived the State and City \"of millions of dollars in tax revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Alco.%20Bev.%20Cont.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2062\">\n    at 183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mar. 16, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The bulk of the district court's analysis concerned Empire's allegations of wire fraud as a RICO predicate offense. Wire fraud,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , has three elements: (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property that is the object of the scheme, and (3) use of the wires to further the scheme.\n   <em>\n    Fountain v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057067\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/250/#p255\">\n    357 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (2d Cir. 2004). Focusing principally on the first element, the court held that Empire largely failed to allege a scheme to defraud, and to the extent that\n   it had adequately pled such a scheme, it had not alleged that the wire fraud proximately caused its injuries. Empire argued that the smuggling operation itself constituted the requisite \"scheme to defraud.\" The district court rejected this characterization, however, insisting that the smuggling operation was not a single scheme to defraud, but three schemes: (1) smuggling to avoid paying liquor taxes; (2) smuggling to violate New York's liquor licensing laws; and (3) smuggling to interfere with Empire's exclusive distribution contracts. It then concluded that Empire failed to allege proximate cause for the first and second schemes to defraud, and that the third was not a cognizable scheme at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, although \"a smuggling scheme to defraud the government of excise taxes constitutes a 'scheme to defraud' under the wire fraud statute,\" the court reasoned, Empire had \"disclaim[ed] any reliance on defendants' tax evasion in its RICO allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8 (emphasis removed). Empire had also not pled that the alleged tax evasion directly caused Empire's injuries, which meant that Empire had failed to plead proximate cause under\n   <em>\n    Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    547 U.S. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Second, to the extent that Empire alleged that the smuggling operation violated New York State's liquor licensing laws, those state law violations did not proximately cause Empire's injuries either because \"Empire would have suffered the identical injury at the hands of a licensed wholesaler.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Finally, a smuggling scheme that interfered with Empire's exclusive distribution contracts, the district court concluded, was not a scheme to defraud because, though potentially actionable under New York tort law, \"the act of selling\" liquor in violation of another's contractual rights is \"not itself deceitful.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court then dismissed Empire's RICO claims predicated on mail fraud,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , money laundering,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1956, and violations of the Travel Act,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1952. Empire did not adequately allege mail fraud because the complaint did not mention any specific use of the mails to further the smuggling operation. The defendants' alleged money laundering - the Cecil County retailers' deposits and withdrawals of the New York retailers' cash payments - may have helped conceal the smuggling from government regulators but did not, on its own, proximately cause Empire's injuries. The Travel Act violations were \"wholly derivative of the[ ] money laundering allegations\" and therefore failed for the same reason.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    at *16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court dismissed the RICO conspiracy claim for lack of proximate cause and denied Empire leave to amend on futility grounds. Accordingly, it dismissed Empire's RICO claims with prejudice and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over its state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court entered final judgment on March 23, 2017, and Empire filed a timely notice of appeal six days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Empire argues on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing its RICO claim predicated on wire fraud. It also contends that the court erred in dismissing its money laundering and Travel Act-based RICO predicates and in denying it leave to amend. The bulk of this case turns on the first issue because each of Empire's RICO predicates relies on the same proximate cause theory. Though the district court erred in how it characterized Empire's wire fraud-based RICO claim, we agree with the district court that Empire did not adequately allege proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We therefore AFFIRM the decision below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's dismissal pursuant to Fed.

First, the court should have considered the smuggling operation to be a single scheme to defraud, rather than disaggregate it into three separate ones.

Again, the district court disaggregated the smuggling operation into three different schemes: one to deprive New York State of tax revenue, another to violate New York liquor licensing laws, and the third to interfere with Empire's sales. For the following reasons, we disagree as to this characterization of the allegations in Empire's Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As Empire observes, it alleged\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   smuggling operation, not three.

This is incorrect. As explained above, New York State's \"entitlement to tax revenue\" is a property interest, and so it\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   deprived of that interest when Reliable directed its sales to New York without paying the New York excise taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pasquantino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5907297\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/349/#p355\">\n    544 U.S. at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5907297\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/349/#p355\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Empire, by contrast, alleged that it was injured because it\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   sold more liquor but for the smuggling operation.

But this just shows that Empire's injury is\n   <em>\n    distinct\n   </em>\n   from New York's, not that its injury was\n   <em>\n    directly caused\n   </em>\n   by the defendants' racketeering. Indeed, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Anza\n   </em>\n   also allegedly lost sales, but the Supreme Court still determined that New York was the most \"immediate victim[ ]\" of the defendants' racketeering scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    547 U.S. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fourth, Empire appears to contend that we should disregard, or at least pay little attention to New York's injury when assessing whether Empire was directly injured. Otherwise, Empire suggests, we would \"leave[ ] no space for private RICO claims arising out of conduct that injures the government as well as a private party.\" Reply Br. 19. This would cripple civil RICO, Empire adds, because \"over a dozen RICO predicates necessarily harm the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. But as in\n   <em>\n    Bridge\n   </em>\n   , private plaintiffs may still sue if their injuries are sufficiently\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   .
