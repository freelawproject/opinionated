The answer turns on the interplay between two Bankruptcy Code statutes:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\" Section 106(a)\") and 362(k) (\" Section 362(k)\"). In Section 106(a), Congress waived sovereign immunity for a \"money recovery\" under certain bankruptcy provisions, including Section 362(k). Section 362(k) in turn allows an individual to recover \"actual damages\" for a willful violation of the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Jonathan and Cheryl Hunsaker filed for bankruptcy, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") violated the automatic stay by sending the couple collection notices. The bankruptcy court awarded the Hunsakers damages under Section 362(k) for their emotional distress, but the district court reversed on sovereign immunity grounds. Because Section 106(a) unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for an award of emotional distress damages under Section 362(k), we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Hunsakers filed for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. Despite being notified of the couple's bankruptcy, the IRS sent four notices to the Hunsakers demanding payment and threatening imminent enforcement action, including a levy on Social Security benefits. The Hunsakers responded by bringing an adversary proceeding against the United States in bankruptcy court seeking damages for violation of the automatic stay under Section 362(k). The government conceded the IRS's conduct violated the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the Hunsakers sought only damages for emotional distress. The government argued sovereign immunity bars this relief, but the bankruptcy court was unconvinced. In reaching the merits, the court determined that the IRS's conduct exacerbated the stress of the Hunsakers' bankruptcy, causing them to suffer significant emotional distress. As compensation, the court awarded the Hunsakers $4,000 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an appeal to the district court, the government again invoked sovereign immunity. The government also challenged the merits of the Hunsakers' claims, arguing they suffered insufficient emotional distress to warrant damages. The district court concluded Congress has not waived sovereign immunity for emotional distress damages under Section 362(k). The court\n   therefore reversed the bankruptcy court's judgment and ordered the Hunsakers' complaint to be dismissed, without reaching the merits of their claims. The Hunsakers appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Because Section 106(a) 's waiver of sovereign immunity applies to Section 362(k), this appeal turns on whether the bankruptcy court's award falls within the scope of the waiver.

First, the plain language of the statute is dispositive. Because the scope of Section 106(a) 's waiver is unambiguous, there is no need to look beyond the statute's text and ascertain whether it was clearly established in 1994 that emotional distress damages were recoverable under Section 362(k).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Germain\n   </em>\n   , 503 U.S. at 253-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513849,6225793\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1146/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, we disagree with the First Circuit's interpretation of Section 106(a)(5), which the First Circuit relied upon to tether its temporal approach to the statute's text. Section 106(a)(5) provides: \"Nothing in this section shall create any substantive claim for relief or cause of action not otherwise existing under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, or nonbankruptcy law.\" In the First Circuit's view, this text limits Section 106(a) 's waiver to only those remedies that were available at the time of the 1994 amendment because the text \"forbids the creation of any substantive claim for relief 'not otherwise existing under this title, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy, or nonbankruptcy law.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556294\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/20/\">\n    432 F.3d at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) ). And, based on Section 106(a)(5), the First Circuit reasoned that \"Congress has clearly endorsed a temporal approach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We do not read the same temporal restriction into Section 106(a)(5). Section 106(a)(5) only states that Section 106(a) -a provision waiving immunity for various substantive provisions-does not itself create any new causes of action or substantive claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin Sav.
