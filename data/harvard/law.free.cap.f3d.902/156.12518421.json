Aug. 29, 2017). Mitchell currently is serving a sentence of life imprisonment following his convictions at a joint trial with Karim\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   and Lester Eiland in a Pennsylvania state court in 2001 for various offenses arising from a robbery and a murder. Mitchell seeks relief on the grounds that the admission at the trial of testimony of jailhouse informants setting forth his co-defendant Lester Eiland's out-of-court jailhouse statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The District Court in the habeas corpus proceedings concluded that Eiland's statements to the informants were nontestimonial as recognized by\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), and therefore their inclusion in testimony at the trial did not violate his Confrontation Clause rights even though he could not cross-examine Eiland regarding the statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mitchell has argued and continues to argue that the District Court erred by applying\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   because the AEDPA requires assessment of whether a state court's decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), and the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   on March 8, 2004, after his trial and after the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed his conviction on direct appeal on September 22, 2003, in the last state court proceeding dealing with the Sixth Amendment issue. Consequently, he points out that the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   principles were not \"clearly established\" at the time the state courts were considering the Sixth Amendment issue. Mitchell contends that even if admission of the challenged statements would not create a Confrontation Clause issue in a trial held today, he is entitled to habeas corpus relief because, prior to\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , when his case was being tried and was on direct appeal, the Confrontation Clause would have been applied to bar the jailhouse testimony with respect to Eiland's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We have concluded that Mitchell, by focusing narrowly on the \"clearly established Federal law\" language of 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) and by relying on the law in effect at the time of his trial and appeal, misstates the standard applicable to habeas corpus review of a state court conviction in the federal courts. Congress in section 2254(d) has made it a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for granting habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner that a state court's decision leading to his custody was contrary to, or unreasonably applied, clearly established federal law at the time that the state court made its decision. But even if a petitioner in state custody makes that showing he has satisfied only one requirement for the granting of his petition because the AEDPA allows relief to be granted \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the ground that [a prisoner] is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Accordingly, notwithstanding a state court's misapplication of federal law at trial a prisoner is not necessarily entitled to relief in the light of \"the longstanding rule that federal courts will not entertain habeas petitions to correct errors that do not undermine the lawfulness of a petitioner's detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Bronshtein v. Horn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9015116\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/700/#p724\">\n    404 F.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724 (3d Cir. 2005). For the reasons we set forth below, we conclude that Mitchell is not in custody pursuant to what is now recognized as a violation of the Sixth Amendment attributable to the testimony at the trial of the jailhouse informants which set forth Eiland's\n   statements and therefore we will affirm the order of August 29, 2017, denying Mitchell's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 10, 2001, at the joint trial of Mitchell and his two co-defendants, Eley and Eiland, a jury convicted Mitchell of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the July 2000 shooting death of Angel DeJesus, a taxi driver, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   No. 782-2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207726738\">\n    2015 WL 7726738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (Pa. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 2015). Prior to the trial, Mitchell and Eley filed unsuccessful motions to have their cases severed from those of the other defendants and thus the trial was of all three defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After extensive but ultimately unsuccessful state court proceedings, Mitchell filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on December 28, 2009, which he amended on October 19, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mitchell's amended petition advanced three grounds for relief: (1) the state trial court's charge on reasonable doubt was constitutionally defective; (2) the introduction of the informants' testimony describing non-testifying co-defendant Eiland's out-of-court statements violated Mitchell's rights under the Confrontation Clause; and (3) the trial court deprived Mitchell of due process of law when it denied his claim of actual innocence. At this time, however, Mitchell limits his claim to the Confrontation Clause issue and thus we do not address the other issues he set forth in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mitchell argues that the testimony at the trial of two jailhouse informants, Matthew LeVan and Steven Taylor, violated his constitutional rights because they testified as to Eiland's out-of-court statements that implicated Mitchell in the offenses and Mitchell did not have the opportunity to confront Eiland regarding those statements. Though Eiland's statements did not mention Mitchell by name, Mitchell contends that in the context of the joint trial Eiland's statements implicated him in the robbery and murder. Specifically, LeVan testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. Now, if you can, describe for the jury the conversation you had with Lester Eiland while you were in the jail cell playing cards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. He said about the sawed-off shotgun was used and a .380 pistol, and there was two other guns used and one was hidden in a brick close to where it happened at.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Did he say what kind of crime it was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Homicide\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Or began as?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Homicide-no, it was a robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. Did he say what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. He said they-they, as in whoever was with him-he didn't say the names of those people-when he went up to them, it was supposed to be a robbery, and he was-he's the one that shot him, but he didn't mean to do it. It was the other two's idea or something like that, in that sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   App. 225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Taylor testified, referring to the substance of Eiland's statements, that \"they were there to rob a cab driver, and I guess with different things you did or whatnot during the evening, somewhere, somehow, something went wrong and whatnot. Somebody ended up dead from that.\" App. 239.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mitchell claims that these jailhouse witnesses' references to \"they\" and the murder being \"the other two's idea\" tied him to the robbery and provided key evidence to establish his culpability for the offenses. Mitchell argues that the failure to exclude or properly redact the references to his involvement in the offenses from the co-defendant's statements to which the informants referred violated his confrontation rights as recognized in\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968),\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

We granted Eley's petition because we believed that there had been a\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   violation in his case by reason of the admission of testimony describing Eiland's statements at the trial. In\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   , we held that the state court's order denying a motion to sever the trials was contrary to federal law clearly established by\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , Supreme Court's precedent on the Confrontation Clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556208\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/837/\">\n    712 F.3d at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Focusing in particular on Eiland's statement that it was \"the other two\" defendants who had the \"idea\" to rob the victim, in\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Although we are mindful of the deference that we owe to the Commonwealth's courts, we are constrained to conclude that fairminded jurists could not disagree that the Superior Court's decision is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   . We have no doubt that the jury inferred, on the basis of Eiland's confession alone, that Eley was one of 'the other two' whose 'idea' it was to rob DeJesus. ... Indeed, a juror who wondered to whom 'the other two' referred ...

Mitchell filed objections to the report and recommendation but the Court overruled the objections by adopting the report and recommendation on August 29, 2017, in a memorandum opinion. The Court concluded that, even assuming Mitchell could make the threshold showing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) that the state court's denial of his Confrontation Clause claim was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n   application of, clearly established Federal law\" under\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   , he was not entitled to relief because the Sixth Amendment law had evolved in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   after his trial and there had not been a Confrontation Clause violation under the updated standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The germane development of the law in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   was that the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause was recognized as guarding against testimonial statements made by an individual in anticipation that the person to whom he makes the statements will be called as a witness as well as formal statements made under oath and statements made to law enforcement officers seeking information about past events. After the District Court denied his petition, Mitchell, to whom that Court granted a certificate of appealability, filed this timely appeal challenging the application of\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   to his Confrontation Clause claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.

A federal court cannot grant habeas relief based on a claim that was \"adjudicated on the merits\" in a state court unless that adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As was the District Court, we are satisfied that Mitchell established that the Pennsylvania Superior Court, in the last state court decision to address the Sixth Amendment issue, unreasonably applied what was then clearly established federal law when it upheld the trial court's ruling refusing to sever Mitchell's trial from that of the other defendants before admitting the testimony referencing Eiland's out-of-court statements that implicated Mitchell in the offenses. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   we considered these statements and their effect on\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   , who was in Mitchell's position, and concluded that the admission of the statements violated the Confrontation Clause and that the error \"substantially influenced the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556208\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/837/\">\n    712 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   861 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1624 ). Thus the admission of the testimony was not a small matter. But the question that we now must address\n   is different for it is whether the District Court in considering the habeas corpus petition correctly considered case law authority subsequent to that on which we relied in\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   in considering whether Mitchell was \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

It would be anomalous to grant habeas corpus relief to Mitchell because of the introduction of evidence that would be admissible under current constitutional standards at a retrial notwithstanding the previous Confrontation Clause error.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We sum up by saying that inasmuch as under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , there was not a violation of the Confrontation Clause due to the admission of the informants' testimony with respect to Eiland's statements Mitchell is not being held in custody in violation\n   of the Constitution laws, or treaties of the United States and accordingly he is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, we will affirm the order entered on August 29, 2017, denying Mitchell's petition for habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The federal habeas corpus proceedings were prolonged by orders staying proceedings on Mitchell's petition while his state post-conviction relief applications were pending.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Mitchell's petition for review of the Superior Court decision on June 29, 2014.

However, by the time the magistrate judge had made her report and recommendation, the Commonwealth had conceded that the exhaustion requirement had been satisfied with respect to the Confrontation Clause claim and that the claim was therefore not procedurally defaulted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    App. 961, 979.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Mitchell argues that application of\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    and its progeny to his petition violates the antiretroactivity principles of\n    <em>\n     Teague v.

But\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    does not affect our analysis for two reasons: First, Mitchell has not challenged the District Court's observation that\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    was decided before his conviction became final for purposes of a\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    analysis, and thus it would not be necessary to apply\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    retroactively to consider its impact on his Confrontation Clause claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mitchell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203725503\">\n     2017 WL 3725503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5. Second,\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    bars application of new rules of criminal procedure to collaterally attack convictions in state courts, but has no relevance where consideration of a new rule leads to rejection of a habeas corpus claim.
