In 2013, Ford sued the members of the U.S. Parole Commission, alleging (among other things) that\n   the Commissioners had unlawfully delayed his first hearing for parole from his D.C. sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Generally, once a D.C. offender has served the minimum term of his court-imposed sentence, he is eligible for parole and has a parole hearing at that time. The rule is different, though, for the small number of offenders like Ford who are serving sentences for both a D.C. crime and a federal crime committed before federal parole was abolished. In that situation, if an offender's eligibility for parole from his D.C. sentence comes before his projected parole date on his federal sentence, a federal regulation calls for delaying his first D.C. parole hearing until shortly before his projected federal parole date. The central question in this case is whether the federal regulation's mandate to delay the first D.C. parole hearing in that situation conflicts with D.C. law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment to the Commissioners on that claim as well as several others pressed by Ford. We conclude that Ford's first D.C. parole hearing was unlawfully delayed. We therefore reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in Ford's favor on that issue, but we otherwise affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1980, Ford committed three murders in three jurisdictions in the space of three months. Ford's final victim was an inmate at a federal prison in Northern Virginia, whom Ford broke into the facility to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ford was first convicted of the prison murder and conspiracy to commit that murder, both in violation of federal law. He received concurrent sentences of life imprisonment for the murder and 15 years for the conspiracy offense. Ford was next convicted of murder while armed, kidnapping while armed, and carrying a pistol without a license, all in violation of D.C. law. He received a sentence of 20 years to life for the murder, 10 years for the kidnapping, and an unspecified term for the gun offense-all concurrent to each other, but consecutive to his federal sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ford is currently serving his D.C. and federal sentences in federal prison. If paroled, he will begin serving another life sentence for a third murder he committed in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since 1997, when the D.C. Board of Parole was abolished, the U.S. Parole Commission has conducted parole proceedings for both D.C. and federal offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel v. Fulwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    766 F.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (D.C. Cir.2014). In December 2001, the Commission held Ford's initial federal parole hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commission applied the federal parole guidelines and determined that, barring disciplinary infractions in prison, Ford would be paroled from his federal sentence on November 22, 2005. The Commission also concluded that Ford would become eligible for parole from his D.C. sentence before his projected parole date for his federal sentence. Applying the federal regulation that governs the timing of D.C. parole hearings for offenders serving both D.C. and federal sentences,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.65\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Commission set the deadline for Ford's first D.C. parole hearing as July 22, 2005-four months before his projected federal parole date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ford had his first D.C. parole hearing shortly after that date, on August 10, 2005. He was denied parole. Since then, Ford has had three rehearings-in October 2010, October 2012, and February 2016-and has been denied parole each time. His next rehearing is scheduled for February 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2013, before Ford's most recent rehearing, he filed a pro se complaint against\n   the members of the Commission. Ford raised claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including a claim that the Commissioners had violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by delaying his first D.C. parole hearing until his projected federal parole date (in 2005) instead of holding the hearing as soon as he became eligible for parole from his D.C. sentence (in 2000). The Commissioners argued in response that they had properly applied\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.65\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) when setting the date of Ford's first D.C. parole hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court agreed, and granted summary judgment to the Commissioners on that issue and Ford's remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    Ford v. Massarone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272262\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/91/#p106\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106, 108 (D.D.C. 2016). Ford appealed, and we appointed amicus counsel to present arguments favoring Ford's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the claims Ford has preserved, we consider various threshold arguments advanced by the Commissioners as to why we should decline to reach some or all of Ford's claims. On the merits of the properly preserved claims, we hold that the Commissioners unlawfully delayed Ford's first D.C. parole hearing. We rule in the Commissioners' favor on the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As an initial matter, the Commissioners argue that Ford's action is barred by res judicata and by a federal statute restricting second or successive habeas actions. The Commissioners further contend that, insofar as Ford's action can proceed, he forfeited certain of his claims by failing to raise them before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. The Commissioners argue that res judicata bars Ford's action because, in 2001, he filed a habeas petition in which he alleged (among other things) that the Commissioners had unlawfully delayed his first D.C. parole hearing.\n   <em>\n    Ford v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attorney General\n   </em>\n   , No. 02-302 (D. Colo. Apr. 9, 2004). Res judicata, however, is an \"affirmative defense\" that \"must [be] plead[ed] ... in the answer to the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3568156,6048998\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/1279/\">\n    514 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285 (D.C. Cir.2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). The Commissioners failed to plead the defense here, so it is forfeited. And while we can overlook forfeiture and consider an issue not raised before the district court in \"extraordinary circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lesesne v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662325,3556517\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/584/\">\n    712 F.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (D.C. Cir.2013), the Commissioners identify no such circumstances here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The Commissioners next contend that Ford's action is barred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which provides that \"[n]o circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus\" filed by a federal prisoner \"if it appears that the legality\" of his or her \"detention has been determined by [a federal court] on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided in section 2255.\" In turn, \u00a7 2255 provides that a prisoner cannot bring a \"second or successive\" habeas petition unless a federal court of appeals certifies that the petition meets certain criteria not relevant here.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Commissioners' argument based on \u00a7 2244(a) again relies on Ford's 2001 habeas petition. While Ford's instant action is styled as a \u00a7 1983 suit, the Commissioners contend that it is subject to \u00a7 2244(a) because it is in substance a second habeas suit. And because no court of appeals has certified that the instant suit meets the criteria laid out in \u00a7 2255(h), the Commissioners argue, the suit is barred by \u00a7 2244(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the Commissioners did not raise their \u00a7 2244(a) argument in the district court, the argument cannot be forfeited because the requirement to obtain authorization for a second or successive habeas petition is a jurisdictional prerequisite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burton v. Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553521\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/147/#p153\">\n    549 U.S. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553521\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/147/#p153\">\n    127 S.Ct. 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553521\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/147/#p153\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (certification is a jurisdictional requirement for state prisoners, under \u00a7 2244(b)(3) );\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Commissioners correctly note that certain claims can be raised only in a habeas suit: those that, if successful, \"would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of [the prisoner's] confinement or its duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson v. Dotson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5883802\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/74/#p82\">\n    544 U.S. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5883802\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/74/#p82\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5883802\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/74/#p82\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).

Ford's claims, then, have only a probabilistic impact on his custody, which means they were properly raised in a \u00a7 1983 suit. Section 2244(a) thus does not bar Ford's instant suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   3.

In the district court, Ford alleged that, by delaying his hearing, the Commissioners had violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. To prevail on that claim, he needed to prove that (i) the date of his hearing was set in accordance with a legal rule established after he was convicted of his D.C. offense, and (ii) the \"retroactive application of [that rule] create[d] a significant risk of prolonging his incarceration as compared to application of the prior [rule].\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

Under sub-section (e) of that regulation, the date of the first D.C. parole hearing is tied to one of two dates, whichever comes later: (i) the projected parole date for the federal sentence, as described above; or (ii) the so-called \"single parole eligibility date,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.5\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a date that takes into account the parole eligibility date for the D.C. offense standing alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The single parole eligibility date, in particular, turns on an application of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204205\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1976) to an offender's aggregated D.C. and federal sentences. Under that statute, the general rule is that an offender is eligible for parole after serving the lesser of one third of his aggregate sentence or 10 years. The statute makes an exception, however, for situations in which a different eligibility date is \"otherwise provided by law.\" The \"otherwise provided by law\" clause comes into play if an offender's D.C. parole eligibility date-that is, the date on which he finishes serving his D.C. minimum sentence-is later than the eligibility date otherwise prescribed by \u00a7 4205(a). In such a case, the D.C. eligibility date controls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chatman-Bey v.

Based on his aggregate sentence of 70 years, \u00a7 4205(a) 's general rule would produce a parole eligibility date 10 years from the date of incarceration (which is less than one-third of the aggregate sentence). But because the D.C. eligibility date would be 20 years, the 20-year date for the D.C. offense would supersede the 10-year date as the single parole eligibility date. Now say that the Commission had set the offender's projected federal parole date as 15 years from the date of incarceration. Because the 20-year single parole eligibility date is later than the 15-year projected parole date for the federal sentence, then under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.65\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), the first D.C. parole hearing would be tied to the 20-year single parole eligibility date.

Complaint at \u00b6 48; Commissioners' Motion for Summary Judgment at 17. His projected federal release date, of November 22, 2005, was later than the single parole eligibility date. And because his federal parole date came after his single parole eligibility date, the deadline to hold his first D.C. parole hearing was tied to his federal parole date-in particular, four months before that date, or July 22, 2005.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.65\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Appointed amicus does not contend that the Commission misapplied\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.65\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) in scheduling Ford's first D.C. parole hearing for 2005 rather than 2000. Instead, appointed amicus contends that the regulation itself is unlawful because it conflicts with D.C. and federal statutes. Appointed amicus's first argument is that the regulation cannot be squared with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-409\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 24-409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we agree with that argument, we have no occasion to consider whether the regulation also conflicts with other D.C. or federal statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 24-409 provides that the Commission \"shall have and exercise the same power and authority\" over D.C. offenders housed in federal prisons as the (now-defunct) D.C. Board of Parole once exercised over D.C. offenders housed in D.C. prisons. (The statute refers to the Commission as the U.S. Board of Parole, which was the agency's title until 1976.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parole Commission and Reorganization Act, Pub. L. No. 94-233, \u00a7 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%20219\">\n    90 Stat. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233 (1976) ). As explained above, if the D.C. Board of Parole had applied D.C. parole guidelines to Ford's case, without regard to his federal offense, the Board would have been obligated to hold his first parole hearing as soon as he served his minimum D.C. sentence-that is, in May 2000.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20200.3\">\n    D.C.

So, appointed amicus argues, if the Commission has the \"same power\" as the Board, then the Commission was also obligated to hold Ford's first parole hearing in May 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Commissioners concede that \u00a7 24-409 covers offenders serving aggregated D.C. and federal sentences, not just those serving D.C. sentences in federal prisons. The Commissioners also concede that \u00a7 24-409 requires that, when they conduct D.C. parole proceedings, they apply the D.C. guidelines governing whether an offender is suitable for parole.

Were it otherwise,\n   the court explained, \u00a7 24-409\"would lose much of its force\"; the statute's mandate that the Commission \"apply D.C. parole suitability guidelines would mean little if [the Commission] were permitted to delay [the guidelines'] application in accordance with a federal regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court held that, as a general matter, \u00a7 24-409 requires the Commission to hold an offender's original D.C. parole hearing at (or shortly before) his D.C. parole eligibility date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court \"carve[d] an exception,\" however, for offenders like Ford with projected federal parole dates later than their D.C. parole eligibility dates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In such cases, the court held, the Commission can delay the offender's first D.C. parole hearing until shortly before his federal parole date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That delay is warranted, the court believed, for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, the court noted, regardless of when the first D.C. parole hearing takes place, the offender would need to remain in prison on his federal sentence until his federal parole date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, the court concluded that delaying an offender's first D.C. parole hearing until his federal parole date does not substantially injure him; he would enjoy only an \"incremental benefit\" if the hearing were held at his D.C. eligibility date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court observed that, under our court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Chatman-Bey\n   </em>\n   , an offender's single parole eligibility date as prescribed by \u00a7 4205 can be later than his D.C. parole eligibility date. And if an offender's eligibility date can be delayed beyond his D.C. eligibility date until the date set by \u00a7 4205, the court thought, then the D.C. hearing can be delayed until the offender's projected federal parole date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 618-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3. We agree with the Seventh Circuit's conclusion that \u00a7 24-409 generally requires the Commission to hold an offender's first D.C. parole hearing at his D.C. parole eligibility date. But in our view, that rule also applies to offenders like Ford who become eligible for D.C. parole before their projected federal parole date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The text of \u00a7 24-409 makes no exception for offenders in that position. Instead, the text applies generally-and equally-to all offenders \"convicted in the District of Columbia of crimes.\" We perceive no basis in the terms of the statute to draw a distinction between offenders who become eligible for D.C. parole before their projected federal parole date and those who become eligible for D.C. parole after their projected federal parole date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   court grounded its support of such a distinction, not in the statutory text, but in other considerations. Respectfully, we do not understand those considerations to justify the distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, it is undoubtedly true that an offender in Ford's position cannot be released from prison until he is paroled from both his D.C. and federal sentences.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863140\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/612/\">\n    961 F.2d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But an offender can be paroled from one sentence first and still remain incarcerated until he is paroled from the other. That is Ford's current situation; he was paroled from his federal sentence in August 2005 but remains in prison serving his D.C. sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, an offender serving both D.C. and federal sentences seemingly could gain more than an \"incremental benefit\" if his D.C. parole hearings began at the time of his D.C. parole eligibility instead of being delayed until his federal parole date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863140\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To see why, it is necessary to understand how the relevant D.C. parole guidelines operate in an offender's first parole hearing and in any rehearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In an offender's first hearing, the Commission uses various offender characteristics to calculate what is known as a \"salient factor score\" (or SFS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20204.4\">\n    D.C.

For one thing, even if an offender has just a single hearing before his federal parole date, when he later has his first rehearing, the more lenient, rehearing-specific point scale will apply. For another, at that rehearing, the offender can obtain a second deduction for rehabilitative efforts. Finally, if an offender's D.C. parole eligibility date is several years before his projected federal parole date, then he could potentially have several D.C. parole hearings before being paroled from his federal sentence. That would give him the opportunity to reduce his SFS over time and thereby obtain an earlier D.C. release date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Consider, for example, an offender with a D.C. eligibility date six years before his federal parole date. Even if that offender had an SFS of 5 at his first D.C. parole hearing, he could, through persistent rehabilitative efforts, reduce his score to 0 by the time of his federal parole date, provided the Commission held rehearings each year as it \"ordinarily\" does.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20104.2\">\n    D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 28, \u00a7 104.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). He then could be paroled from his D.C. and federal sentences simultaneously, which would not be the case if his D.C. parole hearings were delayed until his federal release. In light of those substantial potential benefits from holding D.C. parole hearings as soon as an offender is eligible for D.C. parole, we cannot write off the inconsistency between the Commission's regulation and \u00a7 24-409 as immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   court noted, finally, that under our decision in\n   <em>\n    Chatman-Bey\n   </em>\n   , an offender's single parole eligibility date might be later than the D.C. eligibility date (i.e., the parole eligibility date that would apply if the offender were serving a D.C. sentence but not a federal one).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863140\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/612/\">\n    961 F.2d at 618-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That would happen if the eligibility date dictated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204205\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) were later than the D.C. eligibility date.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.B.1. But while\n   <em>\n    Chatman-Bey\n   </em>\n   contemplates that an offender's single parole eligibility date in that situation would be later than his D.C. eligibility date, this case involves the date\n   of a D.C. parole\n   <em>\n    hearing\n   </em>\n   , not the date of parole\n   <em>\n    eligibility\n   </em>\n   . And for the reasons we have explained, Ford's initial D.C. parole hearing should have been in 2000, not 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We recognize that, in reaching a different conclusion on that issue than the\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   court did, our decision could result in the Commission's applying different rules to offenders serving aggregated D.C. and federal sentences depending on where the offenders are incarcerated. But we must give effect to the terms of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-409\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 24-409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as we understand them, regardless of the implications for the Commission's administration of parole hearings in other jurisdictions. Additionally, the burdens on the Commission from having to keep track of distinct rules for different jurisdictions will depend on the number of affected offenders; and as the Commissioners acknowledged at oral argument, there are only about a dozen parole-eligible offenders presently serving aggregated D.C. and federal sentences in federal prison (and that population will naturally dissipate over time).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In short, we hold that, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-409\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 24-409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ford should have received his first parole hearing as soon as he finished serving his D.C. minimum sentence-in May 2000. As a remedy for that unlawful delay, appointed amicus suggests an order requiring the Commission to (i) reconsider each of its prior parole decisions, this time assuming that Ford had received his first parole hearing in May 2000, and (ii) hold a new parole hearing at which each of the reconsidered prior decisions can be taken into account. We conclude that the suggested remedy is appropriate. We of course express no view about the outcome of the new parole hearing, a decision that rests with the Commission alone in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   4. In addition to arguing that the delay in Ford's initial D.C. parole hearing violates D.C. and federal statutes, appointed amicus also contends that the delay violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. The remedy for that alleged constitutional violation, appointed amicus says, should be the same as the remedy for the alleged statutory violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This case, then, is one in which a party has raised both constitutional and statutory claims, and, by winning on the latter, has secured \"all the relief [the party] seeks.\"\n   <em>\n    Nw.

We find those arguments unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   1. Appointed amicus contends that the Commissioners violated the Ex Post Facto by repeatedly denying Ford parole on the ground that he had three murder convictions. Again, parole authorities violate the Ex Post Facto Clause when (i) they apply parole guidelines promulgated after an offender was convicted, and (ii) that \"retroactive application ... creates a significant risk of prolonging [the offender's] incarceration as compared to application of the prior guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    766 F.3d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (formatting modified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the district court, Ford alleged (and the Commissioners agreed) that, when he was convicted of his D.C. offense, the parole guidelines in effect were those published in 1987. Complaint at \u00b6 16; Answer at 5. Under the 1987 guidelines, if an\n   offender's adjusted SFS indicates that he should be released but he has an \"[u]nusually extensive and serious prior criminal record ( [meaning] at least five felony convictions),\" then the D.C. Board can depart from the SFS scale and deny him parole. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 28, app. 2-1 (1987). In a 1991 Policy Guideline, the D.C. Board interpreted that departure provision to apply only when an offender's five convictions were for certain enumerated felonies. Joint App. 167-68. Under the 2000 guidelines, on the other hand, the Commission can deny parole to any offender with a \"[p]rior record of violence more extensive or serious than that taken in account in the guidelines\"-regardless of how many convictions the offender has, or the specific crimes of which he was convicted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(2)(ii)(A) (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, the Commission's stated grounds for denying Ford parole in 2005, 2012, and 2016 were his three murder convictions. And in 2010, the Commission's stated grounds were the three murders, as well as his 1958 conviction for housebreaking (which is not a qualifying felony under the 1991 Policy Guideline) and his 1965 conviction for robbery (which is a qualifying felony). According to appointed amicus, each of those four denials was impermissible under the 1987 guidelines as interpreted by the 1991 policy guideline. That is so, appointed amicus says, because three murders-or three murders and a robbery-do not five felony convictions make. On the other hand, appointed amicus notes, Ford's three murder convictions were a permissible reason to deny him parole under the 2000 guidelines. Thus, appointed amicus concludes, when the Commission explicitly relied on Ford's three murder convictions, it revealed it was retroactively applying the 2000 guidelines, which worked to Ford's detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Assuming arguendo that the Commission did apply the 2000 guidelines at Ford's parole hearings, appointed amicus's argument still fails. We have held that, when the Commission applies the 1987 guidelines, it can \"depart from [the guidelines'] numerical system\" anytime it wishes, \"as long as it 'specifies in writing those factors which it used.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

The guidelines in effect when Ford was convicted, then, would have posed no obstacle if the Commission wished to deny Ford parole based on his three murder convictions. Hence the retroactive application of the 2000 guidelines-which would\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   permit the Commission to deny Ford parole because of his three murder convictions-would not pose a significant risk of increasing Ford's prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   2. Appointed amicus additionally contends that, by repeatedly denying Ford parole because he had three murder convictions, the Commission violated the Due Process Clause. Parole authorities deprive an offender of due process only if their decisions are \"either totally lacking in evidentiary support or [are] so irrational as to be fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    Duckett v.

Cir.2002). Ford committed three murders in three months, breaking into prison to commit one of them. Given those facts, we cannot consider the Commission's decisions to deny Ford parole to have been irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Ford advances various additional arguments in his pro se briefs. We find those arguments to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Commission delayed Ford's rehearing scheduled for October 2015 until February 2016. Ford contends the decision to delay his hearing was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a). When the rehearing was held in February, though, the Commission again denied Ford parole. And unlike the five-year delay in Ford's original hearing-which, as explained above, might have prejudiced him-the four-month delay from October 2015 to February 2016 could not have hurt him because it had no effect on his score under the parole guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Among other things, the Double Jeopardy Clause \"prohibits the government from punishing [an offender] twice ... for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
