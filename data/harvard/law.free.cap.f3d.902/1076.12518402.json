In 2014, the people exercised this power by rejecting Senate Bill 833 (\"SB 833\"), which would have afforded Oregon residents access to driving privileges through the issuance of driver cards without requiring\n   proof of their legal presence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, five Oregon residents who cannot prove their legal presence and two non-profit corporations, subsequently brought this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against various state officials who are responsible for the issuance of Oregon driver's licenses. Plaintiffs allege that the voters' rejection of SB 833 was motivated by discriminatory animus, and that the state officials' consequent refusal to issue driver cards violates their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process. Plaintiffs do not, however, challenge the initial invocation of the referendum power, which suspended the future operation of SB 833 pending voter approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the context of this unchallenged and ongoing suspension of the bill's operation, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III standing. In particular, the court concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish the redressability element of standing because the court could not order the state officials to implement SB 833 and thus issue driver cards. On the circumstances presented here, we agree with the district court that it cannot provide redress for plaintiffs' claimed injury, their inability to obtain or renew driving privileges. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case can be traced to the enactment of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13 (codified in scattered sections Title 8 of the U.S. Code). When the REAL ID Act was enacted, the State of Oregon did not require its residents to prove their legal presence in the United States to obtain driver's licenses. The REAL ID Act, however, altered this framework by providing that, effective May 2008, states must require individuals to prove their legal presence in the United States to obtain any documents that serve as a form of federally approved identification, including driver's licenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note. The REAL ID Act allows states to issue documents conferring driving privileges regardless of immigration status as long as such documents are distinguishable from driver's licenses and other federally approved identification cards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To comply with the requirements of the REAL ID Act, the Oregon Legislature enacted SB 1080 in February 2008. SB 1080 requires applicants for driver's licenses to prove their legal presence in the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20807.021\">\n    Or.

Pursuant to SB 1080, the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\") stopped granting-and presently refuses to grant-driver's licenses to Oregon residents who are unable to prove their legal presence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2013, majorities in both chambers of the Oregon Legislature voted to enact SB 833, the bill at issue in this case, which would restore access to driving privileges for Oregon residents who cannot prove their legal presence in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, SB 833 would authorize state officials to issue limited-use \"driver cards\" consistent with the REAL ID Act. As one of SB 833's sponsors stated during a floor debate in the Oregon House, the main purpose of SB 833 was to \"improve traffic safety and[ ] reduce the number of unlicensed, uninsured drivers on\n   Oregon's roads.\" The governor signed the bill on May 1, 2013, and it was set to take effect on January 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One week after the governor signed SB 833, however, two legislators who had opposed the bill and a third person filed a petition to refer it as a ballot measure to a state-wide referendum for approval or rejection by the people pursuant to article IV, section 1(3)(a) of the Oregon Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In October 2013, the Oregon Secretary of State determined that the petition had received the requisite number of signatures for such referral, and designated SB 833 as Measure 88 for the November 2014 election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As documented in the Official 2014 General Election Voter's Pamphlet, the ensuing Measure 88 campaign was motivated by efforts to curb \"illegal immigration\" and prevent \"illegal immigrants\" from obtaining or renewing their driving privileges. Similar statements singling out \"illegal aliens\" were made in other public settings, including a \"Protect Oregon Driver Licenses\" webpage set up by a group of driver card opponents in May 2013. In addition, statements in the Official 2014 General Election Voter's Pamphlet denounced the \"Mexican\" consular ID as a possible form of identification; the possibility of increased activity by \"Mexican\" drug cartels; and the \"flood\" and \"surge\" of \"Central American minors to our southern border.\" Opposition statements did not mention immigrants of any other race or nationality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 14, 2014, 66% of Oregon voters at the referendum election voted \"No\" on Measure 88, thus rejecting SB 833. As a result, SB 833 never became effective, and the State has not issued driver cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In November 2015, individuals M.S., V.V., J.H., E.D., and M.B. and non-profit corporations Familias en Acci\u00f3n and Los Ni\u00f1os Cuentan (collectively, \"M.S.\") brought this putative class action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Governor Kate Brown and various other state officials in their official capacities (collectively, \"the Governor\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.S., an Oregon resident who is unable to prove her legal presence in the United States, alleges two violations of the Equal Protection Clause and one violation of her substantive due process rights. In particular, she alleges that the voters' rejection of Measure 88 and the Governor's consequent refusal to issue driver cards are unconstitutional because the referendum result was motivated by animus towards Mexicans and Central Americans and not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.S. does not, however,\n   allege that the referral of SB 833 to the voters was itself unconstitutional or otherwise improper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In May 2016, the district court granted the Governor's motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) on the basis that M.S. failed to establish the redressability element of Article III standing. The court noted at the outset that M.S. was not challenging \"the referendum process associated with Measure 88 or any State action taken with respect to the referendum election.\" \"Rather,\" M.S. was challenging \"only the voters' rejection of Measure 88-and, by extension, of SB 833-and the State's alleged refusal to implement SB 833 as a result of the referendum.\" The district court then reasoned that \"even if [it] found the rejection of Measure 88 to be unconstitutional, SB 833 would not become law\" because Measure 88 did not receive the majority voter approval required under the Oregon Constitution once SB 833 was properly referred to the people for a referendum vote. The district court further reasoned that \"[p]rinciples of federalism underlying the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments forbid [it] from directing the State to enact or enforce state laws.\" Thus, the district court concluded, M.S. failed to establish the redressability element of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    M.S. v.

We begin by reviewing relevant principles of standing. Applying those principles, we then consider whether M.S.'s claimed injury-her inability to obtain or renew driving privileges-is redressable through a favorable judicial decision. Because each of M.S.'s requested remedies is either ineffective or beyond the scope of the district court's remedial power, M.S. fails to establish redressability.

Therefore, the question before us is whether M.S.'s inability to obtain or renew driving privileges is redressable through a declaration that the voters' rejection of Measure 88 violated her constitutional rights, and is void and unenforceable. M.S. asserts that such a declaration would render SB 833 effective under Oregon law, thus enabling her to access driving privileges and redressing her claimed injury. In response, the Governor argues that majority voter approval is necessary to effectuate SB 833, and therefore state officials would not be required-indeed, would not have the statutory authority-to issue driver cards even if the declaration were issued.

Thus, the 1968 amendment does not support M.S.'s argument than an unconstitutional \"no\" vote on Measure 88 has the same effect as a valid \"yes\" vote under Oregon law. To the contrary, the legislative committee explanation for the amendment cuts against M.S.'s argument by clarifying that the substantive force of the pre-amendment text-which plainly states that a referendum measure shall take effect upon majority voter approval \"\n   <em>\n    and not otherwise\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)-did not diminish as a result of the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of the current validity of this majority voter approval requirement, we conclude that the requested declaration does not establish redressability. After the Oregon Legislature initially \"enacted\" SB 833, the Act was referred to the people for a referendum vote prior to its taking effect. M.S. does not challenge the legality of that referral.

Nor is it necessarily the case that it would have been achieved even if we assume, as we must, that M.S.'s claims are meritorious.

Although the scope of this pronouncement may be overbroad-as we explain more fully below, federal courts have jurisdiction to order a remedy requiring the enactment of legislation in certain narrow circumstances, such as where fundamental rights are at stake-we agree with it in principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In light of the bedrock democratic principle recognized in these cases, we decline to extend the Supreme Court's \"substantive result\" jurisprudence beyond its current scope.

In\n   <em>\n    Eu\n   </em>\n   , we held that a plaintiff could seek declaratory relief that would have required the California Legislature to amend a state statute to authorize more judgeships and the governor to fill the new positions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516058\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/697/#p701\">\n    979 F.2d at 699, 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, California's legislative process for amending the judgeships statute was not complete-indeed, it may never have begun-at the time we decided the case. Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Eu\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case in two ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, unlike M.S., the plaintiff there alleged that the limited number of judgeships violated the \"\n   <em>\n    fundamental right\n   </em>\n   of access to the courts in civil litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516058\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/697/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516058\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/979/697/#p701\">\n    at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Here, however, M.S. does not challenge the constitutionality of the REAL ID Act or SB 1080, the Oregon law implementing the REAL ID Act, and thus we are presented only with a challenge to the State's failure to effectuate SB 833 after Measure 88 failed to obtain voter approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   M.S. also points to\n   <em>\n    SDDS, Inc. v.

Although the court did not expressly consider the question of standing, its exercise of jurisdiction was nonetheless consistent with the result\n   we reach here. The court had the power to order relief that would effectuate the statute rejected by the voters because, in the absence of a valid initial referral to the voters, the legislative process was complete. Here, in contrast, M.S. does not challenge the initial referral of SB 833 to the voters. After that referral, the legislative process for SB 833 was, and remains today, incomplete pending majority voter approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Eu\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    SDDS\n   </em>\n   are consistent with the basic democratic principle that courts are not an appropriate vehicle for effectuating change from a lawful status quo-here, Oregon's refusal to issue driving privileges without proof of legal presence in the United States-and it is that basic principle which guides our holding today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, to the extent M.S. seeks to invalidate the initial referral of SB 833 to the voters-which, as we have just explained, would effectively render the legislative process complete-such a remedy would not comport with well-settled principles of equity.

Again, M.S. does not allege that the initial referral of SB 833 to the voters was improper in any way. Instead, she challenges only the voters' rejection of Measure 88 and the Governor's subsequent decision to abide by the result of the referendum election. Thus, there is no basis for the district court to invalidate the referral of SB 833 to the voters and the corresponding suspension of the bill's effect.

For present purposes, however, we need not decide whether there are any circumstances in which principles of federalism provide an independent limit on a district court's power to order prospective relief against state officials.

First, M.S. relies on several Oregon cases for the proposition that, \"whether or not the effective date of a law has been suspended, it still is a law and can become operative if certain conditions are met.\" That general proposition is correct, but none of M.S.'s cited cases involves a properly initiated referendum vote that disapproved of a measure and was subsequently ruled unconstitutional. In such circumstances, the \"bill,\" \"measure,\" or ineffective \"law\" referred to the people cannot become operative because the \"condition\" of majority voter approval has not been met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Second, M.S. alludes to the proposition that \"a court will not inquire into the substantive validity of a measure-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , into the constitutionality, legality or effect of the measure's language-unless and until the measure is passed.\"\n    <em>\n     Boytano v.

According to M.S., a \"necessary corollary\" of this principle is that \"a measure which on subsequent review is found to be substantively invalid does not effectively repeal a statute passed by the Legislature.\" The principle stated in\n    <em>\n     Boytano\n    </em>\n    is inapposite here, however, because M.S. does not challenge the \"substantive validity\" of Measure 88. Nor would such a challenge benefit M.S., given that Measure 88 would have provided her access to driver cards. Rather, M.S. challenges the validity of the\n    <em>\n     voters' rejection of Measure 88\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    M.S. alleges that the Governor's ongoing \"refusal to issue driver cards\" is unconstitutional on the ground that she is effectuating the voters' improperly motivated \"no\" votes on Measure 88 at the referendum, not that such votes were themselves unconstitutional acts.
