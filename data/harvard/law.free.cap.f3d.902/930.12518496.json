We hold\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   applies to both layers of the statute. Following this approach, we conclude the definition of \"methamphetamine\" applicable to convictions under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 11378 and 11379(a) is broader than the definition of methamphetamine under the federal Controlled Substances Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the first step in the categorical approach, therefore, a conviction for a methamphetamine offense under \u00a7\u00a7 11378 or 11379(a) does not qualify\n   as a \"controlled substance\" violation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i). We further conclude the methamphetamine element applicable to a conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 11378 or 11379(a) is not divisible, because the different varieties of methamphetamine covered by California law are alternative means of committing a single crime rather than alternative elements of separate crimes. We therefore do not apply the modified categorical approach. Because the methamphetamine element of \u00a7\u00a7 11378 and 11379(a) is overbroad and the modified categorical approach does not apply, we hold a methamphetamine conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 11378 or 11379(a) does not qualify as a controlled substance offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i).

Section 11033 further provides that the term \"isomer,\" unless otherwise defined, \"includes optical and geometrical (diastereomeric) isomers.\" Thus, under California law, a methamphetamine conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 11378 or 11379(a) may involve methamphetamine or it may involve methamphetamine's \"salts, isomers, [or] salts of its isomers,\" including both \"optical and geometrical ... isomers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The CSA likewise applies to \"[a]ny substance\" that \"contains any quantity of methamphetamine, including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20812\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Schedule II(c), Schedule III(a)(3).

As used in schedule I(c), the term \"isomer\" means any\n   optical, positional, or geometric isomer. As used in schedule II(a)(4), the term \"isomer\" means any optical or geometric isomer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Methamphetamine falls under Schedules II(c) (\"any injectable liquid which contains any quantity of methamphetamine, including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers\") and III(a)(3) (\"Any substance (except an injectable liquid) which contains any quantity of methamphetamine, including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers.\"). Thus, for purposes of methamphetamine, the CSA covers only optical isomers. Federal law extends to geometric isomers with respect to substances listed on Schedules I(c) and II(a)(4), but methamphetamine is not included on those schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We have no reason to believe that these distinctions between California and federal law are immaterial. Both California law and federal law go to great lengths to specify the types of isomers covered for specific controlled substances. California law, for example, carefully specifies the controlled substances for which isomers are covered at all. These substances are opiates; opium derivatives; hallucinogenic substances, such as cannabis, peyote and psilocybin; depressants; cocaine base; opium; ecgonine; stimulants, such as amphetamine and methamphetamine; dimethylamphetamine; N-ethylmethamphetamine; gamma hydroxybutyric acid; and fenfluramine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 11054(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), 11055(b)(1)-(2), (b)(7), (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e), 11056(b), (c)(11), 11057(d), (e), (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, like federal law, California law carefully specifies the\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of isomers covered for each controlled substance. Under California's default rule, both optical and geometric isomers are covered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11033. But, like federal law, the California statutes specify exceptions to the default rule. Section 11054(d), relating to hallucinogenic substances, for instance, expands the default definition, stating that, \"for purposes of this subdivision only, the term 'isomer' includes the optical, position, and geometric isomers.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 11056(b) (stimulants) (including \"isomers (whether optical, position, or geometric)\"), 11057(e) (fenfluramine ) (same), (f) (stimulants) (same). Other provisions narrow the default definition, specifying that only optical isomers are included.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 11054(d)(20) (including \"delta 1 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers; delta 6 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers; delta 3,4 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and its optical isomers\"), 11055(d)(1) (\"Amphetamine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of its optical isomers.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, both California law and federal law carefully identify the types of isomers included for various controlled substances. California law includes geometric isomers of methamphetamine, but federal law does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On its face, therefore, the California definition of methamphetamine is broader\n   than the federal definition. Whereas the former includes geometric isomers of methamphetamine, the CSA does not. Accordingly, California law is facially overbroad under the first step in the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275958\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/1034/#p1039\">\n    864 F.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government challenges this conclusion on two grounds, neither of which is persuasive. First, the government contends Lorenzo waived this issue by failing to raise it in his opening brief before this court. Lorenzo's opening brief, however, plainly argued that California law is overbroad because it \"prohibits both optical and geometric isomers of all listed controlled substances,\" whereas the CSA \"punishes the possession of optical isomers alone.\" The government's waiver argument, therefore, is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the government argues Lorenzo's convictions qualify as controlled substance offenses in light of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vega-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054995\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1031/\">\n    822 F.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016). There, the defendant argued that California law was broader than federal law because federal law contains a provision requiring the Attorney General to exclude from the CSA's controlled substance schedules certain non-narcotic substances that are lawfully sold over the counter, without a prescription, under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20811\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). In accordance with this statutory requirement, the Attorney General has promulgated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201308.22\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which excludes 17 over-the-counter pharmaceutical products from the CSA schedules, including Levmetamfetamine (l-Desoxyephedrine), or \"L-meth,\" a substance used in a nasal decongestant produced by Aphena Pharma and in Vicks VapoInhaler, sold by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Noting that no similar exceptions apply under California law, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Vega-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   argued California law was \"fatally overbroad because it criminalizes methamphetamine in all its forms, including its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers without containing an exception for pharmaceutical products that contain 'L-meth,' although federal law excludes a particular product containing L-meth.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054995\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1031/\">\n    822 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We rejected the defendant's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Vega-Ortiz ... maintains that the federal regulation excluding a particular product containing L-meth from the schedule of federal controlled substances renders California's definition of methamphetamine broader than the definition of controlled substances in the Controlled Substances Act. However, in addressing a similar argument regarding an exemption for \"administering\" controlled substances that existed under federal law but not Washington state law, we focused on whether the defendant showed a \"realistic probability\" that a person would be prosecuted for the offense that assertedly rendered the state statute overbroad.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a result, Lorenzo's convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 11378 and 11379(a) do not qualify as controlled substance offenses under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the IJ and the BIA did not consider whether Lorenzo was removable on the ground that his \u00a7 11379(a) conviction constitutes an \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\" aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), we do not address that question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andia v.
