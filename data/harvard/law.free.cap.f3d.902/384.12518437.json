He claims the station subjected him to a hostile work environment because it scheduled him to train under a white co-worker who accosted him with racial epithets. He further contends he was wrongfully terminated because of his race and/or color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although Younge filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations, he chose to litigate his claims in Bankruptcy Court after Tribune filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. When it disallowed his claims, Younge appealed to the District Court. There he challenged for the first time the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction to hear his claims. The District Court held he impliedly consented to the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction. It also concluded the Bankruptcy Court correctly disallowed his hostile work environment and wrongful termination claims. Because we agree, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2008, Younge was hired as a seasonal, part-time technician by WPHL. He was trained by full-time technicians, as he was responsible for covering their vacation schedules between Memorial Day and Labor Day. On May 7, 2008, Younge was scheduled to train with Rick Schultz, an engineering technician. Before Younge's training began, Sandy Kerr, a technician, told him, \"If you run into any trouble tonight[,] make sure you tell me tomorrow.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 08-13141(KJC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n    2016 WL 1122865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr. D. Del. Mar. 18, 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). When he asked Steve Leff, another technician, to explain Kerr's statement, Leff said, \"Schultz has a problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Younge inquired whether Schultz had a problem with him,\n   Leff replied, \"No, he just has a problem.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During his training with Schultz, Younge walked into the room and placed his briefcase on the table. Schultz immediately responded, \"Hey Spike, you want to get this off the table?\" App. at 127a (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming Schultz did not know his name, Younge introduced himself. The former answered, \"[A]s far as [I] am concern[ed,] you are Spike Lee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Younge walked over to Schultz and retorted, \"I told you what my name is,\" and Schultz countered, \"I'll call you anything I want to.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Younge, in an attempt to diffuse the situation, stated, \"[W]hoa, I don't know what's going on here[.] [A]ll you have to do is train me.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 157a (internal quotation marks omitted). Schultz replied, \"I don't work for you, I don't have to listen to you, I don't have to train you, some intern.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Younge told him he was not an intern and had been in the television industry for years, Schultz asked, \"Well[,] why don't you know nothing?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Schultz walked into the adjacent room, and Younge followed him. The argument continued, with both parties yelling and using profanity. At one point, Schultz told Younge to \"take that shit back to the ghetto[,] hommie.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 127a (internal quotation marks omitted). Younge also said, \"Hey motherfucker, use my name[;] motherfucker[,] I dare you to hit me.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 160a (internal quotation marks omitted). Eventually, the station's security officer entered the room and physically separated both men. Ed Elias, the technician-in-charge, called the station and spoke with Younge. He told him to go home and assured him that the station would investigate the incident in the morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next day, Younge called Elias and Michael Hort, a supervisor. After hearing Younge's account of the altercation, one of them said, \"[Y]ou should have never had to deal with that-we have had problems with S[c]hultz before.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 74a (internal quotation marks omitted). On May 12, 2008, Shalona Douglas, a human resources coordinator, called Younge to investigate the incident. She asked him whether he cursed at Schultz. Younge responded that he did. Douglas probed further, inquiring whether Younge remembered what he said. He answered, \"[N]o, I was angry[.] I don't remember.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, she asked if Younge had spit on Schultz. He replied, \"[A]bsolutely not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Douglas also spoke with Schultz and other technicians, including Leff. The latter informed her that Schultz made a number of comments immediately before training Younge. For example, Schultz told other technicians that Younge \"look[ed] like Spike Lee,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 162a (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Douglas submitted her findings to Vincent Giannini, WPHL's Vice President and General Manager. After reviewing them, he concluded both Younge and Schultz should be discharged for violating WPHL's Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy. The station sent termination letters to both men on May 15, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Younge filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations in June 2008 alleging he was subjected to a hostile work environment and wrongfully terminated because of his race and/or color. He forwarded a copy of his complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which notified him that it would not act on his complaint until its Pennsylvania counterpart issued final findings\n   and orders. Younge's claims were based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"); the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    43 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance, Phila., Pa., Code ch. 9-1100\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations began investigating the complaint during the same month. It started by gathering evidence from WPHL and Schultz. The former responded to the agency's questions and provided company records as requested. Schultz also spoke with the Commission. He said that on, May 6, 2008 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the day before he trained Younge), he asked Leff, \"[W]hy are you training a hoop ... who doesn't know anything?\" App. at 159a (internal quotation marks omitted). He also admitted he gave Younge a nickname-\"Spike Lee\"-and acknowledged his own nickname was the \"Nazi.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 163a. Schultz, however, never mentioned whether WPHL's management knew of his nickname before his altercation with Younge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2008, when the Commission's investigation was still ongoing, Tribune and its affiliates (including WPHL) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (for simplicity, we refer to all debtors as \"Tribune\"). Younge responded by filing a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tribune objected to it. Because Younge was not represented by counsel at the time, he filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   response to Tribune's objection. When he obtained counsel, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the claim and allowed Younge's counsel to file a supplemental response that included additional evidence. Tribune, in turn, filed a supplemental reply. After the parties completed briefing, the Court notified them that it was reviewing Tribune's objection,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 59a (docket entry stating \"Judge Carey is reviewing this case\"), and construed it as a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court sustained the objection. It held Younge could not establish a hostile work environment claim because he could not prove\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that WPHL was liable for Schultz's discriminatory behavior because it knew of Schultz's racial animus and failed to take prompt remedial action). In reaching this conclusion, the Court considered Schultz's personnel file and employment history. It noted Schultz had been employed at WPHL since 1972 and had been involved in two other altercations with his co-workers. The first altercation involved accusations of racial bias and occurred in 1993. A security guard was angry that Schultz accidentally tripped a door alarm and accused him of making a racist comment. Schultz, however, denied any type of racial animus, and the letter in his personnel file included his take of the incident. While the second altercation did not contain any allegations of racism, it involved profanity and took place in 2002. In view of this evidence, the Court acknowledged it was \"troubl[ed]\" by the incident from 1993.\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n    2016 WL 1122865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Nonetheless it concluded that a single altercation from 1993 did not \"provide[ ] the [s]tation with notice or reason to know that Schultz would create a hostile work environment\" or \"harass Younge with racial slurs in May 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to the wrongful termination claim, the Bankruptcy Court applied the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/#p802\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/#p802\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/#p802\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) (noting that, after a plaintiff-employee proves a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination, the employer must offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action and the plaintiff may rebut this reason by showing that it is pretextual). It observed that WPHL provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for firing Younge because it discharged him for violating the station's Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy. It concluded Younge failed to show that the station's reasons were pretextual because he admitted he engaged in conduct that was prohibited by WPHL's employment policies. Though Younge pointed to WPHL's favorable treatment of Schultz following his 2002 altercation as evidence of pretext (he only received a written warning), the Bankruptcy Court rejected that argument. It noted Younge provided \"no evidence that the [2002 and 2008 incidents] were of comparable seriousness.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n    2016 WL 1122865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. In the Court's view, \"the best comparator for Younge's [discharge] [was] the [s]tation's treatment of Schultz, who participated in the same incident[,] was investigated at the same time by the same people ... [, and] received the same treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court concluded Younge was not wrongfully terminated because of his race and/or color and disallowed his claim in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Younge appealed to the District Court. He contested the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction for the first time and argued its proceedings violated his due process rights and his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. He also challenged the Bankruptcy Court's decision as to his hostile work environment and wrongful termination claims. The District Court observed that Younge never raised the issue of jurisdiction during bankruptcy proceedings. Instead, he litigated his claim to a final judgment, filing two responses to Tribune's claim objection, appearing at a hearing, and acknowledging that the Court would \"fully evaluate [his] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   , C.A. No. 16-226 (GMS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202622743\">\n    2017 WL 2622743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D. Del. June 16, 2017) (alteration omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting App. at 212a). In light of these actions, the Court held that Younge waived any objection to adjudication in Bankruptcy Court and impliedly consented to its jurisdiction. The District Court also held that the Bankruptcy Court did not violate Younge's due process rights, as it gave him ample opportunities to submit additional evidence, and it did not violate his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial by disallowing his claim. Finally, the District Court affirmed the rulings on Younge's hostile work environment and wrongful termination claims, providing the same reasons as those in the Bankruptcy Court's opinion.

He contends WPHL is strictly liable for Schultz's actions because it made a tangible employment decision to assign him to train with Schultz. In his view, the station knew of Schultz's racial bias because Schultz asked Leff, \"[W]hy are you training a hoop ... who doesn't know anything?\" App. at 159a (internal quotation marks omitted). Younge claims that Schultz made this statement before the altercation and that Leff relayed Schultz's comments on to Hort (as noted, a supervisor) before he trained with Schultz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As a preliminary matter, this contention is waived, as Younge never presented it to the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buncher Co. v.

However, even if we consider it on the merits, WPHL's assignments during employee training were not a tangible employment action, as they did not effect \"a significant change in [Younge's] employment status.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p761\">\n    524 U.S. at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p761\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus Younge cannot prove that WPHL is strictly liable under the first theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability. He may only succeed on his claim if he demonstrates that the station was liable for co-worker harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654094\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/100/#p104\">\n    568 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the prerequisites for employer liability for a co-worker's discriminatory actions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Turning to this point, Younge argues WPHL knew or should have known of Schultz's alleged racial bias. He points out that Hort and Elias told him, \"[W]e have had problems with S[c]hultz before.\" App. at 74a (internal quotation marks omitted). He also asserts that Kerr and Leff were aware that Schultz \"ha[d] a problem\" and could cause \"trouble.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n    2016 WL 1122865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, he tells us Schultz's personnel file includes an incident from 1993 involving racially charged remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While some of these allegations are troubling, they are still not enough to establish that WPHL knew or should have known of Schultz's racial animus. For example, the statements made by Hort, Elias, Kerr, and Leff plainly indicate that Schultz had a \"problem,\" but none of them specify that he exhibited racial animosity toward his colleagues. Although the incident from 1993 gives us pause, it involved disputed accusations of racial bias and occurred 15 years before Younge's altercation with Schultz. There are no similar incidents in Schultz's personnel file that occurred after the 1993 incident. In view of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the station had actual or constructive knowledge of Schultz's alleged racial animus at the time of the altercation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Younge counters that WPHL must have known of Schultz's racial bias, as the latter told the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations that his nickname was \"the Nazi.\" This statement is undoubtedly disturbing. But the law does not tell us to look at Schultz's comments in isolation. Rather, it directs our attention to what WPHL knew or should have known about his conduct while he was employed there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654094\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/100/#p104\">\n    568 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, we may not consider his remarks to the Commission to determine what the station knew (or should have known) when he was its employee. Nor can we make this type of inference based on the record, as Schultz never mentioned whether WPHL's management knew of his nickname during his tenure there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Younge points to Schultz's interview with WPHL's Human Resources Department after the incident. He asserts this interview gave the station adequate knowledge that Schultz exhibited racial bias, as Schultz admitted he used the terms \"Spike Lee\" and \"hoop\" in reference to Younge. App. at 159a-60a. Even if this were true, WPHL discharged Schultz immediately after the interview, taking \"prompt and appropriate remedial action\" once it learned of his comments.\n   <em>\n    Huston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654094\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/100/#p104\">\n    568 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting an employer is liable for co-worker harassment if \"[it] knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action\"). Thus Schultz's statements during his interview are not enough to sustain Younge's hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, nothing in the record allows us to conclude that WPHL had\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability for Schultz's conduct. Although we agree that certain portions of the record are troubling, they do not touch on WPHL's knowledge of Schultz's racial animus-a key facet of Younge's hostile work environment claim. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's holding on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Instead, it lends credibility to the station's rationale and forces Younge to rely on the second prong to demonstrate pretext and survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Turning to this part of the analysis, Younge argues that a discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating cause for the station's actions because it treated Schultz more favorably after altercations in 1993 and 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p763\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that a plaintiff may prove pretext under the second prong if \"the employer treated other ... similarly situated persons not of his protected class more favorably\"). He contends Schultz remained employed at the station after both incidents and received only a written warning for the altercation in 2002 even though it also involved profanity. Because the incident in 2008 was Younge's first altercation, he claims the station disciplined him more harshly for the same type of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although Younge correctly notes that Schultz was disciplined more leniently for his previous altercations, that is not enough to show that WPHL's reasons for Younge's termination were pretextual. Instead, he must show that Schultz was \"similarly[ ]situated in all respects\"-in other words, he \"dealt with the same supervisor, ... [was] subject to the same standards[,] and ... engaged in the same conduct\" during his earlier altercations.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42493\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/577/#p583\">\n    964 F.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (6th Cir. 1992). Younge has not done so here, as he has not told us whether the station had the same employment policies in 1993 or 2002 or whether Schultz's earlier altercations involved the same degree of yelling, profanity, and disruption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v. Kohler Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533968\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/766/#p776\">\n    335 F.3d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (8th Cir. 2003) (\"To be probative evidence of pretext, the misconduct of more leniently disciplined employees must be of 'comparable seriousness.' \" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/#p802\">\n    411 U.S. at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/#p802\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). Hence we cannot conclude that Schultz's previous altercations are comparable to the altercation between Younge and Schultz in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Younge also contends that the station treated Schultz more favorably after this altercation because the latter received a severance while Younge \"was tossed out on[ ]to the street.\" Younge Br. at 33. But again, Younge and Schultz were not similarly situated in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. Avery Dennison Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9394541\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/676/#p680\">\n    281 F.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"To meet her burden of demonstrating that another employee is 'similarly situated,' a plaintiff must show that there is someone who is directly comparable to her in all material respects.\"). While Younge was a seasonal, non-union employee, Schultz was a full-time, union employee who had been with WPHL since 1972. Accordingly, their tenure and status at the station are not comparable, and the station's failure to give Younge a severance does not indicate its reasons for discharging him were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It follows that Younge cannot demonstrate that WPHL terminated his employment out of discriminatory hostility. There is no comparator that suggests WPHL's decision was guided by racial bias or some other \"illegitimate factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Fuentes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844547\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/759/#p763\">\n    32 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, as the Bankruptcy Court aptly observed, \"the best comparator for Younge's firing is the [s]tation's treatment of Schultz, who participated in the same incident and was investigated at the same time by the same people. It is undisputed that [Younge and Schultz] received the same treatment,\" as both were terminated for violating the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy.\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201122865\">\n    2016 WL 1122865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Hence Younge cannot show that WPHL's reason for firing him was pretextual. As the Bankruptcy Court and District Court reached the same conclusion, we concur with their decision on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Younge challenges the Bankruptcy Court's statutory and constitutional authority to decide his employment discrimination claims and asks if he can recover for an incident of racial harassment by Schultz, a co-worker at WPHL. We lack any basis to question the Court's authority at this stage, as Younge never objected to it during bankruptcy proceedings and instead knowingly and voluntarily submitted to the Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   When we turn to the merits, we also see no reason to disturb the District Court's decision affirming that of the Bankruptcy Court. Although Schultz exhibited racial animosity toward Younge, we cannot impute liability to WPHL for a hostile work environment claim because we have no evidence that it had knowledge of Schultz's racial bias at the time of the incident. Similarly, we cannot say that Younge was wrongfully terminated because WPHL provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his discharge. More importantly, its rationale was not pretextual because Younge and Schultz were both fired for engaging in the same conduct. Younge gives us no examples of similarly situated individuals who were disciplined more leniently for the same type of conduct. Without this type of evidence, we cannot rule in his favor. Thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Because Younge opted to litigate in Bankruptcy Court, his proceedings before the Pennsylvania Commission on Human Relations were automatically stayed.
