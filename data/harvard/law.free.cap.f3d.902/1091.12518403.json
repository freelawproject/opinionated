Barone now appeals from the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees on all of her claims. We affirm the district court respecting her First Amendment retaliation claim, reverse the district court concerning her prior restraint claim, and reverse and remand on the issue of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2003, Barone began working for the Springfield Police Department (Department) as a Community Service Officer II (CSO II). She focused on victim advocacy, and served as a Department liaison to the City's minority communities. Throughout her tenure, members of the Latino community complained to Barone about racial profiling by the Department. She relayed these complaints to Department leadership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These complaints became more frequent beginning in spring 2013. Around that same time, the Department was in the midst of a leadership transition, which led to, among other things, Tim Doney's appointment as Chief of Police. As directed, Barone drafted her job description and sent it to Chief Doney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2014, the Department began investigating Barone in connection with two Department-related incidents. The first incident involved a school tour Barone led through the Department. During the tour, some students took photos of restricted areas, where no photo taking was permitted. Department employees disputed whether Barone had asked for, and received, approval for the students to photograph each unit. In the second incident, a Latina notified Barone of a potential crime. Barone was unable to reach a sergeant about this crime, but she left a message with the dispatchers and asked the sergeant to return her call. The sergeant never returned her call because he said he did not know the phone call pertained to a possible crime. The parties disputed whether Barone informed the dispatchers that she wanted to speak to the sergeant about an alleged crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 5, 2015, Barone spoke at a City Club of Springfield event headlined \"Come Meet Thelma Barone from the Springfield Police Department.\" The Department paid her to attend the event; she wore her uniform; and her supervisor attended. She understood that she attended and participated in the event as a representative of the Department. A member of\n   the audience at the event asked her whether she was aware of increasing community racial profiling complaints. She said that she \"had heard such complaints.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A week later, Chief Doney placed Barone on administrative leave due to her alleged untruthfulness in connection with investigations into the two pre-2015 occurrences. Almost a month later, the Department found that Barone had violated several sections of the Department's code of conduct, and she remained on administrative leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Department's investigation of the two incidents continued into the summer. In July 2015, the Department suspended Barone for four weeks without pay, and informed her that she would be required to sign a Last Chance Agreement (the Agreement) when she returned to work. Barone, her union representative, and Chief Doney met to discuss the Agreement on the day that Barone returned to work. At the meeting, Chief Doney provided Barone with a copy of the Agreement, told her to review it, and told her that the Department would terminate her if she did not sign it. A week later, Barone refused to sign the original Agreement because it prohibited her from reporting on racial profiling and discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At a subsequent meeting, Chief Doney provided Barone with an amended Agreement that addressed her stated concerns with the original Agreement. Paragraph 5(g) of the amended Agreement barred Barone from saying or writing anything negative about the Department, the City, or their employees. However, she could report complaints involving discrimination or profiling by the Department. The amended Agreement also provided that Barone would remain subject to a generally applicable order that barred her from publicly criticizing or ridiculing the Department and barred her from releasing confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the second meeting, Barone did not express concern about any particular provision of the amended Agreement. Nevertheless, after speaking with her representative, Barone refused to sign the Agreement as amended. Because Barone refused to sign the amended Agreement, Chief Doney terminated her employment with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Barone sued the City, Chief Doney, Department Lieutenant Tom Rappe, City Manager Gino Grimaldi, and Human Resources Director Greta Utecht for First Amendment retaliation, and imposing an unlawful prior restraint. In May 2016, the district court denied Barone's motion for partial summary judgment on her prior restraint claim. In April 2017, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on Barone's claims.

First Amendment Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We turn first to Barone's First Amendment retaliation claim, in which she asserts that Appellees retaliated against her after\n   she spoke at the February 2015 City Club event. We affirm the district court, and conclude that Barone's First Amendment retaliation claim fails because she spoke as a public employee, so her speech was not protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First Amendment retaliation claims are analyzed under the five-factor inquiry described in\n   <em>\n    Eng v.

Barone must show that (1) she spoke on a matter of public concern; (2) she spoke as a private citizen rather than a public employee; and (3) the relevant speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Coomes v. Edmonds Sch. Dist.

If Barone establishes such a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate that (4) it had an adequate justification for treating Barone differently than other members of the general public; or (5) it would have taken the adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012970\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1062/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Eng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012970\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1062/\">\n    552 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1070-72 ). \"[F]ailure to meet any [factor] is fatal to the plaintiff's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Dahlia v.

Barone's speech-responding to a citizen inquiry about racial profiling by the Department-is a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connick v.

The second prong of\n   <em>\n    Eng\n   </em>\n   is key to the outcome of the First Amendment retaliation claim in this case. Specifically, did Barone speak as a private citizen or as a public employee at the City Club event?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Supreme Court's foundational case in this area of the law, the Court held that a school district violated a teacher's right to free speech when it fired him for writing a letter to a local newspaper that criticized a school board decision concerning a local tax issue.\n   <em>\n    Pickering v.

In concluding that the teacher spoke as a private citizen, the Court noted that the teacher's statements were not \"directed towards any person with whom [the teacher] would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work\" and the publication of the letter did not \"interfere[ ] with the regular operation of the schools generally.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/#p564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/#p564\">\n    at 569-70, 572-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/#p564\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court provided further guidance on public employee speech in\n   <em>\n    Garcetti v.

One of her self-defined regular duties was \"develop[ing] and provid[ing] presentations and trainings ... to the general public describing our services and how we have implemented cultural considerations when assisting victims of crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With this background in mind, Barone's speech at the City Club event clearly fell within her job duties. She was speaking at a \"community event\" with \"the general public\" where she was describing the Department's services and discussing issues relevant to the Hispanic community. Barone characterized this meeting to her superiors as part of the Department's \"outreach to multicultural communities.\" She was also aware that she was speaking as a representative of the Department and discussing her work with the Department. Moreover, the speech at issue was a response to an inquiry about racial profiling complaints, a type of complaint she regularly received in her capacity as a CSO II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is true that this communication was \"outside of [her] chain of command,\" which can be relevant \"particularly in a highly hierarchical employment setting such as law enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Dahlia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721417\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/1060/\">\n    735 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this lone factor is not enough to transform employee speech into private citizen speech. Barone's job as a CSO II is apart from the typical hierarchical employment ladder in a police department. Her job\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   her to interact and communicate with the public. Therefore, this case is distinct from other cases involving more typical law enforcement employees, such as a prison official who writes letters to a state senator about sexual misconduct at the prison,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freitag v. Ayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453779\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/528/#p545\">\n    468 F.3d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545-46 (9th Cir. 2006), or a police officer who issues press releases while serving as the president of the police officer union,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellins v.

The Department spokesperson's duties focus on interactions with the media, such as fostering dialogue with the media, preparing press releases, and serving as a contact person for media inquiries. In contrast, Barone was interacting with the public, not the media, at the City Club event. An employee does not speak as a citizen merely because the employee directs speech towards the public, or speaks in the presence of the public, particularly when an employee's job duties include interacting with the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brandon v.

While members of the public spoke and asked her questions at the event, she had special access to the event because of her position, highlighted by the event's title: \"Come Meet Thelma Barone from the Springfield Police Department.\" Not only did Barone's speech fall within the \"tasks [she] was paid to perform,\"\n   <em>\n    Ellins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550911\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1049/#p1059\">\n    710 F.3d at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Eng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012970\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1062/\">\n    552 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1071 ), but she spoke while clothed in official attire, while\n   on the clock, and in a location she had access to by virtue of her position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266269\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/813/#p823\">\n    869 F.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a high school coach was a public employee when he engaged in expressive conduct at a school event, wearing school attire, while on duty, and while in a location that he had access to by virtue of his position).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Barone alternatively argues that her job required her to work with communities of color to handle complaints, but the speech here was answering a citizen's question. This argument also fails. Barone's job involved handling complaints and, at a general level, working with the Hispanic community to build trust between the Springfield Hispanic community and law enforcement. Barone's speech was in response to a question\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   racial profiling complaints. Her answer, at an event that falls within her job duties, is \"inextricably intertwined\" with her duties as a CSO II.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hagen v. City of Eugene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725784\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/1251/#p1259\">\n    736 F.3d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1259 (9th Cir. 2013) (concluding plaintiff spoke as a public employee where he raised \"concerns about SWAT safety,\" which was \"inextricably intertwined with his duties as a K-9 officer\" despite no \"formal written duty to do so\"). Moreover, even if answering the question had fallen hypothetically outside of Barone's job duties, she did not cease speaking as a public employee when the conversation moved briefly beyond the narrow range of topics included within her job duties when she attended an event in her official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837849\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/954/#p966\">\n    658 F.3d at 967-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding a teacher does not cease acting as a teacher when \"the conversation moves beyond the narrow topic of curricular instruction\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266269\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/813/#p823\">\n    869 F.3d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (adopting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's reasoning for coaches).

Barone was the listed speaker in the City Club event's advertisement, her supervisors were aware of the event, and one of her supervisors attended the event. There is no evidence that her supervisors instructed her not to speak at this event or instructed that she limit her speech to a certain topic, such as domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, Barone was fulfilling her professional duty as a CSO II for the Department when she spoke at the City Club event. Because she spoke as a public employee, and not as a private citizen, her speech was unprotected, and her First Amendment retaliation claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Chief Doney required Barone to sign the amended Agreement in order to keep her job, and he fired Barone when she refused to sign it. Because the amended Agreement fails to pass muster under the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   test, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellees on Barone's prior restraint claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[C]itizens do not surrender their First Amendment rights by accepting public employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581603\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2369/#p2379\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, the broad policy forbade speech about the best K-9 training protocols, and officers were prohibited from conveying their personal opinions about any aspect of the K-9 or interdiction programs to legislators and community groups, neither of which fell within the officers' official duties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the policy reached speech made by the officers in their capacities as citizens on matters of public concern, and the policy was subject to the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balancing test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    at 862, 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Paragraph 5(g) restricts even more speech than the policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   . First, Paragraph 5(g)'s restriction is not limited to a particular subject matter, unlike the restriction in\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   : Paragraph 5(g) flatly bars Barone from speaking negatively about the Department, the City, or their employees. Second, while a bar on only disparaging or negative speech is narrower than a prohibition on all speech, the prohibition on negative speech \"suggests that, to the extent [Paragraph 5(g) ] is targeted at all, it is targeted at speech\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   made pursuant to [Barone's] official duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   , there is a lack of \"qualification regarding what types of information or opinions\" are subject to Paragraph 5(g).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    at 862-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Paragraph 5(g) does not forbid speech only in Barone's capacity as an employee. The only limiting language in Paragraph 5(g) is that Barone may report complaints of discrimination or profiling by the Department. This one clarification does not remedy an otherwise broad and open-ended prohibition on \"anything\" related to the Department or the City. Indeed, this language would sweep in any disagreement about the City's services, employees, or elected officials, including speech on topics or individuals that do not overlap with Barone. For example, Paragraph 5(g)'s plain language would bar Barone from criticizing the City's cleanliness, water quality, or tax and revenue policies. Commenting on these topics is well beyond Barone's duties as a CSO II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Appellees' argument that Paragraph 5(g) was not intended to reach private citizen speech fails.

Once the officer's website became public, the officer's \"indecent public activities\" undermined that respect, the public began denigrating other officers, potential recruits questioned other officers about the website, and the department feared that the website would reduce its ability to recruit female officers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644060\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/918/#p928\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With this specific conduct in mind, we held that the government adequately justified its disciplinary action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   , we rejected the government's justification that it sought to \"ensur[e] effective operation of the agency without disruption\" by preventing officers from speaking to non-law enforcement entities about certain police programs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    868 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Appellees, these previous accusations and Barone's recent investigation may cause her to discuss publicly her displeasure with the Department.

In turn, the City of Springfield Charter, governing the city council, delegates to the City Manager the authority to \"prescribe rules governing the non-discriminatory recruitment, selection, promotion, compensation, transfer, demotion, suspension, layoff and dismissal of City employees.\" The City Charter does not delegate any authority to the Chief of Police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Barone argues that the City Manager was not the final policymaker by reading the City Charter in an unduly narrow fashion. She contends that the City Charter did not grant the City Manager the sole authority over personnel decisions, but rather the authority only to more broadly \"prescribe rules\" about personnel decisions. This argument is unconvincing. First, she points to no authority that supports this distinction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, and more importantly, the City Charter delegated the pertinent final policymaking authority to the City Manager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final policymaker is the individual who had authority in the particular area where the constitutional violation occurred.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n    491 U.S. at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218818\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/701/#p737\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (examining whether a supervisor \"possessed final policymaking authority in the area of employee transfers\" when a plaintiff alleged he was transferred because of his race). In this case, the relevant area of policymaking is employee discipline because the constitutional violation was requiring Barone to sign the amended Agreement in order to keep her position at the Department. This decision was within the purview of the City Manager under the City Charter-requiring Barone to sign the amended Agreement was a \"rule[ ] governing\" her \"suspension, layoff and dismissal.\" The City Charter therefore delegated final policymaking authority to the City Manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the City Charter delegated final policymaking authority to the City Manager, we now consider whether he delegated final policymaking authority over employee discipline in the Department to Chief Doney. Appellees liken this case to\n   <em>\n    Gillette v. Delmore\n   </em>\n   , wherein we concluded that a fire chief's decision to discipline a fire fighter did not trigger\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability because the city charter \"grant[ed] authority to make City employment policy only to the City Manager and the City Council.\" 979 F.2d at 1350. The fire chief possessed \"the discretionary authority to hire and fire employees,\" but this authority was \"not sufficient to establish a basis for municipal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1350. Appellees argue that, similar to the fire chief in\n   <em>\n    Gillette\n   </em>\n   , Chief Doney possessed only discretionary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We disagree. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Gillette\n   </em>\n   failed to provide evidence that the City Manager delegated final policymaking authority to the fire chief.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Gillette points to neither law nor evidence that suggests the district court erred in relying on or interpreting the applicable municipal law to determine who made final employment policy for the City.\"). In contrast, the record before us contains evidence that the City Manager delegated his final policymaking authority over employee discipline in the Department to Chief Doney. For example, Chief Doney conceded that \"the buck stops\" with him \"[w]ithin the department\"; Director Utecht admitted that \"whatever decision [Chief Doney] made, the city manager would support in this case\"; and the City Manager testified that he had \"no role\" in the decision to fire or discipline Barone. These statements create a triable issue of material fact about who possessed final policymaking authority on employee discipline for the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether the City Manager delegated final policymaking authority to Chief Doney, the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the City. If the City Manager delegated the relevant authority to Chief Doney, the City would be liable under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   for Chief Doney's decision to require Barone to sign the amended Agreement.
