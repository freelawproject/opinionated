In his second \u00a7 2255 motion, Hodge argued that his ACCA-enhanced sentence is now invalid: Without the ACCA's residual clause, Hodge contended, his reckless-endangerment conviction no longer qualifies as an ACCA predicate. And, without the reckless-endangerment conviction, he has only two ACCA predicates-the July 1992 and July 1998 Maryland convictions for felony possession of cocaine with attempt to distribute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Initially, the Government agreed. In its response to Hodge's \u00a7 2255 motion, the Government conceded that the reckless-endangerment conviction was not a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA post-\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   . Because an ACCA sentence enhancement requires three predicate offenses and Hodge had only two, the Government recommended that Hodge be resentenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ten days later, however, the Government reversed course. In a supplemental response to Hodge's \u00a7 2255 motion, the Government argued that Hodge continued to qualify for the ACCA sentence enhancement notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   because he had a third conviction for Maryland felony possession of cocaine with attempt to distribute from March 1992. The Government asserted that this conviction-like Hodge's July 1992 and July 1998 convictions for the same offense-qualifies as an ACCA predicate, even though the PSR did not identify it as one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2016, the district court denied Hodge's second \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    Hodge v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207480397\">\n    2016 WL 7480397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 29, 2016). The court assumed without deciding that Maryland's misdemeanor reckless-endangerment offense no longer qualifies as an ACCA predicate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. But the court agreed with the Government that Hodge's March 1992 conviction for felony possession of cocaine with intent to distribute does qualify as an ACCA predicate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court reasoned that, when presented with a\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 2255 motion, courts \"should ordinarily examine the defendant's entire criminal record to determine whether he has three qualifying convictions for an ACCA-enhanced sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Because Hodge's record contained three convictions that could qualify as ACCA predicates, the court determined that Hodge was properly sentenced as an armed career criminal under the ACCA and was not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court nonetheless issued a certificate of appealability, and Hodge timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin by noting that Hodge's \u00a7 2255 motion is procedurally proper. Federal prisoners who seek relief in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must show that their claim relies on either newly\n   discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(b)(4) (providing that \"district court shall dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements\" in \u00a7 2244(b)(2) );\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   -based \u00a7 2255 motion relies on a new rule of constitutional law, and thus clears this procedural hurdle, when the petitioner's ACCA-enhanced sentence \"may have been predicated on application of the now-void residual clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277532\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/850/677/#p682\">\n    850 F.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Government has conceded that Hodge's ACCA enhancement was predicated on application of the residual clause because Hodge's Maryland reckless-endangerment conviction-one of the three predicate convictions supporting that enhancement-\"only could qualify as a 'violent felony' under the 'residual clause.' \" J.A. 122. We therefore proceed to the merits of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To prevail on a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, the petitioner must show that his sentence is unlawful on one of the grounds specified in \u00a7 2255(b).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the PSR's apparently intentional exclusion of some convictions from the group of convictions supporting an enhancement tells the defendant that he need not challenge the excluded convictions. Requiring defendants to object to these excluded convictions in anticipation of arguments the Government might make in a subsequent proceeding would undermine the adversarial process: It would place defense counsel in the precarious position of flagging potential predicates that neither the U.S. Probation Office nor the Government had contemplated, likely to the defendant's detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, because the PSR designated only three convictions as ACCA predicates, Hodge did not have adequate notice that additional convictions would be used to support his ACCA sentence enhancement. The PSR plainly excluded the March 1992 possession-with-intent-to-distribute-cocaine conviction from the group of designated ACCA predicates-even though the group of designated predicates included two convictions for the same offense. That the March 1992 conviction was for the same offense as two designated convictions strongly suggests that its exclusion was deliberate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.
