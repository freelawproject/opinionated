Twenty-four years after he first applied for asylum, Quiroz Parada petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We conclude that the record compels a finding of past persecution, and that substantial evidence does not support the agency's determination that the government successfully rebutted the presumption of future persecution. We also conclude that the agency erred as a matter of law in denying Quiroz Parada's application for CAT relief. Accordingly, we grant the petition and hold that Quiroz Parada is eligible for asylum and entitled to withholding of removal, and remand for reconsideration of his CAT claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Quiroz Parada, a native and citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States without authorization on May 25, 1991 at the age of seventeen. Quiroz Parada has continuously resided in the United States for the last twenty-seven years, and currently lives in Arizona with his wife and three children, the latter of whom are United States citizens. He is the sole provider for his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the Salvadoran civil war of the 1980s and early 1990s, Quiroz Parada and his family were subjected to threats, home invasions, beatings, and killings by FMLN guerillas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Quiroz Parada's family was targeted largely because of his brother's military service during the civil war, and potentially also because of his father's work as an assistant marshal, a role akin to a sheriff. The FMLN apparently found out about the Quiroz Paradas' government connections because some of the family's neighbors were relatives of the guerillas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 1989, FMLN guerillas sought out and murdered Quiroz Parada's brother while he was on leave from the military. Following his brother's assassination, FMLN guerrillas broke into the Quiroz Parada family home on at least three occasions. The guerillas sought to kill other members of the Quiroz Parada family, and, on one occasion, to kidnap Quiroz Parada\n   with the apparent intent to forcibly conscript him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Quiroz Paradas knew the guerillas were specifically targeting their family largely because the FMLN guerillas would begin calling out their family's name upon entering the Quiroz Paradas' village. Although the FMLN's announcements were terrifying, they at least gave the family enough time to hide in the family's well and thus avoid harm during the first several invasions. On another occasion, however, the family did not hear the guerillas approaching in time to hide before the guerillas broke into their home. Quiroz Parada attempted to flee, but was struck by the guerillas, tied up, carried out of his home, and beaten; the guerillas apparently intended to forcibly conscript him. He was only able to escape because the army suddenly arrived at his village, which caused the guerillas to flee-but not before they beat Quiroz Parada, causing him to lose consciousness. Quiroz Parada testified that his family realized after this attack that they were being targeted because of his brother's military service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FMLN guerillas' targeting of the Quiroz Parada family also led to collateral consequences for those around the family. On one occasion, a different group of FMLN guerillas than had committed the previous home invasions mistakenly entered the home of the Quiroz Paradas' neighbors instead. The guerillas kidnapped the neighbor's sons and, upon discovering they had kidnapped the wrong family's sons, returned and murdered the mother in anger over their mistake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Quiroz Parada fled to the United States in 1991 after these incidents, but his family members who remained in El Salvador continued to suffer harm even after the end of the civil war. In 2000, his father received a death threat from a former FMLN guerilla's son, who had become a Mara Salvatrucha (MS) gang member in the intervening years. This familial transition from FMLN guerilla to MS member was apparently common; Quiroz Parada's family members have told him that many sons of former FMLN guerillas are now part of the MS gang. These FMLN descendants have long memories: the MS member who threatened Quiroz Parada's father told him \"You are going to die. Because your family was in the military and killed someone from my family. And one way or another you will die.\" Quiroz Parada's father was killed five years later in a suspicious hit-and-run, which Quiroz Parada believes to have been carried out by the MS member who threatened his father or one of his associates. The threats did not end with his father's death, either: Quiroz Parada's mother was forced to flee their family home after receiving threats from MS gang members whose fathers were FMLN guerillas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Quiroz Parada's family members have warned him not to return to El Salvador because \"history will repeat itself\"-meaning\n   that Quiroz Parada will face kidnapping or death at the hands of the MS gang members who are descendants of FMLN guerillas. As of Quiroz Parada's hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) in 2012, all of his siblings had fled El Salvador.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Quiroz Parada applied for asylum\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and withholding of removal on September 27, 1994. If he is removed to El Salvador, Quiroz Parada fears he will be persecuted on account of his family status and political opinion. The source of that feared persecution is twofold: the MS gang members seeking revenge on behalf of their FMLN guerilla parents, as well as the FMLN itself-despite the fact that the FMLN is currently a political party, rather than a violent revolutionary movement. Because the FMLN is now the ruling political party, Quiroz Parada does not believe he can safely reside in any part of the country without falling victim to retribution by the FMLN. Moreover, simply laying low is not an option: Quiroz Parada believes the FMLN will learn of his return to the country and have the ability to locate him because he no longer has any Salvadoran documentation and would thus be required to renew all of his documents upon arriving in El Salvador. Quiroz Parada also testified that he is opposed to the FMLN's \"leftist wing\" form of democracy and that he would feel compelled to speak out against the FMLN-run government's policies, which he fears would result in persecution by the government. While Quiroz Parada is aware that the civil war ended several decades ago, he does not believe that the Salvadoran government would prosecute former FMLN guerillas if \"they murder people, or behave badly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thirteen years passed before the government took any action on Quiroz Parada's 1994 asylum application. In May 2007, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officer finally interviewed Quiroz Parada. On May 31, 2007, Quiroz Parada's asylum case was referred to an immigration judge; DHS simultaneously issued a notice to appear, charging him with removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(I) for being present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. At a master calendar hearing in February 2008, an IJ sustained the charge of removability. Quiroz Parada requested relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, CAT protection, and cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The delays for Quiroz Parada didn't end there: nearly five years passed between his February 2008 hearing and his merits hearing before an IJ in November 2012. The government submitted its hearing exhibits back in 2008, including a 2007 Department of State Country Report and a 2007 Department of State Profile on El Salvador. Yet for unknown reasons, the government did not update their exhibits during the years that passed between submission of their exhibits and the actual hearing-despite the fact that the country\n   conditions reports were five years out of date by the time of the merits hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Quiroz Parada, by contrast, submitted his exhibits approximately one week before the November 2012 hearing. In addition to a written statement describing his past persecution and fear of future persecution, Quiroz Parada submitted a number of other exhibits corroborating his claims. For example, he submitted a 2010 letter from his sister-written prior to her fleeing the country-imploring him to not return to El Salvador for any reason because of the risk that he will be kidnapped or killed by MS. The letter explained that the \"police do[ ] not help, and they even get killed,\" and warned that if he were to come back to the country, \"history would repeat itself.\" Another one of his sisters sent him a copy of a handwritten threat she received from MS members, which said they knew she \"snitched on the barrio\" and warned her that if she failed to leave the area by a particular date, her \"daughters will suffer the consequences.\" His exhibits also included several newspaper articles about the violence perpetrated by MS in Quiroz Parada's home region; these articles echoed a letter from the National Civil Police of El Salvador describing MS's crimes, the gang's pervasiveness in Quiroz Parada's home region, and how the rampant violence has forced many families to flee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The long-awaited hearing in November 2012 did not begin on a promising note. Prior to hearing any testimony from Quiroz Parada or argument from his attorney, the IJ conveyed his belief that Quiroz Parada's asylum claim \"may be a lost cause.\" Nonetheless, despite the IJ's significant skepticism, he allowed Quiroz Parada's attorney to present Quiroz Parada's case for asylum. On February 8, 2013, the IJ issued a written decision denying Quiroz Parada's requests for asylum, withholding of removal, CAT protection, and cancellation of removal. The IJ first found that Quiroz Parada was credible under both the pre-REAL ID Act and REAL ID Act standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ then determined that Quiroz Parada had not shown past persecution, but further concluded that even if he had, DHS had rebutted the presumption with evidence of changed country conditions. The IJ also found that Quiroz Parada had not shown an independent well-founded fear of future persecution. Because the IJ determined that Quiroz Parada had not established eligibility for asylum through either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, Quiroz Parada necessarily failed to meet the higher bar required to obtain withholding of removal. The IJ also rejected Quiroz Parada's claim for CAT relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Quiroz Parada appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA, which dismissed his appeal. In its decision, the BIA affirmed the IJ's determinations on Quiroz Parada's asylum, withholding, and CAT claims, including the IJ's alternative holding that even if Quiroz Parada had established past persecution, the government had rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA denied relief to Quiroz Parada, but granted him voluntary departure. Quiroz Parada timely petitioned us for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We examine the BIA's \"legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Bringas-Rodriguez v.

Our conclusion is largely driven by the fact that the BIA mischaracterized what Quiroz Parada endured as simply \"threats against his family and attempt[s] to recruit him.\" This glib characterization ignores, among other evidence, his brother's assassination, the murder of his neighbor as a result of his own family being targeted, his experience being captured and beaten to the point of unconsciousness, repeated forced home invasions, and specific death threats toward his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is clear that the harms Quiroz Parada and his family\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   suffered-murder, physical assault, home invasions, and specific death threats-rise to the level of persecution under our precedent. It is, of course, \"well established that physical violence is persecution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(42)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    Li v.

The country reports at issue in this case were already a half-decade out-of-date\n   <em>\n    by the time of the IJ hearing\n   </em>\n   -unlike in\n   <em>\n    Yang\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tambadou\n   </em>\n   , where the country conditions reports were relatively current at the time of the IJ hearings and only became out-of-date while the petitioners waited for their cases to be heard by the BIA and then the federal courts of appeals. The government gave no explanation for why it failed to submit more recent reports before the IJ hearing in 2012, nor can we discern any from our review of the record. The reports are now more than a decade out-of-date-although we note that the eleven-year gap between the reports' publication and our opinion today is still not as long as the thirteen years it took for DHS to process Quiroz Parada's asylum application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But the staleness of the country conditions reports is not the most troubling part of the government's handling of Quiroz Parada's asylum claim. Quiroz Parada suffered past persecution by the FMLN on the basis of his family association and imputed political opinion. At the time of the 2007 country conditions reports, the FMLN had been reconstituted as a political party, but did not have control of either the Salvadoran legislature or the presidency. But in 2009-two years after the publication of the country conditions reports, and three years prior to the IJ hearing-the FMLN rose to power.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ correctly observed that the 2007 country conditions reports did not mention any politically-motivated killings by the government or any mistreatment by the government of people whose families had fought against the FMLN in the civil war. But this does not mean that there was any evidence in the record to rebut Quiroz Parada's fear that an\n   <em>\n    FMLN-run\n   </em>\n   government would engage in such persecution, because the FMLN had not yet taken power at the time of the 2007 reports. Common sense dictates that the government cannot meet its burden of rebutting the presumption by presenting evidence of the Salvadoran government's human rights record at a time when the government was run by a different political party-particularly when the government is now run, as it was at the time of the IJ hearing, by the very same FMLN who persecuted the Quiroz Parada family. The agency's determination that the presumption had been rebutted thus lacks substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because the agency's determination that the government successfully rebutted the presumption of future persecution is unsupported by substantial evidence, we hold that the presumption has not been rebutted and that Quiroz Parada is statutorily eligible for asylum and entitled to withholding of removal, and remand for the Attorney General to exercise his discretion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) as to whether to grant asylum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baballah v.

Criminal gangs are a serious, widespread, and pervasive socio-economic challenge to the security, stability, and welfare of El Salvador. Indeed, gangs are blamed for the bulk of crimes and murders in El Salvador. While the government's fight against the gangs has met with some success in areas, El Salvador remains an exceptionally violent country because of the pervasive gang violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Although arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, and torture are prohibited in El Salvador, Salvadoran security forces apparently continue to participate in such practices on a regular basis.
