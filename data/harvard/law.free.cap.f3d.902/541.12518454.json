Black filed an application under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. He later was allowed to submit an amended application that collected all his claims. He did so in January 2015. Among Black's claims was that his trial counsel's racial bias and conflicting interests rendered counsel's representation unreasonable and deficient. He broadly described that claim as being governed by\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) and, alternatively, by\n   <em>\n    Cuyler v.

Black did not cite a key Supreme Court decision,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    466 U.S. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). We will discuss each of those cases later along with the significance of Black's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cuyler\n   </em>\n   but not\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In two different reports, a magistrate judge to whom Black's application was referred recommended denying all relief. Black filed objections and made a general request for a COA at the end of his objections. In January 2016, the district court accepted the recommendations and denied all relief. It also issued a blanket denial of a COA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Black appealed the January 2016 decision to this court. While the appeal was pending, Black returned to district court claiming newly discovered evidence and seeking relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The district court, agreeing with the magistrate judge's recommendation, deemed the filing to be a successive Section 2254 application and transferred it to this court. There was no additional discussion of a COA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2017, a motions judge of this court denied Black a COA on seven claims and also refused to supplement the record with the evidence presented in the successive application. In the same order, Black was granted a COA on two issues: (1) whether the claim that trial counsel used abusive and racially-charged language against him and threatened to sabotage his case if he did not accept the State's 10-year plea bargain was governed by\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , and, if so, (2) whether he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this claim to determine whether it was substantial enough to excuse the procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We have held that \"the absence of a prior determination by the district court on whether a COA should issue pose[s] a jurisdictional bar to this court's consideration of whether to grant or deny a COA.\"\n   <em>\n    Cardenas v. Thaler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753982\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/442/#p445\">\n    651 F.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (5th Cir.2011) (collecting cases). That simply means \"before we may consider a petitioner's application for a COA on a particular issue, that petitioner must first submit his request to the district court and have that request denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodwin v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236613\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/450/\">\n    224 F.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 n.6 (5th Cir.2000). \"The rule contemplates that the district court will make the first judgment whether a COA should issue and on which issues, and that the circuit court will be informed by the district court's determination in its own decisionmaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Muniz v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405230\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/43/#p45\">\n    114 F.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (5th Cir.1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State argues we were without jurisdiction to grant Black a COA on the two\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issues. The State is correct that Black did not request a COA on those specific issues. He did, though, make a general request for a COA. The portion of the district court's order denying a COA incorporated by reference the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, articulated the COA standard, and held that Black had not met it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We see two questions to be answered as to the COA. (1) If an issue was not presented to the district court or for some other reason a COA on that issue was never denied, is a grant of a COA by this court valid, allowing us to reach the issue? (2) If the answer to the first question is in the negative, did Black sufficiently raise the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue in district court?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Of course, a judge of this court has already granted a COA on the relevant issue. Nonetheless, because a ruling by a motions judge in the initial stages of an appeal is not binding on the later merits panel, we have the responsibility to determine whether the significant ruling here is valid.\n   <em>\n    Newby v. Enron Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045900\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/416/#p419\">\n    443 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (5th Cir.2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Court of appeals grant of a COA on issues not raised in district court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The complexities we face arise from the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA, which created the COA process effective in April 1996.\n   <em>\n    Slack v.

The relevant codified section of AEDPA is only the initial source for understanding the requirements; it discusses the need for a court of appeals to issue a COA and does not require a ruling by the district court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from - (A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, a COA should not issue absent \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2253(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The initial court rule guiding a district court's consideration of a COA was Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22, which concerns appeals in habeas corpus proceedings. It was amended by AEDPA. The first post-AEDPA version of Rule 22(b) required the district court to address the COA question before an appeal could be taken:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If an appeal is taken by the applicant, the district judge who rendered the judgment shall either issue a certificate of appealability or state the reasons why such a certificate should not issue. The certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court of appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the proceedings in the district court.

Here, of course, there is a district court ruling-that court denied a COA in general terms. Yet if we conclude that the district court's denial did not encompass the specific issues on which a COA was granted by this court, are we also without jurisdiction to grant a COA on such issues? Yes we are, as granting a \"COA in the circuit court on issues not previously denied COA in the district court\" is beyond our jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Brewer v.

Our statement that the\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   opinion classified the defect as a jurisdictional one is due to the parenthetical description it used for a precedent on which it relied, namely: \"jurisdiction is not vested in this Court because the district court has not yet considered whether COA should issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755092\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/253/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We conclude the same reasoning applies when a COA was requested but not on the issue being pursued in the appellate court.

The district court did not mention Black's claims other than by referring to the Report and Recommendation\n   of the magistrate judge. The denial was in the general terms of Black's not being entitled to a COA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   One part of the analysis comes from the fact that the \"review of the denial of a COA is certainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court whose decision is under review.\"\n   <em>\n    Tharpe v.

Another relevant point is that when a district court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   denies a COA without indicating the specific issues, we have treated each of the issues raised in the habeas petition as included within the denial.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haynes v.

Deciding which issues were raised in Black's application is complicated by Black's status as an indigent prisoner handling his own suit.

Black clearly did not seek habeas relief in district court specifically under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   . His contention is that when liberally construed his pleadings show \"he raised a constructive/actual denial of counsel and ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Resolving whether the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim was sufficiently presented in district court starts with recognizing that such a claim is substantially different than a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim-one of the authorities Black did cite. Both are based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, but the distinction between \"the rule of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and that of\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   ... is not of degree but of kind.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

A key question in determining if a\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim has been raised is \"whether the accused asserts that he received\n   incompetent counsel, or none at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Childress v.

Stated another way, the distinction between allegations of \"bad and no lawyering is critical ... because very different results flow from the label which is attached to the conduct in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodard v. Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538673\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1027/#p1028\">\n    898 F.2d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1028 (5th Cir.1990).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The distinction is significant because setting aside a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , which requires proof \"of incompetence and prejudice, is made on a case by case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538673\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1027/#p1028\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Denial of counsel altogether, actually or constructively, which is a\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim, requires that conviction be \"overturned because prejudice is presumed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538673\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1027/#p1028\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   presents a different evidentiary and analytical mix than does\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

For example, Black asked the district court to find both \"that trial counsel performed unreasonably under racial bias and conflicting interests\" and that Black had \"demonstrated 'deficient performance' by trial counsel's racial bias and conflict of interests.\" He also argued that there could not be \"any reasonable trial strategy in trial counsel using the type of threats that Black has alleged that [trial counsel] used and of representing [Black] with a racial bias.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The closest Black came to raising a\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim was, first, in a section of his habeas application where he cited to a decision that applied\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazer v.

That citation does not help, though, because the section of the\n   <em>\n    Frazer\n   </em>\n   opinion that Black quoted and discussed at length did not pertain to\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   . Instead, Black cited\n   <em>\n    Frazer\n   </em>\n   to support his claim that counsel performed with a conflict of interest. As to Black's objections to the magistrate judge's report, he argued that trial counsel had \"not made any significant decision in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment\" and that he had \"presented specific factual allegations showing counsel did nothing.\" These and similar statements, even in liberally construed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings, are \"mere conclusory allegations on a critical issue [and] are insufficient to raise a constitutional issue.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court, as a result, cannot be said to have considered the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issues on which our motions judge granted a COA.
