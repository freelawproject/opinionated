As laid out in the undisputed presentence investigation report (PSR), Henderson obtained a 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe, priced at $13,871.50, from Driver Seat Auto Sales, LLC (\"Driver Seat Auto\"), in St. Charles, Missouri. Henderson identified himself as bishop, pastor, and chairman of the Holy Temple National Assembly of Churches, Inc., also known as the World Council of the National Assembly of Churches, Inc. To make the purchase, Henderson presented the car dealership with a $1,200 check as down payment. To obtain financing for the remainder of the purchase price, Henderson completed an online loan application, where he falsely claimed to be employed by the \"US Ecclesiastical Court,\" drawing a salary of $5,800 per month.

Its bank informed the dealership that the check came from a closed account. The company then contacted Henderson, who-after multiple collection attempts-promised to make good on the down payment. Two months later, Henderson paid the company with a cashier's check, satisfying the down payment amount. Around the same time, Henderson fraudulently procured a Missouri Department of Revenue Notice of Lien Release (\"Lien Release\") for the Tahoe. He then used that document to apply for-and receive-a $4,000 loan from the Missouri Title Loan Company in St. Louis, Missouri. On his loan application, Henderson claimed-falsely-to be employed by an entity called \"US Legal,\" with a salary of $2,370 every two weeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Henderson subsequently cashed the $4,000 check; he kept $2,000 as cash and placed $2,000 as a cashier's check payable to the Holy Temple National Assembly Church. Henderson also received another loan from Missouri Title Loan for $1,200 based on the forged Lien Release and the false information he previously provided to the company. Throughout this time period, Henderson wired multiple payments for the financed Tahoe. However, only one of the payments was credited. The others failed because the originating bank accounts either lacked sufficient funds or were nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A grand jury indicted Henderson on two counts: wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and mail fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Henderson sought to rent property which was advertised for lease on Craigslist. The property included a business location and a residence in Florissant, Missouri. Specifically, in June 2014, Henderson contacted Meinecke Enterprises and arranged a\n   meeting to discuss the lease of the property in Florissant, Missouri. Henderson and his associate ... and an unknown male met with Meinecke and agreed to lease the property and possibly purchase the property by August 31, 2014. The rental application noted that the applicant was the Holy Temple Church and the business at the location was to be named Committee Center of Holy Temple Outreach. On July 1, 2014, Henderson provided Meinecke three checks totaling $4,300.00. After attempting to deposit the checks, on July 3, 2014, the checks were returned as counterfeit as they purported to be drawn on a non-existent account located at Clayton Bank which is located in Tennessee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bold omitted).

The government then asked the district court to impose as a special condition of supervised release that Henderson \"cannot act in any capacity for any employer, including a church or nonprofit entity, in either a salaried or volunteer capacity, to include a board member or consultant without the prior approval of the U.S. Probation Office.\" Sentencing Hr'g Tr. at 9,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In May 2017, the probation office suspected that Henderson had violated his probation conditions, again while living at a Bureau of Prisons halfway house. The government initiated an investigation, which revealed that Henderson, under the name Bishop Larry Henderson-Bey, had begun administering a public Facebook page entitled \"The National Assembly of Churches.\" Government's Motion to Revoke Def.'s Supervised Release at 2,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The cover also included the coat of arms of the Bishop of the National Assembly of Churches. Henderson frequently updated the Facebook page and informed visitors that he also managed \"The Daniel Matthews Ecclesiastical College\" (\"Daniel Matthews\"). The college proclaimed itself to be the \"largest ecclesiastical college providing marketable/occupational studies to local churches and ex-offenders,\" which had been in operation for more than 24 years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Henderson's Facebook page also provided enrollment information for Daniel Matthews and provided a Paypal hyperlink where prospective students could pay their application fees. Henderson posted photos of purported sites for the college's St. Louis headquarters, credit union, and admissions office. Some posts provided a phone number for the college; the number was Henderson's personal cell phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government's investigation exposed the entire Daniel Matthews operation as fraudulent. Alleging that Henderson violated special conditions 8 and 9, the government filed a motion to revoke Henderson's supervised release. One week after its first motion, the government filed a supplemental motion to revoke after interviewing two individuals. One person was hired by Daniel Matthews to perform maintenance. Henderson interacted with this individual on behalf of the college. This person told government investigators that all of his paychecks from Daniel Matthews were returned because of insufficient funds. The second person the government investigators interviewed identified herself as a student registrant at Daniel Matthews. She, too, communicated with Henderson who claimed to represent the college. After learning that all Daniel Matthews offices had been closed and the scheduled student orientation canceled, she called Henderson to complain. Henderson then assured her that the orientation had been rescheduled; he also offered her a job at Daniel Matthews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Approximately one month after the government's supplemental motion to revoke, the probation office petitioned the court to issue a warrant for Henderson's arrest, alleging that Henderson violated two standard conditions and special conditions 7 and 9 of supervised release. In its petition, the probation office noted that during every\n   telephone and face-to-face contact with Henderson, he assured the probation officer that he was not operating or managing a business. The probation office expressly stated that its petition was submitted as a supplement to the government's motions. Henderson subsequently was arrested and released on his own recognizance. Between the original motion to revoke and the two subsequent supplemental motions, the government and the probation office together alleged that Henderson violated two standard conditions as well as specials conditions 7, 8, and 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the revocation hearing, Henderson's counsel stated to the court that Henderson wanted to waive the hearing for the two Grade C\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   violations corresponding to special conditions 8 and 9. Henderson then asked the court to permit him to continue his supervised release, or in the alternative, to be sentenced to home confinement. The government objected, noting that in an effort to remain on supervised release, Henderson procured a forged letter on Daniel Matthews letterhead, purportedly from the dean and general board member of the college, asking the court not to send Henderson back to prison. The government also pointed out that Henderson lied to the court, claiming he had diabetes and a heart condition that required surgery. The government concluded that Henderson's \"probation should be revoked or his supervised release should be revoked; that he should be confined because, quite frankly, he isn't going to stop unless he is confined. And we have seen that time and time again.\" Supervised Release Revocation Hr'g Tr. at 19,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:14-cr-00207-HEA (E.D. Mo.

The court advised Henderson of the consequences of his admission and waiver. It then reminded Henderson of its effort to ensure that Henderson understood fully the special conditions of supervised release at the original sentencing. The district court then sentenced Henderson to 12 months and 1 day in the Bureau of Prisons, followed by 18 months of supervised release, for violating special conditions 8 and 9. The court also imposed the same conditions of supervised release imposed at Henderson's original sentencing, including the special conditions.

He argues that neither restriction provides exceptions, and they are, therefore, overbroad. Further, Henderson suggests that the church finance prohibition infringes his First Amendment rights, as the restriction \"would bar him from donating money to the church because such donation would be a type of financial activity.\" Appellant's Br. at 36. The conditions are neither overbroad nor do they prohibit him from contributing financially to religious organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Henderson relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v.
