The district court dismissed Russo's claim as untimely on the view that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not recognize the right that Russo asserts, and that Russo thus could not benefit from the limitations period in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3).

The parties agree that the court sentenced Russo as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, with a guideline range of 646 to 711 months' imprisonment. The court arrived at a guideline sentence of 646 months and then reduced the term to 235 months for reasons unrelated to his career-offender status. Russo argues that if the court had not sentenced him as a career offender, then the guideline range would have been lower, and his final sentence would have been shorter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Russo was sentenced, the Supreme Court declared the sentencing guidelines effectively advisory.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In 2015, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a new rule of constitutional law by declaring unconstitutionally vague the so-called \"residual clause\" of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Within one year of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Russo moved to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Russo asserted that the district court relied on the residual clause of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) to conclude that he was a career offender under the guidelines. Russo argued that the residual clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague because it was almost identical to the ACCA's residual clause held unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Thus, Russo urged, the court should vacate his sentence because it was calculated based on an unconstitutionally vague provision in the mandatory guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Russo filed his motion, the Supreme Court held that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

Following these decisions, Russo argued that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   supported his claim because the mandatory guidelines \"fix\" a defendant's sentence like the statute in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and that the advisory guidelines at issue in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable because of their flexibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court dismissed Russo's motion as untimely. The court reasoned that Russo's motion was timely only if he filed it within one year of \"the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). The court concluded that Russo's claimed right to be sentenced without reference to the residual clause of the mandatory guidelines required \"an extension, not an application, of the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\" The court therefore ruled that the Supreme Court had not recognized the right that Russo asserted, and that his motion was untimely.

That court thought the contrary view reads the term \"asserted\" out of the statute and \"improperly reads a merits analysis into the limitations period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517222\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/288/#p293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The term \"asserted,\" however, is essential to our analysis, because we must identify the \"right asserted\" by the prisoner before we can\n   determine whether that same right has been recognized by the Supreme Court. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not recognize the right asserted, but we do not resolve the merits of Russo's constitutional claim that a sentence based on a residual clause in the mandatory guidelines violates the Due Process Clause. Insofar as determining whether Russo's proposed rule is dictated by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or open to reasonable debate involves some consideration of the merits, the inquiry is required by \u00a7 2255(f)(3) and not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
