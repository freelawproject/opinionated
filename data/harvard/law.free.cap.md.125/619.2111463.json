Wimbrough, of that county, the appellant, to annul a marriage between him and the appellee on the ground that it was the result of duress \u201cpracticed upon him\u201d by the father of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">It alleges that on the 19th of March, 1913, \u201can alleged marriage took place in the town of Berlin, in Worcester County,\u201d between the plaintiff and defendant; that the plaintiff \u201cwas compelled to go through a marriage ceremony with the defendant only because of duress practiced upon him by John T. Adkins, the father of the defendant, and because of fear of instant death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of the said Adkins by reason of threats then and there made by\u201d him \u201cagainst\u201d the plaintiff if he \u201cshould refuse to go through the marriage ceremony with the defendant\u201d; that he left the defendant at her father\u2019s house immediately after the ceremony, which took place there, \u201cand has not since lived,\u201d cohabited with, seen or communicated with her in any way, and that the marriage was procured as aforesaid without his consent, \u201cand under his protest, uttered at the time of the performance of the ceremony in the presence and hearing of the defendant,\u201d her parents, \u201cand the minister of the Gospel who performed the ceremony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The answer of the defendant admits that the plaintiff left her at her father\u2019s house immediately after the marriage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and that he has not lived or cohabited with her or seen her since; bnt it denies that he never consented to the marriage, or that he was compelled to go through the marriage ceremony by duress practiced upon him by her father, or because of fear of death or bodily harm at the hands of her father, or that the marriage was procured by fraud, force or duress, and avers that the marriage license was procured by the plaintiff; that the minister who performed the ceremony was secured by him, and that \u201che expressed not only his willingness but a desire to marry the defendant, only at the last moment asking that the ceremony be deferred for a day, which the defendant then declined to do.\u201d The answer further alleges \u201cthat since said marriage a child has been born, the offspring of the plaintiff\u201d; that since the birth of the child on the 5th of July, 1913, the plaintiff has contributed \u201cnothing to its support,\u201d or \u201ctowards the maintenance of the defendant\u201d since the marriage beyond the sum of sixteen dollars paid her shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Chancellor Bland says in <em>Fornshill </em>v. Murray, 1 Bland, 479, that, \u201cMarriage has been considered among all nations-as the most important contract into which individuals can enter, as the parent not the child of civil society,\u201d and a reference to some of the authorities bearing upon the important and delicate questions involved, will greatly aid us in the examination of the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">While section 14 of Article 16 of the Code of 1912 provides that the Circuit Courts of the counties and the Superior Court of Baltimore City, upon petition of- either of the parties, and the Circuit Courts of the counties and the Criminal Court of Baltimore, on indictment, may inquire into, hear and determine the validity of any marriage, \u201cand may declare any marriage contrary to the table of this article, or any second marriage, the first subsisting, null and void,\u201d the authority of courts of equity in this State to determine the validity of a marriage charged to have been procured by abduction, terror, fraud or duress, rests upon their general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>jurisdiction to set aside contracts affected by fraud, etc. <em>Fornshill </em>v. <em>Murray, supra; Le Brun </em>v. <em>Le Brun, </em>55 Md. 496; <em>Ridgely </em>v. <em>Ridgely, </em>79 Md. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Tbe caution, however, with which courts exercise this jurisdiction is clearly and forcibly stated in <em>Le Brun </em>v. <em>Le Brun, supra, </em>where Judge Milled says: \u201cBut while the \u2022courts are thus clothed with jurisdiction, the peculiar nature of the subject to be dealt with, requires that the power \u00abshould be exercised with extreme caution, and only where the allegations of the bill are sustained by clear, distinct and \u25a0satisfactory evidence. This position is sustained by an unbroken current of authority. Marriage has been considered, among all civilized nations, as the most important contract into which individuals can enter, as the <em>parent, </em>not the <em>\u25a0child, </em>of civil society. The great basis of human society throughout the civilized world is founded on marriages and legitimate offspring; and where an existing marriage is \u25a0proved, it is not to be exposed to the danger of being set aside by any species of collusion, or by the mere declarations \u2022of either of the parties, and should only be brought into question upon the most undisputed proofs.\u201d After referring to the presumptions in favor of the validity of a marriage where there is issue, or where it is assailed upon the ground 'that a former marriage of the woman is still subsisting, he \u2022says further: \u201cWe can not, therefore, pass a decree in this \u2022case which will bastardize the issue and impute crime to the woman, unless the fact that her former husband was alive, at the date of her second marriage, is clearly established by such proof as all of the authorities upon the soundest of reasons indicate and require.\u201d In the case of <em>Seyer </em>v. <em>Seyer, </em>37 N. J. Eq. 210, the Vice-Chancei/loe said: \u201cAnd as to this branch of the case, it may be said that when the Court is satisfied that ante-nuptial incontinence has taken place, the charge of threat or menace unlawful, or fraud or duress, <em>must be most </em>fully and satisfactorily established before the Court will annul the marriage.\u201d In <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>N. J. Eq. 231, 34 Atl. 682, the Chakoeeeor said: \u201cIt is hardly necessary to cite authority for the position that a .complainant who comes into court under the circumstances above stated, and asks a decree of nullity, the result of which is to declare one whom he has sworn to love and cherish as a wife to be no more than a concubine, and her offspring, the fruit of the unlawful communion (born pending the suit), a bastard, must prove his case with the utmost strictness. The same rule applies in such a case as on an indictment for bigamy. The Court in such cases is hound to act as the guardian of the helpless infant, and watch his rights and interests with jealous care\u201d; and it is said in 26 <em>Oyc. </em>913: \u201cThe burden is on the plaintiff to sustain his material allegations, and in view of the peculiar nature of the contract \u25a0of marriage and the grave consequences of dissolving it, the courts will not grant a decree except upon the production of clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence. * * * According to the generally accepted rule, such a decree will not be given on the mere admissions or confessions of the parties alone without satisfactory extraneous evidence, or upon the uncorroborated testimony of plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>149 Pa. St. 60, 17 L. R. A. 320, where the statute of Pennsylvania authorized a divorce where the marriage was procured by fraud, force or coercion, the Court said: \u201cIt is not alleged that there was any force used to compel the marriage, and, in order to justify a divorce, under the statute, upon the ground of threats, they must be . -such threats, against the life or to do bodily harm as would overpower the judgment and coerce the will. There must be such a mental condition as a result of the threats that the libelant did not and could not in reality consent to the marriage,\u201d and it is said in 14 <em>Cyc. </em>596, \u201cA divorce will not be decreed on the ground of duress unless it appears that the marriage was contracted under force or threat of bodily harm.\u201d Where a man marries to escape arrest or imprisonment for seduction or bastardy he cannot avoid the marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>on the ground of duress, nor is a marriage induced by threats of lawful prosecution, arrest or imprisonment, to redress or punish a wrong open to impeachment on that ground. 1 <em>Bishop on M. &amp; D., </em>sec. 543; 26 <em>Cyc. </em>906; <em>Sickles </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>26 N. J. Eq. 440; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Todd, supra; Collins </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>43 L. R. A. 814, and note; <em>Ingle </em>v. <em>Ingle, </em>38 Atl. Rep. 953; <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>6 Atl. Rep. 282; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shufeldt, </em>5 Paige, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The plaintiff testified that he had several talks with Mr. Adkins about marrying defendant; that on Monday previous to the marriage, which took place on Wednesday evening, Mr. Adkins and his wife came to his father\u2019s shop and told the plaintiff in the presence of his father and his brother that he had to marry the defendant \u201celse he would die by me\u201d; that \u201cit wasn\u2019t need for me to try to get away,\u201d for if he did \u201cthey would put an officer on my track\u201d; that he went around to Mr. Adkin\u2019s house that night and they arranged for Mr. Adkins to get -the license the next day and for the marriage to take place at. seven o\u2019clock Wednesday evening; that the threat Mr. Adkins made on the Monday referred to was the only threat he made before the evening of the marriage; that he also went to see the defendant Tuesday evening before the marriage. That on Wednesday evening at the time appointed for the marriage he went to the defendant\u2019s house, and when he knocked on the door Mr. Adkins came to the door, and that he then told him that he could not decide until the following evening whether or not he would marry the defendant; that Mr. Adkins called his wife to* the door and told her what the plaintiff had said, and that they invited him in the house; that Mr. Van Dyke, the minister, and the defendant were there; that as soon as they got inside of the house Mr. Adkins flew into a rage and told Mr. Van Dyke that he had refused to marry the defendant, and said I would \u201chave to marry her\u201d before I went out of the house; that he, plaintiff, then said that if he had to marry her he would do it, but that he would not live with her or support her unless he had to do it; that Mr. Van Dyke did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>not want to perform the ceremony under those conditions, hut that Mr. Adkins insisted, and that they were married and that he left the house immediately afterwards; that he did not want to marry the defendant and did it to save his life; that as soon as he told Mr. Adkins that night that he would not then marry his daughter he rushed into another room in a fit. of passion and got some kind of weapon; that his wife and daughter tried to stop him, and said \u201cdon\u2019t do that Tom,\u201d but he got the weapon and when he came back he said to the plaintiff \u201cyou will marry this girl before you leave the house\u201d; that he had his right hand in his- coat pocket so that he could shoot right through the pocket, and that he, plaintiff, thought he had a pistol and thought he would kill him, as he was defenseless and had no means of \u2022escape. Mr. Wimbrough, the father of the plaintiff, testified that on Sunday previous to the marriage he went to see Mr. Adkins; that they \u201ctalked on some matters\u201d m regard to the plaintiff and defendant, and that Mr. Adkins said he could not give him any answer until he talked with his wife, and that he would be around to his shop to see him Monday afternoon; that he and his wife came to the shop and said in the presence of the plaintiff that \u201che wouldn\u2019t make any compromise of any kind\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201chad his daughter to many;\u201d that if he did not want to live with her he did not have to do so&gt; or support her, and said to the plaintiff, \u201cyou needn\u2019t think you will run off for I will die by you,\u201d that he would \u201cput an officer on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Mr. Van Dyke states that the first he knew of the matter was when the plaintiff spoke to him as he was passing the shop and told him of the trouble; that the plaintiff said he \u201cgussed he would have to marry the girl,\u201d and asked bim if he would go around to Mr. Adkins\u2019 house Wednesday night, and that he agreed to do so; that on Wednesday afternoon Mr. Adkins brought him the license and asked him if he was coming around and that he said yes; that he went to the house at the hour appointed, and that after a while the plaintiff came, and after some conversation between Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Adkins and the plaintiff on the porch, they came into the house and Mr. Adkins announced that the plaintiff was unwilling to marry the defendant that night; and that when Mrs. Adkins asked why, he said the plaintiff wanted more time, that Mr. Adkins said that he would \u201cdo it tonight or not at all, the next move is mine\u201d; that after some further discussion about it the plaintiff said he would not unless he had to, and would not live with her or support her; that Mr. Adkins replied that it did not make any difference whether he lived with her or supported her; that he had kept her ever since she was a baby and could still do so; that he, Mr. Van Dyke, said that he could not marry them under those conditions, and advised them to take more time to consider the matter or to go to a magistrate and have a civil marriage; that Mr. Adkins insisted that the ceremony be performed; that the plaintiff said \u201cif he had to do the thing he could do it but only under those conditions; that he, witness, asked Mr. Adkins if he was willing to have his daughter marry under those conditions and he said he was; that he asked the defendant if she was willing to enter into such an agreement and she said she was; and that he then married them. He was asked if he had heard the testimony of the plaintiff in reference to Mr. Adkins rushing into another room for a weapon, etc., and what he saw and how it appeared to him, and. he replied that Mr. Adkins did leave the room and go into another room, followed in a few minutes by his wife and daughter, but that he did not know what they went for; that he did not remember seeing anything in his hand; that Mr. Adkins made no threats of bodily harm in his presence, and that the worst thing, as he sees it, in the proceedings, was his statement that \u201cyou will do it tonight or not at all, the next move is mine\u201d; that the plaintiff is a member of his church and that he left the house with him immediately after the ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The testimony of Mi\u2019. Adkins, Mrs. Adkins and the defendant, which is very full and explicit, is to the effect that the plaintiff is the father of the defendant\u2019s child; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>promised to marry her, and that when ho came to the house on the evening of the marriage the only reason he assigned for wanting the marriage postponed for a day was that he had gotten some information from certain persons and wanted to see some others about it, but he would not tell them what it was. They deny most positively that Mr. Adkins on the evening of the marriage went into another room and got a \u201cweapon,\u201d or that he made any threats whatever of bodily harm to the plaintiff. Mr. Adkins states that he insisted upon the marriage because the plaintiff was responsible for the condition of his daughter, and what he meant when he told the plaintiff that he would \u201chave to\u201d marry her was that he was the one who had seduced her; that after he saw the plaintiff and his father at the latter\u2019s shop on Monday the plaintiff came to his house that night; that the next morning the plaintiff asked him to get the license as the defendant was not of age and he could not get it; that the plaintiff was also at his house Tuesday night; that when he came Wednesday night he said that he had been talking to some parties and that he could not marry the defendant that night; that he asked the plaintiff who he had been talking to but he would not tell, and that he then said to him that he could inarry her then as well as any other time. Horace Shockley testified that he was at Mr. Adkins\u2019 house on Tuesday evening before the marriage and that the plaintiff was there; that he had known the plaintiff for a long time and that they had always been great friends; that while at Mr. Adkins\u2019 house Tuesday night the contemplated marriage was discussed, and that afterwards he and the plaintiff went out on the porch and had a talk in which the plaintiff told him \u201che guessed he had got the defendant in trouble and guess he had to marry her, that he did not see any other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The plaintiff was called in rebuttal to state what he referred to when he told Mr. Adkins Wednesday night that he had heard something and did not want to marry the defendant that night, and he stated what he had heard. The matters related by him were positively denied by the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>are in conflict with the testimony of her father and mother and are not supported by the testimony of either the plaintiff\u2019s informant or any of the parties referred to in the information he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">This evidence, when carefully considered in the light of the authorities we have cited, is hardly sufficient to- justify an annulment of the marriage on the ground of duress. The only threat shown by the evidence indicating any intention on the part of the defendant\u2019s father to inflict bodily injury, or to justify a fear of bodily harm to the plaintiff is the statement of the plaintiff himself that Mr. Adkins secured a \u201cweapon\u201d- which he held in his pocket in such a position that he could shoot him through his pocket. This statement is not supported by the testimony of any of those present, and is not only positively denied by Mr. Adkins, Mrs. Adkins and the defendant, but Mr. Van Dyke-, the plaintiff\u2019s witness, says that \u201cMr. Adkins made no threats of bodily harm in his presence,\u201d and that, as he regarded it, the worst thing in the whole proceeding was his statement; \u201cyou will do it tonight or not at all, the next move is mine.\u201d Uothing occurred to indicate that the \u201cnext move\u201d referred to was a threat of bodily injury. If there had been, Mr. Van Dyke would certainly have observed it, and could not have testified that Mr. Adkins made no such threat. The statements of Mr. Adkins that if he attempted to run away he would \u201cput an officer on his track,\u201d and that he \u201cwould die by\u201d him, testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s father, or the statement that the \u201cnext move\u201d would be his, without something more to show a purpose to inflict bodily harm or injury, would not justify that construction, and there is not a particle of evidence in the case, except the statement of the plaintiff, that he so construed them. They may have expressed a purpose to institute such proceedings against the plaintiff as the law and facts justified, and from all the evidence in the case the plaintiff must have so interpreted them, for notwithstanding his repeated interviews with Mr. Adkins in reference to marrying the defendant, he went to see her Monday night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and Tuesday night, and to his house on the evening of the marriage with apparently no thought of any danger to himself, and certainly without any preparation to repel an attempt to inflict bodily injury. His conduct throughout, as disclosed by all the evidence, which we need not refer to at greater length, is entirely inconsistent with the claim he now makes, and if he married the defendant in obedience to an impelling sense of justice to her, or for the purpose of escaping the penalties of such redress as she or her father were lawfully entitled to, a' Court of Equity will not aid him to annul his obligation and cast a stigma-upon his offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The statement of the plaintiff that he would not live with defendant cannot render the marriage void. In <em>Brooke </em>v. Brooke, 60 Md. 524, the Court said in reference to a similar statement alleged to have been made by the husband: \u201cAs to the proposition of law contended for by the appellants, that, assuming Henry Brooke to have been the real party to the ceremony of marriage, his having remarked to the complainant just previous to its performance, \u2018I will marry you, but understand I will never live with you/ rendered the marriage ceremony an idle form without binding force, while we would remark we can give no countenance to the idea that the solemn rights of marriage which it is the policy of the law and good morals to uphold, can be thus converted into a delusion and a fraud, there is in this case no foundation even to contend for the doctrine set up, as the evidence shows the facts do not exist to which it could be applicable. Even if Brooke made that declaration with the intention at the time of not treating the complainant as his wife, he neverthe-lejss proceeded to take the vows that declared them man and wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed, <em>with costs to the appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
