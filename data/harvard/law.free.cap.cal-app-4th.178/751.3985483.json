(Mother) appeals from the jurisdictional findings and dispositional orders of the juvenile court regarding her two children, 16-year-old J.B. (J.) and 12-year-old L.K. (L.). Mother contends there was insufficient evidence to support the jurisdictional findings and the orders removing the children from her custody. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that a finding under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361, subdivision (c)(6),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which must be supported by expert testimony\u2014that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child\u2014is <em>not </em>required when an Indian child is removed from the custody of one parent and placed with the other parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">I.-III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the </em>Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>B. <em>Indian Child Welfare Act Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Mother contends that before the juvenile court could remove her daughter L., an Indian child, from her custody and place her in father\u2019s (Father) custody, the court was required to make a finding, supported by expert testimony, that continued custody of L. by Mother was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to L. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">According to section 361, subdivision (c)(1), before the juvenile court can remove a child from a parent\u2019s physical custody, it must find by clear and convincing evidence that \u201c[t]here is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor if the minor were returned home, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor\u2019s physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor\u2019s parent\u2019s . . . physical custody.\u201d This finding must be made to remove a dependent child \u201cfrom the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians <em>with whom the child resides at the time the petition was </em>initiated.\u201d (\u00a7361, subd. (c), italics added.) In other words, this finding is required even when the child is removed from one parent and placed with the other, noncustodial parent. (See <em>In re Katrina C. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 540, 548-549 [247 Cal.Rptr. 784].)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">A second finding is required in \u201can Indian child custody proceeding\u201d\u2014section 361, subdivision (c)(6), requires that the juvenile court must also find by clear and convincing evidence that \u201ccontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child . . . .\u201d Furthermore, \u201cthat finding [must be] supported by testimony of a \u2018qualified expert witness\u2019 as described in Section 224.6.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Mother asserts that the plain language of this provision requires that the juvenile court make this finding even when an Indian child is placed with a noncustodial <em>parent </em>rather than in foster care, and thus the juvenile court in this case was required to make this finding, supported by expert testimony, before it could remove L. from Mother\u2019s custody. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">\u201cIn construing a statute, our task is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent and purpose for the enactment. [Citation.] We look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1172 [124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 464, 52 P.3d 648].) Our first and most important responsibility in interpreting statutes is to consider the words employed; in the absence of ambiguity or conflict, the words employed by the Legislature control, and there is no need to search for indicia of legislative intent. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) \u201c[W]e presume the Legislature meant what it said. [Citation.] \u2018However, if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider various extrinsic aids, including the purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia, supra, </em>at p. 1172.) \u201cTo resolve [an] ambiguity, we rely upon well-settled rules. \u2018The meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. [Citation.] Literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute. . . . An interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided [citation]; each sentence must be read not in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme [citation]; and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed [citation].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Shabazz </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 55, 67-68 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 750, 130 P.3d 519]; see also <em>Robert L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 903 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951] [statutory language should not be interpreted in isolation, but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts].) We must interpret a statute in accord with its legislative intent and where the Legislature expressly declares its intent, we must accept that declaration. <em>(Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 1, 10-11 [106 Cal.Rptr. 761, 507 P.2d 65].) Absurd or unjust results will never be ascribed to the Legislature, and a literal construction of a statute will not be followed if it is opposed to its legislative intent. <em>(Webster v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 338, 344 [250 Cal.Rptr. 268, 758 P.2d 596]; <em>Lungren v. Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Thus, we begin by examining the plain language of section 361, the relevant portion of which was enacted to incorporate the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) into California\u2019s statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c(c) A dependent child may not be taken from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>time the petition was initiated, unless the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence of any of the following circumstances listed in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, <em>and, in an Indian child custody proceeding, paragraph (6):</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">\u201c(1) There is or would be a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor if the minor were returned home, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor\u2019s physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor\u2019s parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s physical custody. . . fit] . . . [1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201c(6) <em>In an Indian child custody proceeding, </em>continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child, and that finding is supported by testimony of a \u2018qualified expert witness\u2019 as described in Section 224.6.\u201d (\u00a7 361, subd. (c)(1), (6), italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">An \u201cIndian child custody proceeding\u201d in turn is defined by section 224.1, subdivision (c), as \u201ca \u2018child custody proceeding\u2019 within the meaning of Section 1903 of [ICWA], including a proceeding for temporary or long-term foster care or guardianship placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement after termination of parental rights, or adoptive placement.\u201d This list does not include a proceeding in which a dependent child is removed from one parent and placed with the other. Similarly, the ICWA definition referenced in section 224.1 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903) does not refer to placement with a noncustodial parent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By expressly including certain placements, the Legislature impliedly excluded others, such as placement with a parent. (See <em>Imperial Merchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 389 [97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 212 P.3d 736] [citing the rule of statutory construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u2014to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other].) If the Legislature intended to include placement with a parent, we assume it would have expressly done so by adding it to the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Furthermore, the plain language of the statute cannot be said to include placement with a parent as a type of foster care placement. Placement with a parent is <em>not </em>foster care. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(i); see also, e.g., <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 251, 262-265 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 261] [discussing different considerations for juvenile court and different schemes when child is placed with noncustodial parent rather than in foster care].) Section 1903 defines \u201cfoster care placement\u201d as \u201cany action <em>removing an Indian child from its parent </em>or Indian custodian <em>for temporary placement in a foster home </em>or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(l)(i), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Thus, the plain language of section 361, subdivision (c)(6), establishes that the statute applies only in an \u201cIndian child custody proceeding,\u201d the definition of which expressly includes various proceedings, but <em>not </em>a proceeding for placement with a <em>parent. </em>(\u00a7 224.1, subd. (c); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903.) Accordingly, the finding under that provision and the expert testimony to support it are not required when an Indian child is placed with a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Although we believe the statutory language is unambiguous, we note for good measure that this reading comports with the remainder of the ICWA statutory scheme and the express purpose of ICWA. We briefly note some examples supporting the conclusion that ICWA does not apply to a proceeding to place an Indian child with a <em>parent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">First, 25 United States Code section 1912(e)\u2014the federal counterpart to section 361, subdivision (c)(6)\u2014addresses only foster care in this context: \u201cNo foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Likewise, the California rule of court that implements section 361, subdivision (c)(6), also notes the foster care context, providing that \u201c[i]n any child custody proceeding listed in rule 5.480, the court may not order placement of an Indian child unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that continued custody with the parent or Indian custodian is likely to cause the Indian child serious emotional or physical damage and it considers evidence regarding prevailing social and cultural standards of the child\u2019s tribe, including that tribe\u2019s family organization and child-rearing practices, [f] (1) Testimony by a \u2018qualified expert witness,\u2019 as defined in . . . section 224.6 ... is required before a court orders a child placed <em>in foster care </em>or terminates parental rights.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.484(a), italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The notice provision of ICWA also reflects the same purpose, coming into play when the agency seeks foster care placement and the juvenile court has reason to believe the child is an Indian child. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) [\u201cIn any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, <em>the party seeking the foster care placement </em>of... <em>an Indian child </em>shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe . . . .\u201d]; 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11(a) (2009); see, e.g., <em>In re Alexis H. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 11, 15 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 242] [because agency sought neither foster care nor adoption, ICWA seemingly did not apply]; <em>In re Jennifer A. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 692, 699-701 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 54] [although child ultimately placed with father, ICWA applied where child was initially in foster care and agency sought continued foster care placement]; see also <em>In Interest of J.R.H. </em>(Iowa 1984) 358 N.W.2d 311, 321-322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Finally, the legislative intent behind ICWA expressly focuses on the removal of Indian children from their <em>homes and parents, </em>and placement in <em>foster or adoptive homes. </em>In establishing ICWA, Congress found \u201cthat an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in <em>non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions </em>. . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4), italics added.) Thus, Congress declared its policy \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children <em>from their families </em>and the placement of such children <em>in foster or adoptive homes </em>which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902, italics added; see 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.3 (2009).) Following suit, the California Legislature declared that \u201c[t]he state is committed to protecting the essential tribal relations and best interest of an Indian child by promoting practices, in accordance with [ICWA] (25 U.S.C. Sec. 1901 et seq.) and other applicable law, designed to prevent the child\u2019s involuntary <em>out-of-home placement </em>and, whenever that placement is necessary or ordered, by placing the child, whenever possible, in a placement that reflects the unique values of the child\u2019s tribal culture and is best able to assist the child in establishing, developing, and maintaining a political, cultural, and social relationship with the child\u2019s tribe and tribal community.\u201d (\u00a7 224, subd. (a)(1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In sum, the plain language of section 361, subdivision (c)(6), demonstrates that it does not apply to placement of an Indian child with a <em>parent, </em>and this conclusion comports with the Legislature\u2019s intent and the purpose of ICWA. Thus, a finding under section 361, subdivision (c)(6), and the expert testimony to support it were not required to remove L. from Mother and place her in Father\u2019s custody. If the Agency seeks foster care placement of L. in the future, the requirements under ICWA will again become an issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">C.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s findings and orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Afy\">Vartabedian, Acting P.
