J.</author>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Defendant, Ronald Lee Smith, appeals from a judgment of conviction of corporal injury to a cohabitant and criminal threats. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 273.5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>subd. (a), 422.) (All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.) He was sentenced to four years eight months in state prison. He received credit for 123 days in presentence custody plus 60 days of conduct credit for a total presentence custody credit of 183 days. Defendant was orally ordered to pay an $800 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)), an $800 parole revocation restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.45), \u201c[a]nd any other mandatory court fees and costs as required.\u201d In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that there was substantial evidence defendant made criminal threats within the meaning of section 422. We modify the judgment in part and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">n. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A. Criminal Threats</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his criminal threats conviction. We apply the following standard of review: \u201c[We] must consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment and presume the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence in support of the judgment. The test is whether substantial evidence supports the decision, not whether the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 631 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].)\u201d <em>(People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 432 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388], fn. omitted; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1156 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 759, 117 P.3d 476]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Whisenhunt </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 174, 200 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 125, 186 P.3d 496].) Our sole function is to determine if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781]; <em>People v. Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 331 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Stainer </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 31 F.3d 907, 908-909.) Our Supreme Court has held, \u201cReversal on this ground is unwarranted unless it appears \u2018that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the conviction].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 331, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321].) The standard of review is the same in cases where the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 792 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) Because intent can seldom be proven by direct evidence, it typically is inferred from the circumstances. <em>(People v. Smith </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1458, 1469 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 75]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1092, 1099 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 821].)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Section 422 states in part, \u201cAny person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement ... is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Our Supreme Court has set forth the five elements of a section 422 violation: \u201cIn order to prove a violation of section 422, the prosecution must establish all of the following: (1) that the defendant \u2018willfiilly threaten[ed] to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,\u2019 (2) that the defendant made the threat \u2018with the specific intent that the statement ... is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,\u2019 (3) that the threat\u2014which may be \u2018made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device\u2019\u2014was \u2018on its face and under the circumstances in which it [was] made, ... so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u2019 (4) that the threat actually caused the person threatened \u2018to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety,\u2019 and (5) that the threatened person\u2019s fear was \u2018reasonable]\u2019 under the circumstances. (See generally <em>People v. Bolin[, supra,] </em>18 Cal.4th [at pp.] 337-340 &amp; fn. 13 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People v. Toledo </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 221, 227-228 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 26 P.3d 1051]; accord, <em>In re George T. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 620, 630 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 61, 93 P.3d 1007].)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support the third element; he was in Texas, without a job or income, and the victim, S.J., was in California when he allegedly made the threats; therefore the threats could not have been \u201cso unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of execution of the threat . . . .\u201d Our Supreme Court has held: \u201cWith respect to the requirement that a threat be \u2018so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u2019 we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 297, that the word \u2018so\u2019 in section 422 meant that \u2018 \u201cunequivocality, unconditionality, immediacy and specificity are not absolutely mandated, but must be sufficiently present in the threat and surrounding circumstances ....\u201d\u2019 <em>([People </em>v.] <em>Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 340, quoting <em>People v. Stanfield </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1157 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 328].) \u2018The four qualities are simply the factors to be considered in determining whether a threat, considered together with its surrounding circumstances, conveys those impressions to the victim.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanfield, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1157-1158.)\u201d <em>(In re George T, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 635.) The Court of Appeal has held: \u201cThe terrorist threat statute requires a threat to be \u2018so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat.\u2019 (\u00a7 422.) [But section 422] does not require an immediate ability to carry out the threat. <em>(In re David L. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1655, 1660 [286 Cal.Rptr. 398].)\u201d <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 675, 679 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 252].) The totality of the circumstances must be considered in addition to the words used. <em>(People v. Gaut </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1431 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 924]; <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1340-1341 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 728]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1218 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].) As our colleagues in Division Seven of this appellate district explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at pages 1340-1341: \u201c[T]he determination whether a defendant intended his words to be taken as a threat, and whether the words were sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific they conveyed to the victim an immediacy of purpose and immediate prospect of execution of the threat can be based on all the surrounding circumstances and not just on the words alone. The parties\u2019 history can also be considered as one of the relevant circumstances. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Defendant, an unemployed drug user, abused S.J. every day for 19 years\u2014except on the few days when he was unable to do so because he was incarcerated. There was testimony defendant abused her verbally, yelled at her, calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cslut\u201d and a no good \u201cpiece of shit\u201d; administered beatings which were severe and became worse over time; hit and kicked her; kicked her in the legs, the stomach, the back and \u201cjust anywhere\u201d; kicked her when she was on the floor; slapped her in the head and the face; pulled her hair; and urinated on her. The testimony indicated: defendant beat S.J. when she was eight months pregnant; this resulted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>child\u2019s death; he kicked her in the head less than a month after she had brain surgery\u2014surgery that was necessary because of repeated blunt force trauma; he repeatedly put a gun in her mouth and threatened to kill her; he told her to \u201csuck his dick\u201d in front of their three boys; he had sex with her when the children were present; he told the children he would cut her legs off with the machete he kept under the bed; and he tortured their dog and threw their cat out the car window while driving on the freeway. On one occasion, defendant assaulted S.J. within an hour of his release from incarceration. The violence escalated to the point that, as S.J. testified, \u201cI knew ... if I ever went back, I would probably never be sitting here today.\u201d The 19 years of abuse took place in Houston, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">But with the help of N.D., an adult son living in California, S.J. decided to put an end to the abuse and move away. On her first attempt to flee to California, one month earlier, defendant decided to travel with her. Upon arriving at N.D.\u2019s home, defendant assaulted S.J. After S.J. left defendant, brought the children with her to California, and obtained a restraining order, defendant threatened her as he had for 19 years. S.J. testified defendant said, \u201c[T]hat I wasn\u2019t going to take his kids from him like that, that he would hurt me . . . .\u201d Also, defendant told S.J. he would \u201ckill her.\u201d Defendant also threatened to kill N.D. Defendant left \u201creally threatening\u201d voice messages on N.D.\u2019s cellular telephone. Defendant said that when S.J. got back to Texas, \u201c[S]he was going to go through hell ... if she survived, if he didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d SJ. believed defendant would come to California and hurt her. She felt defendant had nothing left to lose. The foregoing constitutes substantial evidence defendant made a criminal threat against S.J. which met the immediacy requirement. A trier of fact could intelligently conclude: it was reasonable for S.J. to fear defendant would follow through on the threats he made from Texas; this conclusion is based on the totality of the circumstances including the long and escalating history of defendant\u2019s violence; and S.J.\u2019s fear made sense because of defendant\u2019s prior trip to California. Also, the trier of fact could consider the fact that S.J. had left defendant and taken their children with her. (See <em>People v. Gaut, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 1431 [threats made from jail]; <em>People v.
