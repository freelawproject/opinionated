Confirming road reported by re-viewers, when same is located so as to lead to the Troy Hill road at a point about 70 perches distant from its junction with the Spring Garden Run road, instead of being located to a point on the Troy Hill road at or near said junction, as the petition asks.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-11\"><em>Bayne Magee </em>and <em>Marshall </em>Patterson, for certiorari.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-12\">The viewers had no power to locate a road running to the Troy Mill road at a point materially different from its junction with the Spring Garden Run road: Lower Merion Road, 8 P. F. Smith 66; Boyer\u2019s Road, 1 Wright 257; Hellertown Road, 5 W. &amp; S. 202. When the new road struck the Troy Hill road it ended: Noble Street, 5 Wharton 333; Southampton Road, 9 Harris 366. The old Troy Hill road could be widened only by a proceeding directly for that purpose; it could not be done by a collateral proceeding without notice to parties interested: Vernon Township Road, 20 P. F. Smith 23; Norriton Township Road, 4 Barr 338; Schuylkill Co.\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 463; Church Road, 5 W. &amp; S. 200; Act of May 8th 1850, sect. 8, Pamph. L. 715, 2 Br. Purd. 1277, pl. 40.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-13\"><em>A. M. Watson, </em>eontr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXS\">October 26th 1874,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,</p>\n<author id=\"ANfl\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AkE\">The general rule is that viewers cannot locate a road upon another legally laid out and opened. But it has been held that they may do this so far as it may be necessary to reach the point of termination called for in the order: Road from West Chester Road to Chester and Germantown Road, 2 Rawle 421; Hess Mill Road, 9 Harris 217; Southampton Road, Id, 356. The mere objection to the adoption of the Troy Hill road, so far as it was thus necessary to reach the point of termination at or near the Spring Garden Run road, would not alone be tenable; but the court in this case added seven feet to the width of the Troy Hill road, without a petition for the widening of the road under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Act of 8th May 1850, Brightly 1277, pl. 40, or an allowance of damages for the land thus taken or release filed. The jurisdiction to widen roads is special, and the landowners adjacent should have notice of the purpose, otherwise they may be misled. A landowner could not know by the petition to locate a new road that an intention to widen an old one existed and might forbear to pursue his claim for damages when he found that the viewers had adopted the old route. Justice can be done in this case by confirming the report of viewers and order of the court below, except as to the widening of the Troy Hill road. It is therefore ordered and decreed that the proceedings of the Court of Quarter Sessions be confirmed except so much thereof as orders the widening of the Troy Hill road to the width of forty feet, as to which excess of seven feet the order of the court is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
