Gillilan, Rachel L. Harvey and Fanny W. Scott, with their respective husbands, against Richard Wistar and William L. Wistar. The bill set out:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-11\">1. The plaintiffs and defendants were the only children of Richard Wistar, deceased, and nephews and nieces of Sarah Wistar, who was their father\u2019s sister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-12\">2. Sarah Wistar died September 21st 1866, unmarried, and, as plaintiffs alleged, intestate, leaving neither father, mother, sisters nor brothers, but leaving the plaintiffs and defendants, her only nephews and nieces, and owning a large real and personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-13\">3, 4. The defendants propounded a paper-writing as her will; it was admitted to probate by the register, October 3d 1876; an appeal was taken, and a feigned issue was awarded to try in the Common Pleas whether the paper was her will; this issue was pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-14\">5. Fourteen actions of ejectment had been brought in the Supreme Court to recover a number of pieces of real estate in Philadelphia, late the property of the decedent; these actions were pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-15\">6. After numerous efforts to settle this family dispute, an agreement was made by which the plaintiffs, \u201c for the sake of peace, agreed to take, and the defendants to give, in full settlement and satisfaction of all interest and claim on their deceased aunt\u2019s estate, in addition to the devises and bequests of the will, $40,000 in down-town lots, to be appraised \u201d by one person to be selected by the plaintiffs and one by the defendants; the plaintiffs selected William Loughlin, who accepted the appointment; the defendants selected Edward Bedlock,- who declined to act; the defendants had since refused to appoint another appraiser, or pay the $40,000, or to be bound by the agreement. The agreement was by letters of the counsel of the respective parties, having full power in the premises; these were six letters, copies of which were annexed to the bill, and hereafter stated as Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-16\">7, 8. The \u201c down-town lots \u201d were unimproved lots in Philadelphia, belonging to the estate of Sarah Wistar or the defendants; the $40,000 was to be paid to the plaintiffs in'addition to what was given them by the will; in default of completing the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the agreement, as to the lots, the plaintiffs averred that they were entitled to $40,000 in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">9. Four of the actions of ejectment on the trial list had been continued in consequence of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">10, 11. The agreement was entered into \u201c for the sake of peace,\u201d and the settlement of a family dispute; and the plaintiffs, on the payment of the $40,000, were ready to release all interest in the estate of Sarah Wistar, except their devises and legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">12. The defendants refused to perform their agreement, and insisted on trying the issue on the will in the Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-9\">The prayers were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">That the rights of the parties might be ascertained and declared; that the defendants be decreed to appoint a referee in conjunction with the plaintiffs\u2019 referee, to appraise the lots, or in default, to pay the $40,000 ; that when the lots had been appraised the defendants convey them to the plaintiffs; that defendants continue the issue on the will until this case be disposed of, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">The following are letters referred to in the bill, with others, in evidence in the case:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-12\">No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-13\">3d October 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-14\">My Dear Sir: \u2014 I sent up to your office to-day, between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock, but you were not in.

The correspondence in regard to this arrangement was conducted by the counsel for either side respectively, and is contained at length in letters of October 3d 1870, and January 2d, and February 3d, 1871, printed in the answer; and December 17th and 19th, and March 4th and-April 5th 1871.\u201d Owing to some disagreement, in regard to what it does not definitely and clearly appear, Mr. Wain, counsel for the defendants, in his letter of April 5th 1871, abruptly and peremptorily broke off all negotiations and declared them at an end.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-20\">He reported also that the letters of December 22d 1871 (No. 6), December 26th 1871 (No.' 7), January 1st 1872 (No. 8 &amp; 9), con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tained the agreement which the plaintiffs relied on to compel specific performance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">Mr. Loughlin was appointed appraiser by the plaintiffs and Mr. ' Bedlock by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">Bedlock declined, because the correspondence had so much ambiguity about it, and he had been on amicable terms with all the parties, and because Mr. Loughlin, from his official position, must have formed his opinion. The counsel of the plaintiffs requested Mr,. Wain, the counsel of defendants, to select another person, which was not done. Mr. Wain deprecated a legal construction, that \u201c devises and bequests,\u201d carried rents and interest, saying such was not the meaning which in an amicable compromise like this, those words should bear; the other counsel insisted upon adhering to the legal interpretation of the agreement. Some further negotiation looking to settlement was had, but no settlement was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">The master proceeded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">\u201cIt therefore becomes proper to examine the nature and effect of the agreement upon which the complainants rely in their bill to enforce specific performance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-10\">\u201c That it is an agreement for the purpose of settling a family dispute has been fully proved; that it is moreover an agreement in writing whose terms are clear, certain, and final, without allusion to any prior negotiation or attempted settlement, and without reference to further conference or adjustment, save the appraisement of the down-town lots, \u2018 as agreed upon,\u2019 a simple inspection of the letters which constitute it, will establish beyond question. By virtue of it, the complainants agree to abandon the trial of the feigned issue and suits in ejectment, and in consideration of their relinquishing these actions the defendants on their part agree to pay the sum of $40,000 in down-town lots; and in addition thereto, the legacies and devises left them by their aunt\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-11\">\u201c The terms \u2018 bequests and devises,\u2019 legally and in the eyes of a court of equity, carry with them, as to the latter, the rents accruing from the time of Miss Wistar\u2019s death; and as to the former, the interest arising since a period one year distant from that event.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-12\">\u201c Now, although indisputably prior efforts towards a compromise were made, and letters having that object in view passed between the counsel on either side, it cannot with justice be contended that there exists such a connection between the former abortive attempts at a settlement, and the final agreement as will constitute the former part of the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-13\">\u201c The letter of Mr. Wain, of April 5th 1871, raises up an impassable barrier between the two transactions, and as strongly as is within the power of language, separates them ; he there peremptorily and abruptly, without assigning any reason whatsoever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>declines all propositions of settlement, and declares that all inducements offered by him are withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">\u201cAny effort to unite them in one transaction must therefore fail, and we may proceed at once to the consideration of the argument urged by the defendants, that the agreement in question was entered into through mistake, and was the result of mutual surprise ; that the former attempt at settlement was broken off owing to the fixed desire of the complainants to obtain over and above the $67,500 named therein as a basis of compromise, the rents and interestsarising upon the devises and legacies; and'finally that the words \u2018bequests and devises,\u2019 as used by the counsel for the complainants in their letter of December 26th 1871, and acceded to by Mr. Wain, in his of January 1st 1872, were not intended, by either party to the compromise, to bear the strict legal interpretation which a court of law would accord them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">\u201cIt will be necessary perhaps to answer these objections somewhat at length.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">\u201c The mistake and surprise, if any existed, were certainly unilateral, and not mutual; there is not the shadow of a reason for the supposition that the complainants on their part did not knowingly and with a full understanding of the legal import of the words used by them, consummate the agreement; nor is there anything whatever to indicate that they were in any way conscious of a mistake or misapprehension on the part of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">\u201c Granting, then, for the sake of argument, that the defendants labored under the erroneous impression that in this amicable settlement, by a sort of tacit agreement the legal significance of the words was for the time being waived, would such a misconception, in equity, relieve them from the consequences of their act ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-10\">\u201c The master is of the opinion that a misconception, such as is claimed by the defendants, is, even if clearly shown, insufficient to overthrow an agreement for the settlement of a family dispute. But it must be held in mind that, to set aside a written contract upon the ground of mistake, the mistake must either be admitted in the bill or answer, appear from the nature of the case, or else be clearly and satisfactorily proved; neither of which three things is the case here. The sole evidence which goes to establish mistake on the part of the defendants, is the testimony of Mr. Richard Wistar, who not only declares that a former negotiation was terminated, owing to a disagreement in regard to the inclusion or exclusion of the rents and interests arising from the legacies and devises, but testifies that the principal agreement in question was entered into upon the understanding that they were to be included in the $&gt;40,000 named therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-11\">\u201cNow, apart from the extreme danger of allowing an interested party, by means of his sole and unsupported testimony, to provoke mistake, and so free himself from the deliberate obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tions imposed upon him by means of a written contract, the evidence of Mr. Wistar is, in the master\u2019s opinion, contradicted by the presumptions arising from the facts of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">\u201c If the former negotiation referred to by him is the attempted settlement so abruptly terminated by Mr. Wain\u2019s letter of April 5th 1871, and it was broken off, as he declares, owing to a desire on the part of the complainants not to include the rents and interest arising from the legacies and devises in the $67,500 named therein as a basis of compromise, what is the conclusion to be derived from such a state of facts ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">\u201cWould the defendants, acting subject to the advice of counsel of great experience, and who must be supposed to have rendered them fully cognisant of the legal meaning of the terms used, and forewarned by their former experience of the d\u00e9mands of the complainants, have carelessly and hastily acceded to a contract which, by its language, accomplished the very object which they were so anxious to avoid? On the contrary, would they not naturally have been most careful to provide against anything like mistake by insisting upon the use of the words and phrases which would legally secure them from future misapprehension and annoyance? By the terms of the former abortive attempt at settlement, had it been consummated, the complainants could have obtained nothing more than $67,500. Why then an alteration in the meaning of the final agreements, if it were not that the defendants had undergone a change of purpose, and had at length determined to accede to the complainants\u2019 demands ? This inference is certainly unavoidable in view of the fact that it was the former and not the latter, who, as the time for the trial of the feigned issue approached, reopened, first, the matter of amicable settlement and tendered an offer of compromise. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">\u201c The clause in regard to the appointment of appraisers is not an arbitration or reference, but merely an agreement for the appraisement of land. What then might have been the effect of Mr. Bedlock\u2019s refusal to act, had he, in conjunction with one or more persons, been originally, by name, selected as an appraiser, it is useless to discuss; as the matter stands it is incumbent upon the defendants, in pursuance of their agreement, to name some one who will consent to act, or failing that, to pay the $40,000 in cash.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">The master reported that the complainants were entitled to a decree in their favor, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-10\">1.

In cases of family arrangements the court gives great weight to considerations -which w'ould not be taken into account in ordinary contracts: Stapilton <em>v. </em>Stapilton, 1 Atkyns 2; Stockley <em>v. </em>Stockley, 1 Ves. &amp; B. 31; Cory <em>v. </em>Cory, 1 Ves.

F. Smith 25. And in one case such an agreement was upheld, even where there had been a misconception of his legal rights by one of the parties: Lies <em>v. </em>Stub, 6 Watts 52. But the principle is not to be carried so far as to work practical injustice. Especially it ought not to override every other rule upon which courts of equity proceed in the enforcement of the specific performance of contracts. A bill for that purpose is always an appeal to the conscience of the chancellor, in which he exercises a sound discretion under all the circumstances, and he will not interfere if the bargain is hard or unconscionable, or the terms unequal, or the complainant is taking an undue advantage from the strict legal construction of the words: Oil Creek Railroad <em>v. </em>Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, 7 P. F. Smith 65. Even at law it may be stated as a sound principle of determination, that if the reasonable interpretation of an alleged offer and acceptance shows that something material as between the contracting parties is left to be afterwards arranged, the mind of the defendant never assented to all the terms proposed, never was at one with the'mind of the plaintiff, there would be no agreement between him and the plaintiff, for breach of which an action would be maintainable. <em>A fortiori, </em>in a court of equity, unless it is perfectly clear that the minds of the parties have come together and been in accord upon all the material terms of the agreement, a chancellor ought to decline to interfere, but leave the parties to their legal remedies. In the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>promise of family disputes particularly, the agreement of compromise should be complete in itself, not a mere plan looking to a future adjustment of details; more especially when, so far from settling the family difficulties, it will be itself merely the germ of future litigation. Otherwise, instead of promoting peace and harmony, it may be the source of prolonged discord and dissension.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We are of opinion that the correspondence, upon which the alleged compromise in this case rests, does not show clearly that the minds of the parties were at any time at one, and that specific performance ought not, therefore, to be decreed. A very important matter of dispute, whether the bequests and devises in the will of Sarah Wistar, which was in contest, in favor of the complainants, should carry with them the accretions from the date of the will, was a point not mentioned. Upon a strict legal construction of the words of the offer and acceptance, they would follow. It is not an insignificant fact that in a former unsuccessful attempt to compromise this family controversy, they had split upon this very question of an account of these accretions. Had it been in the minds of both parties when these letters passed, it certainly would have been mentioned or attended to. If it was in the minds of the complainants they should have expressed it, and not to have left it to a mere legal inference, that the devises and bequests would of themselves carry their accretions. But this is not all. It is very clear that when Mr. Wain introduced the subject of a compromise in his note of December 22d 1871, he meant the arrangement to be a complete and final one. \u201c The Messrs. Wistar will pay in full settlement and satisfaction of all interest and claim of the legatees in their deceased aunt\u2019s estate, |40,000, in downtown lots.\u201d The whole controversy was to be settled by a round sum in down-town lots, according to an appraisement by persons eventually to be chosen, and that was to be the end of it. When the counsel of the complainants proposed to vary his offer by the addition of the devises and bequests contained in their aunt\u2019s will, Mr. Wain had no reason to suppose that the main purpose in view \u2014an immediate and final settlement, which would at once put an end to all litigation and produce family peace \u2014 was thereby to be abandoned. The legacies and devises to the complainants, or to the defendants in trust for them, were all specific. There was no element of uncertainty and dispute introduced thereby into the arrangement. But when they go further and claim all the accretions upon these devises and bequests since the death of the testatrix \u2014 subject to all just allowances to the trustees \u2014 and without any provision as to the manner in which the amount which would be coming to the complainants, was to be ascertained and settled, it is evident that here is a matter of account extending over a period of five years, and without some new agreement, only <em>to </em>be reached by adverse proceedings. The defendants then as trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>would remain liable to account. It is not easy to regard this as a full settlement of all interest and claims of the complainants, such as was contemplated by Mr. Wain\u2019s proposition of December 22d 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">This was not then the case of a mere misconception of their legal rights by the defendants. It was a failure of the whole purpose of the compromise, which was to be a full, final and immediate settlement of all matters of controversy, so that domestic peace and harmony might be at_once and for ever restored between these near relations. Under all the circumstances we think that it would not be equitable to enforce the specific performance of this alleged agreement of compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Decree reversed and the bill dismissed, each party to pay their own costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
