Offered for the purpose of showing that Barber could not transfer the note after protest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The plaintiff objected, that the note being commercial paper, Shriner took it subject only to such defences as the defendants had against Minsker, the payee; a purchaser of overdue negotiable paper, taking it free from all defences, except those growing out of the paper itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">The offer was rejected, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">The court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-11\">* * * \u201c The defendants have not offered to show that the consideration of the note has failed in whole or in part, or that the same has been paid. They offered evidence to show that R. T. Barber, the immediate endorser of plaintiff, was a member of this firm, and that he had transferred the note to the plaintiff after maturity, and after the insolvency of the firm. This evidence the court rejected for the reason that the holder of overdue commercial paper takes it affected by those defences that are connected with the note itself, and not antagonistic claims or set-offs that are wholly independent of the note in suit. Nor can a presumption of payment of the note by the defendants arise, for it was admitted that Barber, one of the defendants, was a partner, and had the possession of the note after maturity; the ordinary presumption of payment arising from such possession is now defeated by proof that the firm did not pay it, but that <em>he paid it with his own funds. </em>Indeed, the defendants admit that it has not been paid, but undertake to set up an equity, <em>de hors </em>the note. This we rejected, and charge you that if the evidence is believed, you ought to find for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $486.87.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-13\">The defendants sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-14\">They assigned for error the rejection of their several offers of evidence and the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-15\"><em>A.

The note is admitted to have been good in the hands of Minsker, the payee, and was taken from him by Barber for a full consideration paid out of his individual funds. Though Shriner took the note after it was overdue and protested, it was without notice that Barber was a partner of Young &amp; Worth. There was nothing to put him on his guard, and no want of consideration or of equity to affect his right of recovery. The general state of the accounts of the partnership was therefore not a ground of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
