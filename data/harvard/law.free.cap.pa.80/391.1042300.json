A mortgage was made by a wife with her husband of her separate estate; the husband used the money for his own purposes exclusively, without accounting to her; by deed, in which she joined, he assigned all <em>his </em>estate for creditors; the wife died, having devised her estate to a son; her land was sold under the mortgage, leaving a balance after its payment. <em>Held, </em>if the husband had any interest as tenant by the curtesy in the balance, the amount taken by him of the wife\u2019s money having been greater than such interest, her devisee was entitled to receive it, in preference to the husband\u2019s assignees.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-15\">2.

Platt, deceased, Benoni Lockwood being the terretenant. After payment of the mortgage debt for which the land was sold, by agreement of the parties $4781.48 were paid to Benoni Lockwood; the remainder, $7000, was paid into court, and B. E. Chain, Esq., was appointed auditor to report distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">The case as found by him, in two reports, is as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">On the 30th of November 1864, Benoni Lockwood conveyed to his mother, Amelia C. Platt, the wife of Clayton T. Platt, a piece of land in Springfield township, Montgomery county, containing about five acres; the land was conveyed subject to a mortgage to secure the payment of $7500. On the 20th of April 1867, Mrs. Platt, her husband joining with her, executed a mortgage on this land to Louis A. Godey, to secure the payment of $12,000. Part of this sum was applied to the payment of the $7500 mortgage, &amp;c., and the remainder, $4221, \u201cwas used by Clayton T. Platt for his own purposes, no part thereof being appropriated for the use or benefit of Mrs. Platt or her real estate, nor was any account ever rendered to her of the manner in which it was expended.\u201d On the 1st of November 1867, Platt and wife executed to Edward Shippen and William B. Robbins an assignment of all the estate, real and personal, \u201c of him the said Clayton T. Platt, without any reservation or restriction of any kind,\u201d for the payment of Platt\u2019s debts. The deed contained the proviso :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">\u201c That nothing herein contained shall be deemed to convey, assign, transfer or in any manner affect the title and estate of her, the said Amelia C. Platt, in and to all that certain parcel of ground, with the improvements thereon erected, situate in the township of Springfield, in Montgomery county * * * (the premises above mentioned as conveyed by Lockwood), which premises she, the said Amelia O. Platt, claims to hold as her separate estate.\u201d Mrs. Platt died May 20th 1871, having made a will, dated May 3d 1869, by which she gave all her estate of every kind to her son, Benoni Lockwood, and appointed him the executor of her will. Clayton T. Platt, on the 2d of January 1874, conveyed all his interest in the Springfield property to Lockwood. To September Term 1874, under a levari facias on the Godey mortgage, the land was sold by the sheriff for $24,200. After the payment of the mortgage and costs, the balance remaining was $11,736.40: at the date of the sheriff\u2019s sale, Clayton T. Platt was fifty-five years of age; according to the Carlisle Tables, the value of his life interest in that sum was $6534.60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The assignees of Platt claimed that at the date of the assignment, he had an estate by the curtesy in the land, which estate passed to them hy the assignment; that his wife being dead at the time of the sale, and his curtesy estate therefore consummate, they were entitled to the sum at which his life interest was so valued; the $7000 were therefore paid into court to await the determination of this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">The auditor, in a well-considered and elaborate report, held, that Platt had such an interest in his wife\u2019s land as would pass by his deed of assignment; that by the assignment this interest actually passed, notwithstanding the proviso reserving Mrs. Platt\u2019s separate estate in the land; and that the assignees were not entitled to receive the sum at which Platt\u2019s life interest was valued, but only the interest during his life of the balance of the purchase-money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">After the coming in of this report, Lockwood presented a petition setting out the conveyance to Mrs. Platt, the mortgage to Godey, &amp;c.; the petition proceeds:\u2014 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">\u201c Your petitioner is informed and believes, and expects to be able to prove, that the said Amelia C.

Platt\u2019s debts and answering his necessities, and that no part of it went to his mother\u2019s use or benefit, until after the filing of the auditor\u2019s report in the above case. * * * He is advised that the said Amelia C. Platt, to the extent of the balance of the said sum of $12,000, after paying the said mortgage of $7500, with the interest due thereon, stood as a surety for the said Clayton T. Platt, and that the same having been raised out of his inheritance by the sheriff\u2019s sale in the above case, your petitioner is entitled to have the proceeds of the said Clayton T.

Platt, to the extent of at least $4221, part of the said $12,000, was a creditor of her husband, and by joining in the mortgage of her separate estate for her husband\u2019s debts she became entitled to all the rights of a surety as against her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">Without deciding whether this would be a defence to the claim of Platt\u2019s assignees, he awarded the fund in court \u2014 $6755.50\u2014 after deducting the expenses of the audit, to Benoni Lockwood, in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\">Exceptions were filed to this report by the assignees of Platt; they were dismissed by the court, the report confirmed, and the fund ordered to be paid to Benoni Lockwood, devisee and legatee of Amelia C.

Platt in the property sold. It arises from a sheriff\u2019s sale under a mortgage given by her in her lifetime, when she was fully competent to dispose of her own estate in the mode prescribed by law. Her right, or that of her legal representatives, to the residue of the fund after payment of the mortgage debt is therefore a legal right to be enforced unless a better title can be shown. It is claimed such exists here in a derivative estate by the curtesy of her husband, preserved to him under the Acts of 1848 and 1855. The wife having, with the consent of her husband, who joined in the mortgage, exercised her superior right of property, by mortgaging the whole estate, including his curtesy interest, the joint act of both, followed by a sheriff\u2019s sale under the mortgage, it might be a question whether the curtesy of the husband is not wholly extinguished. It is unnecessary, however, to decide this, as his curtesy, if it survived the mortgage and sale, is clearly subordinate to her rights, and he having received out of the mortgage money a greater sum than his curtesy in the residue of the fund would amount to, he cannot claim any part of the fund to the prejudice of her estate. The auditor finds that he received out of the mortgage the sum of $4221. This is greater than the sum to which his curtesy would be entitled under the common-law rule, allowing one-third of the capital of the whole fund as representing the accumulated interest of the fund for his lifetime. The sum in court remaining after satisfying the mortgage and expenses, was, $11,736.10, of which one-third is $3612.03. The auditor has found all the facts necessary to a conclusion. Had Mrs. Platt been alive when the sheriff\u2019s sale was made, no one would dispute her right to the money, under the force and effect of the Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1848, to the exclusion of her husband. Being the owner of the fund, her claim is primary at law, and not merely in equity. Supposing that the curtesy estate survived the joint mortgage and sheriff\u2019s sale, still her representatives would be entitled to assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>her superior claim to the fund, to the extent of the sum received by the husband out of the mortgage. The money so raised was hers, not his. The conversion was by her lawful act, in the exercise of her superior title, and was with his consent. The case, therefore, does not depend on subrogation \u2014 on a mere equity, but the claimant under the husband must show a superior title to the fund both in law and equity. In this view of the cas\u00e9 it is unnecessary to decide between the title of the assignees under their deed, and \u25a0 that of Benoni Lockwood, under his deed. The latter is entitled to claim under the will of Mrs. Platt.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">As to the measure of the life estate of Clayton T. Platt, we may add that the Carlisle Tables are not authoritative. They answer well their proper purpose, to ascertain the average duration of life, so as to protect life insurers against ultimate loss upon a large number of policies, and thereby to make a profit to the shareholders. But an individual case depends on its own circumstances, and the relative rights of the life tenant and remainderman are to be ascertained accordingly. A consumptive or diseased man does not stand on the same plane as'one of the same age in vigorous health. Their expectations of life differ in point of fact. A court, therefore, must ascertain the actual probable expectation of life of the party as he is, or must adopt some recognised approximate standard as its legal measure, in order to capitalize the interest he is entitled to for life. In this case the Carlisle Tables, it is said, would give the value of the life estate, or capitalized interest at $6534.60, leaving the fee simple estate worth but $5202. The' disproportion is quite manifest. We are, therefore, disposed to take the old common-law rule of one-third of the whole sum, as the present value of the accumulated interest for the life of Clayton T. Platt. This gives a sum several hundred dollars less than that received by him out of his wife\u2019s mortgage-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Decree affirmed with costs, and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
