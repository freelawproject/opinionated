De Haven, trading as De Haven &amp; Brother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-20\">The claim of plaintiffs, as filed, was a deposit made by them with the defendants, who were bankers; the affidavit of claim was as follows: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>\u201c </em>That the plaintiffs in this suit, as executors of the last will and testament of Anthony Williams, deceased, lent to the defendants in this suit, at four per cent, interest, on March 30th 1872, $12,608.45; on April 6th 1872, $435; on April 10th 1873, $5630.90; and on April 15th 1873, $3716.01, to he repaid by the' said defendants to the said plaintiffs, with interest, when demanded; that on October 6th 1873, there remained unpaid of said loans $10,217.52; that the defendants stopped payment in September 1873, and plaintiffs in this suit claim to recover the same, with interest, from October 6th 1873.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">The affidavit of defence was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">\u201c That a sum of money, as will appear from the copy filed, was deposited with the said defendants by George O. Williams and Daniel Williams, executors of Anthony Williams, deceased; that after the suspension of defendants, in September last, they entered into a composition with their creditors, which was signed by George C. Williams, one of said executors for the said estate, before the bringing of the suit in this case, by the terms of which agreement all the property of said defendants was conveyed to John M. Maris, as trustee for the executors of said defendants. It was further provided that, upon the said agreement being signed by a committee, consisting of Edwin M. Lewis, Samuel It. Parke and William S. Kirk, the agreement shall go into effect and operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">\u201c It was further provided by the twelfth clause of said, agreement, as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>When and as soon as this agreement is signed by the parties of the first part and second part, and the approval thereof is given to it by the committee above mentioned, the said parties of the third part do hereby agree with the other parties hereto, and wdth one another, that the agreement shall then take effect and operate; and immediately thereupon the parties of the first part, individually and trading as De Haven &amp; Brother, shall be fully and finally released, acquitted and discharged from the several sums due the creditors whose names are subscribed to this agreement.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">\u201c Deponent says, and expects to prove, that the said agreement has been signed by the parties of the first and second parts, and that the said committee have approved the same, and that it has gone into full effect and operation, and that the said'George G. Williams, on behalf of said estate of Anthony Williams, has duly signed said agreement; and he avers that said defendants are thereby released and discharged from the debt upon which suit has been brought in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">On a rule for judgment, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, the court made the rule absolute, Hare, P. J., delivering the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\"><em>\u201c </em>The question presented in this case is, so far as I am aware, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>one of the first impression.It is, whether one co-executor can, without the knowledge and assent of the other, release a demand arising from a deposit made in the names of both, and agree to look solely to the fund in the hands of the assignee, to whom the debtor has transferred his property for the benefit of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">\u201c The inclination of the court, in the first instance, was in favor of the validity of the defence, but an attentive examination of the authorities has led to an opposite result. It is well settled, in general, that the acts of one co-executor bind the others, by reason of the confidence reposed in them individually, in consequence of which each has full power over the assets: Beltzhoover <em>v. </em>Darragh, 16 S. &amp; R. 327, 329. This is an exception to the rule that when a trust or authority is delegated for mere private purposes, the concurrence of all who, are intrusted with the power is requisite to its due execution: Sinclair <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Cowen 533, 583; and distinguishes executors from trustees, who are regarded by equity as forming one collective trustee, and must, therefore, execute the duties of the office in their joint capacity: Vandever\u2019s Appeal, 8 W. &amp; S. 405, 409. Hence, a payment to one executor, or a release from him, extinguishes the debt, although he misapplies the money and no part of it comes to the use of the estate: Herbert <em>v. </em>Pigott, 2 C. &amp; M. 384. Eor a like reason one may, where the circumstances require it, take part and release the residue, or accept goods or securities in satisfaction: Smith <em>v. </em>Everett, 27 Beavan 446; Gilman <em>v. </em>Healy, 55 Maine 120; and it will make no difference if the case be free from fraud, that the compromise is effected without the knowledge of the co-executor, or that it is against his wishes: Murray <em>v. </em>Blatchford, 1 Wend. 583; Herbert <em>v. </em>Pigott, 2 C. &amp; M. 384. It results from this principle that one of several co-executors is not answerable for the acts or defaults of his companions, unless he was negligent or had notice of some fact or circumstance rendering it a duty to interfere: Townly <em>v. </em>Sherborne, 1 Bridgman 39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">\u201cIt is at the same time equally well established that executors may join in the administration of the assets; and such is often the better course as affording an additional guaranty to the creditors and legatees. Under these circumstances each is responsible for the safe-keeping of the fund, and cannot allege the neglect or misconduct of another, as an excuse for a loss which would not have occurred if he had been diligent: Mendes <em>v. </em>Guedalla, 2 J. &amp; H. 259. Ordinarily, an executor is not liable for nonfeasance; hut if he enters on the execution of any part of the trust he cannot stop short, and must do all that is requisite to conduct the business to a successful termination. An executor who unites in the collection of a debt cannot get rid of his responsibility by leaving the proceeds in the custody of his associate, and should, on the contrary, take such measures as will prevent the fund from being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>used without his knowledge. The place of safe-keeping must consequently be one where both can exercise a control or supervision. The authorities accordingly agree that money which has been received by a co-executor should be deposited to the joint account; and if this precaution is not observed,, and a loss ensues through the fraud of him who is intrusted with the fund, a chancellor will visit the consequences on both. See Clough <em>v. </em>Bond, 3 Mylne &amp; Craig 490; Langford <em>v. </em>Gascoyne, 11 Vesey 333. Under these circumstances they are still executors, but executors charged with a fiduciary obligation, which renders them virtually trustees as it regards the assets which they have received and hold in common.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">\u201c The existence of such an obligation implies the power to fulfil it. <em>Lex neminem eogit ad vana sen impossibilia. </em>It were futile to open a joint account, if one of the depositors could withdraw the money. All must, therefore, unite in the receipt or check, in order to discharge the banker; and it follows that he cannot rely on a compromise or release by one as a defence; This is not so much an exception to the rule, that a payment to a co-executor discharges the debt, as a return to the general rule, to which that is an exception. The right of each executor to act without the concurrence of the rest seems to have been the growth of circumstances. A testator might have assets in different counties, and lying as far apart as Canterbury and York. It might be difficult or impracticable to find any one who was able and willing to assume the whole responsibility, and he might appoint a representative in either province, in the expectation that each would collect what lay nearest to his own door. So one executor may be chosen for his knowledge of accounts, and another for his skill and sagacity in the adjustment of outstanding and disputed claims. Under these circumstances, it would be useless and injurious to require that all should join in acts that can be better performed by one. The privilege is not confined to executors, but extends \u25a0 measurably to trustees, who, as Lord Keeper Coventry observed, in Townly <em>v. </em>Sherborne, may permit one of their number to receive all or the most part of the profits without a breach of trust, \u2018 it falling out many times that some of the trustees live far from the lands, and are put in the trust out of other respects than to be troubled with the receipt of the profits.\u2019 In this case, as in that of executors, the right to receive necessarily implies the power to give an acquittance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">\u201c It results from what has been said that the right of executors to sever in the execution of the trust is a concession to expediency, which should not be made when the case is one for care and judgment, and it is possible for all to unite without inconvenience. It does not, therefore, exist, where a fund arising from the collection or sale of the assets comes to the hands of two or more executors or administrators, or has been deposited to their joint account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Under these circumstances, there is nothing to exclude the principle that persons acting in \u00e1 fiduciary capacity must concur in every measure affecting the interests which they represent. See Beltzhoover v. Darragh, 16 S. &amp; R. 329, <em>339; Mendes v. </em>Guedalla.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">Judgment was accordingly entered for the plaintiff, and the damages assessed at $&gt;10,377.59.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">This was assigned for error\u2019, on the removal of the record to the Supreme Court by the defendants by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-8\"><em>PI.
