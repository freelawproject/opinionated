That at and before the time that defendants endorsed the first of said notes for the benefit and accommodation of said Garfield as before mentioned, which they were by him requested to do, they took the precaution before doing so to inquire of the cashier of plaintiff\u2019s bank and of one of the directors thereof, as to the financial condition of said Garfield, and whether or not it would be safe for them (defendants) to endorse for him, and were informed by said cashier and director that they considered said Garfield perfectly good financially, and that the defendants would be safe in endorsing for him: that when said representations were made by said bank officers they (the said officers of plaintiff\u2019s bank) knew they were false, and that said Garfield was then very largely indebted to said bank for borrowed money, and was insolvent and unsafe, and that it would not be safe for defendants to endorse for him, and that said false representations were made, and said large indebtedness and insolvency of said Garfield were concealed by said bank officers, in bad faith, to benefit said bank and injure and deceive defendants; and that defendants, relying on said representations, endorsed both said notes, and would not have endorsed either of them had it not been for said false and fraudulent representations made by the officers of plaintiff\u2019s bank, as above stated; that defendants went to plaintiff\u2019s bank to make said inquiries before endorsing said paper, for the reason that they knew that said notes, if endorsed by them would be negotiated in said bank, as said Garfield did all, or nearly all, his banking business in said bank, and its officers had a more full and intimate knowledge of his affairs than any other banking institution or individual known to defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">Judgment was entered August 7th 1874, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and the damages liquidated at $2371.62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">The defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error, the entering of judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-8\"><em>Neill Neill </em>and <em>B.

F. Smith 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>As to the second point, the alleged fraudulent representation of the cashier and one of the directors of the bank,' the affidavit is clearly insufficient. All that is alleged is that when asked as to the financial condition of Garfield, these officers replied that they considered said Garfield perfectly good financially and th\u00e1t defendant would be safe in endorsing for him. How can such a declaration, not made in the course of their duties as officers or agents of the bank, even admitting it to have been wilfully false, affect their principal? It would be subversive of every well-settled principle which regulates the relation of principal and agent and the responsibility of the principal for the acts and declarations of his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
