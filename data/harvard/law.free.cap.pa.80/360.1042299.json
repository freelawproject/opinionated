J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-13\">The plaintiff testified, that a wagon belonging to him had been sold on the 11th of March 1871, at constable\u2019s sale, as the property of John Roudenbush ; that he gave notice at the sale in the presence of defendant, that the wagon was plaintiff\u2019s ; defendant heard him ; defendant bought and took possession of the wagon ; the wagon had been taken from the shop of Roudenbush, who was a wheelwright, to be sold; plaintiff had taken it from his father\u2019s house to Roudenbush\u2019s to have it done up. Roudenbush then lived in Montgomery county; he was indebted to the father, and plaintiff made arrangements with Roudenbush at the time to pay by his father\u2019s account, for doing up the wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-14\">On cross-examination plaintiff said : He did not buy the wagon of Roudenbush ; he had agreed with Roudenbush in 1869 to build him a wagon; it was not this wagon; this wagon was built on two contracts. In the first place Roudenbush was to build him a certain kind of wagon which he could not build ; plaintiff took what part he had built and made arrangements afterwards for the balance ; he took the running-gears at $30, he bought th\u00e9 wagon-bed afterwards on his father\u2019s account, and paid $25 for that; the trimming and painting were to cost a certain sum; plaintiff was to buy the trimming and the whole wagon was to cost $186; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>to be finished in the beginning of 1870 ; it was never finished; there had been a final settlement about the wagon about February 20th 1871; beside a debt owing by Roudenbush to plaintiff, there were due after paying blacksmith and trimming materials about $71; this did not include his father\u2019s bill, which was put at $60 ; the bill had nothing to do with the wagon, except how Roudenbush had agreed it should be credited on the wagon ; he did not know that his father\u2019s account had ever been closed by payment; it was not taken into account when the wagon was sold; plaintiff then owed on it $70.81; plaintiff paid for iron works and trimmings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">On re-examination he said: Roudenbush owed him for shoe-making $28.29 ; he had paid for iron work and trimmings $79. Roudenbush was about moving into Chester county near the Valley Forge, and delivered to plaintiff the running-gears; he bought the bed afterwards; then they arranged that the wagon should cost $186 \u201c all toldhis father\u2019s bill $81 was to go against- the balance ; this was about the beginning of October 1870 ; he had had the running-gears and wood work in the February preceding; after it was done he took it to his father\u2019s; he paid his father\u2019s, bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">The blacksmith testified that plaintiff paid him $61 for ironing the wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">James Boud, father of plaintiff, testified: that Roudenbush was to make a wagon body for plaintiff, but could not make it as plaintiff wanted it; and wanted witness to take the body for his claim; witness said he would have to consult plaintiff; witness did not see Roudenbush until they settled February 20th 1871, when Roudenbush said he would let part of the claim go; could not let it all go; witness said he would not do that; witness had no further talk with him; plaintiff told him to finish the wagon and they would settle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">On cross-examination he said: Roudenbush offered to take part of his bill off of the wagon; he told witness his bill was to be paid by the wagon before the new arrangement; before the body was bought; the running-gears had been bought before. Roudenbush declined to take the whole bill; the wagon was not done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the record of an attachment-execution, \u201c James Boud <em>v. </em>William H.

The question now arising is, should the evidence have been submitted to the jury ? The defendant contends that <em>the </em>evidence shows <em>the </em>transaction was substantially an agreement by which Roudenbush, a wheelwright, was to make and deliver to the plaintiff, at a price stipulated, the wagon in question, but when the defendant purchased it at constable\u2019s sale as the property of Roudenbush, it was unfinished, and the plaintiff had neither paid for it nor obtained possession of it. If these were the facts, and Roudenbush had furnished the materials, it is very clear the court committed no error in ordering the nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">We think, however, that this is not the only view presented by the evidence. The testimony -is not very clearly stated in the paper-books, but as we understand it, there is some evidence going to establish this state of facts, to wit: \u201c In 1869 Roudenbush resided in Montgomery county. He was indebted to the plaintiff, and also to the plaintiff\u2019s father. An agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and Roudenbush, by which the latter was to make the wagon. Before it was finished Roudenbush moved to Chester county. On leaving, he delivered the running-gears to the plaintiff. Not long after the plaintiff also bought from him the bed of the wagon. After the plaintiff had retained all these parts of the wagon in his possession for several months, and procured other materials, he made a new contract with Roudenbush for its completion, at a stipulated price for the whole cost of the wagon. He thereupon took to the shop of Roudenbush, near Valley Eorge, the running-gears, body, iron work and materials for trimming and cover. As a part of the consideration the plaintiff was to pay the debt which his father had against Roudenbush. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The plaintiff further testified that about the 20th February 1871, he settled with Roudenbush for the wagon, and that there was due on account of it a less sum than the debt due to his father, and that he subsequently paid the residue to his father, but had not taken the wagon from the shop when it was levied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">If the jury should find this alleged statement of facts to be true, we think it takes the question of legal fraud out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">There had been such an exclusive and long-continued possession of the property in the plaintiff, that his title could only be affected by actual fraud. There had been an open, visible change of the possession of the property. When Roudenbush moved out of the county, the plaintiff had accepted it. After retaining it in his exclusive possession for some six months, the fact that, under a new contract, the plaintiff placed the unfinished wagon in the possession of the former owner to be finished, is no fraud in law on the creditors of Roudenbush. The jury should be permitted to pass on the good faith of the whole transaction under proper instructions from the court: Dunlap <em>v. </em>Bournonville, 2 Casey 72; McMarlan <em>v. </em>English, 24 P. F. Smith 296. The third, fourth and fifth assignments are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">As we are not furnished with a copy of the record referred to in the first assignment, we are not able to say there was error in its rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The evidence covered by the second assignment is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
