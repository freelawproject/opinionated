Though no trustee was named, equity will raise one, in order to effectuate the intention of the testator. Hence, it was the duty of the Orphans\u2019 Court, which proceeds according to the principles of equity, to preserve the use by providing that the estate should not be paid into her own hands, and thereby enable her to dispose of it contrary to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Decree affirmed with costs and appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
