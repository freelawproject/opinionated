Their claim was for a quantity of coal furnished to the defendants at Shamokin. The defendants alleged that the contract between plaintiffs and themselves was that the plaintiffs should give the defendants the exclusive sale of their coal <em>westward </em>from Shamokin, at such prices that the defendants could realize 25 cents per ton on the sale of the coal, and sell it at the same price as the plaintiffs sold to the trade, but that the plaintiffs sold coal westward to Thomas Baumgardner and others. The plaintiffs alleged that their contract with defendants was that they should have the sale of the coal westward exclusive of every one except Baumgardner. Whether there was this exception, was the question of fact in the ease, as to which there was much evidence on both sides on the trial of the case October 31st 1872, before Rockefeller, P.

A. G. Fuller, recalled, said: \u201c I procured the certificate dated 25th February 1879, from the office of the secretary of state in the city of Boston. The erasures were all made before the paper was certified by the secretary, and before the seal of state was on. The words of the certificate were all put there by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>proper officer. The paper is in the same condition that it was in when I received it at the office of the secretary of state.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">Being cross-examined he said : <em>\u201c </em>I think it had the seal of the state to it when I took it away the first time. I cannot say that it was re-stamped when I went back the second time. I cannot tell what the words were that were originally written in where the erasures are. The paper is just as I received it from the officers at the office of the secretary of state. I noticed an erasure when I got the paper at the office. The officer in the secretary of state\u2019s office wrote the certificate. I have no recollection of seeing the original paper drawn. I got the paper at the office, and then went back afterwards and got the certificate made to it. I do not know whose handwriting the certificate is in, that is, I am not personally acquainted with the party who drew it. I do not know whether there was anything written in underneath those words or not before they were written in there. After some few terms ago of this court, I went to the secretary\u2019s office in Boston and got the certificate put on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">Being re-examined he said: \u201c This book, containing the minutes which I before referred to, contains the original articles of association and the minutes of the proceedings of the corporation.

They contain a record of the election of officers.\u201d Paper purporting to be a certificate of the mayor and clerk of the city of Boston shown witness.

Douty was their agent for the Henry Clay Colliery, that he had sold the coal for which the suit was brought to defendants in December 1867 and January 1868 at prices agreed on; being those in the accounts sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-11\">T. D. Grant, one of the' defendants, testified that he made a contract with Douty, agent, on the 9th of January 1866, for the exclusive sale of coal west from the Henry Clay Colliery; the defendants had been buying coal from that colliery during the year 1865; that Douty accepted propositions made by witness to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>defendants the exclusive sale west of the Henry Clay coal; Douty was to sell this coal to plaintiffs for 25 cents per <em>ton </em>less than he would sell to the trade. Witness testified that the plaintiffs had sold coal to Baumgardner and others to go west.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">Defendants gave evidence also that they had issued a card, signed with Douty\u2019s name by his authority, stating that he had given them the exclusive right of the Henry Clay coal west.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">For the plaintiffs in rebuttal, Douty testified that the bargain was, that he sold to defendants all the coal that went west but Baumgardner\u2019s ; the defendants and Baumgardner agreed that he was not to touch any of defendants\u2019 territory west of the river, and defendants were not to sell any coal east of Harrisburg down. This arrangement was made in consequence of the complaint of both parties that Douty had sold to each more than to the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">The evidence on both sides tended to show that the defendants had had two or three years\u2019 course of dealing in coal with Douty as agent for the plaintiffs. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-9\">The defendants\u2019 points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-10\">1. The plaintiffs have not established by sufficient legal evidence their existence or right to sue as a corporation; and that they cannot sustain this action under the pleadings and evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-11\">2. If the court should decline answering the above point in the affirmative,' then the defendants ask the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiffs not having been incorporated by the state of Pennsylvania, or under or by virtue of the laws thereof, had no power or authority to hold lands nor carry on the business of mining or selling coal in the years 1866, 1867 and 1868, in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-12\">3. The plaintiffs cannot in a suit brought in their alleged corporate name, enforce a contract alleged to have been made in Pennsylvania in relation to the sale and delivery of any portion of the coal mined or alleged to have been mined by the plaintiffs in Pennsylvania, and that therefore this action cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-13\">The court refused the first and third points without qualification: and in answer to the second point said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-14\">\u201c I answer this pointin the negative. It may be that these plaintiffs had no right, power or authority to hold lands in this state, but as I understand this and defendants\u2019 third point, it is intended to raise the question whether the plaintiffs, having lands consisting of a colliery in this state, can with it carry on the business of mining or selling coal, and if not, then can plaintiffs recover in an action for the price of coal sold and delivered ? I think the defendants cannot question this right in this action, so as to defeat the claim of plaintiffs for coal sold and delivered to them under their contract, and therefore I do not affirm this point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-15\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $3274.53.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-16\">The defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>admission of the evidence objected to, and the answers to their points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-6\"><em>L.

The said act was certified by the secretary of state, under the seal of the Commonwealth. This is in strict compliance with the Act of Congress of the 26th of May 1790, sec. 1, Brightly\u2019s Digest 265, pl. 9, which provides that <em>\u201c </em>the acts of the legislatures of the several states shall be authenticated, by having the seal of their respective states affixed thereto.\u201d The objection was made to the admission of this copy, that it is only a chapter or part of a statute and that as the whole was not certified, the portion offered was not evidence. We do not regard the objection as well taken. There is no evidence that the matter certified is only a portion of an act, except what may be drawn inferentially from a reference in the fifth section to another distinct act, as chapter sixty. The fact that one Act of Assembly refers to another act, does not render the former act incomplete in itself, nor make it necessary to certify the act to which such reference is made. The act in question provides for the organization of corporations in Massachusetts, and the reference in sect. 5th to chapter 60, shows it to have no connection with the organization of corporations, but to relate to matters subsequent thereto. It was held in Adle <em>v. </em>Sherwood, 3 Whart. 481, that if an Act of Assembly contains different subjects, it is not necessary that the whole act should be certified in order to make it admissible in evidence. It is sufficient to produce those sections which relate to the matter in question. The admission of the Massachusetts statute referred to in evidence, was followed by proof of the organization of the plaintiffs below, thereunder. The articles of association, with the signatures of the corporators thereto, and the notice of the time and place of their first meeting, were duly proved. The minute book of the company was properly received for the purpose of showing its organization. It is said in Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations 573, that \u201c to prove the acts of a corporation necessary to be done in order to their corporate existence, the books of the corporation proven by the clerk or secretary, are competent evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Up to this point there seems no difficulty. Then comes a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tificate of the president, treasurer, and a majority of the directors, certifying to the name of the company, its objects, its organization under the laws of Massachusetts, the amount of capital stock and par value of its shares, the amount of capital actually paid in, and the location of its place of business. This certificate is evidently in compliance with the 8th section of chapter 61. One copy thereof appears to have been filed in the office of the mayor of Boston, and another copy in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A copy from each office was offered in evidence, and objected to upon the ground that it was not properly certified. The certificate of 25thof February 1869 was objected to, upon the further ground that it contained erasures upon its face. The latter objection is disposed of by the testimony of Mr. Fuller. He says: \u201c The paper is just as I received it at the office of the secretary of state. I noticed an erasure when I got the paper from the office.\u201d Nor is the remaining objection to this paper well founded. It appears to be certified in substantial compliance with the requirements of the first section of the Act of Congress of 27th of March 1804, Brightly 266, pl. 10. It is true there is no certificate that the attestation is in due form. It is to be remembered, however, that it is the secretary of the Commonwealth who certifies. He does so under the seal of the state ; and that portion of the Act of Congress which requires that officer to certify that \u201c the attestation is in due form,\u201d would not seem to he applicable to a case where the secretary himself certifies a paper from his own office. It would be an unnecessary adherence to the letter of the statute to require him to certify that his own certificate is in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The certificate of the 25th of February 1869, having been properly admitted, the certificate of the mayor of Boston became unimportant. The testimony of Mr. Fuller, the secretary of the company, that the parties signed the articles of association and organized thereunder; the minutes of the company, proved by him to be in his handwriting, together with the copy of the declaration, filed in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth, certified by that officer under the seal of the state of Massachusetts, sufficiently established the existence of the corporation. <em>\u201c </em>A corporation exists under the General Statutes, chap. 61, sect. 1, so as to be able to contract debts as soon as its first meeting has been held and its officers have been chosen, if not immediately upon the signing of the articles of association:\u201d Hawes <em>v. </em>Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, 101 Mass. 385. The making of the certificate required by the General Statutes, chap. 61, sect. 8, is not a condition precedent to the existence of a corporation under that chapter: Merrick <em>v. </em>Reynolds Engine &amp; Governor Co., 101 Mass. 381. We are bound by the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts, upon a matter relating to the organization of a corporation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the statutes of that state. It was wholly unnecessary to give in evidence the certificate of the mayor of Boston, and its admission by the court, even if erroneous, did not injure the plaintiffs in error. This point is purely technical. There was evidence that the plaintiffs in error knew- that Mr. Douty was the agent of the Henry Clay Coal Company; that they dealt with him as such agent for about two years, making monthly settlements for the coal received from him. Having dealt with\u2019the defendants in error as a <em>de facto </em>corporation, there is little merit in the defence now taken, that they were not duly incorporated, and,had no right to sue for the coal which it is admitted they delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Nor is there any question raised upon this record as to the right of this company, as a foreign corporation, to hold real estate, or even mining leases, in this state. If the Commonwealth has any interest in such inquiry, it can be made by her proper officer. It is a matter with which the plaintiffs in error have no concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">It is unnecessary to notice any of the other questions raised by the assignments of error. With the failure of their plea of <em>nul tiel corporation, </em>the case of the plaintiffs in error crumbles to pieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
