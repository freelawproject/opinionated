Developments are expected to entangle a United States Senator, a member of the District bench, an official of the District other than the insurance superintendent, candidates for the inaugural chairmanship, and many others prominent in financial and social affairs here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">Mr. Johnson\u2019s resolution provides that the two companies and all their affairs be investigated, and that the same inquiry be made into the affairs of the superintendent of insurance and a firm of Washington real estate brohers. The resolution gives the District of Columbia or any of its subcommittees power to examine the books, records, and documents of all named in the resolution, to appraise their property and examine witnesses in public hearings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">Rigid Penalty for Perjury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-9\">It provides a rigid penalty for perjury in the case, and specifically provides that no official or private person be called as a witness before the examiners shall be excused from testimony, either because such testimony would incriminate him or because he learned facts as a private counselor or public official.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-10\">While Mr. Johnson and several of his colleagues were preparing to set the machinery for this inquiry in motion to-day, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>atmosphere around the Capitol was tense, and it was no less exciting at. the Municipal Building. It was reported that Commissioner Judson, after signing the order of removal., was informed by one of his associates, Commissioner Cuno Rudolph, that he declined to affix his signature to the order. Mr. J udson was therefore compelled to seek Commissioner John A. Johnston in order that a majority of the Commissioners might sign the order, making it valid. Superintendent Ingham is a nephew of Senator Gallagher, of New Hampshire, chairman of the District committee of the Senate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">It is understood that one of the insurance companies is accused of buying a building in Washington, and a few days later having this property appraised for $500,000 more than the purchase price. This inflated value, it is charged, was put into the insurance company as a \u201csurplus\u201d and shares sold upon its guaranty. The names of prominent men were sought and used upon the letter heads, and alluring stock offers sent out hv mail. The success resulting from this campaign was said to be so great that, it is charged, the price of the stock was doubled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">Johnson in Quiet Probe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">Early in the summer, the Painesville (Kentucky) man wrote Mr. .Johnson asking the Congressman\u2019s advice about the company, and asking for a recommendation concerning an investment in its stock. After an inquiry, Mr. Johnson replied, advising against such an investment, and since that time has been quietly gathering information about the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">A few days ago a prominent Washington financier, who has been seeking from President-elect Wilson the appointment of inaugural chairman, resigned from connection with the company; and another financier, who has been equally active in making a campaign for appointment as inaugural chairman, is said to have been one of tbe original promoters of the venture. All these facts can be proved, according to Mr. Johnson, and the letter heads of the company hear names prominent in congressional judicial, and financial affairs of the District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Plaintiff offered testimony tending to show publication of the foregoing in the Baltimore Sun of December 14, 1912, and that the circulation of the paper on that day was 86,776; that the defendant had an office in the city of Washington from which orders could be had at the Sun Bureau on Fourteenth street; that plaintiff was superintendent of insurance of the District of Columbia; that he knew many people in the city of Washington and the city of Baltimore; that the Commissioner referred to in the above article was Colonel William V. Judson, Engineer Commissioner; that the Municipal Building was the District building where the Commissioners have their offices, and where the office of plaintiff as superintendent of insurance is located; that the Cuno H. Rudolph referred to is the president of the Board of Commissioners. John A. Johnston was the other civilian Commissioner. That there is no Senator Gallagher of New Hampshire, but the article meant Senator Gallinger; that he is not a nephew of Senator Gallinger, but a distant relative; that the Congressman Johnson referred to is Representative Ben Johnson, Chairman of the District committee of the House of Representatives. That plaintiff on his way to his office on December 14, 1912, had his attention called by several persons to the article in the Baltimore Sun, and bought a copy at the first news stand; that it was a great shock when he was told of and saw the article; that plaintiff had never been removed or suspended from office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">J. Fred Essary, called by defendant, said he had been correspondent of the Baltimore Sun about three years. While in the press gallery of the House of Representatives he heard the resolution offered by Representative Johnson. This resolution was then read. It contained a recital of a resolution committing to the District committee the investigation of the conduct, management, and affairs of certain fire insurance companies, certain individuals, and to examine the papers, etc., of the superintendent of insurance of the District of Columbia. That after reading the resolution witness made notes of it with the idea of writing an article upon it. That about 7 o\u2019clock that day, Arthur B. Crock, of the Courier Journal, came to witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>office and told him he had written a story bearing on the investigation, and would relieve him of the trouble of writing it. Crock did this under what is known in Washington as a sort of co-operative arrangement whereby newspaper men work together, it being impossible for one or two men to report all of the business of Washington in a day. Witness read the story and it was printed in next morning\u2019s Sun just as Crock wrote it. Witness did not accept the story, however, without making particular inquiry as to the source of Mr. Crock\u2019s information. lie had no reason to question its accuracy, as he had co-operated with Crock for two or three years and found him to be an intelligent and conscientious newspaper man. Knowing the fact of the investigation, witness asked Crock where his information came from. Crock replied that he had gotten it from Representative Johnson, of Kentucky; he had told him the District Commissioners had suspended Ingham pending the investigation. Witness further read an article communicated by him to the Sun, January 26, 1913, relating to this investigation, and giving an account of the examination of a Washington judge. About the middle of this article appears the following sub-headline :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">\u201cTends to Vindicate Ingham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">\u201cAt the time the report was current t-liat District Insurance Commissioner Ingham had been suspended. This proved later to he untrue, and the more recent developments in the inquiry have tended strongly to vindicate Mr. Ingham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">\u201cHe was made a target of, it is now believed, for the reason that he was connected -with the family of Senator Gallinger, chairman of the District committee of the Senate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">Witness testified further that at the time he wrote the article of January 26 he had had no complaint from plaintiff or from any source of the article of December 14; that it came to his notice some time after the first article was written; that there was an error in it inasmuch as plaintiff had not been removed pending the investigation, but in the rush of business he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>given no attention to the matter until the investigation had proceeded some two or three weeks. lie followed the testimony in the case from the Washington papers, and at the first opportunity wrote his second article with the view of setting right the former error, if one had been committed; felt the impulse to right the injury that had been done plaintiff whether complained of or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">Defendant read a letter from plaintiff\u2019s counsel to O. H. Grasty, president and general manager of the defendant corporation, dated March 3, 1913, in which he called attention to the article announcing the dismissal of plaintiff, and of his employment by plaintiff to bring action for the libel, and inquiring if he desired to make amends or compensation without litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">A reply to this letter was read, dated March 5, 1913, which said: \u201cIf we have done an injustice to Mr. Ingham, as stated in your letter, we shall make thorough correction regardless of \u25a0whether you bring a suit or not. Any such errors in the Sun are made in the effort to print the news, and when we make them it is our settled practice to correct them promptly, frankly, and without reserve, and with -the view of making the fullest reparation possible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">Plaintiff then read the following letter from Grasty to the correspondent Essary:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\">March 5, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-9\">My Dear Mr. Essary:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-10\">I send you, herewith, copy of letter from Mr. Easby-Smith, together with my reply thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-11\">Please immediately proceed to investigate this matter, and if the facts are as stated by Mr. Easby-Smith, I want to set his client right, thoroughly and promptly and without any regard to the question of libel suit. Kindly let me hear from you at once in this matter, and if we are in error give me full explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-12\">Another letter from plaintiff\u2019s counsel to .Grasty, dated March 31, 1913, was to the effect that he had been expecting to hear from him since Mr. West called a couple of weeks before, as to proposition for settlement, and saying that sufficient time had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>been given, and that lie would be compelled to file suit unless lie heard from him within a few days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">Defendant offered in evidence an article which Essary testified was written by him and published in the Baltimore Sun next day, under the following headlines:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">Mr.' Ingham Exonerated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-7\">Congressional Committee Repudiates all Charges Against Him.

The responsibility for the headline rests in the city or news room in Baltimore. That he had nothing to do with the headline of the article, but that the article gives the impression which the headline states.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-13\">Charles IT. Grasty, for defendant, was president and general manager for the defendant when this matter occurred. Did not know plaintiff, and had no knowledge of the publication until he received the letter from plaintiff\u2019s counsel. That he had no malice or ill-will against plaintiff. Defendant read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>evidence from the records of the District Commissioners a motion by Commissioner Judson that the office of superintendent of insurance be declared vacant. This motion was not carried. Also a letter from Grasty to II. West, of the Sun Bureau, in Washington, asking his advice about the letter from plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">West testified that he consulted with Essary, called on plaintiff\u2019s counsel and offered to make a correction, and was told that the time had gone by when a correction would be satisfactory. Witness submitted a form of correction to counsel, who said the time had gone by in which it would be satisfactory. Witness wrote a correction, which was published in the Baltimore Sun If arch 22, 1913. This article is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">Ingham Still in Office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">Superintendent of Insurance Not Bcmoved as Stated in the Sun.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">The attention of the Sun has been called to the fact that in its issue of December 14, 1912, in a report of the recent congressional investigation of two insurance companies of the District of Cohunbia, it was stated that Superintendent of Insurance Ingham had been removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">Superintendent Ingham was not removed or suspended during the investigation, and the Sun desires to express its regret that this error in its report should have occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-10\">Defendant then read the report from the congressional committee toward exonerating the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-11\">Plaintiff asked an instruction to the effect that, in estimating the damages to be awarded the plaintiff, you should render a verdict for such sum as you believe from the evidence will fully and fairly compensate him for the injuries suffered by him by reason of the publication by the defendant of the libel complained of, including the mental pain, distress, and humiliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>which you may find he suffered as the result of the publication, and for the detraction from his good name and reputation which the publication of the defamatory article may have occasioned, or may hereafter occasion; and in this connection you may consider the extent of the circulation of the publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">Defendant excepted to this instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">Plaintiff offered instruction number eight, which was given over the objection of the defendant, and exception reserved. It reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">\u201cTou are instructed that the publishers of newspapers are held by the law to the highest accountability for unreliable publications, and that it was the duty of the defendant as the publisher of a widely circulated newspaper to exercise reasonable caution against the false defamation of the innocent, and to take reasonable care to ascertain the truth of the defamatory matter affecting the character, good name, and reputation of the plaintiff; and if you believe from the evidence that the defendant failed to exercise such reasonable care, and that the libel complained of was published without taking reasonable precautions to ascertain the truth of the allegations concerning the plaintiff; and if you further find from the evidence that the libel complained of was published by the defendant with reckless indifference to the injuries which it might occasion to the plaintiff, then such failure to take reasonable precautions and such reckless indifference to the rights of the plaintiff is equivalent to an intentional violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, or to malice in fact, and sufficient to justify the jury in awarding the plaintiff punitive damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">Defendant offered the following instruction, which was refused, and exception reserved. It reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-8\">\u201cThe jury are instructed that if they find from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s correspondent Essary honestly and in good faith believed the statements in the newspaper article set forth in plaintiff\u2019s declaration to be true, and had the grounds for such belief sufficient to satisfy an ordinary prudent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>cautious man that such statements were true, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover punitive damages in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">Defendant then offered the following instruction, which was refused, and exception reserved:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">\u201cThe jury are instructed that if they find that the defendant\u2019s correspondent Essary was prompted by actual malice, or acted with reckless or careless indifference to the rights and feelings of the plaintiff in the publication of the newspaper article set forth in plaintiff\u2019s declaration, that such actual malice or reckless or careless indifference cannot be imputed to the defendant on the evidence in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\">The court in the general charge stated to the, jury as follows: \u201cYou will consider all the circumstances of the case, and assess those damages at what you believe is a fair and just sum, merely with a view to compensating the plaintiff, so far as he can be compensated by money damages, as is stated in the instruction which has been read to you. Those are all the damages which a plaintiff is entitled to recover in his own right strictly as a matter of law, but in this class of, cases, if the jury find certain other elements to be present, the jury has a right to award punitive damages. These damages are to be awarded, if at all, as a punishment to the defendant, and by way of an example to the defendant and to the community in the interest of law and order; and consequently they rest entirely in the discretion of the jury, not only as to the amount, but as to whether any shall be awarded at all. It is my duty to call your attention to the elements which would justify you, if you find them to exist in the case, in awarding such damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-8\">This was excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, assessing his damages by reason of the premises in the sum of $6,000; $5,000 of which they assess as compensatory damages, and $1,000 as punitive damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-10\">The court overruled a motion for a new trial and entered judgment upon the verdict for the whole amount, and defendant has appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Mr. <em>Arthur Peter </em>and <em>Mr. Julian W.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>facts alleged in tlie article as regards the removal of plaintiff were libelous <em>per se. </em>It tended to bring him into contempt and disgrace. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. S. B. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>12 App. D. C. 306, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In that case it was said: \u201cWhere, in an action for libel or slander, the cause of action is proved against the defendant, the jury are not limited to nominal damages merely, though no evidence is given on behalf of the plaintiff, and where the libel is actionable without the averment of special damages, the jury may take into consideration not only the injury that has arisen, but that which may thereafter arise, from the publication of the libel.\u201d See also <em>Washington Herald Co. </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>41 App. D. C. 322, 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The serious contention is as to the instruction permitting the jury to find punitive damages also. Essary was a correspondent of the Baltimore Sun. Ilis duties were to collect and forward news items. It does not appear that the corporation or its manager knew of the character of the article or of anything to refute the act of publication. On the contrary, the paper published the refutation of the story and sent a representative to the plaintiff with an offer to publish a correction, and this correction was also published. <em>Lake Shore &amp; M. S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>147 U. S. 101, 107, 37 L. ed. 97, 101, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261, where the court said: \u201cExemplary or punitive damages, being awarded, not by way of compensation to the sufferer, but by way of punishment of the offender, and as a warning to others, can only be awarded against one who has participated in the offense. A principal, therefore, though, of course, liable to make compensation for injuries done by his agent within the scope of his employment, cannot be held liable for exemplary or punitive damages, merely by reason of wanton, oppressive, or malicious intent on the part of the agent.\u201d See also <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>50 N. <em>J. </em>L. 481, 14 Atl. 488; <em>Detroit Daily Post Co. </em>v. <em>McArthur, </em>16 Mich. 447; <em>Eviston </em>v.

S. 534, 43 L. ed. 543, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>It was therefore error to submit the question of punitive damages to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The verdict for punitive damages being separate and distinct from that for compensatory damages, if the plaintiff shall, within ten days from this date, remit the amount of that verdict, $1,000, the judgment will be modified to that extent and affirmed, each party paying his own costs in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">If the amount he not remitted as above provided, the judgment will he reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A remittitur was filed, and the judgment was modified and affirmed.
