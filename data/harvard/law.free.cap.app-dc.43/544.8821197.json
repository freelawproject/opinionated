Stilson Hutchins, his wife, Walter S. Hutchins, Lee Hutchins, and .Mildred Rogers, heirs at law and next of kin of Stilson Hutchins, were made parties defendant. November 13, 1911, the court entered a decree taking jurisdiction of the trust, and ordered the trustee to file a statement of the property included in the trust, of all receipts and disbursements, and of all the obligations of the said Hutchins and the mortgages and trust deeds upon said property.

He admitted that he had in cash surplus income amounting to $90,000, and stated that he had no objection to the granting of an order directing him to make a loan to petitioner. A further answer filed by him November '6, 1914, admitted that petitioner had an interest in the income of the estate; that he has now in hand net income amounting to $120,000, after the payment of taxes, interest, maintenance, and upkeep of the property; that this fund is in banks which for the greater part is earning 3 per cent interest; that this loan will not impair the estate, as sufficient funds will remain in hand to finance the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">He prays that an order be entered authorizing him to make, a loan to Rose Reeling Hutchins of $35,000 at 6 per cent per annum, and payable upon the issue of letters testamentary or of administration of the estate of 'Stilson Hutchins, the same to be secured by proper assignments and deeds of trust upon the, interest in the said estate of Stilson Hutchins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">December 9, 1914, the court entered a decree authorizing and directing the trustee to loan Rose Reeling Hutchins $35,-000 out of the funds of the estate upon her executing to him lier promissory note for said sum payable on or before two years from its date, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually, to be secured by a deed of trust and assignment of all her right, title, and interest in the said estate of Stilson Hutchins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">He was further directed to pay out of said $35,000 such liens, if any, as now exist against Rose Keeling Hutchins, so that the security would be a first charge upon her interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANc\">It was further decreed that said loan shall be a charge and first lien upon the interest of Rose Keeling Hutchins in the estate of Stilson Hutchins, real, personal, and mixed, and upon the increase thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">Walter S.

C. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">It has also upheld the validity of the claim of Nose Keeling Hutchins to an interest in the surplus income of the estate. <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>41 App. D. C. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The accumulated income at the time of the order was $120,-000, and was not invested at a greater rate than 3 per cent. The trustee is fully satisfied with the security offered, and recommends the loan. The court, with a knowledge of the circumstances, approved the loan and made the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Mr. Justice Gould, who entered the order, filed a brief opinion, in the conclusion of which he says: \u201cWhile this form of security is unusual as an investment of trust funds, under the circumstances of the instant case, to make a loan thereon appears not only advantageous to the estate, but an act of justice to applicant; therefore, the safety of the loan is beyond question. Under either will, or in the event it should be found that Stilson Hutchins died intestate, her interest in the estate would exceed many times the amount of the loan. In fact, her interest in the fund of the accumulated rents of the real estate from which the loan is drawn, if it should now be divided, exceeds the amount borrowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>We agree with the learned justice, and his decree is affirmed with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">An appeal to the Supremo Court of the United States was denied May <em>21, </em>1915.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
