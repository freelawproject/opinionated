In the specification and claims of this patent the ridges of the tip are said to be formed by \u201ccorrugating\u201d or \u201ccrimping\u201d the metal. In 1912 appellant, Barthels Manufacturing Company, manufactured lacings under this patent, which it sold under the mark \u201cNubeaded.\u201d On July 20th of that year it filed an application for registration of \u201cNubded,\u201d and the use of the prior mark was then discontinued. As soon as \u201cNubded\u201d was registered, appellant applied it to its laces in a hyphenated form; in other words, as \u201cNu-B-Ded,\u201d and has since used the mark in that form.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Whether, as contended by appellant, the word \u201cBeaded\u201d as .used is descriptive, and hence not susceptible of exclusive ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>propriation by the appellee, or whether, as contended by appellee, it is merely suggestive, and therefore subject to such appropriation, we need not stop to inquire, for if it is descriptive, \u201cNew Beaded,\u201d or, as the appellant spells it, \u201cNu-B-Ded,\u201d is equally so, and hence not regist\u00e9rable. If \u201cBeaded\u201d is merely suggestive, appellant is not entitled to registration, since \u201cBeaded\u201d and \u201cNu-B-Ded,\u201d are sufficiently similar as to be likely to cause confusion in trade when applied to goods of the same descriptive properties. Inasmuch as appellee would be damaged in either event, it is entitled to be heard in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Decision affirmed. \u2022 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
