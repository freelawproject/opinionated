As he desired to be transported on Fourteenth street north of Park road he obtained a transfer which, according to its terms, was good from point of issue in the direction indicated until the time canceled; in this instance, until 6:20. The transfer also contained the following: \u201cPassengers are required to see that time punched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>is correct and accept transfer subject to company\u2019s rules and as not transferable or giving stop-over privileges.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">\u2022 Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that when the car reached the point of transfer, that is, Fourteenth street and Park road, plaintiff got off and went to a house one street north, where he transacted some business, after which he returned to the transfer point (having consumed in all, according to his estimate, about ten minutes time) and boarded a north-bound, pay-within car. He handed the transfer to the conductor and sat down. The conductor then said: \u201cYour transfer is overdue; it\u2019s no good; it\u2019s out of date.\u201d Plaintiff replied: \u201cNo, I guess it\u2019s all right; I don\u2019t, think it\u2019s overdue.\u201d The conductor, insisting that the transfer was overdue, rang the bell and the car stopped at Fourteenth and Monroe streets. In the meantime the conductor had called the motorman back and had informed the plaintiff that he would have to get off the car. The plaintiff jumped up and said, \u201cWell, I will give you another fare rather than, have any trouble and be put off;\u201d but the conductor would not then receive any fare. Later on in his testimony plaintiff said that he \u201coffered to pay his fare between Park road and Monroe street when the conductor was contesting his transfer; <em>when the motorman came bade at the call of the </em>conductor, the plaintiff jumped up and said, \u2018Very well, I will pay you another fare rather than be put off.\u2019 * * * It was just about the time the car stopped at Monroe street that he offered to pay his fare; it was after the car stopped at Monroe street that the conductor called the motorman back, <em>and just before the motorman got to where conductor and plaintiff </em>were, <em>plaintiff offered to pay his fare; </em>when he jumped up and offered to pay his fare, the car had stopped at Monroe street.\u201d Plaintiff did not at any time look at the time limit punched on his transfer. A witness for the plaintiff testified that he heard the plaintiff and conductor arguing over the terms of the transfer, and that finally \u201cthe conductor pulled the bell and called the motorman, and the motorman came back; just before the motorman reached plaintiff, the conductor put both hands on plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and said, \u2018Well, you will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>get off, the transfer is no good;\u2019 and the plaintiff replied, \u2018Why, it is good, and <em>why should I pay another fareby that time the moto man ivas possibly two seats from plaintiff and conductor, </em>and the- conductor caught hold of plaintiff\u2019s arm, the hitter started to rise from his seat, and put his hand in his right vest pocket, and said, \u2018Ifatlier than be put off the car, I will pay you another fare,\u2019 but the conductor replied, \u2018You won\u2019t pay me any fare,\u2019 and while he did not push the plaintiff, he followed him around with his hand until plaintiff stepped from the car; this occurred -at about thirty-four or thirty-five minutes past 6.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">It is conceded that the transfer was overdue, and 'it is not contended that excessive force was employed in ejecting plaintiff. According to the evidence for the defendant, the Fourteenth street car from which plaintiff alighted reached the point of transfer at about 6 o\u2019clock. Its evidence further tended to show that the conductor to whom the transfer was presented made repeated unsuccessful efforts to induce the plaintiff to pay his fare before resorting to the extreme measure of putting him off the car. The defendant offered to show, from regularly kept transportation records, that twenty-six cars passed the transfer point between the car from which plaintiff alighted and the car from which he was ejected. This offer was rejected and an exception noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\">At the close of the evidence counsel for the defendant moved the court for an instructed verdict, which motion was overruled and an exception noted. Thereupon the court instructed the jury that if the plaintiff, when he offered the void transfer, was acting in good faith, it was the duty of the conductor, after informing him that the transfer was not good, to give him a reasonable time in which to pay his fare before putting him off. Among other things the court said: \u201cIf all that time he (plaintiff) was acting in good faith, honestly thinking his transfer was good, and the conductor insisted on his side that it was not good, <em>and then called the motorman back to help him eject the passenger, </em>who said, \u2018Why, I do not want any trouble; I will pay my fare rather than be put off,\u2019 all the while acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>as an honest man in good faith, it would be the duty of the conductor in those circumstances to accept his fare, and not put him off. That is the case as the plaintiff tries to show you on the evidence. * * * <em>The plaintiff says that as he saw the motorman coming back </em>he tried to reach his vest pocket, and said, \u2018I will pay the fare rather than have any trouble,\u2019 and the other passengers said the same thing, that that did occur.\u201d In response to a question from a juror the court again stated the issue as follows: \u201cThe question is whether he (plaintiff) offered to pay his fare <em>before he was put off': </em>If he did offer to pay it, they had no right to put him off, no matter about the transfer.\u201d To this portion of the charge the 'defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-6\"><em>Mr. Frank J. </em>Hogan, for the appellant, in his brief, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ars\"><em>Abra Silver Min.

Realizing the proneness of the travel-ling public to carelessness, the courts .have adopted the very reasonable rule that if a passenger tenders a ticket void on its face, he must be given a reasonable opportunity to pay lawful fare before he may be considered a trespasser. In other words, the conductor, at least in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, may not assume that he is acting in bad faith until he has been informed that his ticket is not good and has failed, within a reasonable time, to pay his' fare. But, after notice, he must seasonably elect whether he will pay his fare and receive the privileges of a passenger, or leave the car as-a trespasser. \u201cAnd while there is some contrariety of opinion respecting the effect of a subsequent tender of compliance, the better and prevailing rule is that, when the refusal is wilful, persistent, or capricious, or proceeds from a fraudulent purpose to evade paying for transportation to which he knows he is not otherwise entitled, the passenger cannot, * * * after the process of ejection has begun, entitle himself to transportation and render the completion of the ejection wrongful.\u201d <em>Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>81 C. C. A. 598, 152 Fed. 608, 10, Ann. Gas. 939. In that case Judge Van Devanter now Justice Van Devanter of the Supreme Court, wrote the opinion for the circuit court of appeals. It appeared that after the conductor had given the signal for the train to stop for the purpose of ejecting the plaintiff, a third person offered to pay plaintiff\u2019s fare. This offer the court ruled did not operate to render the <em>completion </em>of plaintiff\u2019s ejection wrongful. In <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>United R. &amp; Electric Co. </em>97 Md. 347, 353, 99 Am. St. Rep. 452, 55 Atl. 371, 14 Am. Neg. Rep. 314, the court said: \u201cIn the case at bar the transfer was void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>on its face when the appellant attempted to use it. It therefore did not entitle him to ride on the Willdns avenue car, and the conductor was justified in demanding the appellant\u2019s fare, and upon the refusal of the latter to pay, the conductor was warranted in ejecting him. * * * Both upon authority and principle it is clear that when the conductor has given the passenger a reasonable time and opportunity to pay the fare, and the passenger has persistently refused to comply, and the conductor has begun the process of expulsion by stopping the car or by applying force to the passenger when necessary, \u2018the passenger thereupon forfeits his rights as a passenger, and his ejection may be completed even though he may thereafter tender the performance demanded.\u2019 \u201d See also <em>Shortsleeves </em>v. <em>Capital Traction Co. </em>28 App. D. C. 365, 8 L.R.A. (N.S.) 287; <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Erie R. Co. </em>73 N. J. L. 558, 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 727, 118 Am. St. Rep. 704, 66 Atl. 403, 9 Ann. Cas. 883; Cincinnati, <em>S. &amp; C. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Skillman, </em>39 Ohio St. 444, 8 Am. Neg. Cas. 571; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>New York C. &amp; H. R. R. Co. </em>80 N. Y. 236. The reasonableness of the above rule is apparent upon a moment\u2019s reflection. The passenger, by presenting a void transfer, becomes prima facie a trespasser, for the obvious reason that his right to be upon the car as a passenger is dependent upon his proffer of proper fare. If he fails or declines within a reasonable time to pay his fare, after the invalidity of his transfer lias been brought to his attention, he becomes in fact a trespasser, and the conductor may treat him as such. Deliberately having assumed the status of a trespasser, he is thereafter in no position to complain because he is treated accordingly. To permit him, after he discovers that his wilfulness has resulted in the commencement of the process of ejection, to resume the status of a passenger by the tender of his fare, would invite attempts at fraud and greatly interfere with the orderly and expeditious running of cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In the light of the foregoing, the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted, since, according to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, he persisted in his failure or refusal to pay his fare until the conductor had rung the bell and called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>upon the motorman to assist in ejecting him. Indeed, the coiiclusion is irresistible from the jolaintiff\u2019s evidence that actual]}7 the car had been.stopped for the purpose-of \u25a0 his ejection before he offered to pay his fare, for he testifies, as does his&gt; witness, that the motorman had started back before he (plaintiff) offered to pay. Of course, the motorman would not have started back while his car was in motion. That such was the purport of plaintiff\u2019s evidence is apparent from the charge of the learned trial justice. -The plaintiff had then voluntarily assumed the status of a trespasser, and his offer to pay his fare came too late. His own evidence leaves no room for doubt that he was afforded ample opportunity to pay his fare before the conductor fixed his status as a trespasser by ringing the bell and calling upon the motorman to assist in ejecting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We think the defendant should have been permitted to show the number of cars that passed between the time the plaintiff reached the transfer point and the time when he boarded the car from which he was ejected, and that its regularly kept transportation records were competent for that purpose. <em>St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>169 Ala. 389, 55 So. 989, Ann. Cas. 1912 B, 366; <em>Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>122 Ky. 256, 3 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1190, 91 S.

The plaintiff contended that he presented the void transfer in good faith and within about ten minutes after he reached the transfer point. The conductor who issued the transfer testified that his ear reached the transfer point at about 6 o\u2019clock, and it is conceded that it was not presented until about 6:35. Evidence that twenty-six cars passed this point after the plaintiff -reached it tends to support the statement of the conductor issuing the transfer, and has some bearing upon the plaintiff\u2019s contention of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The judgment'will be reversed, with costs, and the 'cause remanded for a new trial. <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>New York L.
