What I said was, I must have started it too soon.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-11\">(b) The driver testified also that he had been discharged immediately after the accident and he had seen the president of the company about it: \u201cHe asked me, why I was discharged, and I said on account of an old lady falling from my car, and he says, You had better say, an old lady being thrown from your car.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-12\">1. In such case it was error for the trial judge to charge: \u201c The driver\u2019s evidence here is that he must have started the car before the plaintiff had time to get off, and that he was dismissed, on the ground that his negligence had produced the accident, by the president of the company.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-13\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony showing that the negligence, if any existed, was in the driver\u2019s starting the car too quickly to enable her to alight, it was error to charge the jury that the construction of the car was to be considered, with the other evidence, as bearing upon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-14\">3.

The declaration made to the driver by the president of the company, as above quoted, that officer having no personal knowledge of the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>flic occurrence, was inadmissible as evidence either that the accident was the result of the driver\u2019s negligence, or of any negligence at all.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-4\">5.

The plaintiff\u2019s claim is for damages by reason of negligent conduct on the part of the railroad company by which she has been injured. Before there can be a recovery in a case of this kind, you must be satisfied that the company is guilty of some negligence bringing about the injury, and that the plaintiff is guilty of no negligence on her part contributing to bring about the accident. The evidence must satisfy you: 1. That the company was negligent. 2. That the plaintiff was not negligent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-15\">The negligence here complained of -by the plaintiff is that she was a passenger on board of one of the street-cars commonly known as Slawson or bobtail cars, which is a ear having only a driver and no conductor. It is the obligation of the railway company to carry its passengers with safety. That includes the duty of giving an ordinary and reasonable opportunity to its passengers to get off of the car. It is the duty of the company to carry its passengers safely and give them a reasonable opportunity to get off its cars without injury. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint is, that wishing to alight from the car, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>bell was pulled and when slie was about to get off the car started before slie could do so, and wliile she was getting off the car, she was thrown down and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">The main facts in the case are not disputed. It is not denied that she was in the car, that the car was going west, that she wished to get off the ear, that the bell was rung to stop the car, and that she started to get off the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">[You have heard the evidence on both sides, the plaintiff\u2019s, and that for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">The driver\u2019s evidence here is, that he must have started the car before the plaintiff had time to get off, and that he was dismissed, on the ground that his negligence had produced the accident, by the president of the company. That fact is not controverted by any evidence on the part of the company. The president is not here within the jurisdiction of the court, and no attempt has been made on the part of the other officers of the company to deny the truth of this allegation.] 3 If you believe that this accident happened by reason of the car starting while the plaintiff was in the act of getting off and before she had time to alight, then the company is responsible for the damage sustained by this plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">The character of the injuries sustained by her has been detailed to you. It appears that the bone of her right arm was broken, and that she received a scalp wound on the head..... If you believe that the railroad company has been guilty of negligence, then it is your duty to consider what damages should be awarded to the plaintiff for the injuries she has sustained. Anything like vindictive damages is out of the question in this case. Only compensatory damages can be awarded. In giving damages you must take into consideration the pain and suffering the plaintiff has endured, her loss of time, and any further loss of earning power that you may find has been occasioned by the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">In passing upon all these questions juries are apt to get false impressions of their duty. They are giving away other people\u2019s money, and they are apt to be led away by their sympathies with the injured person. In considering this question you ought to act as business men, and consider it as if it were a suit against yourselves, giving such damages as the evidence justifies, and not disregarding the ordinary rules.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>[In regard to the evidence as to the construction of this car, I charge you that this is to be considered, with all the other evidence in the case, as bearing upon the question of defendant\u2019s negligence. The company has a right to put on such a car as the wants of the community, having regard to the neighborhood and number of people who may ride, may require. In a rural district, where few people ride on the cars, and where there are not many people or vehicles to be expected on the street, it is not negligence in itself to run cars with one person acting as both driver and conductor. The whole case is to be considered with reference to the kind of car, and whether the construction of the car would prevent the driver from attending to his duties as he should have done.] 5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">The defendant requests the court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">1.

What the driver did testify on this subject was as follows: \u201c Heard bell ring, stopped the car and 1 looked in, I saw an old lady passing out of the car. I watched her until she had stepped down off the platform out of my sight. I then started the car and had proceeded but a short distance when some one notified me that the old lady had fallen. I then immediately stopped the car, and went back and found that she had fallen in the street.\u201d This was the actual testimony of the driver, as delivered on the trial, in relation to the facts of the occurrence. Of course it was error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>to say of that testimony that the driver\u2019s evidence here, that is, on the trial, \u201c is that he must have started the car before the plaintiff had time to get off,\u201d and as this is a very material part of the case and may easily have misled the jury, the third assignment of error must be sustained. The error of the learned court was an inadvertence which grew out of another portion of the driver\u2019s testimony. He was interrogated respecting another version of the matter which he had given at another time and which was reduced to writing and signed by himself. The paper being handed to him he read it and then said, speaking of its contents, \u201c It is right that I looked back and saw some one lifting her from the street. The paper says I started the car too soon. What I said was, I must have started it \u25a0 too soon.\u201d It will be seen at once that he was speaking of what he had said on the former occasion and was not testifying to the actual facts of the occurrence. It would have been a fair subject of argument by counsel for the plaintiff, and even of comment by the court, to the effect that inasmuch as he had formerly said he must have started the car too soon, that such must have been the fact notwithstanding his present testimony to the contrary, but in no point of view was it correct for the court to say positively that he testified in that way on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We think the remainder of the portion of the charge covered by the third assignment was also a mistaken presentment of the testimony. The court treats the testimony of this witness as direct, distinct, and affirmative proof that the president of the company had discharged the driver because \u201chis negligence had produced the accident,\u201d and then by way of comment he remarks to the jury that \u201c that fact is not controverted by any evidence on the part of the company.....and no attempt has been made on the part of the other officers of the company to deny this allegation.\u201d Now in point of fact, there was no distinct proof by any witness that the driver was discharged because his negligence had produced the accident. There was at best but a presumption to that effect, and not by any means a strong one, derived by inference from the driver\u2019s testimony. But it might very easily be that the driver was discharged merely because the accident occurred while he was driving and without any reference to the question whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>was liis negligence that produced the accident. The president of the company had no personal knowledge of the accident nor was he or any other officer of the company called to prove either the fact or the cause of the driver\u2019s discharge, and it was scarcely a fair way to treat the testimony as if it was direct and uncontroverted proof that the driver had been discharged by the president because his negligence produced the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Wo think the portions of the charge covered by the fourth and fifth assignments are objectionable. They tended to lead the jury to infer that the mere construction of the car was proof of negligence in producing this particular accident. As the accident arose from a totally different cause, it was error even to intimate to the jury that they might consider the method of construction as proof of negligence. These assignments are therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The sixth and seventh assignments are sustained because the witness, Mary A. Christian, was in no sense an expert, and of course was incompetent to testify to what was mere opinion in respect to her mother\u2019s internal injuries. She could state distinct facts observed by herself, but certainly could not give her opinion that her mother suffered in her head and in her stomach. As to those subjects, she could have no actual knowledge of her own and no information, except from her mother\u2019s declarations, which, of course, would be inadmissible both as hearsay and secondary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">We think the tenth assignment is also sustained. The evidence offered and received was not an admission by the president of the company either that the accident was the result of the driver\u2019s negligence or of any negligence at all. It -was but an admission that the driver was discharged because the accident had occurred. It could not be a binding admission that the accident was the result of the driver\u2019s negligence, because the president was not present at the time of the accident, and had no knowledge of the facts of the occurrence and hence knew nothing to which he could testify, directly or by admission. What the president said could at the best\" be merely an opinion of his own derived from the information of others, and hence could have no element of original testimony or of any legitimate substitute for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In Bigley v. Williams, 80 Pa. 107, we held that the declaration of the pilot of a steamboat, made within an hour after the occurrence of an accident, that the collision was caused by his neglect, was inadmissible as not being part of the res gestae. In the case of Baker v. Allegheny V. R. Co., 95 Pa. 211, the offer was to show a declaration of the defendant company\u2019s superintendent, made after the. accident occurred, that the rope which caused the accident was unsafe. It was held that unless it appeared that the superintendent had had a previous knowledge of the rope, and the declaration was to the effect that he knew before the accident that the rope was unsafe, Ins opinion that it W9-S unsafe was inadmissible. In Oil City Fuel Supply Co. v. Boundy, 122 Pa. 449, we said: \u201c It is imperative in cases of alleged tortious conduct such as negligence, unless the act is specially authorized, that the admissions of the agent must be part of the res gestae. Otherwise they are hearsay. The agent himself can be called to prove the state of facts attempted to be proved by his admissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Conceding that on account of the official position of the president of the company there is a wider responsibility for his admissions than in the case of an ordinary agent, a brief consideration of the testimony received under this assignment establishes its incompetency. The question put to the witness was not cross-examination in any point of view and should have been rejected for that reason. But the fact of the driver\u2019s discharge was of no relevancy, except as it tended to prove the fact of negligence of the driver in the occurrence of the accident. That negligence was an inference to be drawn by the jury from the specific facts of the case, and not from the inferences or opinions of any one. Hence the declarations of any one, no matter who he might be, who was not present and had no personal knowledge of the transaction, could prove nothing more than his own opinion as to the ultimate and essential fact of negligence. This would be so where the declarations were directly to the point that there was negligence. But in the present case the evidence was quite short of this. The driver said the president \u201c asked me why I was discharged, and I said on account of an old lady falling from my car, and he says you had better say an old lady being thrown from your car.\u201d How would this prove or even tend to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>in point of fact the old lady was thrown from the car ? It might tend to prove that the president thought so, but his thinking so would depend upon the correctness of the information he had received from others, to which of course he could not testify directly, and most certainly not indirectly by way of admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In the case of the American Steamship Co. v. Landreth, 102 Pa. 131, we held it to be error, in an action by a passenger against a steamship company to recover damages for an injury sustained on board the vessel, to admit the declaration of the captain of the vessel made to the plaintiff and to another passenger immediately after the accident, that the place where it occurred was a very dangerous part of the ship and that he would have it remedied immediately, for the reason in part that it was a mere expression of opinion on the part of the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The language used by the president of the company in this case does not necessarily import anything more than his displeasure with the driver and is proof of absolutely nothing as to the actual facts of the occurrence. The tenth assignment is sustained. The remaining assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Judgment reversed and new venire awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
