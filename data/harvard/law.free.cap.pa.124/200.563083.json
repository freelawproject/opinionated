McCafferty against J. Lewis Crew and others, trading as Crew, Levick &amp; Co., ivas tried and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $113. On January 25th, the defendants moved for a new trial and a rule was granted. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>March 21st, after argument before the court in banc, Thayer, P. J., the following order was made and entered upon the minute book:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">\u201c March 27, 1887. Rule discharged, on condition that the plaintiff within ten days file a remittitur for all damages over $75; otherwise, rule absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">In transcribing this order upon the court docket, the clerk omitted the words, \u201c within ten days,\u201d therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">On April 20, 1887, the plaintiff filed a remittitur for all damages above $75, paid the jury fee and caused judgment to be entered. Afterwards, the defendants\u2019 counsel called the attention of the clerk to the order as entered upon the minute book, when the clerk interlined upon his docket the words, \u201cwithin ten days,\u201d after the word, \u201cplaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\">On July 6, 1888, the defendants\u2019 counsel obtained a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off, and on September 22, 1888, Thayer, P. J., the rule was discharged and the following order made :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-9\">\u201c September 25, 1888. It is now ordered that the record of this court made March 21, 1887, be corrected so as to read: Rule discharged, on condition that the plaintiff within thirty days file a remittitur for all damages over $75 and costs; otherwise, rule absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-10\">Thereupon the defendants took this writ, assigning as error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-11\">1. The entry of the judgment of April 20, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-12\">2. The refusal to strike off said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-13\">3. The order of September 25, 1888.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-14\"><em>Mr. Theodore F. </em>Jenkins, for the plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-15\">By the order of March 21, 1887, the matter became res adjudicata, and, unless the plaintiff within ton days from that date filed her remittitur, the rule for a new trial became absolute and the verdict was set aside. There can be no doubt of the power to make the order: McBride v. Daniels, 92 Pa. 382, 334. The new trial having been granted by a court having full power to do so, the defendants could not be deprived of a right thus lawfully acquired, by air attempt of the court to reverse its own order: Van Vliet v. Conrad, 95 Pa. 494; Ullery v. Clark, 18 Pa. 148, 149.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Mr. R. W. </em>G-imber, for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">To amend or alter the records rests within the sound discretion of the court, and is not the subject of appeal or writ of error: Kendig\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 68. In cases of fraud, and for the correction of the misprision of a clerk, lapse of time appears to be no bar. Even after judgment is entered, the court have a right to amend the verdict entered to make it conform to the verdict rendered: Smaltz v. Hancock, 118 Pa. 558.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"ANI\">Mr. Chiee Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The plaintiff below recovered a verdict for $113. The defendants obtained a rule for a new trial, and after argument the court made the following order: \u201c March 21, 1887; rule discharged on condition that the plaintiff within ten days file a remittitur for all damages over $75, otherwise rule absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">There is no doubt as to the power of the court to make this order. It may impose terms upon granting a new trial, and this is the constant practice: McBride v. Daniels, 92 Pa. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The plaintiff attorney filed a remittitur in accordance with the above order on April 20, 1887. This, it will be observed, was not within ten days, and the rule for a new trial consequently became absolute. Next in point of time followed the order of court which is the subject of the present contention. It is as follows : \u201c And now, to wit, September 22, 1888, it is ordered that the record be corrected so as to read: Rule .discharged on condition that the plaintiff within thirty days file a remittitur for all damages over $75 and costs; otherwise rule absolute.\u201d This was eighteen months after the original order had been made and several terms had intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We have no doubt of the power of the court to amend its record so as to make it conform to the truth, even after the term has expired, or writ of error lodged in the office. The wealth of authority upon this question is so great that it is almost unnecessary to draw upon it. I will refer only to two of our latest cases: Cohn v. Scheuer, 115 Pa. 178; Smaltz v. Hancock, 118 Pa. 550. If, therefore, the order of September 22,1888, was an amendment of the record, the case would be free from difficulty. But it was not in any sense an amendment. There was nothing upon the record to amend by. It is conceded the original order of court specified ten days as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>time within whicli the remittitur should be filed. It is true the words \u201cton days\u201d were omitted from the order as copied upon the appearance docket. That was a mistake of the clerk which the court had the power to amend at any time. This amendment appears to have been made, as the words \u201cten days \u201d are interlined on the docket. B ut the entry of September 22d was an original order, with nothing upon the record to support it. It was an alteration, not an amendment, the effect of which was to deprive the defendants of their right to a new trial, which right, by reason of the lapse of time, had become absolute and beyond the power of the court below to interfere with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
