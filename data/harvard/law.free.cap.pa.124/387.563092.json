Mendinhall claimed before the auditor, that inasmuch as the testator had stated upon the face of the codicil, his reasons for the revocation of the legacy to her of twenty thousand dollars and had expressly grounded his revocation upon the assumption of certain facts therein set forth, the said revocation was not an absolute but a conditional one, dependent upon the truth or falsity of the facts so assumed; that the assumptions of fact which are stated in the codicil as forming the basis of the revocation were untrue, to wit: He had not given to Edward Mendinhall one hundred and fifty shares of stock in the Marshall Iron Company; neither had he loaned to Edward Mendinhall the sum of five thousand dollars, for which Edward Mendinhall had given him his bond: that she was prepared to prove the falsity of the facts stated in the codicil, and was entitled in law to the opportunity of proving them by evidence dehors the <em>will; </em>that the revocation in said codicil being founded upon a mistake of fact was inoperative, and that the legacy given to her, in the body of the will, stands, and must be awarded to her in the distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">On the other hand, the remaining legatees named in the testator\u2019s will contended that the revocation by the codicil was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>absolute, and operative, and that there was no question of fact affecting this legacy which could be inquired into by the auditor in this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">The auditor, after an elaborate study of the following authorities : 1 Jarman on Wills, 5th Amer. ed. by It. &amp; T., 357 ; 1 Powell on Devises, 3d ed. by Jarman, 523; Swinburne on Wills, 7th ed., 894; 2 Roberts on Wills, 3d ed., 40; 1 Williams on Executors, 7th ed., 208; Campbell v.

That where the truth or falsity of the assumed facts upon which the revocation is expressed to be based, appear not to have been within the personal knowledge of the testator, the revocation is conditional upon the truth of those facts, and becomes inoperative upon the simple showing of their falsity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-8\">\u201c 3. That where the truth or falsity of the assumed facts must have been, at or prior to the execution of the codicil, within the knowledge of the testator, the revocation will not be read as conditional upon the truth of the facts assumed, unless the claimant shall satisfy the mind of the chancellor or court, that the testator was laboring under some mistake in his conception of the facts at the time the codicil was executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\">\u201c4. That in either of the preceding eases, the court will permit the fullest inquiry dehors the will, to be entered into by the claimant in the determination of his rights under the will and codicil, in so far as respects the mistake of the testator as to the facts assumed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-10\">The auditor then proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201c Reading the codicil to the will of John Marshall, with a view to the application of these principles, the auditor is of opinion that this is one of the cases where the truth or falsity of the assumed facts therein contained must have been at some time prior to the execution of the codicil, personally known to the testator, for the reason that he was a party thereto; and that therefore it is incumbent upon the claimant, Lydia S. Mendinhall, to satisfy the court that the testator at the time of the execution of the codicil, was laboring under some misapprehension in his conception of the facts as they then existed. The auditor is further of opinion, and so holds, that she is entitled to show such misapprehension by any competent evidence, documentary or parol, dehors the will, and that if she is successful in this effort, the revocation will be read as conditional and will be pronounced inoperative; but if, on the other hand, she fails to satisfy the court of the mistake, the revocation will take effect, and she will not he entitled to the whole or any part of the legacy of if20,000 bequeathed to her in the body of the testator\u2019s will, but only to her share of his residuary estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">The auditor then proceeded to an examination of the testimony, parol and documentary, and after a discussion of the same found the facts substantially as stated in the introduction of this report, and continued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">From the foregoing documentary and parol proof, the auditor is asked to find that the reasons given bjr the testator for the revocation of the contestant\u2019s legacy, to wit, the \u201c gift \u201d of the stock, and the \u201c loan \u201d of the money are false; that the testator, in so stating these reasons, was laboring under a mistake; and that the revocation is conditional and inoperative. Whether or not the evidence will safely bear such a construction, is the matter presented for inquiry and determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">Let us, in the first place, consider the question raised by the transfer of the stock. Reading the agreement exhibit A between the lines, in connection with the fact which is in evidence, that the testator was exceedingly desirous of disposing of the mill property and had repeatedly offered to sell it for thirty-five thousand dollars, we cannot escape the conclusion that as between the testator and Edward Mendinhall, the consideration which tbe former was to rceeive for the mill, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>sisted solely of the mortgage for twenty-five thousand dollars, the interest on the bond, of five thousand dollars during life, and the dividends on twenty-five shares of stock for a period of five years; that it was the intention of the parties to the agreement, from the outset, that Edward Mendinhall should have the stock, and that the issuance of the certificate to the testator was but a device whereby that intention could mor\u00e9 readily be effectuated. The transaction therefore, in which Edward Mendinhall acquired ownership of one hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the Marshall Iron Company was not in the legal acceptation of the term a \u201c gift.\u201d A gift is defined to be \u201c the act by which the owner of a thing voluntarily transfers the title and possession of the same, from himself to another person who accepts it without any consit? eration.\u201d The testator, however, never became under the agreement the actual owner of the stock; he was merely, so to speak, the conduit through which the stock was to be conveyed to Edward Mendinhall. Edward Mendinhall also paid a consideration for the transfer of the stock as specified in the agreement, a consideration which was in part payment for conveyance by John Marshall of the mill property to the Marshall Iron Company. The two essential requisites of a gift are therefore lacking, to wit, first, that the party transferring the title shall be owner, and secondly that the transfer shall be without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">Moreover, that Edward Mendinhall fulfilled his part of the contract, at least so far as respects the payment of dividends on twenty-five shares of stock of the Marshall Iron Company, during the lifetime of the testator, is shown by the receipts of John Marshall which were in evidence, and is conceded by every one. The statement in the codicil, \u201c Whereas, I gave to Edward Mendinhall \u2014 one hundred and fifty shares of stock\u201d etc., is therefore untrue if we are required to construe the word \u201c gave \u201d in its legal and technical signification. In the opinion of the auditor, however, we must construe the word, \u201cgave \u201d with reference to the intention of the testator and the thought which he had in his mind, appearing by the will and by extrinsic evidence. In Wright\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 67, the words \u201c loaned \u201d and \u201c advanced,\u201d in the testator\u2019s will, were held to be used interchangeably. Mr. Justice Woodwaud in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>delivering the opinion said: \u201c They are to be construed in view of the facts that have been either admitted or ascertained. It has often happened that the stringent application of even a strictly technical word has worked grievously unjust results. All mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention of a testator: Shabswood, J., in Reek\u2019s App., 78 Pa. 432; and, when in aid of a written instrument, its intention can be gathered from undoubted proofs, the equity of parties claiming under it are not to be overthrown by a rigid adherence, to one alternative meaning of an equivocal technical word.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\">From a study of John Marshall\u2019s will, it is very clear that the controlling idea and intention with him was to make an equal provision for each of his children. To his daughters Mary H. Brosius, Lydia S. Mendinhall, and Anna B. Fogg, he bequeathed to each twenty thousand dollars. To his daughter Elizabeth M. Hannum, he gave the income of eighteen thousand dollars for life, and the use for life of a house in Kennett Square worth about four thousand dollars, and at her death, to her children, thus making her share about equal to the shares of his other daughters. Then he states that \u201c in justice to his daughters \u201d he does not give a similar legacy to his son Calvin P. Marshall because he had paid debts of Calvin recently, to the amount of about twenty-two thousand dollars. He then divides the residue of his estate into five equal parts, and gives to each of his children one of these parts. After-. wards he entered into a written agreement with Edward Mendinhall, husband of his daughter, Lydia S. Mendinhall, whereby, through the sale of the rolling mill, his said son-in-law became the owner of stock in the Marshall Iron Company, worth, in the opinion of the testator, as well as in point of fact, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, the ownership of which the testator considered to be a benefit to his daughter and her family equal to its par value. The legacies to his other children could not take effect until his death. At the time of the execution of the codicil, the stock had been transferred to Edward Mendinhall, the mill was in active operation and the prospect was that the business would be profitable. In justice to his other children, the payment of whose shares in his estate was deferred until the testator\u2019s death, he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>have regarded the consideration paid for the stock, as mentioned in the agreement, in the light of interest upon the amount of principal which it represented. The transfer of the stock was, therefore, from the testator\u2019s standpoint, substantially a \u201cgift.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">That it was so regarded by him can hardly admit of a question. He was a party to the transaction, and was necessarily familiar with its details. He was a man of intelligence and business capacity, and at the time of his death, was president of the National Bank of Keimett Square, a flourishing institution located in the borough in which he lived. It is not to be presumed that within two months after the transfer of the stock, he became by reason of advanced age or forgetfulness, mistaken as to the facts, and believed that he had actually made a present to his son-in-law, of fifteen thousand dollars in the stock of the Marshall Iron Company. No mistake is shown. On the contrary the evidence is very convincing that there was no mistake.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">In the light of all the evidence as presented before him, the auditor holds that as a matter of construction, the revocation in the codicil of June 14, 1881, is not conditional, but operative, and that the contestant, Lydia S. Mendinhall, is only entitled in the distribution of the fund now in the hands of the administrators to her share of the residue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">To the foregoing report, Mrs. Mendinhall filed various exceptions alleging in substance that the auditor erred in his conclusion that the legacy bequeathed to the exceptant by the testatoi\u2019s will was revoked by the codicil dated June 14, 1881, and that the exceptant was entitled in the distribution to a share in the residue only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-8\">Said exceptions having been argued, the court, Futhey, P. J., dismissed them and confirmed the auditor\u2019s report.

Chief Justice Paxson:</author>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The learned auditor and court below held that the legacy to the appellant o\u00ed $20,000 was revoked by the codicil to the testator's will, and that she is only entitled to her share of the residue of the estate. The contention of the appellant is that this ruling is erroneous for the reason that the testator based liis revocation of the legacy on the ground that the facts alleged by him in the codicil were true ; that as the reason for the revocation has failed, the revocation itself falls, and the appellant is entitled to be paid the $20,000. The rule as laid down in the text books appears to be this: \u201c And here it may be observed, that, when a testator by a codicil revokes a devise or bequest in his will, or in a previous codicil, expressly grounding such revocation on the assumption of a fact which turns out to be false, the revocation does not take effect, being, it is considered, conditional and dependent on a contingency which fails: \u201d 1 Jarman on Wills, 357; Powell on Devises, vol. 1, 528; 2 Roberts on Wills, 210; 1 Williams on Executors, 208.

The learned auditor has collected a large number of cases, mostly English, upon this subject, which in the main sustain the text-writers.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The principle referred to may be conceded to be correct when applied to cases in which the falsity or error of the alleged fact rested not in the personal knowledge of the testator, but was assumed upon information derived from others; as in the case of Campbell v. French, supra, where by his will the testator gave legacies to A. and B., describing them as grandchildren of C. and then residing in America. By a codicil he revoked these legacies, giving as a reason that the legatees were dead. That fact not being true, and being necessarily derived from information of other persons, the legatees were held to be entitled to the legacy, notwithstanding the revocation. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>case in hand, the reason given by John Marshall, the testator, for the revocation of the legacy of $20,000 to his daughter, the appellant, was, that he had, since the execution of his will, given to his son-in-law, Edward Mendinhall, the husband of the appellant, one hundred and fifty shares of stock in the Marshall Iron Company, the par value of which was one hundred dollars per share, and had also loaned to him the sum of five thousand dollars. The appellant contends that this statement was untrue; that the transfer of the stock to his son-in-law was a sale, not a gift, and that he had never loaned him the five thousand dollars. The facts were that the testator transferred this stock to Mendinhall upon an agreement with the latter that he (Mendinhall) should \u201c execute and deliver to the said John Marshall his bond for the sum of $5,000, to secure the payment of interest on that sum at the rate of six per cent, payable semi-annually to the said John Marshall for and during the term of his natural life, and further agrees to pay to said John Marshall the dividends that may be declared on $2,500 of the capital stock of said company when and as declared for the term of five years from date of transfer as aforesaid, it being hereby agreed that if either the said John Marshall or Edward Mendinhall shall die within said five years, that then and in said ease said dividends shall not thereafter be paid to said John Marshall, but shall belong thenceforth to said Edward Mendinhall, his executors, administrators or assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The object of this arrangement is apparent. The testator was conveying to his son-in-law $15,000 of stock which it was believed would be valuable, and which in point of fact proved to be worth more than its par value, the dividends thereon being from ten to fifteen per cent. It was an advancement during the lifetime of the testator, over and above what his other children received at that time, and the provision for the bond of five thousand dollars and for the dividends upon $2,500 of the stock was doubtless intended to produce equality between his children, taking into consideration the testator\u2019s expectancy of life. Be that as it may, the testator regarded it as an advancement; in point of fact it practically was so; the testator had the right to so treat it; the facts \\yere peculiarly within his own knowledge, and we cannot deny him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>right to do what ho pleased with Ms own property. Were we to reverse this ease and award the $20,000 legacy to the appel hint, we would cause gross inequality in this estate, the appellant would receive her full share, and her husband would get in addition $15,000 of valuable stock, for which he has paid nothing beyond a reasonable consideration for the advancement in the lifetime of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
