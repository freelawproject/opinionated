T. Lancaster, the reversion and rental due thereon having been assigned by the lessor to Clinton S. Fritz, and under the authority of a provision in said lease, a judgment in ejectment for the demised premises, to wit, a store-room and cellar at the corner of Tenth and Race streets, was confessed in favor of \u201c Clinton S. Fritz, assignee of James P. Rossiter, against Jacob B. Lefevre and William T. Lancaster, trading as Lefevre &amp; Lancaster, and all persons claiming under them.\u201d On the same day writs of fieri facias and habere facias were issued, returnable to the first Monday of February, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">On January 14, 1888, one Plenry Hessel presented his petition setting forth that he was in possession of the premises before the commencement of the action, not claiming to hold under the defendants, and prayed for a rule to set aside the judgment and proceedings thereunder. This rule having been heard on depositions filed, on January 21, 1888, it was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">The writ of habere facias being as yet unexecuted, on March 22, 1888, the plaintiff obtained a rule to show cause why the sheriff should not proceed to execute the same, when the sheriff answered that he had gone upon the premises to execute said writ and found them to be in the possession of one Henry Hessel, who was not a party to the proceeding and who claimed to hold by a paramount title, as appeared by his \u201canswer\u201d attached; in view of which facts the respondent was advised, etc. Attached to the sheriff\u2019s answer to the rule was a paper signed and verified by Henry Hessel, entitled, \u201c The answer of Henry Hessel to the rule on the sheriff,\u201d etc., which set,, forth, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">\u201c That at the time of the commencement of said action of ejectment and the entry of the judgment, and issuing execution thereupon, the said Lefevre and Lancaster were not in possession of the said premises, and had not been in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of the same since, to wit, the seventeenth day of March, A.

Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\"When the sheriff made return to the rule to show cause why he should not execute the writ of habere facias issued by Fritz, assignee of Rossiter v. Lefevre &amp; Lancaster, he returned that he \u201c found the premises to be in the possession of one Henry Hessel, who is not a party to the present proceeding, and who claims to hold by a paramount title, as appears by his answer hereto annexed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The answer of Hessel to the rule was annexed to the sheriff\u2019s return, and by it it appears that the plaintiff in error was in possession of the premises, not under Lefevre &amp; Lancaster, who were defendants in the judgment, but under a title paramount to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Notwithstanding this return of the sheriff, and also the return of Hessel to the rule, the learned court below made absolute the rule for executing the writ, and directed the sheriff to proceed with the habere facias against Hessel. As Hessel was thus brought upon the record, and as the order directly affected his right to the possession of the premises in dispute, he is clearly entitled to a writ of error. The return made by Hessel shows that he obtained possession by virtue of a lease from Rossiter as agent for the owners, on the 16th dajr of August, 1887. The terms of the lease are set out, and also that under it he (Hessel) entered into possession, and continued therein until the time of the present proceeding. The amicable action and judgment against Lefevre &amp; Lancaster were not entered until January 11, 1888, and Hessel was not made a party thereto, although he was then in possession. In this state of the facts it is apparent that although Hessel was in possession anterior to the judgment, and claimed by title paramount to that of the defendants in the judgment, and not under them at all, he was ordered to be ejected without hearing or trial, and without a.day in court. That such an order made in such circumstances was erroneous, was clearly pointed out in the opinion of this court in the case of. Monongahela Valley Camp Meeting Association v. Patterson, 96 Pa. 469, and for that reason the order to eject Hessel must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>be reversed. In tbe ease just cited tlie order to eject was affirmed because, in point of fact, when tbe suit was commenced, the association claimant bad no existence; \u201c natural persons were in possession, were served with process, made defence, and verdict and judgment were rendered against them. Not one disclaimed possession.\u201d Tbe facts were therefor entirely different from those of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The order of April 7, 1888, directing the sheriff to execute the writ against Henry Hessel is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
