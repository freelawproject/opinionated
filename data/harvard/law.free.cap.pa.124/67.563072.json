P. Harlan certain lots bounded by Fourth street, Duneannon avenue and Lindley avenue. This deed was not shown in the paper books, but it was said to contain the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am2\">\u201cTogether as respects each of said lots, above granted and released, with its full proportion of the soil of the street or streets, avenue or avenues, on which it is situate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-10\">It was admitted as evidence by the parties that Fourth street and Duneannon and Lindley avenues, were laid out on the city plan, but not opened or occupied and used as streets. The plaintiff then showed the record of a suit and judgment by the assignees of Abraham Ritter against R. P. Harlan, in an action upon a bond to Abraham Ritter for $3,500, an execution, levy and condemnation, and a sheriff\u2019s deed to the plaintiff dated November 7, 1885, in pursuance of a sheriff\u2019s sale under said judgment, conveying the property in dispute to the plaintiff, the lines of the deed embracing the ground between the lines of the deed to R. P. Harlan dated May 22, 1874, and the middle of the street and avenues upon which the lots were bounded. The plaintiff, having shown the writ to prove defendant\u2019s possession, rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The defendant, showing title, read from the partition deed to R.

P. Harlan to Abraham Ritter to secure the bond for $3,500, upon which the suit had been brought and judgment obtained, put in evidence by the plaintiff. This mortgage was not presented in the paper books, but it was said to describe the mortgaged premises as bounded by Fourth street, Duncannon and Lindley avenues, and to contain the ordinary language, \u201c together with all appurtenances, all and singular the streets, ways, water courses,\u201d etc. The defendant followed with the record of a judgment in a scire facias upon the mortgage referred to, a sheriff\u2019s sale thereon not satisfying the mortgage, a sheriff\u2019s deed for the premises described in the mortgage executed to D. Ramsey Patterson, dated December 23, 1882, and a deed from D. Ramsey Patterson, and others, to the defendant, conveying the same premises, dated July 31,1885.

McGrath, </em>for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-20\">1. It has been well settled that a conveyance of land described as bounded on a public street or highway, does not give the grantee a title to the middle of the street, except where: <em>(a) </em>The grantor at the time of the conveyance had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>title to tlie middle of the street: Paul v. Carver, 24 Pa. 207; Grier v. Sampson, 27 Pa. 190; Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 339; <em>(l&gt;) </em>and did not expressly or by clear implication reserve it: Cox v. Freedley, 33 Pa. 128; Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 839; <em>(a) </em>and the street is opened for public use and is a public highway: Cox v. Freedley, 83 Pa. 128; Spackman v. Steidel, 88 Pa. 459; Union Burial Ground Soc. v. Robinson, 5 Wh. 18; Robinson v. Myers, 17 Pa. 17; Lehigh St., 81* Pa. 85. For the dedication of land to a public use, the assent of the owner is required; user is not essential, if there is assent, but the intention to dedicate must exist: Cincinnati v. White, 6 Pet. 431; Thirty-second Street, 19 Wend. 128; Jarvis v. Dean, 3 Bing. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">2. It has been equally well settled that the mention of a street laid out by the municipality on its public plan, as a descriptive boundary line in a deed, is not a dedication of the land in the soil of the street to public use: Easton Bor. v. Rinek, 116 Pa. 1; Bellinger v. Union Burial Ground Soc., 10 Pa. 185; Forbes Street, 70 Pa. 125; Lehigh Street, 81* Pa. 85; Brooklyn Street, 118 Pa. 640. The Pennsylvania cases of dedication, express or implied, arising from the mention of a street as a boundary line, are cases where the street has been laid out and plotted by the property owner on his own ground, and not where laid out by the authorities on a city plan: Schenley v. Commonwealth, 36 Pa. 62; Darlington v. Commonwealth, 41 Pa. 63; Baker v. Chester Gas Co., 73 Pa. 116; Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 339; Schenley v. Pittsburgh, 104 Pa. 472; Transue v. Sell, 105 Pa. 604; Pearl Street, 111 Pa. 565.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">3. As the streets were not described in the mortgage by R. P. Harlan, and were not public highways, not having been opened for public use, the fee remained in the owner and did not pass by his mortgage: Lehigh Street, 81* Pa. 85, 89; Union Burial Ground Soc. v. Robinson, 5 Wh. 18; Balt. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Gould, 67 Md. 60 (7 Cent. R. 379); Bellinger v. Union Burial Ground Soc., 10 Pa. 185; Brooklyn Street, 118 Pa. 640. The vendee takes no other estate than that which was intended to be granted: Angel\u00ed on Highways, \u00a7 141. If the mortgage had been a deed, the description would not have conveyed to the middle of the street, and it will not be contended that the mortgage conveyed more than such deed would.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>4. But a mortgage, though in form a conveyance of the land,' is but a mere security for the payment of money: Wilson v. Shoenberger, 31 Pa. 295; Scott v. Sample, 5 W. 53 ; Philips v. Bank of Lewistown, 18 Pa. 394; Lennig\u2019s Est., 52 Pa. 138; Rickert v. Madeira, 1 R. 325. A mortgagee has neither an equitable nor a legal estate in the premises; he is simply a lien creditor, a holder of a security of specific property for the payment of money: Michener v. Cavender, 38 Pa. 338; Twitchell v. McMurtrie, 77 Pa. 383; Lance\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 456. It follows, that the purchaser of the mortgaged premises at sheriff\u2019s sale, took title only to the property as described in the mortgage, with the streets as boundaries, and not to the soil of the unopened streets.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-5\"><em>Mr. J. B. </em>Thayer, for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">1. As between vendor and vendee, mortgagor and mortgagee, the description in the instrument of lands bounded on a highway, is a dedication, and that whether the highway be opened or not opened to public use at the time: Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 339; Lehigh St., 81* Pa. 85; Paul v. Carver, 24 Pa. 207; Cox v. Freedley, 33 Pa. 124. But as between grantor and'the municipality, whose streets are described, the question of dedication and its bearing upon the right to recover damages for the opening, depends upon a totally different principle : Easton Bor. v. Rinek, 116 Pa. 1; Brooklyn St., 118 Pa. 640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">2. In the present case there is, however\u2019, an express covenant in the deed of partition, the effect of which is to dedicate to public use all the streets on the plan, whenever it may be necessary to open them. That covenant has all the elements of a covenant running with the land: Platt on Covenants, 135; Coleman v. Coleman, 19 Pa. 100; Savage v. Mason, 3 Curt. 310, it binds the assignee, though he be not named : Platt on Covenants, 466, and it is immaterial in what part of the deed it is found: Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 339; Platt on Covenants, 136. Moreover, the only difference between a deed and a mortgage is as to the equity of redemption. After foreclosure, the distinction vanishes, and the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale takes the title of the mortgagor, as if the mortgage had been a deed without a defeasance : Act of 1705,1 Sm. L. 59; Hartman v. Ogborn, 54 Pa. 120.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"ARU\">Mr. Chief Justice Paxson:</author>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">This was an action of ejectment depending wholly upon documentary evidence. None of the deeds and other papers are printed in the plaintiff in error\u2019s paper book. As, however, extracts are given from the material parts, we will decide the case upon what we have before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The amicable partition by the heirs of Margaret Harlan recognized the streets laid down upon the city plan, but not opened. The deed of partition conveyed to Richard P. Harlan certain lots, and described them as bounded by Dunca\u00f1non and Lindley avenues and Fourth street, laid out upon the city plan, but as before stated, not opened or used. In the deed the lots are described as bounded by the streets aforesaid, with the additional clause: \u201c Together as respects each of the said lots of ground above granted and released, with its full proportion of the soil of the street or streets, avenue or avenues on which it is situated.\u201d Richard P. Harlan, being so seised, mortgaged the premises to Abraham Ritter, but without inserting in the mortgage the above recited grant of the soil. The mortgage was foreclosed and the defendant below became the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale. This is his title. The sheriff\u2019s sale did not satisfy the bond accompanying the mortgage; the assignees of the bond entered judgment thereon, took out an exeem tion for the balance unpaid, levied upon and sold a portion of the soil embraced in said streets. The plaintiff below became the purchaser at said last sheriff\u2019s sale, and this is his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The court below instructed the jury to find for the defendant. In this we see no error. The sale under the mortgage passed whatever title was conveyed by the deed. The omission in the mortgage of the language above quoted from the deed possesses no significance. As the mortgage was not printed in full as it should have been, we must presume it contained the description used in all such instruments: \u201c Being the same premises \u201d conveyed by the deed, etc. Aside from this, the streets and ways were appurtenant to the lots conveyed, and as between grantor and grantee, mortgagor and mortgagee, passed by a conveyance of the land bounding upon them: Lehigh St., 81* Pa. 85; Trutt v. Spotts, 87 Pa. 339. Otherwise, we would have the anomaly of a man selling lots fronting upon certain streets, and then denying his grantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>access to his land by closing up the streets and repudiating his own grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We need not discuss the question how far the deed was a dedication of the street to public use, nor the extent to which such dedication would be effective without an acceptance on the part of the municipal authorities. It is sufficient to'say that there was a dedication of the streets to the use of his grantees, and neither the grantor nor those claiming under him can now be allowed to repudiate such dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
