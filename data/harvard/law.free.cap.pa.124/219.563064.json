The bills rendered and payment of which was refused amounted to the sum of $1,397.56.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\">The defendant company filed an affidavit of defence denying liability for the claim sought to be recovered, and averring that the corporation was formed by the union and consolidation of two earlier corporations, and as thus consolidated was rechartered by the act of March 8, 1872, P. L. 264. The two earlier corporations thus consolidated were the Girard College Passenger Railway Company, incorporated by the act of April 15, 1858, P. L. 300, \u00a7 8 of which was similar in its provisions to \u00a7 8 of the act of March 28,1859, hereafter referred to. The Girard College &amp; Manayunk Passenger Railway Company was incorporated by the act of March 28, 1859, P. L. 264, one of the sections of which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">\u201cSection 8. That said company, in constructing said road, shall conform to the grades now established, or hereafter to be by law established, of the several streets and avenues traversed by said road, and keep said roads and avenues in perpetual good repair, at tbe proper expense of said company; and shall moreover be subject to all ordinances of the city councils heretofore or hereafter to be passed, regulating city passenger railways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">The act of March 8, 1872, referred to, was entitled, \u201cAn Act relating to tbe Ridge Avenue Passenger Railway Company,\u201d and one of its sections was the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">\u201cSection 8. All provisions in the charters of the two companies so consolidated as above recited, not included in this act, are hereby repealed: Provided always, That any supplements to the said charters, which may have been heretofore granted, shall be and remain in full force and virtue, and enure to the said the Ridge Avenue Passenger Railway Company, consolidated as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">On June 4, 1888, the plaintiff entered a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, an agreement being filed by which all special acts of assembly relating to the said company or com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>panies were to be considered as set out on the record. This rule on November 8th, was made absolute, Hake, P. J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">The constitution of Pennsylvania provides as follows: \u201c No bill, except general appropriation bills, shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly stated in the title.\u201d The question is, does the act of March 8, 1872, ratifying the consolidation of the Girard College Passenger Railway Company and the Ridge Avenue and Manayunk Passenger Railway Company, sin against this rule. If it does not, it is a defence to the city\u2019s claim for damages for the failure of the railway company to repair the streets as provided in their charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">To understand the controversy we must revert to the facts out of which it arose. The Ridge Avenue and Manayunk Passenger Railroad Company was bound by its charter to keep the several streets and avenues traversed by said road in perpetual good repair at the proper expense of the said company, and also, \u201c subject to all ordinances of the city councils heretofore or hereafter to be passed regulating city passenger railways.\u201d They entered into an agreement with the Girard College Passenger Railway Company which made both companies one under the title of the Ridge Avenue Passenger Railway Company, and subsequently procured the passage of the act above referred to, ratifying and confirming what they had done. Why it was thought necessary to obtain a legislative confirmation of a union which was valid under the existing laws does not distinctly appear, but one motive probably was a desire to get rid of the obnoxious clause in the charter requiring the company to give the city of Philadelphia something in return for the valuable and exclusive right of using her streets for railway traffic. Whether such was or was not the case, the means taken were singularly well adapted to such an end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">It might be doubtful whether the legislature would put the company beyond municipal control, and release them from the obligation of repairing the highways, which to a great extent, had become their own, and it would be obviously the duty of the select and common councils to protest against the surrender of rights which the citizens whom they represented were inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ested in maintaining. A bill disclosing such a purpose would meet with objections and might not become a law. If, on the other hand, the legislature were simply asked to confirm the union of both companies as one body, and the bill was so drawn and so entitled as to indicate that the sole purpose was to assure the union already effected, subject to existing burdens, there presumably would be no opposition from any quarter, because no one outside of the railway company would be correctly informed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The act was accordingly denominated in the most general terms \u201cAn Act relating to the Ridge Avenue Passenger Railway Company; \u201d and, after reciting the consolidation of the companies, as above described, went on to declare that the new body corporate should \u201chave, use, and maintain the railways which were of the said corporation so consolidated as they are now laid, constructed, and used.\u201d Rules were then laid down for the government of the company, certain duties imposed and powers conferred, and it was finally declared that \u201call provisions in the charters of the two companies, so consolidated as above recited, not included in this act, are hereby repealed.\u201d The effect was to give the bill a double aspect, on one side relating to the railway company, and releasing them, and on the other, to the city of Philadelphia, and not only depriving her of the needful control provided for when the company was originally chartered, but of the right to require the company to keep the streets in order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">Can such an act be said to have only one subject clearly expressed in the title ? Had it been entitled, \u201c An Act relating to the Ridge Avenue Railway Company and the city of Philadelphia,\u201d it might justly have been said to have.a single clearly expressed subject, namely, the relations between the two specifically defined bodies; and, had- the people of Philadelphia and their representatives at Harrisburg failed to inquire what these relations were, and how they were affected by the repealing clause, it might have been just to regard them as in default, although the notice even then would have been scant in rendering it necessary to examine the charter of the railway company in order to ascertain the truth. But as the matter actually stood, there was nothing to put them on inquiry or suggest the idea that a bill denoting an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>simply to regulate the railway, bore hardly on the city. There is the more reason for such an inference because the policy of the state and city has been to charge passenger railways with the duty of repairing the streets which they use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-3\">As far back as July, 1857, councils provided by an ordinance, which is still in force, that \u201c all passenger railway companies shall be at the entire cost and expense of maintaining, paving, repairing and repaving that may be necessary, upon any road, street, or alley occupied by them.\u201d Since then, charters have been granted to twenty-seven passenger railway companies, each containing a provision that the company shall repair the streets, or what comes to the same thing, that they shall be subject to the city ordinances. This, I believe, is the first instance where the clause imposing the obligation has been repealed, and it cannot reasonably be supposed that the legislature would advisedly have favored this particular company at the expense of the city. Such a bill is obviously at variance with the purpose of the constitution, which, as defined by the Supremo Court, is, that the title, when read in connection with the body of the act, shall clearly indicate the subject, and still more that it shall not denote a single subject when it really covers two: Union Pass. Ry. Co.\u2019s App, 81* Pa. 91; Becker v. Allegheny, 85 Pa. 3 91; Rogers v. The Manufacturer's Improvement Co., 109 Pa. 109, 111; Phcenixville Bor. Road, 109 Pa. 41.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-4\">In the case last cited, a bill entitled \u201cAn Act relating to boroughs in the county of Chester \u201d enumerated various acts, and provided that the same \u201cshall be repealed so far as they relate to the boroughs now incorporated or hereafter to bo incorporated in the county of Chester,\u201d and that \u201clike proceedings shall be liad for the opening, widening and straightening the roads and streets in the said boroughs,\u201d and \u201cfor the assessment of damages sustained thereby,\u201d \u201cas are by law provided,\u201d as regards \u201cpublic roads within the said county of Chester outside of said boroughs.\u201d Here the title, read in connection with the enacting clause, disclosed the aim of the bill more fully than in the case before us now. But the Supreme Court held that since the act not only exonerated the boroughs from the payment of damages, but threw them on the county, it had in effect two subjects, and both should have been denoted in the title with such clearness as to notify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>parties whose interests were injuriously affected. So here, the title should have been so drawn as to warn the citizens of Philadelphia that the bill, if passed, would shift the burden of repairing the streets to their shoulders, and free the railway company from the control of councils. The case of Phoenix-ville Bor. Road was cited and approved in Sewicldey Borough v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 165, and we cannot consistently with these decisions hold the present act constitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">Judgment is therefore rendered for the plaintiff in the sum of \u00a71,397.56, being the damages for the failure of the defendants to repair the streets as assessed in the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">Judgment having been entered as directed in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant took this writ, assigning the entry thereof as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-7\"><em>Mr. J.

It is sufficient that it fairly give notice of the general subject-matter, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into its body: Church St., 54 Pa. 353; Commonwealth v. Green, 58 Pa. 226; Yeager v. Weaver, 64 Pa. 425; Allegheny Co. Home\u2019s Case, 77 Pa. 77; State Line etc. R. Co.\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 429; Mauch Chunk v. McGee, 81 Pa. 433; Esling\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 205. Other cases are equally as \u2022strong; these are given as samples. The decisions elsewhere are in the same spirit: Cooley, Const. Lim., *146. The title of the act is as wide a title as if it were \u201cA supplement to \u201d the original charter, yet such supplements have always been sustained where they relate to matters contained in the acts to which they are supplements: Pottstown Borough, 117 Pa. 538, 546; Allegheny Co. Home\u2019s Case, supra; State Line etc. R. Co.\u2019s App., supra; Craig v. Presbyterian Church, 88 Pa. 42. The repeal of a provision in an act of course relates to a matter in that act and is germane to it: Gabbert v. Railroad Co., 11 Tnd. 365 (71 Ameri D. 358). In all the cases in which acts have been held void in whole or in part for this reason, the title has been actually misleading: Union Pass. Ry. Co.\u2019s App., 81* Pa. 91; Beckert v. Allegheny, 85 Pa. 191; Dorsey\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 192; Sewickley Borough v. Sholes, 118 Pa. 165; Hatfield v.

According to the numerous decisions under these constitutional provisions, the title of an act must not only embrace the subject of the legislation, hut must also express the same so clearly as to give notice of the legislative purpose to those who may he specially interested therein: Blood v.
