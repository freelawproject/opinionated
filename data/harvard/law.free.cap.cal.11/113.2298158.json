Therefore the statute provides that the \u201c County Jail shall be kept by the Sheriff and used as a prison \u201d for the detention of such persons as are placed in his custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">He is also required to <em>\u201c </em>keep an office at the county seat of his county \u201d for transaction of other business connected with his station, and would have the same right to demand compensation from the county for guarding and taking care of this office as of the Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The law fixes the compensation of officers for the performance of these official duties, and it also provides that no fees shall be charged for any other services than those mentioned.
