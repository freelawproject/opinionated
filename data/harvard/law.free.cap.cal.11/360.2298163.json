Afterward, Semple executed a mortgage to secure the payment of the note, and further agreed to pay attorney\u2019s fees. Moore &amp; Allen brought a joint action on these instruments, and Semple filed a demurrer for several grounds. But, before the trial, a stipulation in writing was entered into between the plaintiffs and all the defendants, that a joint judgment should be rendered against all the defendants for the principal, interest and attorney\u2019s fee\u2014the attorney\u2019s fee being liquidated, and the amount paid ; the interest also fixed at a different rate, and a different sum on which said interest should be calculated was also agreed upon. This agreement was not embodied in a statement on appeal, nor was there any bill of exceptions setting it forth, showing in what manner the agreement came before the Court below. The agreement simply forms a part of the record sent up without explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-9\">The decree of foreclosure after the entry of the judgment against the defendants, proceeded as follows: \u201c And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said mortgage be foreclosed, and that the said mortgaged premises, to wit, all the right, title * * of C. D. Semple of, in, and to \u201d (here follows a description of the premises) at the end of which the words \u201c be sold\u2019\u2019.were omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">The -points made by appellants in this Court were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-11\">1st. That the decree differed from the terms of the written agreement of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>2d. The decree is void for uncertainty, in this: it does not direct the mortgaged premises to \u201c be sold.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-4\"><em>D. C. Semple, </em>in person, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-5\"><em>J. S. Belcher </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-6\">Field, J., at the April Term, 1858, delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Aha\">Terry, C. J., and Burnett, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The agreement inserted among the papers forms no part of the record. It is not embodied in any statement or bill of exceptions, and possesses, therefore, no verity upon which any errors can be assigned which .this Court can notice. Gates <em>v. </em>Buckingham, 4 Cal.' 286 ; Davis <em>v. </em>Stratton <em>et al., </em>and Flint <em>v. </em>Haight <em>et al., </em>January Term, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The decree is substantially for the sale of the mortgaged premises. It specifically directs judgment for the amount of the note, the application of the proceeds of sale of the premises to its satisfaction, the disposition of any surplus, and execution for any deficiency. The omission of the words <em>\u201c </em>be sold \u201d after the description of the premises, is a mere clerical error, which does not affect the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Judgment affirmed, with five per cent, damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
