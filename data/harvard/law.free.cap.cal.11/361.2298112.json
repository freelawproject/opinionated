The bill prays that this amount (some $13,800) may be adjudged a debt against the county, and so much as necessary set off against the taxes assessed against the plaintiff for the year 1856, and a decree for the balance rendered in his favor. The defendants answered, denying generally that any illegal tax had been exacted of the plaintiff; and also, that the county was insolvent. There was no proof taken, the Court passing upon the motion for the injunction on bill and answer. The Court below granted the injunction and defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-4\"><em>Wade &amp; Flower </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-5\"><em>C.

No apology could be given for such a proceeding, except that it was necessary to protect the plaintiff from what would otherwise be an irremediable evil. But this could not be, unless the county were shown to be insolvent. This has not been shown in this case; for, though the charge is made, it is denied, and there is no proof of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The order for granting the injunction is dissolved, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
