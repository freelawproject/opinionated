The claims of the parties adjoin each other ; and in June, 1857, they entered into a written agreement as to the dividing line between the claims, describing the same as commencing at a designated point, and \u201c <em>running thence north twenty-three degrees and fifteen minutes west, six hundred and forty-three feet to afine stake,\u201d </em>and \u201c <em>thence north forty-five degrees west </em>to Devil\u2019s canon and the principal question presented by the record relates to the admissibility of parol evidence to show that the last course of the dividing line thus agreed upon was run according to the magnetic, and not the true meridian. It appeared from evidence allowed on the trial, that it was the general custom at Forest Hill, where the ground in controversy is situated, to run boundary lines by the magnetic meridian; and from the testimony of a witness present at the execution of the agreement, that it was understood the line was to run \u201c the way the needle points.\u201d The cause was tried by a jury, who returned a verdict as follows, to wit: \u201c We, the jury, find for the plaintiffs, and assess their damnges at $3,100. We further find, that the lines mentioned in the agreement introduced in the evidence in-this case were to run by the magnetic meridian.\u201d Judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>entered upon this verdict for the plaintiffs. Defendants moved the Court for a new trial on several grounds, and amongst others, on the ground of \u201c newly discovered evidence, material to the defendants, which they could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d The motion was supported by the affidavit of Marshall, one of the defendants; setting forth that since the trial of the cause, one Hoffman had informed him that he would testify to certain facts, which facts are set out in the affidavit; but affiant being ignorant of the law, did not know that Hoffman\u2019s affidavit as to what he would testify to was necessary, until it was too late to procure the same in time for the hearing of the motion.

The claims of the parties adjoin each other, and in June, 1857, the parties entered into a written agreement as to the dividing line between their claims, describing the same as commencing at a designated point, and \u201c <em>running thence north twenty-three degrees and fifteen minutes west, six hundred and forty-three feet to api\u00f1e </em>stakeand \u201c <em>thence north forty-five degrees west </em>to Devil\u2019s canonand the principal question presented by the record relates to the admissibility of parol evidence to show that the last course of the dividing line thus agreed upon was run according to the magnetic and not the true meridian. It appeared, from the evidence allowed on the trial, that it was the general custom at Forest Hill, where the ground in controversy is situated, to run boundary lines by the magnetic meridian, and from the testimony of a witness present at the execution of the agreement, that it was understood the line was to run <em>\u201c </em>the way the needle points.\u201d It is true, parol evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement; but we do not perceive that the rule was violated in the present case. It was not to contradict or vary the meaning of the term <em>north </em>that the evidence was admitted, but to ascertain the sense in which it was used by the parties. The term has two meanings, one common and the other technical. Unprofessional men generally mean, in stating courses, the lines indicated by the compass, without making any allowance for variation in the needle <em>; </em>and even professional Surveyors, as appears from the evidence in the case, would not consider the true meridian as intended, unless specially so informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The language of every instrument should be so construed, if possible, as to effectuate the intentions of the parties; and to ascertain the meaning attached to particular words, when such words are used in vari-' ous senses, parol evidence is perfectly legitimate. And this evidence is received to explain, and not to contradict or vary the written language. The patent ambiguity, which according to the rules of Lord Bacon cannot be aided by averment,, arises from uncertainty upon the face of the instrument in the application of the terms used, and not from uncertainty in the meaning of the terms themselves, when those terms are susceptible of two meanings. (See 2 Parsons, 69, and note.) In the present case the ambiguity lies in the word north; and yet it is not within the rule laid down by Bacon. It belongs to that \u201c intermediate class of cases,\u201d of which Mr. Justice Story speaks in Peisch <em>v. </em>Dickson, (1 Mason, 11) \u201c which partake of the nature both of patent and latent ambiguities ; and that is,\u201d where the words are all sensible and have a settled meaning, but at the same time consistently admit of two interpretations, according to the subject matter in the contemplation of the parties. In such a case, I should think,\u201d says the Justice, \u201cthat parol evidence might be admitted, to showthe circumstances'under which the contract was made and the subject matter to which the parties referred. For instance, the word 1 freight \u2019 has several meanings, in common parlance ; and if by a written contract a party were to assign his freight in a particular ship, it seems to me that parol evidence might be admitted of the circumstances under which the contract was made, to ascertain whether it referred to goods on hoard of the ship or an interest in' the earnings of the ship ; or in other words, to show in which sense the parties intended to use the term.\u201d (Goddard <em>v. </em>Bullow, 1 Nott &amp; McCard; Smith <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 Barn. &amp; Adol. 728 ; Heald <em>v. </em>Cooper, 8 Greenl. 32; Clayton <em>v. </em>Gregson, 4 Rer. &amp; Man. 602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">And Cowen and Hill, after referring to the illustration given by Mr. Story, observe that this and other instances of a kindred character \u201c fall exactly within the general definition of a patent ambiguity. The terms used have in themselves a doubtful meaning, and consistently admit of more than one interpretation, according to the subject matter in contemplation of the parties. The ambiguity is not <em>latent </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>any proper sense; it arises from the known infirmity of language ; it is inherent in the instrument; appearing on its face, and evincing a difficulty at the very moment of perusal. And yet it admits of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u201c It will not do to say, therefore, that a patent ambiguity (meaning thereby merely an ambiguity patent or appearing on the face of the instrument) cannot be explained by evidence <em>aliunde; </em>though such remarks are frequently found in the books.\u201d (Notes to Phillips, part II, note 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The motion for a new trial was properly overruled. The position of the boundary line was the principal question in the ease, and upon this point several surveyors were examined, and upon their conflicting testimony the jury passed. The subsequent survey of one of the surveyors would only have corroborated the testimony of the defendants\u2019 witnesses, and correspondingly weakened the testimony adduced by the plaintiffs. We do not perceive that it would, taken in connection with the different starting point from the first survey, have materially changed the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Each of the surveyors testified to using the utmost care, and each was of opinion that his survey was correct. The Court below was in a better position to judge of the effect of Brewster\u2019s testimony in the case, and the probable result of his evidence after the second survey, than this Court, and we do not feel warranted in disturbing its action in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The affidavit of Marshall, as to the testimony which Hofiman would give, should have been accompanied by Hoffman\u2019s affidavit. Hoffman\u2019s absence at his residence at Forest Hill, and the consequent inability of Marshall to obtain the affidavit in time, was not a sufficient excuse for its non-production. If necessary, application should have been made to the Court for additional time to obtain and file it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
