We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Mrs. Garner testified that she worked at night at the University Hospital in Baltimore and had parked her 1960 Chevrolet car on Redwood Street near the hospital at 10:50 p.m. on August 31, 1964, when she went to work, and that it was gone the next morning when she sought it to drive home. She recovered her car in Georgetown, Delaware. Trooper Short of the Delaware State Police testified that Lee was driving Mrs. Garner\u2019s car in Georgetown, Delaware, at about 5:00 a.m. on the morning of September 1, 1964, when he stopped him for investigation. Lee had no operator\u2019s license, no form of identification and no money, and Sumpter, who was enjoying an alcoholically induced nap on the back seat, likewise had no way to identify himself, and no money. Lee told Trooper Short he had borrowed the car from a Harry Walker in Baltimore. The trooper found in the car its registration card which showed the owner to be Mrs. Garner. From this testimony there was sufficient evidence to permit the trier of facts to infer that Lee had unlawfully taken and carried away \u201cout of the custody or use\u201d of the owner, Mrs. Garner\u2019s car for his \u201cpresent use,\u201d contrary to Code (1957), Art. 27, Sec. 349. <em>Anello v. State, </em>201 Md. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">After the State produced the testimony outlined above, Lee\u2019s experienced and able lawyer moved for a verdict of acquittal which Judge Harris denied at that time, suggesting that he would rule at the close of the whole case. Lee announced that he would not take the stand or offer evidence. Sumpter then took the stand and after he had answered several preliminary questions Lee\u2019s lawyer moved the court not to consider any of Sumpter\u2019s testimony against Lee because Lee had moved for a verdict of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case and then rested, and the case against him must be decided in the posture in which it had ended. Judge Harris asked Lee\u2019s counsel if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>desired a ruling immediately and the reply was: \u201c* * * if the Court wants to hold its ruling until both cases are completed, fine, but I certainly want our case determined as of the point we rested, sir.\u201d Judge Harris then said: \u201cAs of the close of Lee\u2019s case?\u201d and counsel answered \u201cRight\u201d-&amp;emdash;that he wanted the record to show \u201c* * * that the ruling will be based on that testimony alone.\u201d Judge Harris responded: \u201c* * * the ruling * * * at the end of the case will be based as to Lee upon the posture of the case when Lee\u2019s case was rested.\u201d The testimony, then, shows that Lee, through his counsel, was satisfied with Judge Harris\u2019 statement that he would rule on Lee\u2019s motion based only on the testimony as of the time the motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Sumpter then continued his testimony which, among other things, revealed that he had had four prior convictions including the two automobile larceny cases. At the end of Sumpter\u2019s testimony the court, after hearing argument, denied both Lee\u2019s and Sumpter\u2019s motions for verdicts of acquittal and added: \u201cThe motion as to Lee being denied on the basis of the evidence in the case when his case was rested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">For at least three reasons we think Lee has no basis to claim prejudice on the ground that his motion was not ruled on until the end of the whole case. First, Lee, through his counsel, agreed that the ruling could be deferred until the end of the whole case, if it was based only on the evidence produced by the State; second, Judge Harris, at the beginning of Sumpter\u2019s testimony, said explicitly he would find Lee guilty or not guilty on the State\u2019s testimony only and at the end of the whole case he said he had done this; and third, the State\u2019s testimony so clearly indicated that Lee was guilty as to negate any inference that Judge Harris\u2019 ultimate decision as to Lee was influenced by anything revealed by Sumpter\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
