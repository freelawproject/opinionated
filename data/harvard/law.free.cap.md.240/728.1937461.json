It begins, \u201cThe Court instructs the jury that there being <em>no evidence in this case of want of due care on the part of Doris Blankenship, </em>the decedent child, for own safety, * * (Italics ours.) This is a false postulate in the prayer; there <em>was </em>evidence in the case which, if believed by the jury, would have justified a finding of contributory negligence. Moreover, an examination of the court\u2019s charge relative to contributory negligence discloses it to be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In regard to the second question, apart from the fact that there was no request for an instruction relative to last clear chance or objection to its omission from the charge, Maryland Rule 554, the factual situation, as developed in the trial, did not justify such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
