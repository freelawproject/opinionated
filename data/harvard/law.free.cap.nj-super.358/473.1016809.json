Bassinder agreed to purchase the license for $242,500, payable $17,500 upon execution of the agreement, $17,500 180 days thereafter, and the balance of $207,500 upon \u201coccurrence\u201d of one of six enumerated events described in paragraph 2d of the agreement. One such \u201coccurrence\u201d is Bassinder\u2019s \u201csale\u201d of premises he leased on the Long Branch Pier from Ric-Cic Co. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered at the close of plaintiffs case. <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The central issue on appeal is whether the condemnation of the subject property by the City of Long Branch constituted a \u201csale\u201d of the premises by Bassinder. If so, the \u201csale\u201d triggered Bassinder\u2019s obligation to pay the balance due under paragraph 2d. We conclude that the condemnation did not constitute a \u201csale\u201d of the premises by Bassinder as that term was contemplated by the parties. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The salient facts are undisputed. Prior to 1987, plaintiff operated a nightclub on the Long Branch Pier. A 1987 fire on the pier totally destroyed plaintiffs business. During the same time Bassinder\u2019s was operating Scotty\u2019s Long Branch Arcade, an amusement facility also situate on the pier. Bassinder\u2019s arcade occupied its premises pursuant to two ninety-nine year leases with Ric-Cic Co.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His arcade was also totally destroyed by the fire. <em>See Ric-Cic Co. v. Bassinder, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 336-37, 599 A.2d 943 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Because plaintiffs nightclub was destroyed, it was desirous of selling its liquor license. By written agreement dated October 30, 1987, prepared by plaintiffs attorney, it agreed to sell the license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to Bassinder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for $242,000, payable by two $17,500 payments, and, pursuant to paragraph 2d of the agreement, the balance of the $207,500 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">upon the occurrence of the earlier of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">i. The Liquor License or any other liquor license is actively used on the Premises; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u00fc. The Liquor License is transferred by the [Purchaser] in a place to place transfer, to any other property that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the Premises; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">iii. The Premises is sold by the Purchaser to a third party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">iv. The Purchaser assigns, to a thirty party, the Leases, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">v. The Purchaser voluntarily terminates one or both of the Leases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">vi. The Liquor License is sold to a third party in a person to person transfer____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">Paragraph 9 of the agreement, entitled \u201cReversion of Seller,\u201d provides that the liquor license reverts to plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-14\">upon the occurrence of any one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">(a) One or both of [Bassinder\u2019s] Leases are invalidated or voided by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">(b) One or both of the Leases are terminated by the landlord; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">(c) One or both of the Leases are foreclosed in a mortgage foreclosure action or in any other action brought by a secured creditor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-18\">(d) The Purchaser for any reason whatsoever [loses] the interest bestowed upon it by one or both of the Leases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">(e) Premises, because of restrictions in one or both of the Leases or because of governmental regulation, cannot be used as Premises that are licensed for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-20\">Paragraph 9 also provides: \u201cHowever, in lieu of the rights bestowed upon it by this paragraph 9 [plaintiff] may waive this right of reversion in favor of the rights bestowed upon it by subparagraph 2.d.\u201d The agreement does not have a time limit for the triggering of any of the events set forth in either paragraphs 2d or 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Bassinder also executed a non-interest-bearing promissory note in favor of plaintiff for the amount of $207,500, due and payable upon the occurrence of the earlier of the six events listed in paragraph 2d of the parties\u2019 agreement. The note was personally guaranteed by Bassinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">On May 10,1988, the City of Long Branch adopted a resolution approving the transfer of the liquor license from plaintiff to Bassinder. On June 24,1997, the City filed a declaration of taking which rendered the City owner of the premises leased by Bassinder from Ric-Rie Co. The City subsequently instituted a condemnation action against Ric-Cie in which all the tenants on the pier, including Bassinder, were named as defendants. In the condemnation action, the court determined that, by virtue of the \u201ceminent domain clause\u201d in Bassinder\u2019s leases with Ric-Cie Co., the condemnation action by the City terminated his leasehold interest in the premises, and therefore he had no standing to share in any of the condemnation proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">This ruling notwithstanding, plaintiff filed an action against Bassinder seeking a declaration that he was required to pay plaintiff the balance of the $207,500 due under the agreement and accompanying promissory note. During the nonjury trial, Francis Marine\u00f3la, plaintiffs principal, advanced the proposition that under paragraph 9, plaintiff had the right to demand payment \u201cin lieu of\u2019 a reversion of the license to it. On this point, Marine\u00f3la recognized that paragraph 9 did not explicitly give plaintiff that right. He claimed, however, that the \u201cin lieu of\u2019 clause was intended to read \u201cin favor of [plaintiff] getting paid the monies,\u201d instead of \u201cin favor of the rights bestowed ... by paragraph 2.d.\u201d He admitted that he should have drafted the agreement to be \u201cvery clear with that\u2014 That is probably why we are here.\u201d. Alternatively, Marine\u00f3la claimed that the City\u2019s condemnation of the subject property constituted a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d, thereby triggering Bassinder\u2019s obligation to pay the balance due under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>According to Marine\u00f3la, prior to the parties\u2019 agreement plaintiff had a \u201cmonopoly\u201d because no other licensed premises could be operated on the pier. However, since the agreement, the City has passed an ordinance permitting beachfront property owners to hold liquor licenses. It was Marincola\u2019s view that the new ordinance had the effect of devaluing plaintiffs license.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The trial court granted Bassinder\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence. It ruled that condemnation of the subject property had triggered paragraph 9 of the parties\u2019 agreement, because, by court order, Bassinder\u2019s rights under his leases had been terminated. However, the court determined that paragraph 9 entitled plaintiff only to a reversion of the license, and not the payment of the balance due under the agreement. The court reasoned that any other interpretation would be plainly contrary to the plain language of the provision. The court further found that none of the conditions in paragraph 2d had occurred so as to trigger the obligation of Bassinder to pay the balance of the purchase price. In an earlier ruling the court had determined that condemnation of the property did not constitute a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d. In reaching that conclusion, the court relied on case law indicating that condemnations were \u201cinvoluntary\u201d transfers of title, rather than \u201csales\u201d of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Plaintiff first argues that Bassinder became obligated to pay the balance due under the agreement pursuant to paragraph 9 when he lost his interest in his leasehold by virtue of the City\u2019s condemnation of the subject property. As noted, paragraphs 9a and 9d call for the reversion of the license upon the invalidation of Bassinder\u2019s leases by court order, or in the event he \u201cfor any reason whatsoever [loses] the interest ... in the leases.\u201d Plaintiff focuses on the caveat in paragraph 9, giving it the right to waive reversion \u201cin favor of the rights bestowed upon it by subparagraph 2d,\u201d and reasons that the only \u201cright\u201d logically intended was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the \u201cright for [plaintiff] to receive $207,500 from Bassinder.\u201d We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In interpreting a contract our goal is to ascertain the intent of the parties as revealed by the language used by them. <em>Jacobs v. Great Pacific Century Corp., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>580, 586, 518 A.2d 223 (1986). We may not make a better contract for either party, or supply terms that have not been agreed upon. <em>Graziano v. Grant, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 342, 741 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1999). Essentially, plaintiffs contention tracks Marineola\u2019s trial testimony. As noted, he testified that it was his intention in drafting paragraph 9 that, in lieu of reversion of the license, plaintiff was entitled to payment of \u201cthe monies\u201d due it if Bassinder lost his leasehold. However, that is not what paragraph 9 says; it provides clearly that plaintiff may waive reversion \u201cin favor of the rights bestowed upon [plaintiff] by subparagraph 2d.\u201d Those \u201crights\u201d are predicated upon the occurrence of one of six events. Even if we were to find an ambiguity in the clause, which we do not, the ambiguity must be resolved against plaintiff, the party who drafted the instrument. <em>In re Miller\u2019s Estate, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>210, 221, 447 A.2d 549 (1982). If plaintiff wanted the right to demand payment under paragraph 9 in lieu of reversion, it should have so stated in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Plaintiff also contends that the City\u2019s condemnation of the subject premises constituted a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d(iii), which triggers Bassinder\u2019s obligation to pay if \u201cthe Premises <em>is sold, by the Purchaser </em>to a third party____\u201d (Emphasis added). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Paragraph 2d(iii) appears to contemplate Bassinder\u2019s obligation to pay only upon \u201csale\u201d of the premises by <em>him. </em>This event could only have occurred had Bassinder prevailed in the condemnation proceeding by convincing the court that he was the <em>owner </em>of the subject property by virtue of his ninety-nine year leases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>However, as noted, his ownership claim was rejected in the condemnation case, and his leasehold was extinguished by virtue of the \u201ceminent domain\u201d clause under his leases. Consequently, if in fact the condemnation constituted a \u201csale,\u201d it was Ric-Cic, the property title holder of the subject property, who \u201csold\u201d the premises to the City, not Bassinder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The trial court did not engage in the above-described interpretation of paragraph 2d. Rather, it focused on whether condemnation of the subject property constituted a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d(iii). The court concluded that it did not because it was not a free and voluntary transfer of the property. For that proposition, the court relied on case law in the field of taxation which holds that a loss suffered as a result of a mortgage foreclosure is not the same as a loss resulting from the \u201csale\u201d of an asset within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Freihofer, </em>102 F.2d 787, 788-89 (3rd Cir. 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">If, as the trial court assumed, it is necessary to decide whether the condemnation constituted a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d(iii), our view is that that issue should not be resolved based on cases decided in the field of taxation. Indeed, some courts dealing specifically with condemnation proceedings have held that acquisition of property in condemnation in fact constitutes a sale or exchange of property for income tax purposes. <em>See Feinberg v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>377 F.2d 21, 26 (8th Cir.1967); <em>Hawaiian Gas Prods. v. Commissioner, Internal Revenue, </em>126 <em>F.2d 4, </em>5 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>317 <em>U.S. </em>653, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>48, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>525 (1942) (same); <em>Simpson v. Timber Co. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>326 <em>Or. </em>370, 953 P.2d 366, 369-70 (1998) (same). However, none of these cases are on point because their holdings are based on legislative intent and underlying tax policy considerations. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>contrast, the issue in this ease is the contractual intent of two private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In seeking to discover the intentions of the parties, courts generally consider the contractual terms, the surrounding circumstances, and the purpose of the contract. <em>Caruso v. Ravenswood Developers, Inc., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 506, 767 A.2d 979 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>Marchak v. Claridge Commons, Inc., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>275, 282, 633 A.2d 531 (1993)). Here, the surrounding circumstances were plaintiff\u2019s intention to sell the license because it could no longer use it, and Bassinder\u2019s desire to construct a licensed facility on his leased premises. By its very terms, the evident purpose of paragraph 2d was to trigger Bassinder\u2019s obligation to pay the balance of the contract price when he <em>voluntarily </em>divested himself of either the premises or the license. Each occurrence listed under paragraph 2d presupposes such a voluntary act. Further, under five of the six \u201coccurrences\u201d listed, that voluntary act by Bassinder will result in consideration paid to him for the sale or transfer. Termination of his leaseholds as a result of the condemnation was hardly voluntary, and it clearly did not yield pecuniary gain. Indeed, Bassinder vigorously participated in the condemnation action, but without success. We therefore conclude that the condemnation of Ric-Cic\u2019s property did not constitute a \u201csale\u201d under paragraph 2d(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Plaintiff also argues that Bassinder voluntarily terminated his leases, thereby triggering paragraph 2d(v) of the agreement. It relies on the fact that Bassinder\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to Ric-Ric in December 1998, claiming that, by virtue of the condemnation of the property, his mortgage payment was no longer due and payable. We do not agree. At no time did Bassinder ever voluntarily terminate his leases. Indeed, the related condemnation litigation amply demonstrated that he defended the leases vigorously, and took the position that he in fact held fee title to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Additionally, we agree with Bassinder that a mortgagor may in fact be relieved of its obligation to make payments on a mortgage after a condemnation award has been paid into court and funds are available for withdrawal by the mortgagee. <em>See City of Orange Township v. Empire Mtg. Services, Inc., </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 225, 775 A.2d 174 (App.Div.2001). Under this view, Bassinder\u2019s reluctance to continue making mortgage payments to Ric-Cic following the commencement of the condemnation proceedings would not necessarily be deemed a voluntary termination of the leases. Moreover, on the record before us, we do not know whether the applicable provisions in the mortgage gave Bassinder the right to stop making payments. In any event, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that Bassinder did not voluntarily surrendered his interest in the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Finally, we reject plaintiffs argument that the executory nature of the parties\u2019 agreement required that Bassinder, as the \u201cvendee\u201d and \u201cequitable owner\u201d of the property, bear the risk of condemnation. This was not an executory contract for the sale of real property where title had not yet passed to the purchaser. <em>Cf. Cox v. RKA Corp., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>487, 494-95, 753 A.2d 1112 (2000) (if vendor cannot properly convey title as contracted for, the purchaser, as equitable owner, may assert rights to recover any payments made). Rather, Bassinder became legal owner of the liquor license upon execution of the agreement and transfer of the license by the City. He was obligated to pay an additional $207,500 only if certain events occurred. As such, he was not \u201cequitable owner,\u201d and did not bear the risk of anything except as specifically bargained for by the parties and as set forth in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"> Ric-Cic Co., a partnership, was the fee title owner of the land on which the pier was built.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-21\"> Bassinder bought out the interests of his partners, the other signatories of the agreement who are named as party defendants in this action. These defendants did not participate in the trial, nor do they participate in this appeal. Therefore, instead of referring to all defendants, reference is made only to Bassinder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\"> Further, paragraph 2d(iv), which calls for payment upon Bassinder\u2019s assignment of his leases to a third party, does not trigger repayment because, as noted, his interest in the leases had been extinguished by virtue of the City's declaration of taking and condemnation proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
