If an agency fails to issue a final decision within the allowed time, the ALJ\u2019s initial decision is \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d as the agency\u2019s final decision. <em>Ibid. </em>The APA also requires, an agency to include in its final decision findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>and conclusions of law supporting any rejection or modification of an ALJ\u2019s initial decision. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d). We have previously held that the lack of findings of fact and conclusions of law in an agency\u2019s final decision does not automatically require the ALJ\u2019s initial decision to be \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d However, we also have stated that an agency decision issued without findings of fact and conclusions of law does not conform with the APA and that an unjustifiable delay in satisfying this requirement could result in the ALJ\u2019s initial decision being transformed into the agency\u2019s final decision. These appeals involve one case where the Racing Commission did not issue a final decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law until seven months after receipt of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision and a second case where the Commission failed to satisfy this requirement for an entire year. We conclude in both cases that the Commission\u2019s delays in issuing final decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law constituted gross indifference to its responsibilities under the APA. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decisions are reversed and the ALJ\u2019s initial decisions are \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d as the Commission\u2019s final decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On April 5, 1998, the Board of Judges at the Meadowlands Racetrack suspended the harness horse training license of Mark Capone, the trainer of \u201cStonebridge Do Run,\u201d for thirty days for a \u201creversal of form\u201d in a race held on March 27, 1998, compared to the horse\u2019s two prior races on March 15 and 20, 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 8, 1998, the Board suspended the harness racing license of Richard Silverman, the driver of Stonebridge Do Run in all three races, for fifteen days for the same violation. Both Capone and Silverman appealed their suspensions to the Commission, which referred the matters to the OAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On January 11, 2001, a one-day hearing was held before an ALJ. On March 8, 2001, the ALJ issued an initial decision, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>concluded that the Commission had failed to prove the charges against either Capone or Silverman. On March 9, 2001, the Commission acknowledged receipt of this initial decision. On March 22, 2001, the Deputy Attorney General representing the Commission filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s initial decision. On April 2 and 17, 2001, Capone and Silverman submitted replies to these exceptions. On April 12, 2001, the Director of the OAL granted the Commission an extension to June 7, 2001, of the forty-five day statutory period for rendering a final decision on the ground that the Commission needed additional time to review the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">On May 24, 2001, the Commission staff sent a pro forma letter-to Capone and Silverman notifying them that the Commission had decided at its May 16, 2001 meeting to reject the ALJ\u2019s initial decision and reinstate the suspensions imposed by the Board of Judges. This letter also stated that \u201c[a] copy of the Commission\u2019s written decision, which will memorialize its final disposition of this matter, together with a ruling implementing said decision will be forwarded under separate cover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">More than four-and-a-half months later, on October 9, 2001, the Commission issued its final decision, which rejected the ALJ\u2019s initial decision and reinstated the Board\u2019s ruling that Capone and Silverman had raced Stonebridge Do Run in an inconsistent manner resulting in a reversal of form on March 27, 1998. By separate orders, also issued on October 9, 2001, the Commission reimposed the suspensions imposed by the Board and directed that the periods of suspension commence on November 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Capone and Silverman filed separate notices of appeal from this final decision, and the Commission granted their motions for stays pending the outcome of the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The procedural course of the second case was similar, except that the Commission took even longer to issue its final decision. The Board of Judges at Freehold Raceway suspended the license of Richard Silverman, also one of the appellants in the reversal of form appeal, for nine days for allegedly kicking a horse, \u201cStar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Fleet Cadet,\u201d in a race held on April 12, 2000. Silverman appealed this suspension and the matter was referred to the OAL. On March 1, 2001, a hearing was held before an ALJ that took less than an hour. On April 11, 2001, the ALJ issued an initial decision which concluded that the Commission had failed to prove the charge. On April 16, 2001, the Commission acknowledged receipt of the initial decision. On May 31, 2001, the Director of the OAL granted the Commission an extension to July 15, 2001, of the forty-five day statutory period for issuing a final decision on the ground that the Commission needed additional time to obtain and review the transcript of the hearing before the ALJ. However, the Commission did not even order this transcript until June 18, 2001, two months after it received the ALJ\u2019s initial decision. On July 17, 2001, the Director of the OAL granted the Commission a second extension of time to August 29, 2001, on the ground that the Commission had only received the transcript of the hearing on July 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On August 22,2001, the Commission sent Silverman a pro forma letter, substantially similar to the one used in the reversal of form ease, notifying him that the Commission had decided at its August 15, 2001, meeting to reject the ALJ\u2019s initial decision and reinstate the nine-day suspension imposed by the Board of Judges. More than seven-and-a-half months later, on April 11, 2002, a full year after the ALJ issued its initial decision, the Commission issued its final decision, which rejected the ALJ\u2019s decision and reinstated the Board\u2019s decision suspending Silverman\u2019s license for nine days. Silverman filed a notice of appeal, and the Commission granted a stay pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Appellants argue that the Commission\u2019s final decisions must be reversed, because the ALJ\u2019s initial decisions were \u201cdeemed approved\u201d when the Commission failed to issue its decisions within the extended statutory periods for issuance of final agency decisions. In addition, appellants argue that the Commission\u2019s final decisions are not supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. Capone also argues that the administrative regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>upon which the Commission relied in suspending his license\u2014 which prohibits \u201cany act or conduct detrimental to the sport\u201d of harness racing, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:71-7.29(a)(13) \u2014 is impermissibly vague, thereby rendering it unconstitutional. We consolidate the three appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We conclude that the suspensions of appellants\u2019 licenses must be reversed, because the ALJ\u2019s initial decisions, which found that the Commission had failed to prove the charges against appellants, were \u201cdeemed approved\u201d when the Commission failed to issue final agency decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law within the time allowed under <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(e). In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider appellants\u2019 other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">The head of the agency, upon a review of the record submitted by the [ALJ], shall adopt, reject or modify the recommended report'and decision no later than 45 days after receipt of such recommendations.

New Jersey Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>412, 423-24, 511 A.2d 615 (1986), the Court held that a final decision of the Racing Commission that the Court determined to have been rendered without a full quorum did not provide a basis for application of the \u201cdeemed-approved\u201d provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c). The Court\u2019s discussion of the quorum issue presented in <em>King </em>indicates that the Commission had a good faith basis for believing it had the quorum required for issuance of a final decision. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 416-18, 511 A.2d 615. Consequently, the Court characterized the Commission\u2019s final decision, issued without a proper quorum, as \u201ctechnically defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 511 A.2d 615. In concluding that the ALJ\u2019s initial decision should not be \u201cdeemed approved\u201d under such circumstances, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">[WJere an administrative agency to proceed in bad faith, or with inexcusable negligence, or gross indifference, or simply to take no action whatsoever that purports \u201cto adopt, reject or modify\u201d the recommended report of the ALJ during the 45-day period following the issuance of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, the \u201cdeemed-approved\u201d provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(e) should be invoked; in that event the ALJ's initial decision should be transformed into the agency\u2019s final decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In <em>DiMaria v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., 225 N.J.Super. </em>341, 345-49, 542 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>638, 552 A.2d 164 (1988), this court concluded, relying upon the Court\u2019s analysis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c) in <em>King, </em>that an ALJ\u2019s decision should not be automatically \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d if an agency issues a final decision that is not accompanied by the findings of fact and conclusions of law required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d). However, we added a cautionary comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">It is vitally important that an agency issue findings of tact and conclusions of law in compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d), and that it do so expeditiously. An administrative agency\u2019s explanation of the reasons lor its decision is required not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>only for appellate review but also to assure the parties that their factual allegations and legal arguments have been fully considered. Therefore, this opinion should not be understood to condone delay in an agency\u2019s issuance of findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">[Id. at 349, 542 A.2d 498 (citations omitted).]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We revisited this topic in <em>Chapel v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 396-99, 609 A.2d 1294 (App.Div. 1992), a case similar to this one, in which a state agency \u2014 there the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees Retirement System \u2014 sent a pro forma letter notifying the affected party of the agency\u2019s rejection of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, but then delayed four months before issuing an opinion containing the reasons for its final decision. Although we reversed the Board\u2019s final decision on the merits, we also commented upon its failure to issue an opinion containing findings of fact and conclusions of law within the forty-five day period allowed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14-10(c). In an opinion written by Judge Kestin, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>King </em>held that the \u201cdeemed-approved\u201d provision embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(e) for an administrative agency\u2019s failure to issue a final decision within the prescribed period of time \u2014 45 days unless an extension is agreed to by the agency head and the Director of the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) \u2014 should neither be automatically applied nor lightly imposed. The salutary principle of that case is that an agency which has committed a non-substantive error or has made a procedural mistake or has otherwise, in good faith, taken \u201caction that addresses the merits of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision within the statutory time period\u201d should not be faced with the draconian result of being deprived of final decision-making authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">Accordingly, an exceptional and excusable lapse in timely conformance with the content requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d), in the absence of prejudice to a party, should not ordinarily result in application of the \u201cdeemed-approved\u201d provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">Nevertheless, an agency may relinquish the benefit of this latitude by persistent disregard of its procedural responsibilities. The APA clearly rests upon the principle that parties affected by an agency\u2019s decision are entitled to know the reasons for it. A corollary of that premise is that agency action that lacks the basic informational qualities established in the statute cannot be seen as a final administrative decision under the APA. Any such action is without those characteristics which the Legislature perceived to be necessary to invest the administrative process with essential fairness, procedural regularity and decisional reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 396-98, 609 A.2d 1294 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>We again considered a state administrative agency\u2019s responsibility to render a final decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law within the forty-five day period allowed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(e) in <em>New Jersey Racing Comm\u2019n v. Silverman, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 302-04, 696 A.2d 771 (App.Div.1997), a case that involved the same agency, the Racing Commission, and the same appellant, Richard Silverman, as in two of the three appeals addressed in this opinion. Although we decided the appeal on the merits rather than on the basis of the Commission\u2019s failure to <em>comply </em>with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d), we strongly condemned the Commission\u2019s procedure, identical to the one followed in this case, of simply notifying appellant of its rejection of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision within the time allowed under the APA and then delaying the issuance of a final decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law until many months later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">The Commission was seriously derelict in performing its responsibilities under the APA in this case. Since the ALJ\u2019s initial decision was served upon the Commission on March 13, 1995, it was required to issue its final decision no later than April 27, 1995. However, on April 26, 1995, the Commission simply announced that it was rejecting the part of the ALJ\u2019s decision relating to the length of the suspension of appellant\u2019s license, without issuing any written decision in conformity with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d). The Commission then delayed nine months until it eventually issued its decision on January 22, 1996. During the intervening period, the Commission never applied to the OAL for an extension of time, as authorized by N.J.S.A. 54:14B-10(e) and <em>N.J.AC. </em>1:1-18.8, and the decision itself contains no explanation for the long delay in its preparation and release. Consequently, we have no way of knowing whether there was some exceptional circumstance which might justify the prolonged delay in the Commission issuing its rather brief and uncomplicated decision or whether it follows the practice we condemned in <em>Chapel </em>of routinely announcing \u201ca <em>proforma </em>rejection of an fALJ\u2019sJ decision, ... and unilaterally postponing] the final decision,\u201d thereby \u201cextendfing] the administrative process in a way not contemplated by the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">We have no need to pursue the point further because we conclude that the part of the Commission\u2019s decision relating to the length of appellant\u2019s license suspension must be reversed for other reasons. However, we take the occasion to again admonish state agencies that if a final decision rejecting or modifying an ALJ\u2019s initial decision is not issued in conformity with <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d), the ALJ\u2019s initial decision may be \u201ctransformed into the agency\u2019s final decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 303-04, 696 A.2d 771 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This appeal requires further exposition of the intent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(e) and (d). On its face, the APA\u2019s requirements for issuance of a final decision are categorical: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c) states that \u201c[u]nless the head of the agency modifies or rejects the [ALJ\u2019s] report within [the statutory] period, the decision of the [ALJ] shall be deemed adopted as the final decision of the head of the agencyf;]\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(d) states that \u201c[a] final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Reading these provisions literally, for a purported agency decision to constitute a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d it must be issued within forty-five days and contain \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d and in the absence of such a decision, the ALJ\u2019s initial decision must be \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d as the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">However, the Supreme Court in <em>King </em>rejected this kind of a literal reading of the \u201cdeemed approved\u201d provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) by holding that \u201cwhere the agency takes action that addresses the merits of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision within the statutory time period, which action is later determined by a court to be legally ineffective due to a non-substantive error or procedural mistake made by the agency, the agency should be permitted to take remedial steps to cure the deficiency and to issue a decision.\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615. In <em>DiMaria, </em>we applied this flexible approach to the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) as well as <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(d) in a case where an agency issued a final decision that did not contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. 225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 345, 542 A.2d 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">But the <em>King </em>holding we relied upon in <em>DiMaria </em>does not extend to a case where an agency proceeds in \u201cbad faith, or with inexcusable negligence, or gross indifference\u201d to its statutory responsibilities. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615. In <em>King, </em>there was no basis for finding \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d or \u201cgross indifference\u201d because the Racing Commission issued a decision which was \u201ctimely, clearly and unambiguously expressed, and fully explained,\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615, but defective because issued in violation of quorum requirements as determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>by the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 416-18, oil A.2d 615. In <em>DiMaria, </em>we did not specifically identify the circumstances which led us to conclude that the ALJ\u2019s initial decision should not be \u201cdeemed adopted.\u201d However, we note that <em>DiMaria </em>involved complex questions of pension law which the agency undoubtedly needed significant time to consider. Moreover, the agency\u2019s final decision, containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, was issued four months after receipt of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, 225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 346, 542 A.2d 498, which was still within a period when the agency may have been able to secure an extension of time from the Director of OAL for issuance of its decision. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>1:1-18.8 (providing that an agency may obtain a first extension for issuing a final decision of not more than forty-five days for \u201cgood cause\u201d and a second extension of forty-five days upon a showing of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d); <em>see also Wilson v.

Sys., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 484-86, 731 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1998) (also involving a complex issue of pension law which the Board decided a little more than three months after receipt of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We perceive no comparable basis in the present cases for concluding that the Commission\u2019s failure to issue its final decisions within the time allowed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c) was without \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d or \u201cgross indifference\u201d to its responsibilities under <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d). The Commission\u2019s delays in the issuance of its final decisions were extremely lengthy: seven months in the reversal of form case and a full year in the horse kicking case. In addition, the records were small and the issues simple in both eases. The administrative hearing took less than a day in the reversal of form ease and less than an hour in the horse kicking case. Only a small number of documents were admitted into evidence at the hearings. Moreover, the issue in both cases was solely factual and very straightforward: whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the Board of Judges\u2019 findings that appellants had committed the violations with which they were charged. In fact, when the Commission eventually acted, its decision was only six pages long in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>reversal of form case and only a little more than one page long in the horse kicking case. We also note that the Commission has not even undertaken to show that it had a good excuse for failing to issue its decisions in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Despite the Commission\u2019s long and inexcusable delays in issuing its final decisions, it argues that the \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) should not be applied because appellants suffered no prejudice. \u201cHowever, the automatic approval mandated by <em>N.J.SA </em>52:14B-10(c) does not require a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Mastro v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 451, 630 A.2d 289 (App.Div.1993). To avoid application of the \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d provision, an agency must show that it proceeded in \u201cgood faith\u201d and that there was not \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d or \u201cgross indifference\u201d in satisfying its responsibilities under <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d). <em>King, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615. The Commission failed to make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Moreover, we cannot disregard the fact that we specifically admonished this very agency in the prior <em>Silverman </em>appeal that its practice of simply notifying a party of its rejection of an ALJ\u2019s initial decision, followed many months later by issuance of a final decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, violates <em>N.J.SA. </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d) and could result in the ALJ\u2019s initial decision being \u201ctransformed into the agency\u2019s final decision.\u201d 303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 304, 696 A.2d 771 (quoting <em>King, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 511 A.2d 615). Under these circumstances, the Commission\u2019s failure to issue timely decisions constituted \u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d and \u201cgross indifference\u201d to its statutory responsibilities. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s initial decisions must be \u201cdeemed adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Finally, we consider it appropriate to provide guidance to state agencies regarding compliance with <em>N.J.SA </em>52:14B-10(c) and (d). The final sentence of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:14B-10(c), which provides that \u201c[f]or good cause shown, upon certification by the director and the agency head, the time limits established herein may be subject to extension[,]\u201d clearly contemplates that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>extension of the forty-five day period for issuance of a final agency decision shall be under the supervision and control of the Director of the OAL. <em>See Chapel, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398, 609 A.2d 1294. An agency may not simply delay issuance of a final decision beyond the forty-five day deadline on its own. It must apply to the Director for an extension. Under the administrative regulations adopted to implement this provision, any such request must be submitted no later than the expiration of the forty-five day period for issuance of a final decision. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>1:1 \u2014 18.8(b). However, \u201c[t]his requirement may be waived ... in any case of emergency or other unforeseeable circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, even if an agency fails to seek an extension of time for filing a final decision before expiration of the forty-five day period, it still should apply to the Director for an extension. <em>See Newman v. Ramapo Coll. of N.J., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super </em>196, 201-03, 793 A.2d 120 (App.Div.2002); <em>Town of Secaucus v. Hackensack Meadowlands Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 390-92, 631 A.2d 959 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>187, 652 A.2d 175 (1994). This will enable an adequate record to be developed concerning the agency\u2019s reasons for failing to issue a timely decision and failing to file a timely application for an extension, so that any reviewing court can determine whether the <em>King </em>criteria for relaxation of strict application of the \u201cdeemed adopted\u201d provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c) have been satisfied. We also reiterate that \u201capproval of ... a request [for an extension of time] ought not to be unreasonably withheld.\u201d <em>Chapel, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398, 609 A.2d 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s final decisions are reversed and the ALJ\u2019s initial decisions are deemed adopted as the Commission\u2019s final decisions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-8\"> The Board of Judges also imposed a $500 fine upon Capone for failure to provide accurate information concerning an equipment change for the March 27, 1998 race, which is not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
