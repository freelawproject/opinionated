The action was brought on behalf of a child, Kathryn Buono, who was injured when Michael Scalia, then aged five years and nine months, struck her with the bicycle he was riding. Plaintiffs sued Michael on a theory of direct negligence and sued Michael\u2019s parents Alphonse and Lisa Scalia on a theory of negligent supervision. The trial judge determined that under <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>533, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983), parental immunity exists in the instant situation, where failure to supervise was neither willful nor wanton, even though suit was not brought on behalf of the defendant parents\u2019 child. This appeal raises only issues as to the liability of Michael\u2019s father, inasmuch as it was conceded at oral argument before us that Michael is not liable to plaintiffs and that his mother also is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>not liable because she had not undertaken to supervise him at the time of the events in suit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The essential facts are these. Michael Scalia, then five years and nine months old, injured sixteen month old Kathryn Buono when the bicycle he was riding struck her. The victim\u2019s father, Vincent Buono, filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and on behalf of his daughter. Plaintiffs assert on appeal that Alphonse Scalia was negligent in supervising and controlling his son, and that his negligence proximately caused the accident which led to plaintiff Kathryn\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The accident occurred around mid-day on June 17, 2000, on Sunset Avenue in Bayonne, which was closed to traffic for a block party. Between fifteen and twenty neighbors, including approximately fourteen adults and six children, had gathered for the party at the time of the accident. Michael\u2019s mother Lisa was inside their home, preparing food to bring to the party. Vincent Buono was inside his home exercising. Neither Lisa nor Vincent observed the accident. Kathryn was standing on the street beside her mother, Diane Buono, who was engaged in conversation. Diane testified there was \u201ca lot of activity\u201d on the block including an open fire hydrant and \u201cchildren riding bikes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Michael was nearby riding a two-wheel bicycle. He had been taught to ride a bicycle by both his parents, and he had been riding without training wheels for about two months prior to the accident. Michael\u2019s parents allowed him to ride his bicycle outdoors as long as he remained on the sidewalk in front of his or in front of one or two neighboring houses in either direction. Because of the block party, however, Michael was permitted to ride in the street that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Alphonse Scalia was following his son Michael as he rode his bicycle that day, \u201ckeeping an eye on him[.]\u201d Alphonse watched from five to eight feet behind, as his son came closer to Kathryn, who Alphonse claims walked toward the path of Michael\u2019s bicycle. Anticipating an accident, Alphonse shouted to Michael, \u201c[Wjatch out!\u201d Michael did not respond to his father\u2019s warning, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>struck Kathryn with his bicycle, and both children fell to the ground, with the bicycle landing on Kathryn.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary judgment, alleging that the trial court erred in determining that parental immunity barred plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Michael\u2019s parents because their supervision had not been negligent, willful, or wanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In granting the motion, the trial judge relied on <em>Foldi, </em>and noted that <em>Foldi </em>dealt with liability for injuries to an allegedly negligent parent\u2019s own child. The judge in effect reasoned from <em>Foldi </em>that the determinative consideration was not the relationship between the allegedly negligent parent and the injured person, but between the allegedly negligent parent and the child in need of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s determination under <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Tp. Committee, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995), pursuant to which we need not give special deference to a trial judge\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts[.]\u201d Id. at 378, 658 A.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Because of the centrality of Foldi to this appeal, we refer to it at length. The facts were that Jennifer Foldi, a two and one-half year old child, wandered off her own property and onto her neighbors\u2019 property, where she was bitten by their dog. Through her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Jennifer brought suit against the neighbors, who filed a third party complaint against Jennifer\u2019s parents for failure to exercise reasonable care in supervising their child. Jennifer also amended her complaint to name her parents as defendants. Jennifer\u2019s mother had been keeping an eye on her while gardening but failed to notice for as long as five or ten minutes that Jennifer had left the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The Supreme Court affirmed \u201cthat the parental immunity doctrine barred Jennifer\u2019s claim and the [neighbors\u2019] third-party claim for indemnity.\u201d <em>Foldi, supra, </em>at 536, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983). The Court addressed in detail the development of the parental immunity doctrine and a split of authority in state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>As explained by the Court in <em>Foldi, </em>the history is as follows. 93 <em>N.J. </em>at 538-42, 461 A.2d 1145. The Court of Errors and Appeals first recognized the doctrine of parental immunity in <em>Reingold v. Reingold, </em>115 <em>N.J.L. </em>532, 181 A. 153 (1935), in which the court reasoned that parental immunity would preserve tranquility within the family. Three decisions of the Supreme Court, <em>Hastings v. Hastings, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>247, 163 A.2d 147 (1960), <em>Heyman v. Gordon, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>52,190 A.2d 670 (1963), and <em>Franco v. Davis, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>237, 239 A.2d 1 (1968), followed <em>Reingold, </em>applying the parental immunity doctrine in cases of ordinary automobile negligence. The Court noted that each of the three was decided by a \u201cslim\u201d 4-3 margin, and that Justice Jacobs had written a dissent in each, arguing that New Jersey should follow the lead of other states to abolish the doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 181 A. 153. Then, in <em>France v. </em>A.P.A. <em>Transp. Corp., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>500, 267 A.2d 490 (1970) (allowing \u201can unemancipated child to sue his or her parent for injuries that resulted from the parent\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle\u201d), and a companion case, <em>Immer v. Risko, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>482, 267 A.2d 481 (1970) (\u201cabolishing interspousal tort immunity in automobile negligence actions\u201d), the Court recognized that the traditional justifications for these immunities, \u201cpreservation of domestic harmony, the deterrence of fraud and collusion, and the protection of the family exchequer had little remaining validity[]\u201d given the \u201cwidespread use of liability insurance[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 267 A.2d 481. Though the Court\u2019s holding in <em>France </em>only abolished parental immunity in the motor vehicle context, the Court referred in <em>Foldi </em>to the \u201cgeneral view that the immunity \u2018should be abrogated in this State[]\u2019 \u201d despite a statement in <em>dictum </em>in <em>France </em>that \u201cthere may be areas involving the exercise of parental authority and care over a child which should not be justiciable in a court of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539-40, 461 A.2d 1145, citing <em>France, supra, </em>at 506-507, 267 A.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The Court further reduced the scope of parental immunity in a case unrelated to parental supervision, <em>Small v. Rockfeld, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>231, 330 A.2d 335 (1974), in which it allowed a minor child to sue his father for the father\u2019s wanton and grossly negligent drowning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the child\u2019s mother. In <em>Small, </em>the Court \u201cclearly reaffirmed [its] general disapproval of the parental immunity doctrine\u201d but allowed that parental immunity \u201cmight still remain operative in \u2018special areas in the parent-child relationship, such as customary care and discipline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foldi at 540, 461 A.2d 1145, </em>citing <em>Small, supra, </em>at 244, 330 A.2d 335. On this point, <em>Small </em>cited a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision, <em>Goller v. White, </em>20 <em>Wis.</em>2d 402, 122 N.W.2d 193, 198 (1963), which abolished parental immunity subject to the following exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">(1) where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of parental authority over the child; and (2) where the alleged negligent act involves an exercise of ordinary parental discretion with respect to the provision of food, clothing, housing, medical and dental services and other care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Court in <em>Foldi </em>then addressed an existing split among New Jersey courts on the question whether \u201ca parent\u2019s negligent failure to supervise or instruct a child on safety principies!]\u201d fell within the <em>Goller </em>exceptions. Compare <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 440 A.2d 58 (App.Div.1981), and <em>Fritz v. Anderson, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 73, 371 A.2d 833 (Law Div.1977) (holding that parents\u2019 failure to prevent their minor child from falling into an excavation site was \u201cwithin the realm of parental authority and discretion\u201d and thus, under the <em>Goller </em>exceptions protected by the doctrine of parental immunity against a counterclaim brought by the owners of the excavated property), with <em>Carey v. Davison, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 437 A.2d 338 (Law Div.1981) (strictly construing the <em>Goller </em>exceptions to the abrogation of parental immunity so as not to cover a father who let go of his child\u2019s hand as she crossed a street, and holding that the \u201conly tort cause of action sounding in negligent supervision in New Jersey is that in favor of third parties where a parent has failed to curb a child with known dangerous propensities, or has failed to supervise a child using or having access to a dangerous instrumentalityD\u201d), and <em>Convery v. Maczka, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 394 A.2d 1250 (Law Div.1978) (holding parental immunity did not bar a five year old\u2019s negligent supervision claim against his mother when she allowed him to play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>unattended in a basement where he broke his arm by falling off a chair).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Foldi </em>resolved the split as to \u201cwhether suits against a parent for negligent supervision fall within or without the <em>Goller </em>exceptions.\u201d 93 <em>N.J. </em>at 542, 461 A.2d 1145. Weighing the policy considerations, the Court explained that \u201cpreservation of domestic harmony\u201d and \u201cdeterrence of fraudulent or collusive suits against third party insurers\u201d no longer justified intrafamily tort immunity. The Court held that two justifications<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> survived to justify the Court\u2019s decision to retain parental immunity in \u201ccertain areas of activities within the family sphere involving parental discipline, care, and control that should and must remain free from judicial intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545, 461 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">First, the Court recognized the right and duty parents have to \u201cdetermine how the physical, moral, emotional, and intellectual growth of their children can best be promoted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court acknowledged that, given there was \u201cno recognized correct theory\u201d on the right amount of freedom for a parent to accord a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">[s]ome parents believe that a child must be made self-reliant at an early age and accordingly give their children a great deal of independence. To outsiders, such independence may look like indifference or neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 546, 461 A.2d 1145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Under <em>Foldi, </em>the Court aims to allow parents freedom to accord independence to their children without fear of second-guessing by such outsiders, unless such license rises to the level of willful or wanton neglect or indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Second, the Court notes that individual differences among children make it impossible to articulate \u201cone ideal \u2018formula\u2019 for how much supervision a child should receive at a given age.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the Court\u2019s judgment, leaving parental immunity intact in cases where a parent, as opposed to a teacher or a babysitter, is charged with negligent supervision, takes note of the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he parent is clearly in the best position to know the limitations and capabilities of his or her own children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the Court in <em>Foldi </em>determined that questions of \u201cnegligent supervision\u201d or \u201cthe absence or inadequacy of a parent\u2019s supervision over his or her children!]\u201d fall within the <em>Goller </em>exceptions, and thus are covered by the parental immunity doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 546-57, 122 <em>N.W.2d </em>193. It went on, however, to base its holding, not upon the relationship between the person charging negligent supervision and the person answering that claim, but upon the degree to which a parent had abdicated the duty to supervise the child in question. The Court determined that \u201cwhile the doctrine of parental immunity is a bar to a suit alleging negligent supervision, it does not protect a parent who has willfully or wantonly failed to watch over his or her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 461 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We are satisfied that <em>Foldi </em>retained the parental immunity doctrine in the area of negligent supervision by a parent to apply to suits whether they are brought by that parent\u2019s child or by third parties. Throughout the opinion, the Court spoke of suits generally, rather than about claims made in particular by or on behalf of children against their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">As we read the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Foldi, </em>it did not exclude suits by third parties from the scope of immunity when it referred in the following terms to actions in which parental immunity existed: \u201csuits for negligent supervision!,]\u201d \u201csuits against a parent for negligent supervision!,]\u201d \u201cnegligent supervision actions!]\u201d \u201cnegligent supervision cases!,]\u201d \u201ca suit alleging negligent supervision,\u201d \u201c[s]uits for mere negligent lack of supervision could be used as a tool of harassment and retaliation by devoiced parents!,]\u201d \u201ccases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>negligent supervision,\u201d \u201ctort actions that involve a parent\u2019s willful or wanton misconduct[,]\u201d and \u201cparental supervision eases[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541-42, 547-50, 461 A.2d 1145. We believe the Court would have been more specific if it had intended to limit immunity to cases brought against a parent by or on behalf of that parent\u2019s child. We acknowledge that in one instance the Court referred to \u201can action against a parent by a child for substantial injuries resulting from his or her parent\u2019s willful or wanton lack of supervision^]\u201d but this was not an assertion regarding New Jersey law but rather an explanation of why the Court was rejecting the option of \u201cpermit[ting] the doctrine of parental immunity completely to bar\u201d such actions. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 461 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Here, we also note, Alphonse Scalia was in the best position to determine how much monitoring and support Michael required to ride his bicycle under the conditions of a block party. A uniquely difficult duty is placed upon a parent in Alphonse\u2019s situation to balance between providing close supervision and allowing a child freedom to practice a new skill. That duty is no less difficult if the child injures a third party rather than a family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In considering the scope of parental immunity as declared in <em>Foldi </em>we note that the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">In addition, the comparative fault of parents guilty of willful or wanton misconduct should be factored into the allocation of liability in cases involving third-party joint tortfeasors. Although it would perhaps be fairest to those third parties to consider the parent\u2019s contributory fault in all cases, we draw a line for policy reasons \u2014 as we do in offsetting damages in contributory negligence cases of less than 50% \u2014 that takes into account at least <em>some </em>of their interests. Hence, we go further than the line of purely intentional torts by also removing willful or wanton supervisory misconduct from the protective boundary of immunity. Thus, third-party claims may properly be brought against parents in appropriately severe lack-of-supervision cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">[Id. at 548-49, 461 A.2d 1145 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">This passage is not dispositive of the issue before us, however, because we are not here concerned with the subject of the foregoing passage, namely, the \u201callocation of liability in cases involving third party, joint tortfeasors. Yet it is fair to view <em>Foldi </em>as being concerned with the parental duty of supervision rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>than being focused on whether the victim was or was not a member of the child\u2019s family unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Somewhat surprisingly, we have found no reported decision in which <em>Foldi </em>has been discussed by New Jersey courts in connection with the issue of whether it immunizes parents for negligent supervision claims brought by or on behalf of persons other than their own children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Foldi </em>of course acknowledges that policy concerns may properly drive necessary modifications of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>law immunities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite this lack of reported authority since <em>Foldi </em>the policy concerns embraced in <em>Foldi </em>in our view provide determinative guidance here. The Court embraced respect for differences in parenting philosophies and for the degree to which parents understand the uniqueness of their own children. Regardless of whether the person who seeks recovery for parents\u2019 apparent failure to keep their child from causing harm is a family member, these two policy concerns, outlined in <em>Foldi </em>work to insulate Alphonse Scalia from scrutiny by judge or jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">One application of <em>Foldi </em>in the common situation of a suit by a child against that child\u2019s parent for negligent supervision illustrates why the holding in <em>Foldi </em>appropriately should be deemed to include a bar against suits by third parties. A trial court held in <em>DeMarco v. DeMarco, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>257, 261, 643 A.2d 1053 (Law Div.1992), that parental immunity covered a mother\u2019s decision not to pull over while her daughter threatened to jump out of the car in which the two were traveling. This application of the parental immunity doctrine illustrates why the doctrine, as limited, has been retained. In <em>DeMarco, </em>a mother, while driving with her unemancipated daughter, determined by her daughter\u2019s behavior and admissions that her daughter needed drug rehabilitation treatment, something the daughter had required previously. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 643 A.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">As the mother drove her daughter toward the treatment facility, her daughter\u2019s behavior caused the mother to stop for a period to let her daughter walk, then the mother told the daughter to return to the car. <em>Ibid. </em>The daughter continued behaving irrationally by screaming and threatening to jump from the moving car. <em>Ibid. </em>After the mother decided to continue driving toward the treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>facility rather than to pull over the car, the daughter jumped from the car, sustained injuries, and brought suit against her mother. 274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261, 648 A.2d 1053. Her claim was properly dismissed by the trial court under <em>Foldi. Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We conclude that under <em>Foldi </em>the same result is appropriate if a party other than the daughter (a pedestrian, for example, hit by the daughter\u2019s body) brought suit for injuries allegedly proximately caused by the mother\u2019s decision to continue driving her daughter to drug treatment. In our view, a parental decision to continue or not continue driving in this context is exactly the type of parenting decision, in the absence of willful indifference or neglect, which should be protected by the doctrine of parental immunity. A parent contending with this level of stressful decision-making should not have a decision subject to second-guessing by \u201coutsiders\u201d unfamiliar with her daughter\u2019s past and personality, alien to the mother\u2019s own philosophical perspective, and guided by twenty-twenty hindsight. Of hindsight, the Court cautioned in <em>Foldi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">we can conceive of few accidental injuries a child might sustain that could not have been prevented by closer supervision by his or her <em>parents. </em>Hindsight invariably will expose some slight oversight, some failure to take yet another precaution that somehow contributed to the child\u2019s mishap. No parent can do everything. If such claims were allowed, it would be the rare parent who conceivably could not be called to account in the courts for his or her conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[93 <em>N.J. </em>at 547, 461 A.2d 1145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We note further that although the American Law Institute (ALI) advocates a different position on the doctrine of parental immunity than the New Jersey Supreme Court has approved, the ALI provides support for the proposition that parents must be accorded greater discretion in decisions they make regarding the supervision of their children. Thus the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 895G, Comment j cites the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Goller, supra, </em>approvingly as having for \u201call practical purposes completely abrogated the immunity between parent and child[.]\u201d The comment goes on to note the <em>Goller </em>exceptions and to say that the <em>\u201cGoller </em>ease has now been followed by a substantial minority of jurisdictions.\u201d That comment further states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cunder the better law the immunity between parent and child is entirely abrogated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Restatement describes the immunity as existing only between the parent and child, stating in pertinent part, \u201cA parent or child is not immune from tort liability to the other solely by reason of that relationship.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 895G(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We acknowledge with respect the learned views expressed in the Restatement. We are governed, however, by the decisions of our Supreme Court, and we are satisfied that under <em>Foldi </em>the trial judge\u2019s order should be affirmed. Inasmuch as the supervision of Michael by his father was not willfully or wantonly negligent, Michael\u2019s father is immune even though this was not intra-family litigation but a lawsuit brought respecting alleged injuries to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The <em>Foldi </em>holding did not represent an expansion of parental immunity, and indeed that decision was rendered in a period in which the trend was to limit rather than expand such immunity. But <em>Foldi </em>nevertheless represents a recognition of the legitimacy of parental immunity in particular circumstances. Our decision today represents, not an attempt to expand immunity, but simply our determination that the immunity declared in <em>Foldi </em>embraces the claims alleged by the injured third party in this case that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>said to have arisen from the negligent supervision of Michael by his father.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-10\"> These two surviving justifications tracked the two reasons given by the Appellate Division in affirming the grant of summary judgment by the trial judge. <em>Foldi v.

Section 895G goes on to offer an alternative way to address the intuition that respect should be given to parental discretion in matters of supervision. Comment k to this section proposes a more forgiving standard of reasonableness in determining whether parental supervision has been negligent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">Conduct involving the exercise of parental authority or supervision is essential to the parent-child relationship. This is also true of the performance of parental duties such as the use of care to provide a safe place to live or adequate necessaries or proper instruction and training. Parental discretion is involved, and to say that the standard of a reasonable prudent parent is applied should be to recognize the existence of that discretion and thus to require that the conduct be palpably unreasonable in order to impose liability.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b253-6\">STERN, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">As the majority develops, plaintiffs appeal from an order of December 7, 2001 which grants summary judgment to defendants and dismisses their complaint with prejudice in this case involving injuries sustained by a sixteen-month old minor. The injuries were caused by defendants\u2019 son who was less than six years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe trial court erred in applying the parental immunity doctrine to the plaintiffs\u2019 action against defendant Alfonse Scalia for the negligent supervision of his son, Michael Scalia.\u201d Specifically, plaintiffs contend that \u201cthe parental immunity doctrine does not ... prevent an innocent, unrelated, injured third party from bringing an action against the parents for their negligence in supervising their own unemancipated child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Many of the policy reasons that originally supported the concept of immunity, such as avoidance of fraud and preservation of family harmony, do not apply in the third party setting, irrespective of any increased use of homeowners\u2019 and similar liability insurance coverage. <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>533, 539, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983); <em>France v. A.P.A. Transp. Corp., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>500, 504-06, 267 A.2d 490 (1970). Yet there is no dispute that Kathryn Buono could not sue her mother, Diane Buono, who might have been negligent in failing to watch more carefully and to protect her sixteen-month old daughter as the bicycle approached, and that Alphonse Scalia could not \u201cthird party\u201d Diane Buono in the case against him. This flows from <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, supra, </em>because Diane Buono\u2019s negligent supervision of her daughter was neither willful nor wanton,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and the doctrine of parent-child immunity has not been abrogated in \u201csituations that involve the exercise of parental authority and customary child care.\u201d <em>Foldi supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 551, 461 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">I concur in the opinion of the court because it accurately examines New Jersey law as it now stands, and because a reexamination of <em>Foldi </em>based on developments of the last twenty years, can come only from the Supreme Court. Moreover, I am satisfied that the ability of the Buonos to sue Alfonse Scalia cannot be fully analyzed without reexamining his inability to bring a third party action against Diane Buono, which is concededly barred by <em>Foldi.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\"> In <em>Foldi, </em>the Supreme Court concluded \"that the doctrine of parental immunity will continue to preclude liability in cases of negligent supervision, but not for a parent\u2019s willful or wanton failure to supervise his or her children.\u201d 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 549, 461 A.2d 1145.
