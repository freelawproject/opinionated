The trial judge relied upon our opinion in <em>Levison v. Weintraub, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 277, 521 A.2d 909 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>650, 527 A.2d 470 (1987), which stated that so long as \u201cattorney disapproval is registered within three days there can be no contract, regardless of prior approvals.\u201d The trial judge further concluded that the contract becomes \u201cbinding at the end of the three-day period and not if and when the attorneys approve the terms,\u201d so that since the defendants\u2019 counsel \u201cdisapproved of the contract ... within the three day period, defendants properly terminated the contract,\u201d notwithstanding the prior approval of both counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The material facts are not in dispute. The parties entered into a form real estate sales agreement, prepared by a real estate broker, on Wednesday, September 19, 2001. The agreement included the standard \u201cthree day review\u201d provision. On Friday, September 21, 2001, the attorneys for the respective parties spoke by telephone, and the buyers\u2019 attorney\u2019s \u201conly requested change\u201d was an amendment to permit the buyers to purchase the property in the name of a holding company. The sellers\u2019 attorney acknowledged the changes and faxed a letter approving the changes back to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, together with a letter declaring that the attorney review was complete. That letter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Enclosed is a copy of the Contract of Sale relative to the above matter. It is acceptable to the sellers as executed. As you advised me, the only change requested by the buyers is that they be able to assign the Contract to an entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>which wili be formed by them <em>to own the </em>property. This change is acceptable to the sellers. Accordingly, attorney review is completed as of today\u2019s date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Under separate cover, X will forward to you back title information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Very truly yours,2</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Thereafter, on the same day, the buyers\u2019 attorney wrote sellers\u2019 counsel, with a copy sent by fax, stating, among other things, \u201cI have reviewed the contract of sale and your addendum which memorialized our discussion of earlier today. All are acceptable and attorney review is confirmed as complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">On Monday, September 24, 2001, a new buyer finalized what sellers deemed to be a better offer, and defendant Robert Chapman, still -within the three day review period, as calculated by the form provision concerning \u201ccounting the time,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hand delivered a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney from defendants\u2019 counsel stating that the attorney \u201chereby disapprove^] the Contract of Sale\u201d pursuant to the attorney review clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney thereafter called the sellers\u2019 counsel, and wrote him on September 26, to the effect that the contract was not \u201clawfully voided\u201d and that plaintiffs desired \u201cto continue with the Contract.\u201d Of course, no closing thereafter occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the history of the \u201cattorney review\u201d clause indicates that it was not designed to prevent the creation of a binding contract \u201cbefore the running of the three days\u201d so long as the parties\u2019 attorneys have approved its contents; that <em>Levison </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>distinguishable because it involved an attorney as agent acting as the seller and not acting as an attorney in entering the contract; and that the attorney disapproval in this ease was not delivered to the plaintiffs personally, as required by the agreement, but to their attorney as well as the broker, and therefore was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The narrow legal issue before us, based on uneontested facts, is whether the \u201cthree day review\u201d period was designed to permit each party to consult with counsel and obtain legal advise with respect to the contract, therefore confirming a binding agreement once the attorneys for both parties agree to the language of the previously executed agreement, or whether the three day period was designed to permit a \u201ctimeout period\u201d, or period of reflection \u201cto accommodate a rethinking of the entire transaction,\u201d <em>see Levison, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 277, 521 A.2d 909, in which the parties can consider whether they want to go through the transaction. We are more than satisfied that the history behind the provision reflects that it was designed to give the parties an opportunity for their respective attorneys to review the form agreement, and that once the agreement is approved by the attorney, as the agent for the party, the agreement remains binding upon the client if accepted in that form by the other party. Of course, the attorney could reject the agreement under the three-day review provision, could recommend revisions to the contract, or even seek an extension of the three-day review period for a mutually agreeable time. <em>Kutzin v. Pirnie, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>500, 508-09, 591 A.2d 932 (1991). Moreover, parties can have the attorney wait to the last moment to approve the agreement, or take no position at all before the midnight hour, thereby giving the client an opportunity to reflect and reverse the decision.- But here counsel for the sellers indicated approval of the agreement in a form approved by the purchasers, and the trial judge should not have permitted defendants to withdraw from the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Under its plenary authority over the practice of law, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. VI, \u00a7 II, \u00b6 3, in 1983, the Supreme Court authorized the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>by licensed real estate brokers and sales persons of form residential real estate sales agreements and approved the consent judgment executed by retired Justice Mark A. Sullivan following a public hearing and resolution of a dispute between the New Jersey State Bar Association and the New Jersey Association of Realtors. <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 461 A.2d 1112 (1983), <em>modified, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>449, 467 A.2d 577 (1983). A reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and order makes clear that the dispute, and concern of the Court, related to the unauthorized practice of law by realtors, and the need for parties to residential real estate agreements to have the opportunity to consult with counsel about the transactions they had entered. The Court quoted at length from Justice Sullivan\u2019s opinion which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">The proposed settlement accommodates the interests of realtors and attorneys by allowing the realtor to consummate the contract phase of the transaction, with attorneys handling the actual transfer of title. Most importantly, however, it serves to protect the public interest by making the contract subject to prompt attorney review if either buyer or seller so desires. [[New <em>Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards,] </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[391] at 396[, 452 A.2d 1323 (1982)]].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">93 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 461 A.2d 1112.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In approving the settlement, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">that approval of this settlement is appropriate. The activities to be undertaken by realtors pursuant to the settlement agreement will not transgress unduly upon the practice of law. To the extent that there is an inevitable or unavoidable ovei\u2019Iap between the realty and legal professions, the public\u2019s interest is safeguarded through the settlement\u2019s attorney review provisions and the Court\u2019s continuing supervisory control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Accordingly, the Court approved the proposed Final Consent Judgment with modifications to paragraphs one and two of the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 461 A.2d 1112. As a result, the sales agreement form must contain the following language conspicuously set forth at the top of the first page, as the contract in this case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT THAT WILL BECOME FINAL WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING THIS PERIOD YOU MAY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>CHOOSE TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY WHO CAN REVIEW AND CANCEL THE CONTRACT. SEE SECTION ON ATTORNEY REVIEW FOR DETAILS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The settlement, as approved by the Supreme Court, also required that the agreement provide the following form attorney review clause, as provided in the agreement before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">1. Study by Attorney</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">The Buyer or the Seller may choose to have an attorney study this contract. If an<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> attorney is consulted, the attorney must complete his or her review of the contract within a three-day period. This contract will be legally binding at the end of this three-day period unless an attorney for the Buyer or the Seller reviews and disapproves of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 461 A.2d 1112.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">The approved settlement also required form provisions relating to \u201ccounting the [three day] time\u201d and \u201cnotice of disapproval,\u201d which paragraphs were contained in the agreement before us. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 461 A.2d 1112. Similar provisions were required for agreements relating to the leasing of residential dwelling units. <em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 461 A.2d 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">As we have said, the history of the attorney review provision makes it clear that the attorney review provision was designed to give the parties an opportunity for attorney review and consultation before a form agreement prepared by a real estate salesperson becomes enforceable. The settlement, as approved by the Supreme Court, provided a manner by which real estate brokers and salespersons could have agreements executed without being charged with the unauthorized practice of law, by permitting the parties the right and opportunity to have their attorney review, and modify or cancel, the contract before it takes effect. That being the case, it seems to us that once the attorney undertakes that review and approves the agreement, his or her client cannot escape the binding agreement unless the attorney for the other party, within the three day period, makes a change (or responsive change) which counsel does not approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>It is significant that the conspicuous language at the outset of the form agreement notes that \u201cthis is a <em>binding contract </em>that will become final in three days.\u201d (emphasis added.) It is in the public interest for members of the public to recognize that agreements they sign are binding contracts, and this agreement is no exception unless and until an attorney makes a timely cancellation, or modification which is not acceptable to the other party. The settlement, as approved by the Supreme Court and provided in the form agreement like the contract before us, permits cancellation by the attorney and only the attorney. The \u201cNotice of Disapproval\u201d paragraph expressly so provides. Hence, there is a binding agreement upon execution by both parties unless, within the three day review period, as calculated by the required \u201ccounting the time\u201d provision, the attorney cancels the agreement, or modifies it in a manner not acceptable to the other party within the three-day period, or the review period is mutually extended. <em>See Kutzin v. Pirnie, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 508-09, 591 A.2d 932 (\u201c[b]ecause neither attorney disapproved of the contract under the terms of the attorney-review provision, the contract ... was legally binding as written at the end of the three-day period, changed only in respect of the sellers\u2019 attorney holding the deposit money [which both attorneys agreed to]\u201d); <em>Carmagnola v. Hann, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 559 A.2d 478 (App.Div.1989) (Real Estate Commission\u2019s \u201cAgreement to Honor\u201d requirement violative of the approved consent judgment and intrudes upon the Supreme Court\u2019s plenary authority over the practice of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">While language in <em>Levison v. Weintraub, supra, </em>on which the trial judge relied, is supportive of the decision of the Chancery Division in this case, that decision is distinguishable. There, the issue was whether attorney review was precluded because an attorney signed the contract on behalf of the seller-estate. 215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274-75, 521 A.2d 909. In the course of our opinion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">[I]t is notable that the contract does not provide that it becomes enforceable once such approval is given [upon attorney review]. This could have been provided for, but was not. Instead, it was agreed that the contract would become binding at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>end of three days \u2018unless\u2019 disapproved within that time. This means that if attorney disapproval is registered within three days there can be no contract, regardless of prior approvals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 276-77, 521 A.2d 909.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">However, we also said that the purpose of the three day review clause \u201cis to protect parties against being bound by broker-prepared contracts without the opportunity to obtain adequate protection of their separate interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 277, 521 A.2d 909, and that the attorney could reject the agreement for any reason. Accordingly, we concluded that, although an attorney executed the agreement on behalf of the seller-estate, the seller was entitled, like any other party, to the review by an attorney which was contemplated by the three day review provision. We \u201cemphasized that our determination [was] limited to the facts recited [and] ... expressed] no opinion as to the effect of an independent agreement by the parties, with or without the advice of counsel, to be bound by the contract within the three day period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 521 A.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The trial judge in this ease concluded that after attorney review was completed here, and both attorneys had approved the agreement in a form satisfactory to the other, the sellers could still cancel the agreement because the agreement did not reduce or limit the three day period upon attorney approval. We disagree with the conclusion of the trial judge and conclude the contract became enforceable when both attorneys agreed to its form because the three-day review was designed \u201cto protect parties against being bound by broker-prepared contracts without the opportunity to obtain adequate protection of their separate interests\u201d through their own attorney. <em>Peterson v. Estate of Pursell, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 278, 771 A.2d 666 (App.Div.2001), citing <em>Carmagnola </em>u <em>Hann, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 552, 559 A.2d 478. Once a party to the agreement obtains that counsel, and his or her interests are protected by their own attorney who approves the agreement in its final form, the purpose of the \u201cthree-day review\u201d provision has been satisfied. Although the attorney can be instructed to delay a decision or communication to the last possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>moment, in case a better offer comes along or the client desires to change his or her mind, the party cannot approve an agreement through the attorney, or send a change which is acceptable to the other party, and then change its mind because a better offer is received within the three days. Stated differently, once the attorney has the opportunity to review the agreement and consult with the client, and the agreement is approved, with or without changes, the client cannot back out of the agreement, even within the three-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Finally, plaintiffs assert that the notice of disapproval was not consistent with the contract requirement. The issue was not addressed by the trial judge. In light of our conclusion, it need not be passed upon by us. We merely note that the settlement approved by the Supreme Court prescribes a form \u201cnotice of disapproval,\u201d <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 476, 461 A.2d 1112, as modified in 94 <em>N.J. </em>449, 467 A.2d 577, and its requirement of notice to the broker and the other party to the agreement must be complied with. <em>Kutzin v. Pirnie, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 507-09, 591 A.2d 932. Accordingly, as in <em>Kutzin, </em>we need not pass upon whether timely actual notice to the other party through their attorney, upon timely notice to him or her, is sufficient. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">One other matter deserves comment. Defendant Robert Chapman is a real estate sales agent. In his deposition, Chapman testified that he had \u201cno conversations\u201d with his attorney regarding the letter from the buyers\u2019 attorney \u201cor any changes made to the contract.\u201d While acknowledging that the attorney was \u201cauthorized to represent [him] in [the] transaction\u201d and \u201cto conduct attorney review of the contract,\u201d his attorney did not have \u201cspecific authority\u201d to do what he did, as opposed to \u201ca general authority to conduct attorney review.\u201d Chapman testified that he was never \u201cconsulted to determine whether the contract in its changed form was acceptable to me\u201d and that he had a problem with the acquisition in the name of a limited liability company. Chapman further asserted that the attorney did not \u201cperform [the] due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>diligence with regard to [the] buyer,\u201d as directed on a prior contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Plaintiffs subpoenaed the defendants\u2019 attorney to appear on the return date of the order to show cause, and plaintiffs asked that the attorney be permitted to testify on the question of authority. The counsel defendants retained for the litigation stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Your Honor, again, it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not a defense, first of all. I don\u2019t know what defense my adversary is referring to. We assert that Mr. Allocca acted properly by terminating within the three day period the attorney review clause, period. We also have no dispute, and it\u2019s undisputed between the parties, that both the, Mr. DeMarzo and Mr. Allocca had submitted on the second day of attorney review letters saying that they, whatever they said, they said the attorney review period is completed. They said that too, and those letters speak for themselves. There\u2019s no dispute about what they say and they were transmitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Beyond that there is no other legal defense being raised as far as authority or not. He had the authority to send the termination letter. He did not, there was some miscommunication perhaps between Mr. Chapman and Mr. Allocca, but I don\u2019t believe that really goes to the heart of the matter because the heart of the matter is how the Levison case applies here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">So whether Mr. Allocca is released [from appearing] or not, that\u2019s not for me to say, and I assume counsel may feel he needs to have him here even, perhaps he should stay here, but we will still raise our attomey/client objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">The judge excused the attorney after defendants\u2019 legal argument was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">The issue of authority was not addressed by the trial judge in his opinion. Defendants do not expressly assert the lack of authority as a grounds for sustaining the judgment, and in their reply brief plaintiffs assert the issue has been waived. We do not comment on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The judgment under review is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Chancery Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\"> We raised the issue of whether the sale to a third party occurred when the temporary restraint was vacated as part of the judgment and, if so, whether the case is moot. The parties have advised that the sale has been held in abeyance by virtue of this appeal and the cloud on title which it presents. The third party complaint against the second purchaser was dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is not moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\"> Defendants' present counsel did not represent them at the time and did not write the letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\"> The new contract was signed by the second purchaser on September 24, 2001, but not until September 25, 2001 by defendants. As the trial judge said, without any dispute before us, \"[i]n construing an identical attorney review provision, <em>Kargen v. Kerr, 248 N.J.Super. </em>91, 590 A.2d 255 (Ch.Div.1991) states that the day of delivery of the contract of sale is not included in the three-day review period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\"> We have previously held that a reason need not be given for rejection of the agreement during \"attorney review,\u201d <em>Levison v. Weintraub, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 277, 521 A.2d 909.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b84-13\"> The word \"an\u201d appears as \"any\u201d in this contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
