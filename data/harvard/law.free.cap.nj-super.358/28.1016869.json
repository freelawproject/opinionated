The loss originates from a fraudulent credit scheme conceived and carried out by Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">As a salesperson for Gentilini, Carpenter submitted fraudulent applications to Auto Lenders Acceptance Corp. (Auto Lenders) to induce it to finance car purchases to high risk customers. After several of those customers defaulted on their loans, Auto Lenders discovered the fraud and brought suit against Gentilini for participating in the fraud. Carpenter, who was Gentilini\u2019s Finance Manager, provided customers with fictitious pay stubs and completed credit applications with knowingly false information intended to improperly bolster the customer\u2019s creditworthiness. Gentilini settled that action for $215,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Gentilini brought a third-party action against its insurers under the \u201cemployee dishonesty extension\u201d of the property insurance section of its commercial coverage insurance policy, seeking a defense to Auto Lenders\u2019 suit and indemnification. The insurers declined coverage. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the motion judge granted Gentilini\u2019s motion and denied the insurers\u2019 motion. We conclude that the Law Division erred in construing the policy of insurance as providing indemnity coverage to Gentilini and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Gentilini is an automobile dealership. Pursuant to a written agreement, PNC Bank provided financing for motor vehicle installment sales contracts that Gentilini would execute with its customers. Auto Lenders agreed to finance those installment sales contracts rejected by PNC. For each approved contract, Gentilini retained the cash deposit paid by its customer and collected the financed portion of the sales price from PNC or Auto Lenders. Gentilini assigned to PNC or Auto Lenders its rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>under the customer\u2019s installment contract, including any security interest and related insurance. In the event of default by the customer, Auto Lenders was entitled to require Gentilini to repurchase, without recourse, all outstanding contracts purchased by Auto Lenders from Gentilini for the amount of the aggregate unpaid balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In June 1997, Gentilini and the Ohio Casualty Group entered into an insurance contract. The relevant policy language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">Employee Dishonesty:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">(1) You [Gentilini] may extend the insurance provided by this Coverage Form to apply to direct loss of or damage to Business Personal Property and \u201cmoney\u201d and securities\u201d resulting from dishonest acts committed by any of your employees acting alone or in collusion with other persons (except you or your partner) with the manifest intent to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">(a) Cause you to sustain loss or damage; and also</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">(b) Obtain financial benefit (other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment) for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">(i) Any employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-12\">(ii) Any other person or organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">sfc sfc ifc :fc :fc \u00edfc ifc &gt;fc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">(3) The most we will pay under this Extension for loss or damage in any one occurrence is $5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">(4) All loss or damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">(1) Caused by one or more persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-17\">(2) Involving a single act or series of related acts; is considered one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-18\">The policy defines \u201cmoney\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-19\">currency, coins, bank notes in current use and having a face value, travelers checks, register checks and money orders held for sale to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-20\">The term \u201csecurities\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-21\">all negotiable and non-negotiable instruments or contracts representing either \u201cmoney\u201d or other property. \u201cSecurities\u201d includes revenue and other stamps (whether represented by actual stamps or unused value in a meter) in current use, tokens and tickets, and evidence of debt issued in connection with credit or charge cards, which cards are not issued by you, but does not include money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-22\">The motion judge decided in favor of coverage and made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>It is undisputed that Mr. Carpenter was an employee of Gentilini Ford. This court finds that the fraudulent acts that Mr. Carpenter committed in order to obtain loans for prospective automobile purchasers were dishonest. Ohio Casualty contends that the policy was intended to protect against embezzlement or theft but the policy states \u201cdishonest acts.\u201d The policy does not define \u201cdishonest acts.\u201d This court holds that if Ohio Casualty intended \u201cdishonest acts\u201d to mean embezzlement and theft then either \u201cdishonest acts\u201d would have been defined as such or the policy would have stated embezzlement and theft rather than \u201cdishonest acts.\u201d For these reasons and the fact that the frauds undertaken by Mr. Carpenter were dishonest, this court finds that the fraud fall within the meaning of \u201cdishonest acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The motion judge further held that the loss sustained by Gentilini, as a result of the law suit brought by Auto Lenders was \u00e1 \u201cdirect loss\u201d within the meaning of the policy based on the so-called Appleman\u2019s Rule which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Where a peril specifically insured against sets other causes in motion which, in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produced the result for which recovery is sought, the insured peril is regarded as the proximate cause of the entire loss. It is not necessarily the last act in a chain of events which is, therefore, regarded as the proximate cause, but the efficient or predominant cause which sets into motion the chain of events producing the loss. An incidental peril outside the policy, contributing to the risk insured against, will not defeat recovery____In other words, it has been held that recovery may be allowed where the insured risk was the last step in the chain of causation set in motion by an uninsured peril, or <em>where the insured risk itself set into operation a chain of causation in which the last step may have been an excepted risk.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\"><em>[Franklin Packaging Co., v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 191, 408 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1979), (citing 5 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 3083 at 309-311 (1970)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Under this reasoning, the motion judge found \u201can unbroken sequence\u201d of events all leading to a recoverable loss: Carpenter\u2019s fraud against Auto Lenders precipitating in Auto Lenders\u2019 suit against Gentilini, which in turn resulted in a loss to Gentilini.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we use the same standard as the motion judge: first we decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, and if none, we then decide whether the Law Division\u2019s ruling on the law is correct. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Southern Jersey Family Med. Ctrs., Inc., v. City of Pleasantville, </em>351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 279, 798 A.2d 120 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>545, 810 A.2d 65 (2002); <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1998); <em>R. </em>4:46-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Our analysis will be guided by well-established principles of insurance law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">When examining an insurance contract, the first step is to determine whether the policy is ambiguous. If a court determines that the policy is clear and unambiguous the policy must be enforced as written. However, if the policy clause is found to be ambiguous, any ambiguities must be resolved against the insurance carrier and in accordance with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured. A policy provision is considered ambiguous if the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage. If the policy is considered ambiguous, the reviewing court should determine whether more precise language by the insurer, had such language been included in the policy, would have put the matter beyond reasonable question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\"><em>[U.S. Mineral Prods. Co., v. American Ins. Co., </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>526, 538, 792 A.2d 500 (App.Div.2002) (citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">However, the insured bears the burden of establishing that a claim is within the policy terms. <em>Cobra Prods., Inc. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 401, 722 A.2d 545 (App.Div.1998), <em>certif. denied, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>89, 733 A.2d 494 (1999). Here, the policy language unambiguously describes the type of coverage to be limited to direct loss from an act of dishonesty by an employee with the \u201cmanifest intent to cause loss or damage\u201d to the insured. However, Carpenter\u2019s criminal acts were intended to defraud Auto Lenders, not Gentilini.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Indeed, as the direct seller of the automobiles, Gentilini became the unintended beneficiary of the fraud by receiving the proceeds of the illicit sales. Such sales proceeds were not limited to the percentage of the sale\u2019s price financed by Auto Lenders. Gentilini received and kept the down payment paid by the buyers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>full credit for the amount of the loan amortized by the debtors and retained its right to institute legal action directly against the buyers, both to repossess the collateral and seek payment of the outstanding loan balance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Thus, under these undisputed facts, coverage cannot be found in Gentilini\u2019s favor. This principle was succinctly elucidated by the court in <em>F.D.I.C. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>205 <em>F.3d </em>66 (2d Cir.2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">[Bly their clear terms, the fidelity bonds require that the unfaithful employee must intend to cause the employer a loss directly and solely relating to the faithless act, classically describing embezzlement or another type of theft from the employer])] An embezzler, at one end of the continuum, necessarily intends to cause the employer the loss, since the employee\u2019s gains are directly at the employer\u2019s expense. At the other end of the continuum, not triggering fidelity coverage, is the situation where the employee\u2019s dishonesty at the expense of a third-party is intended to benefit the employer, since the employee\u2019s gain results from the employer\u2019s gain. Under such circumstances, even if the employer suffers a loss, fidelity coverage is not triggered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 72 (citations omitted).].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">We also agree with and adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Lynch Prop., Inc., v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>140 F.3d 622 (5th Cir.1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">Employee dishonesty policies insure against the risk of property loss through employee dishonesty. Liability policies, by contrast, require an insurer to discharge an obligation of the insured to a third party for some act of the insured or its employee. Although employee dishonesty policies may cover the loss of third-party property in the possession of the insured, these policies do not serve as liability insurance to protect employers against tortious acts committed against third-parties by their employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 629 (citations omitted).].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">A similar conclusion was reached by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Vons Cos., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>212 F.3d 489, 491 (9th Cir.2000); the New York Court of Appeals in <em>175 East 74th Corp. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>51 <em>N.Y.2A </em>585, 435 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>584, 416 N.E.2d 584, 593 (1980) and the Supreme Court of Iowa in <em>Cent. Nat\u2019l Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Co., of Omaha v. Ins. Co. of N. America, </em>522 <em>N.W. </em>2d 39, 42 (Iowa 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Our dissenting colleague would find Carpenter\u2019s actions to r\u00e9veal a manifest intent to harm his employer because Gentilini was contractually obligated to Auto Lenders to buy back any promissory note in default. We believe this analysis glosses over the clear pecuniary benefits derived by Gentilini from the fraudulent loans and contorts the meaning of \u201cdirect loss\u201d to make it apply to a scenario not intended by the plain wording of the contract language.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The relevant coverage language unambiguously described the insurable risk: \u201cYou may extend the insurance provided by this Coverage Form to apply to <em>direct loss </em>of or damage to Business Personal Property and \u2018money\u2019 and \u2018securities\u2019 resulting from dishonest acts committed by any of your employees ____\u201d (emphasis added). Here, the facts involve fraudulent conduct by the employee directed against a third-party. The words \u201cdirect loss\u201d must be afforded their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 595, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001). Accordingly, we decline to adopt the proximate cause analysis embodied in the Appleman\u2019s Rule. The policy involved here provides coverage to employers for losses sustained as a direct result of the illegal acts of employees, without any intervening event. To be afforded coverage, the employee\u2019s action must be directed against the employer, i.e., embezzlement, theft or destruction of business property.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In this context, payment by the insured to settle a third party claim does not constitute a direct loss triggering coverage under the policy\u2019s \u201cEmployee Dishonesty\u201d provisions. To find coverage under these circumstances would convert this direct loss policy into a third party indemnity policy. This was not the risk the insurer agreed to cover nor the coverage purchased by the insured. \u201c[I]n the absence of any ambiguity, courts \u2018should not write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 670, 730 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>1278 (1999) (quoting <em>Walker Rogge, Inc. v. Chelsea Title &amp; Guar. Co., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 562 A.2d 208 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Our dissenting colleague considers our conclusion that the trial court erred in construing this policy to provide indemnity coverage to be use of a mere \u201clabel [and not] accurate or useful.\u201d To describe a policy as providing indemnity coverage or liability coverage, however, is more than placing a \u201clabel\u201d for it defines the scope of the insured risk. In the area of insurance law, the terms \u201cthird party liability\u201d and \u201cdirect loss\u201d are not mere labels, to be discarded when their application would frustrate a desired result. These terms have well established legal significance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">[O]ne method of classifying insurance is to categorize the subject matter by the interests protected in the insurance contract which is accomplished by asking this basic question: \u2018To whom does the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay (indemnify) run?\u201d Liability insurance is customarily described and classified as third-party insurance because the liability insurer\u2019s duty to pay runs not directly to the insured but directly (on the insured\u2019s behalf) to a third-party claimant who is injured by the insured\u2019s conduct. For instance, if an insured negligently injures a person not in privity of the insurance contract, that third party has a claim usually in tort against the insured. The third party\u2019s claim is not a contract claim under the liability insurance contract. But if the third party reduces its claim to a judgment (or a settlement between the insured, insurer and third party), the insured will suffer a loss. However, the insured\u2019s loss is \u201cindirect\u201d and the third party\u2019s loss is \u201cdirect.\u201d The liability insurer reimburses (\u201cindemnifies\u201d) its insured for the insured\u2019s indirect loss, but payment in practical effect runs directly to the third-party claimant. The liability insurer essentially reimburses its insured for any liability it may have to the third party by paying the third party on the insured\u2019s behalf and benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">[1 <em>Appleman On Insurance </em>\u00a7 3.3 (Holmes ed.2d ed.1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Furthermore, none of the cases cited by the dissent used a proximate cause analysis to transform direct loss coverage into a third party indemnity policy. The facts here do not present a facial conflict between a covered risk and an exclusion provision in the policy. We are called upon here to declare the scope of coverage contracted for by the insured under the employee dishonesty provisions of the policy. The words: \u201cdirect loss of or damage to Business Personal Property and money and securities resulting from dishonest acts committed by any of your [Gentilini\u2019s] employees ... with the manifest intent to cause you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>sustain loss or damage\u201d cannot be transformed into \u201cdamages sustained as a result of a third party liability suit brought against you by the victim of your employee\u2019s dishonesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Since we have determined that the insured cannot recover payment made to settle a third-party claim under this direct loss policy, we also vacate the trial court\u2019s award of counsel fees. <em>Eagle Fire Prot. Corp. v. First Indem. of Am. Ins. Co., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>345, 364, 678 A.2d 699 (1996); <em>Giri v. Med.

Thus, the amount financed by Auto Lenders was only $16,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-13\"> Auto Lenders also assigned to Gentilini the right to receive any monetary restitution paid by Carpenter as part of any criminal sentence imposed by a court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b68-10\">WECKER, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">I respectfully dissent. I would affirm summary judgment in favor of defendant/third-party plaintiff, Gentilini Ford, Inc. (\u201cGentilini\u201d), because I agree with the motion judge that the employee dishonesty provision of the policy issued by the insurance third-party defendants (collectively \u201cOhio Casualty\u201d) covers Gentilini\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Ohio Casualty appeals a judgment in favor of Gentilini Ford in the amount of $191,206.83, representing loss suffered as a result of the dishonest acts of Gentilini\u2019s former employee, Randy Carpenter. Carpenter submitted fraudulent credit applications to his employer and to a third party, Auto Lenders, to induce that party to finance car purchases to higher risk customers. After several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of those customers defaulted on the loans, plaintiff, Auto Lenders Acceptance Corporation (\u201cAuto Lenders\u201d), discovered the fraud and brought suit against Gentilini to enforce the terms of the financing agreement governing these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The agreement governing Gentilini\u2019s obligation to Auto Lenders is central to my view of Gentilini\u2019s claim against Ohio Casualty. Auto Lenders, by assignment from PNC Bank, became a party to a \u201cRetail Paper\u201d \u201cDealer Agreement\u201d with Gentilini. Under paragraph 18(b) of that agreement, in the event of any \u201cincorrect\u201d loan application, Gentilini was obligated \u201cto repurchase the ... [loan] Contract, without recourse to [Auto Lenders], for an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the amount financed.\u201d Gentilini paid $215,000 to settle Auto Lenders\u2019 suit to enforce Gentilini\u2019s contractual repurchase obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Gentilini brought a third-party action against its insurers under the \u201cemployee dishonesty extension\u201d of the property insurance section of its commercial coverage insurance policy, seeking a defense to Auto Lenders\u2019 suit and indemnification. The insurers declined coverage. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the motion judge granted Gentilini\u2019s motion and denied the insurers\u2019 motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">The relevant policy language is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">Employee Dishonesty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">(1) You may extend the insurance provided by this Coverage Form to apply to direct loss of or damage to Business Personal Property and \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201csecurities\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> resulting from dishonest acts committed by any of your employees acting alone or in collusion with other persons (except you or your partner) with the manifest intent to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">(a) Cause you to sustain loss or damage; and also</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>(b) Obtain financial benefit (other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment) for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">(i) Any employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">(n) Any other person or organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">(3) The most we will pay under this Extension for loss or damage in any one occurrence is $5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">(4) All loss or' damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">(1) Caused by one or more persons <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-11\">(2) Involving a single act or series of related acts; is considered one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">The motion judge concluded that the policy issued to Gentilini covered Ford\u2019s damages as a \u201cdirect loss,\u201d citing the so-called \u201cAppleman\u2019s rule\u201d that where an insured risk sets in motion a series of events that lead to the final loss for which recovery is sought, the final loss is covered. The judge also ruled that each of Carpenter\u2019s twenty-seven fraudulent acts constituted a separate occurrence, allowing recovering up to the policy limit of $5,000 for each of those acts, totaling $135,000; Gentilini was entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending Auto Lenders\u2019 claims as an element of damages; and Gentilini was entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees. on its suit against Ohio Casualty. With the exception of the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, I agree. I would therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the policy in several respects.. First, I find that under the circumstances, Carpenter\u2019s conduct involved the \u201cmanifest intent\u201d to harm, not to help Gentilini. Second, I find that the loss suffered by Gentilini as a result of Randy Carpenter\u2019s undisputed, dishonest conduct, which obligated Gentilini under the terms of its contract with Auto Lenders to repurchase the fraudulently acquired notes, is a \u201cdirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>loss\u201d resulting from an insured risk. Finally, whereas the majority holds that the motion judge erred in \u201cconstruing the policy of insurance as providing indemnity coverage to Gentilini,\u201d Op. at 31, 816 A.2d at 1070, I do not find that label accurate or useful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">There is no dispute that Gentilini suffered loss as a result of employee dishonesty. Gentilini\u2019s employee, Carpenter, repeatedly instigated the submission of fraudulent loan applications by Gentilini\u2019s customers. In each case, the customer obtained a motor vehicle from Gentilini by misrepresenting his or her creditworthiness, with Carpenter\u2019s knowledge, thereby inducing both Auto Lenders and Gentilini to approve the loan and the sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gentilini would accept the customer\u2019s note; under the terms of Gentilini\u2019s agreement with Auto Lenders, Auto Lenders would advance cash in the face amount of the note to Gentilini; and Gentilini would assign the note to Auto Lenders. However, in the event the customer defaulted, or the loan application was \u201cincorrect,\u201d Gentilini was obligated to repurchase the note and pay Auto Lenders the unpaid balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that Carpenter\u2019s dishonest acts, on at least twenty-seven separate occasions over a period of eleven months, were not undertaken with the \u201cmanifest intent\u201d to harm Gentilini. The majority\u2019s suggestion that Carpenter was acting for Gentilini\u2019s benefit, presumably by helping his employer to sell cars, is untenable. I cannot see how it was to Gentilini\u2019s benefit to convey property \u2014 a motor vehicle \u2014 in exchange for a note made by one who was likely to default, leaving Gentilini responsible to Auto Lenders for the unpaid balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">An actor\u2019s intent is commonly inferred from conduct, that is, from circumstantial evidence, and rarely from direct evidence of the actor\u2019s spoken or written words. <em>E.g., State v. Siegler, 12 N.J. </em>520, 524, 97 A.2d 469 (1953); <em>Donofry v. Autotote Systems, Inc., </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 291-92, 795 A.2d 260 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The intent to injure and defraud, which is necessary to constitute a willful misapplication, does not necessarily involve any malice or ill will, but merely that general intent to injure and defraud which always arises, in contemplation of law, when one willfully or intentionally does that which is illegal and fraudulent, and which, in its necessary and natural consequences, must ipjure another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\"><em>[Roseville Trust Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, </em>91 <em>N.J.L. </em>588, 591, 103 A. 182 (E. &amp; A.1918) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The common meaning of the adjective \u201cmanifest\u201d includes \u201ccapable of being easily understood or recognized at once by the mind; not obscure, obvious.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed.1999) defines \u201cmanifest intent\u201d with a pertinent example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Manifest Intent. Intent that is apparent or obvious based on the available circumstantial evidence, even if direct evidence of intent is not available. For example, some fidelity bonds cover an employer\u2019s losses caused by an employee\u2019s dishonest or fraudulent acts committed with a manifest intent to cause a loss to the employer and to obtain a benefit for the employee. Establishing manifest intent sufficient to trigger coverage does not require direct evidence that the employee intended the employer\u2019s loss. Even if the employee did not actively want that result, but the result was substantially certain to follow from the employee\u2019s conduct, the requisite intent will be inferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The majority relies on <em>F.D.I.C. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>205 F.3d 66 (2d Cir.2000), to conclude that Carpenter did not have the required manifest intent to cause harm to Gentilini. To the contrary. After discussing cases interpreting the \u201cmanifest in.tent\u201d requirement in fidelity bonds, the court said: \u201cWe conclude that [the employee\u2019s] conduct in remaining silent when the Bank chose to lend $8 million more to [a borrower the employee knew to be dishonest] was substantially certain to cause the Bank a loss.\u201d The court concluded that such conduct evidenced the required manifest intent to trigger coverage on a fidelity bond. <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">I also conclude, contrary to the majority, that Gentilini did indeed suffer a \u201cdirect loss\u201d as a result of Carpenter\u2019s dishonest acts. The fraudulent loan applications produced at Carpenter\u2019s direction directly implicated Gentilini\u2019s contractual obligation to Auto Lenders. That obligation required Gentilini to take back the worthless paper it had assigned to Auto Lenders and to repay the money it had received from Auto Lenders (less any sums paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the maker of the note), that is, to undo each such negotiated transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The majority views Gentilini\u2019s loss as \u201c \u2018damages sustained as a result of a third party liability suit brought against [it] by the victim of [its] employee\u2019s dishonesty.\u2019\u201d Op. at 39, 816 A.2d at 1075. Largely on that basis, the majority concludes there is no coverage. However, Gentilini\u2019s liability to Auto Lenders, which resulted in the settlement of Auto Lenders\u2019 suit against Gentilini, arose not merely out of a \u201cthird party liability suit ... by the victim,\u201d but out of an unwitting breach of contract induced by Gentilini\u2019s employee\u2019s dishonesty, and required Gentilini to disgorge the benefits of that contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">I will assume for present purposes that if Auto Lenders\u2019 right to recovery against Gentilini had arisen solely out of tort theory, and that Gentilini\u2019s claim against Ohio Casualty was a claim to indemnify it for an indirect loss suffered as a result of its tort liability to a third party, Auto Lenders, it would not be a covered loss. But Auto Lenders\u2019 claim against Gentilini was grounded first in the contract between them. Carpenter\u2019s fraudulent conduct caused Gentilini to lose its rights under that contract, including the right to retain the financed portion of twenty-seven sales. Those rights constituted property, and their loss was a \u201cdirect\u201d rather than an \u201cindirect\u201d loss. Where the insured\u2019s loss can be viewed in two ways, basic principles of insurance law, instructing us to interpret coverage provisions broadly and to construe exclusions and limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tions narrowly, require that we view this loss in the manner that brings it within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>See, e.g., Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hurley, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>260, 272-74, 765 A.2d 195 (2001); <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669-71, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Because Gentilini\u2019s loss can be attributed to Auto Lenders\u2019 breach of contract claim, it is a \u201cdirect\u201d loss proximately caused by its employee\u2019s dishonesty and is therefore within the \u201cemployee dishonesty\u201d coverage of the policy. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Lynch Prop., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co., </em>140 F.3d 622 (5th Cir.1998), for the proposition that Gentilini\u2019s loss is an indirect loss resulting from its liability to Auto Lenders and not an insured direct loss, is misplaced. Here Gentilini, the insured employer, was induced to part with property (motor vehicles) based upon false representations induced by its employee. It was also induced to accept fraudulent commercial paper and then to assign that paper to Auto Lenders, resulting in loss to Gentilini. From either perspective, this was a \u201cdirect loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In holding Gentilini\u2019s resulting loss not to be \u201cdirect,\u201d the majority \u201cdeeline[s] to adopt the proximate cause analysis embodied in the Appleman\u2019s Rule.\u201d That \u201crule\u201d is set forth in 5 John Alan Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 3083 at 309-11 (1970) (\u201cAppleman\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">Where a peril specifically insured against sets other causes in motion which, in an unbroken sequence and connection between the act and final loss, produces the result for which recovery is sought, the insured peril is regarded as the proximate cause of the entire loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 309.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">In the case before us, the \u201cperil specifically insured against\u201d was \u201cdishonest acts committed by [an employee].\u201d Gentilini\u2019s \u201cfinal loss\u201d followed \u201cin an unbroken sequence and connection,\u201d and the dishonest acts \u2014 the insured peril \u2014 must be regarded as the proximate cause of the entire loss, which is therefore covered under the policy extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">I see no basis for ignoring the proximate cause analysis of Appleman\u2019s rule, an analysis which we have applied to coverage disputes in the past. <em>See Search EDP, Inc. v. American Home </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Assurance Co., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 543, 632 A.2d 286 (App.Div.1993), cer<em>tif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>466, 640 A.2d 848 (1994); <em>Stone v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 251, 511 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1986); <em>Franklin Packaging Co. v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 191, 408 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>434, 420 A.2d 340 (1980). Section 3083 of the Appleman treatise, quoted above, addresses proximate cause in the context of \u201cfire and related coverages.\u201d Nevertheless, we have previously-adopted its approach to proximate cause in another context. <em>Search EDP, supra, </em>(scope of professional errors and omissions policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">While not a conflict between policy \u201ccoverage\u201d language and express policy \u201cexclusions\u201d such as existed in <em>Search EDP, Stone, </em>and <em>Franklin, </em>cited above, the conflict here appears within the policy\u2019s coverage language itself, including its definitions and limitations. The proximate cause analysis reflected in Appleman\u2019s rule, which was followed in each of these three cases, equally applies here. As Judge Pressler said in <em>Search EDP, </em>(citing 5 Appleman, \u00a7 3083), \u201c[w]e fully subscribe ... to the proximate-cause test for resolving facial conflicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Ohio Casualty argues that Gentilini did not suffer a covered loss or damage to \u201cBusiness Personal Property [or] \u2018money\u2019 [or] \u2018securities.\u2019 \u201d Gentilini\u2019s loss arguably involved all three. In the first instance, Gentilini was caused to convey valuable property \u2014 motor vehicles \u2014 without receiving its anticipated consideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent that the policy terms are ambiguous, long-accepted principles of interpretation applicable to insurance contracts require us to construe this policy language against the drafter, in favor of the insured, and in accordance with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>See, e.g., Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669-71, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999); <em>Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>138 (1992); <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 486-87, 625 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1993); <em>Hoboken Camera Center, Inc. v. Hartford Accid. &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 226 A.2d 439 (App.Div.1967); <em>see also </em>1 <em>Holmes\u2019s Appleman on Insurance, 2d </em>\u00a7 4.23 (1996) (\u201cHolmes\u2019s Appleman)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; 2 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6.6. In <em>Hoboken Camera, </em>a fidelity bond case, Judge Conford cited \u201cthe well-established principle that in construing an insurance policy it is presumably the intention of the parties that in the event <em>of </em>loss the insured will be protected to the full extent that any fair interpretation of the contract will allow.\u201d 93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 492, 226 A.2d 439. A fair interpretation of this insurance contract protects Gentilini from this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The opinion of the court of appeals in <em>Imperial Ins., Inc., v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp., </em>442 F.2d 1197 (D.C.Cir.1970), is instructive. In that ease, the court held that an employee fidelity policy covered \u201cconsequential losses\u201d suffered by the insured, which happened to be an insurance company. Those losses took the form of liability to the plaintiff\u2019s own insureds, after the insured company\u2019s employee acted dishonestly in issuing the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The policy issued to Imperial protected against \u201closs of money, securities and other property ... through any fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any of the employees____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. The court rejected the argument that only the physical loss of \u201cmoney, securities and other property\u201d was a covered loss, and not \u201ca consequential primary loss measured by payments it made to third parties [under the insurance contracts]. <em>Ibid. </em>The court held \u201cthat it is not so clear consequential losses were not covered as to free the policy of ambiguity in this regard. The loss here was a depletion of Imperial\u2019s monetary assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198-99. The court reasoned that any doubt as to coverage was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 1199-1200. Much the same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The coverage at issue is expressly described in the policy. It is entitled \u201cEmployee Dishonesty.\u201d That coverage is defined in the first instance as loss or damage \u201cresulting from <em>dishonest acts </em>committed by any of your employees____\u201d That plain language is highly relevant both to the reasonable expectation of the insured and to the nature of the covered \u201closs or damage\u201d to \u201cBusiness Personal Property and \u2018money\u2019 and \u2018securities\u2019.... \u201d Such language cannot, in my view, mean that only theft of tangible property is covered, as the majority suggests. Theft is one of many forms of dishonesty, and \u201cdishonest acts\u201d is a more inclusive term than \u201ctheft.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, theft is a risk covered by the basic policy. If the Employee Dishonesty Extension were limited to theft, it would be a worthless addition to the insured\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Contrary to Ohio Casualty\u2019s contention, I agree with the motion judge that the twenty-seven fraudulent transactions induced by Carpenter over a period of eleven months constitute separate occurrences, each subject to a separate $5,000 limit. The common pattern of these transactions cannot fairly be said to turn them into a single event. The cases relied upon by Ohio Casualty to claim a single occurrence are entirely inapposite. <em>E.g., Doria v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 74, 509 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1986) (drowning deaths of two brothers deemed one occurrence where one had jumped in to save the other.).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Pre-judgment interest is an appropriate discretionary award in a contract action, representing loss of use of the funds otherwise due. <em>See Ellmex Constr. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 208-13, 494 A.2d 339 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>nied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>453, 511 A.2d 639 (1986). I would affirm that award as a reasonable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In light of my conclusion that it is Gentilini\u2019s loss under its contract with Auto Lenders that supports coverage here, and not a loss arising from tort liability to Auto Lenders, I do not believe Auto Lenders is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending Auto Lenders\u2019 claims. And under our traditional adherence to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d Gentilini is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in prosecuting its third-party action against Ohio Casualty. <em>See R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) and Pressler, <em>New Jersey Court Rules, </em>Comment 2.6 on <em>R. </em>4:42-9 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">I would therefore affirm the judgment respecting coverage, and remand for determination of recoverable damages consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-12\"> The policy defines \u201cmoney\u201d as \u201ccurrency, coins, bank notes in current use and having a face value, travelers checks, register checks and money orders held for sale to the public.\u201d The policy definition of \"securities\u201d includes: \"all negotiable and non-negotiable instruments or contracts representing either \"money\" or other property.\u201d There is no policy definition of \"Business Personal Property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-14\"> Obviously, any loss as a result of dishonest acts will have been caused either by one person or by more than one person.
