Hendry, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 336, 771 A.2d 701 (App.Div.2001). Where the parties to a New Jersey divorce proceeding agree in their Property Settlement Agreement that one parent will have primary residential custody of their child, that the custodial parent may move out-of-state with the child, and that jurisdiction over custody and visitation issues will remain in New Jersey, which will be deemed the child\u2019s home state, does there come a time when that consent-to-jurisdiction is no longer effective? Putting the question another way, what is the relationship between the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 to -52 (\u201cUCCJA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), and the parties\u2019 voluntary agreement respecting jurisdiction? Because we conclude that the Family Part did not give due consideration to all the statutory factors when it exercised jurisdiction over an application to change custody, we remand for a determination whether New Jersey remains the appropriate state to exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Given the nature of our society, it is not uncommon for divorced parents to live in different states, sometimes at great distances from each other, as in this case. <em>See, e.g., Baures v. Lewis, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>91, 770 A.2d 214 (2001). Thus applications to modify custody and visitation orders, which are difficult enough when all of the parties live within a single jurisdiction, become complicated by an overlay of jurisdictional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Addressing the effect and longevity of the parties\u2019 consent-to-jurisdiction agreement, we decline to impose a bright-line rule holding the agreement binding, either for a prescribed period of time or until the child\u2019s emancipation. We conclude that so long as one parent remains a New Jersey resident, as here, the other party\u2019s consent to the continuing jurisdiction of the New Jersey courts establishes the minimum basis for the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction. However, that consent is only one factor to be weighed in the decision whether to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the UCCJA. The parties cannot agree in advance to ignore the Act, or for the court to proceed contrary to the Act. The UCCJA recognizes that more than one state may have jurisdiction over custody and visitation and provides guidance for determining which state shall exercise its jurisdiction in furtherance of the Act\u2019s purposes. Those purposes include the avoidance of conflicting orders issued by the courts of different states, assuring that custody litigation takes place in the state with the \u201cclosest connection\u201d with the child and the most \u201csignificant evidence,\u201d and most importantly, where the best interest of the child can be served. The Act aims to limit controversy in the interest of protecting a stable home environment and secure family relationships. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>A second issue dramatized by this case is the necessity for plenary proceedings and detailed findings by a Family Part judge before ordering a change in custody. We conclude that the Family Part judge clearly erred in summarily changing primary physical custody of this eight-year-old child from his mother, with whom he had been living in Oklahoma for the last seven of his eight years, to his father in New Jersey. Were it not for the passage of time since the August 2001 order enjoining this child\u2019s return to his mother in Oklahoma, at the end of his regular, eight-week summer visit in New Jersey, we would order an immediate return to the status quo ante. Because the child has now been living with his father in New Jersey since the summer of 2001, we remand instead for further proceedings, as we shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Certain facts and procedural history are undisputed. The parties were married and divorced twice. Their son Kevin, born November 20, 1992, is the only child of their second marriage to each other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their second judgment of divorce, entered in 1993 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>when Kevin was just one year old, incorporated a property settlement agreement (\u201cthe agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under that agreement, the parties were to share \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d of Kevin, with plaintiff to have \u201cprimary residential custody\u201d for the first twelve months, \u201cpending an evaluation by the court____\u201d Plaintiff was permitted to move with Kevin to Oklahoma, where she had been raised and where her parents still lived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apparently in consideration of defendant\u2019s consent to Kevin\u2019s move to Oklahoma, plaintiff agreed to a list of conditions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">a. The State of New Jersey shall retain jurisdiction over the minor, KEVIN PEREGOY, and shall constitute the \u201chome\u201d state in accord with the Uniform Child Custody and Jurisdiction Act as adopted by the State of New Jersey;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">b. Within a period of one (1) year, the Court shall review the nature of the joint custodial relationship between the parties, anticipatory changes in the child, consistent with such variables as age, academic and vocational settings and differences; the nature of the home component; together with an examination of the success or lack thereof of the custodial access arrangement; including, but not limited to, addressing the problems, if any, in the compliance by BARBARA PEREGOY of the custodial access____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Among the detailed provisions of the agreement relating to custody and visitation, Kevin was to spend a minimum of twelve weeks each year with defendant, Matthew Peregoy, including a block of eight weeks during each summer, up to two weeks each at winter and spring breaks, and at other mutually agreed upon times.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The agreement also contemplated that if plaintiff were to find herself \u201cunable to economically and physically care\u201d for Kevin, the parties could \u201cdiscuss a change of Kevin\u2019s primary residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>custody\u201d and enter into a written agreement with respect to such a change without \u201capplication to a court of competent jurisdiction for a change of custody.\u201d The agreement repeated that in any event, the Family Part of the New Jersey Superior Court \u201cshall review the custodial arrangement within a period of one (1) year.\u201d No such review took place, and neither party invoked the one-year review or initiated any other court action until defendant\u2019s application by Order to Show Cause near the end of Kevin\u2019s summer stay in New Jersey in August 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">With respect to child support, the agreement provided that defendant was to pay fifty-five dollars per week to plaintiff, to be suspended during the eight weeks Kevin spent with defendant each summer. Defendant was also to be responsible for all of the travel expenses associated with his visits to Kevin in Oklahoma and Kevin\u2019s stays in New Jersey, up to $1,875 per year, with a potential adjustment to child support in the event travel expenses exceeded that amount in any year.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Immediately after the divorce, plaintiff, Barbara Peregoy, moved to Oklahoma with Kevin, where she has remained and where Kevin remained a resident until the summer of 2001. In Oklahoma, Kevin lived with plaintiff and his half-brother, the child of his mother\u2019s first marriage, who was twenty years old in 2001. Kevin\u2019s maternal grandparents lived across the street. Plaintiff was employed as a nurse in a local hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">After plaintiffs relocation to Oklahoma, Kevin returned to New Jersey to spend eight weeks each summer with his father; he also spent vacations at Christmas and Easter with his father in New Jersey. Defendant operated a financial consulting business out of his home. In 2001, Kevin spent the summer with his father as usual. Kevin was then eight-and-one-half years old, and he was due back in Oklahoma on August 17 to begin school.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">On August 6, 2001, defendant obtained an <em>ex parte </em>Order to Show Cause in the Family Part, temporarily enjoining Kevin\u2019s return to his mother in Oklahoma and temporarily ordering sole custody of Kevin to defendant. In support of his application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the order to show cause, defendant submitted a letter from a psychologist, Dr. Monty N. Weinstein,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as his own certification. Dr. Weinstein described having consulted with defendant \u201cfor over ten hours\u201d and having observed defendant with Kevin \u201cfor several hours.\u201d He restated defendant\u2019s version of Kevin\u2019s experiences both with plaintiff and with defendant; reported that Kevin had expressed to him \u201cthat he wishes to remain in New Jersey with his father and yet still see his mother\u201d; described defendant in highly complimentary terms; and concluded that defendant \u201chas all the qualities to assume custody,\u201d and that \u201cit is in the best interest of Kevin Peregoy to have an ongoing relationship with his father which is not happening now due to the fact that the mother is living in Oklahoma.\u201d The order referred to the <em>possibility </em>of irreparable harm or damage to Kevin if he was returned to his mother\u2019s care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The order was premised expressly upon defendant\u2019s certification alleging that Kevin was afraid to return to his mother in Oklahoma, that Kevin had expressed feelings of anxiety about his mother\u2019s likely retribution for his wanting to stay with his father, and that plaintiff failed to take Kevin to a dentist or an eye exam, as well as a finding, before plaintiff had an opportunity to respond, that her \u201cability to continue emotional and psychological abuse [if Kevin is returned to her] combined with a generally combative nature is grounds for Kevin\u2019s fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The order required plaintiff to show cause on August 13, 2001 why its terms should not be continued pending a-custody investigation. In her certification in response, opposing jurisdiction in New Jersey and opposing any change in custody, plaintiff denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>all of defendant\u2019s allegations and described Kevin\u2019s life with her and with his brother and grandparents in Oklahoma. She described his success in school and involvement in soccer, as well as his medical care. In response to defendant\u2019s certification alleging that her older son was a bad influence because he wanted to be a spy, plaintiff explained that he hoped to join the FBI or CIA. At argument on August 13, 2001, plaintiff was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Defendant appeared pro se, but was accompanied by an individual who identified himself as James Wilks, \u201can advocate with the National Association of Fathers.\u201d That individual was not permitted to remain at counsel table with defendant. The Family Part judge referred to an interview with Kevin by Eve Holt, a social worker with the Ocean County Probation Department. The judge provided defendant and plaintiffs counsel with a one-page \u201cInterOffice Note\u201d he received from Ms. Holt, dated August 9, 2001. In that note Ms. Holt reported that she had interviewed Kevin and recommended \u201cthe child remain here in New Jersey pending the completion of the investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Plaintiffs counsel argued on August 13 that \u201c[t]he most logical reading\u201d of the parties\u2019 consent-to-jurisdiction clause is that it was intended to allow the parties to return to court in New Jersey for the one-year review of the custody arrangement, as provided under the property settlement agreement. Counsel argued that the parties had waived that review, and therefore the consent-to-jurisdiction no longer applied. He argued that Oklahoma was now the child\u2019s home state, and as the jurisdiction with more contacts and information relevant to a custody determination, Oklahoma was also the more convenient and appropriate forum, citing <em>Ivaldi v. Ivaldi, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>190, 685 A.2d 1319 (1996). Counsel also argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that there were no grounds for interfering with Kevin\u2019s return to his mother in Oklahoma as scheduled, in time for the first day of school on Friday, August 17. The judge rejected those arguments, continued temporary restraints upon Kevin\u2019s return to Oklahoma, and reserved further decision until the following Monday, August 20,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">After further argument on August 20, the judge made this determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">THE COURT: I find that New Jersey has jurisdiction. I find that the child was born here, this was a bargained-for aspect as part of Mrs. Peregoy leaving for Oklahoma and this Com\u00ed has jurisdiction of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">7 <em>admit that it might not be very convenient to be holding this evaluation here but it certainly is something that, apparently, Mr. Peregoy bargained for and should have. </em>So we\u2019re going to continue the examination for child custody. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The judge continued the restraints upon Kevin\u2019s return to his mother in Oklahoma pending completion of a full custody investigation, to be undertaken by the county probation department in New Jersey. The judge also imposed, sua sponte, visitation for plaintiff in New Jersey only, to be supervised by defendant\u2019s mother, who lived in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On August 30, 2001, plaintiffs application for emergent relief and for leave to appeal the August 20 order were denied by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">On August 17, while the Order to Show Cause was pending, defendant filed a motion for retroactive relief on his child support obligation and related tax issues. On September 27, 2001, plaintiff filed a cross-motion in the Family Part to set aside the existing orders, to return custody to her, in the alternative to allow Kevin to return to Oklahoma for holiday visits, and for related relief. For reasons we cannot determine from the record, those motions were heard before a different Family Part judge. On October 5, 2001, the second judge denied plaintiffs motions, including her request for an <em>in camera </em>interview with Kevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">On November 9, 2001, defendant filed a motion to establish his right to child support from plaintiff in the amount of eighty-five dollars per week, to compel plaintiff to provide life and health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>insurance for the benefit of Kevin, and to relieve defendant of further child support obligations to plaintiff. By cross-motion, plaintiff sought relief on various financial and visitation issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Oral argument on those motions was heard on January 11, 2002 by the second judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge declined to consider a Home Study completed by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, telling plaintiffs counsel \u201cI understand that you submitted late a copy of an Oklahoma review.\u201d Without the full custody investigation promised on August 20, 2001 by the judge who entered the order to show cause,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> without an evidentiary hearing respecting defendant\u2019s application to change custody, and without findings respecting the best interests of the child, the judge ordered sole custody to remain in defendant. The order provided for reasonable and frequent visitation for plaintiff on one month\u2019s written notice. The parties were ordered to share equally the costs of visitation, including travel expenses, and plaintiff was ordered to pay ninety-one dollars per week in child support. At least as of the filing of briefs on this appeal, Kevin apparently had not been back to Oklahoma. The record does not reveal the nature or extent of his visitation with plaintiff since August 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Restating plaintiffs arguments on appeal, she contends through counsel that (1) the consent-to-jurisdiction provision of the agreement is void; (2) Oklahoma is the state with jurisdiction and the more appropriate forum; (3) defendant\u2019s initial application for emergent relief did not set forth a prima facie case of changed circumstances to warrant the Family Part in entertaining further proceedings to change custody; (4) the court erred in granting injunctive relief barring Kevin\u2019s return to his mother\u2019s custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and to his home with her in Oklahoma; (5) the court erred in considering the reports of Dr. Weinstein and Ms. Holt without hearing their testimony and thus without giving plaintiff the opportunity to cross-examine each of them; (6) the decision to change custody of Kevin permanently to defendant without a plenary hearing, without interviewing Kevin, and without making any findings of fact to support that decision was arbitrary and capricious; and (7) the determination of child support due from plaintiff to defendant in light of the change in custody, but without adherence to the Child Support Guidelines, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Defendant, who is representing himself on this appeal, essentially argues that the orders appealed from should be affirmed. The legal argument in his brief consists of criticizing plaintiffs procedural history and restating and elaborating upon the allegations contained in his certifications filed in the Family Part.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Plaintiffs contention that the agreement is void with respect to jurisdiction is without merit and does not warrant extended discussion in this opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(l)(E). Suffice it to say that plaintiff does not allege that defendant engaged in any impropriety in obtaining her consent to that agreement. <em>See Hendry v. Hendry, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334, 771 A.2d 701. Nevertheless, the scope of that agreement is open to question, as reflected in plaintiffs argument on the Order to Show Cause. We will address plaintiffs remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The language of the agreement itself supports plaintiffs contention that the parties did not agree that New Jersey would retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>jurisdiction for all time. First, the agreement provided that New Jersey \u201cshall retain jurisdiction and shall constitute the \u2018home\u2019 state <em>in accordance with </em>the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act....\u201d (Emphasis added). The agreement thus expressly incorporates the Act\u2019s definition of \u201chome state\u201d and implies an intention for the court to act \u201cin accordance with\u201d the UCCJA. Under the UCCJA as enacted in New Jersey, the home state is the state where the child has lived \u201cfor at least six consecutive months\u201d proceeding the action. Unquestionably, Oklahoma was Kevin\u2019s home state in August 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Second, in providing for the possibility that the parties might agree to a change in the custodial agreement in the future, and in further providing that they could do so by \u201ca written letter executed by both,\u201d their agreement said: \u201c[I]t is not necessary for an application [to be made] to a court of competent jurisdiction for a change of custody[J\u201d Reference to \u201ca court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d and not simply to the Superior Court of New Jersey, suggests that the parties contemplated another court having jurisdiction in the future, and that their 1993 consent to jurisdiction was intended to apply only to the one-year review. The first judge rejected that argument out of hand. Plaintiffs interpretation, if not controlling on its face, at least evidenced an ambiguity that should have prompted further consideration and perhaps an evidentiary hearing before defendant\u2019s interpretation was adopted and before the court held that the agreement controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">A forum selection or consent-to-jurisdiction clause respecting custody and visitation can be effective. <em>See, e.g., Hendry, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 771 A.2d 701, <em>Bless v. Bless, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 723 A.2d 67 (App.Div.1998); <em>G.C. v. M.Y., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 367, 370, 651 A.2d 110 (App.Div.1995). <em>See also Ivaldi v. Ivaldi, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>190, 685 A.2d 1319 (1996). To say that the agreement can be effective, however, is not to say that it is effective for all time or that it controls if it is inconsistent with the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>These are the facts in <em>Hendry. </em>The child had lived in New Jersey with both his parents until their separation, and in total until he was almost seven years old. In a property settlement agreement incident to their divorce, the parents agreed that the mother could move with the child to North Carolina, and New Jersey would \u201cirrevocably\u201d retain jurisdiction over all issues relating to their child. The father subsequently moved to New York. He also had a second home in North Carolina, not far from where the mother and child were living. When the mother initiated a court proceeding in North Carolina to modify visitation, the father brought a motion in New Jersey to enforce litigant\u2019s rights and to change primary residential custody to him. The North Carolina judge conferred with the Family Part judge in New Jersey, consistent with the UCCJA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Upon learning of the consent-to-jurisdiction agreement, the North Carolina judge declined jurisdiction. In affirming the New Jersey Family Part judge\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction, we said that after taking into account the circumstances and language of the parties\u2019 agreement, \u201cNew Jersey becomes a more appropriate forum than North Carolina, <em>at this time.\u201d </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334, 771 A.2d 701 (emphasis added). We noted that the child had only lived outside New Jersey for approximately three years, and we said: \u201c[w]e specifically do not rule on the longevity of the \u2018irrevocability\u2019 of the consent-to-jurisdiction agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 771 A.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In <em>Bless, </em>the parties modified their New Jersey divorce judgment with a consent order changing their child\u2019s primary residential custody to the father, who had relocated to Switzerland. The consent order provided that \u201ccustody and visitation shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of New Jersey.\u201d 318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 95, 723 A.2d 67. A dispute arose over the mother\u2019s several requests that the father return the child to her in New Jersey. The Family Part judge initially issued orders extending the child\u2019s summer visitation with his mother, but later concluded that New Jersey no longer had jurisdiction, and that Switzerland had obtained exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>sive jurisdiction because Switzerland had become the child\u2019s home state under the Hague Convention. We reversed, holding that as the child\u2019s original home state, New Jersey retained jurisdiction both under the UCCJA\u2019s \u201csignificant connection\u201d test, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31(a)(2), and because the consent-to-jurisdiction clause of the parties\u2019 agreement was enforceable. At the time, the child had lived in Switzerland with his father for less than one full school year, and the mother resisted returning him to Switzerland during his summer visitation in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In <em>G.C., </em>the consent-to-jurisdiction provision in a post-judgment custody agreement was one of several alternate grounds we cited for affirming a decision that New Jersey retained jurisdiction, despite the fact that the children by that time had lived for one year with their father in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In <em>Ivaldi, </em>the parties\u2019 separation agreement contemplated the mother\u2019s move to Morocco with the child while the father remained in New Jersey, the family\u2019s home for several years. The agreement provided for New Jersey law to apply to any future dispute; it did not include a choice of forum. The mother initiated a divorce and custody proceeding in Morocco within three months of moving there with the child. The father immediately filed an action in New Jersey, and each parent contested jurisdiction in the other forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In reviewing this court\u2019s decision deferring jurisdiction to Morocco on grounds of international comity without deciding whether New Jersey had jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held that the UCCJA applied to an international as well as an interstate custody dispute, and that both New Jersey and Morocco had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Ivaldi, 147 N.J. </em>at 202 204, 685 <em>A.2d 1319. </em>The Court remanded the matter to the Family Part \u201cto determine whether Morocco or New Jersey provides the more convenient forum.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 204, 685 A.2d 1319. The Court cited <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35(c), the provision of the UCCJA which provides that a court should \u201cconsider if it is in the interests of the child that another state assume jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 685 A.2d 1319. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The Court\u2019s finding of concurrent jurisdiction in <em>Ivaldi </em>informs our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">' The theme we discern from these eases, and apply now, is that a three-step analysis is required when jurisdiction over custody or visitation, or the exercise of such jurisdiction, is disputed in a New Jersey court in the face of a prior agreement consenting to jurisdiction. The first step is to determine whether a valid (that is, a knowingly bargained-for and agreed-upon) consent-to-jurisdiction clause is part of the parties\u2019 agreement respecting custody and visitation. <em>See Hendry, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 334, 771 A.2d 701. The second step is to determine whether any other state has acquired subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to . the UCCJA or other applicable law, such as the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A (PKPA).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The existence of an agreement to continuing jurisdiction in New Jersey does not preclude acquisition of concurrent jurisdiction in another state, consistent with the UCCJA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Finally, in the event that the court finds concurrent jurisdiction in two states, the third step is to determine which is the more appropriate state to exercise its jurisdiction in the child\u2019s best interest. We now hold that in determining which of two potential forum states should exercise jurisdiction, the parties\u2019 agreement is not necessarily controlling; rather, it is one of several factors to be considered within the framework of the UCCJA. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-35(e)(4), listing as a factor in determining which state is the more convenient forum, \u201c[i]f the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>have agreed on another forum which is no less appropriate.\u201d The weight to be given to the parties\u2019 consent to jurisdiction depends upon a number of factors, including the time elapsed since the child left the state, the strength of the child\u2019s connections to this state compared to another state, and the place where the most evidence relevant to the child\u2019s best interest, including witnesses, is available. <em>See Ivaldi </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 204-05, 685 A.2d 1319. The choice of forum requires the court to consider \u201cif it is in the interest of the child that another state assume jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Returning to a consideration of the scope of our decision in <em>Hendry, </em>we note that this case arises in a somewhat different procedural posture. Whether or not the North Carolina judge in <em>Hendry </em>should have deferred the exercise of jurisdiction to New Jersey, that deferral alone established good reason for a New Jersey court to honor the parties\u2019 agreement and to exercise jurisdiction. In this case, there was no court action pending in Oklahoma when defendant sought an Order to Show Cause in a New Jersey court. Had there been a decision by an Oklahoma court to defer to New Jersey\u2019s jurisdiction, such as that of the North Carolina judge in <em>Hendry, </em>or a conference with an Oklahoma judge who expressed an intention to decline jurisdiction, that circumstance would have been entitled to great weight. Obviously, a pending action in another state warrants consultation between the two courts. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35d. Nonetheless, the lack of a pending action in the other state hardly signified that New Jersey must or should exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Furthermore, we see nothing in the record or the law to suggest that Oklahoma law or procedure in regard to custody matters is inconsistent with the principles of New Jersey law. Oklahoma\u2019s enactment of the UCCJA, formerly 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 501-527, was repealed and replaced by enactment of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 551-101 to -402, effective November 1,1998 (\u201cUCCJEA\u201d). <em>See also </em>9 <em>Uniform Laws Annotated </em>657 (1999) (\u201cULA\u201d); <em>Ivaldi </em>147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>N.J. </em>190, 202-03, 685 A.2d 1319.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Oklahoma adopted the UCCJEA effective November 1, 1998, to replace the UCCJA. The significant difference potentially applicable to this case is that the UCCJEA, consistent with the PKPA, grants \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d to the state where an initial custody order has been entered, until the child no longer has \u201ca significant connection\u201d and \u201csubstantial evidence is no longer available\u201d in the original state, or when neither the child nor a parent resides in that state. It appears that an Oklahoma court would find that it has jurisdiction to modify 1993 New Jersey custody order only if New Jersey finds either that it no longer has continuing jurisdiction or that Oklahoma would be a more convenient forum to hear an application to modify custody or visitation. 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 551-203.1 Oklahoma\u2019s enactment of the UCCJEA includes a provision for \u201ctemporary emergency jurisdiction\u201d where a child is deemed to require emergent protection. 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 551-207. Where the potential jurisdiction of two states is involved, the courts are to confer, on the record, and may give the parties an opportunity to participate in that conference. 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 551-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In fact, when Eve Holt wrote to the Oklahoma Department of Human Services on November 19, 2001,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> seeking its assistance in obtaining a home study and custody evaluation, a detailed report was forthcoming within six weeks. The State of Oklahoma Parent Home Study apparently was completed on December 31, 2001. That is the report the second judge refused to consider. It reflects interviews and a home visit with Barbara Peregoy and with Kevin\u2019s then twenty-year-old half-brother, Christopher Hall. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The study also reflects an appropriate home and parenting situation with Mrs. Peregoy in Lawton, Oklahoma.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Although we have not undertaken an exhaustive study of the other forty-nine states, our research has revealed decisions in four states, Illinois, Georgia, Maryland, and Missouri, that address the effect of a consent-to-jurisdiction provision in light of the UCCJA, on facts similar to those before us. One court finds the agreement controlling; one finds the agreement null and void; a third finds the agreement \u201cnot controlling;\u201d and the fourth decides the case under the UCCJA without reference to the agreement. To the extent that there is a unifying element in those cases, it is that all four state courts purport to act in accordance with the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In <em>In re Marriage of Hilliard, </em>178 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>620, 127 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>671, 533 N.E.2d 543 (1989), the mother and children had lived in California by agreement for two years. The Illinois court enforced the parties\u2019 Illinois settlement agreement, which provided that post-judgment proceedings would be filed only in Illinois, and affirmed denial of the mother\u2019s motion to transfer jurisdiction to California on grounds of an inconvenient forum. In the alternative, the court concluded that the trial court had discretion to exercise its \u201ccontinuing\u201d jurisdiction pursuant to the UCCJA, irrespective of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46. <em>But see In re Marriage of Bueche, </em>193 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>594, 140 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>566, 550 N.E.2d 48 (1990), holding that the UCCJA did not require Illinois to defer the exercise of jurisdiction to Michigan, despite a Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>gan decree providing for Michigan to retain jurisdiction. The court remanded to determine whether the child had lived in Illinois for six months, in which case a determination of the more convenient forum would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Gouse v. Wilson, </em>207 <em>Ga.App. </em>574, 428 <em>S.E.2d </em>571 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>263 <em>Ga. </em>887, 441 S.E.2d 57 (1994), the Georgia appeals court refused to enforce a provision of an Ohio divorce judgment, in which the parties stipulated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoj\">[Ohio] shall always retain exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the minor children ----[and that] Ohio shall ... always remain the home state ... and neither party shall attempt to initiate any actions under the UCCJA ... notwithstanding [the children\u2019s residence in] Georgia or any other jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">When the mother sought to modify the custody and visitation provisions of the Ohio decree in Georgia, after having lived in Georgia for several years, the father obtained an order in Ohio declaring the mother in contempt for filing the Georgia action.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The Georgia trial court dismissed the mother\u2019s action, and the appellate court reversed, holding that \u201c[s]uch provision is a nullity even though it is based on the agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573. The court reasoned that \u201ca decree which attempts to retain jurisdiction of custody matters contravenes the letter and the spirit of the UCCJA\u201d and held that jurisdiction to modify a child custody order would be determined solely under the UCCJA. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">A Maryland intermediate appellate court likewise refused to enforce a consent-to-jurisdietion and forum selection agreement, concluding that under the UCCJA, Maryland had jurisdiction to modify a Rhode Island custody order because Maryland had become the home state of the children. <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>64 <em>Md.App. </em>154, 494 A.2d 737 (1985). In <em>Olson, </em>the parties were divorced in Rhode Island in 1979, and the children moved with their father to Maryland. When the mother refused to return the children after visitation in the summer of 1984, the father brought an action in Maryland to modify the Rhode Island decree. The trial court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, based on the parties\u2019 divorce agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The Maryland appellate court reversed, holding that the agreement \u201cthat Rhode Island \u2018shall continue to retain jurisdiction\u2019 is not controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739. The court held that the issue \u201cis governed by Maryland\u2019s UCCJA,\u201d that Rhode Island had lost jurisdiction because the children no longer had significant connection with that state, that Maryland had become the children\u2019s home state under the UCCJA, and that the home state \u201c[a]s a general rule should be the jurisdiction to hear and determine custody issues\u201d unless precluded by some other provision of the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Love v. Love, </em>75 S.W.3d 747 (Mo.Ct.App.2002), the parties\u2019 1996 post-judgment \u201cParenting Agreement\u201d provided for the child to live most of the next two years in Missouri with his father and most of the following two years in Florida with his mother. When the parties could not agree on a continuing arrangement in 2000, each filed an application in a Missouri court. The mother sought \u201ctransfer\u201d to a Florida court. The trial court found that Missouri remained the child\u2019s home-state under the UCCJA because the parties had contemplated his stay in Florida to be temporary. The appellate court affirmed. Neither court invoked the \u201cForum Selection Clause\u201d of the Agreement as the basis for finding jurisdiction in Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In this case, we find that the Family Part judges who addressed the dispute over Kevin\u2019s custody mistakenly exercised their discretion by failing to consider that Kevin\u2019s home state in August 2001 under the UCCJA was Oklahoma. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-30e. Thus under New Jersey law, Oklahoma had jurisdiction to modify the New Jersey custody order. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31a(l). Arguably, New Jersey also had jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-31a(2), and the New Jersey court therefore was required to decide whether it was an inconvenient forum. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35. It would have been appropriate for a New Jersey judge to contact an Oklahoma family court judge with the aim of conferring, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>accordance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-35(d) and 43 <em>Okla. Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 551-110, to determine which state should exercise jurisdiction. <em>Compare, e.g., D.B. v. R.B., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 408, 652 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1995) (where the New Jersey trial judge conferred with the Virginia judge before whom custody proceedings were pending, we found no abuse of discretion in the decision to defer to Virginia\u2019s jurisdiction). The record strongly suggests, although we do not decide, that when this matter first arose in August 2001, Oklahoma had the more significant, more recent, and more substantial connections with Kevin than did New Jersey. Those circumstances should have been considered along with the parties\u2019 seven-year-old consent-to-jurisdiction agreement before a New Jersey court determined to proceed on the merits. As we have previously recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[T]he rationale for the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the UCCJA appears in <em>Ivaldi, ... </em>holding that the Act applies to an international child custody dispute and remanding that case to the trial court to determine whether New Jersey or Morocco provides a more appropriate forum. In so ruling, the Supreme Court described \u201cthe central policy of the Act\u2019s jurisdictional provisions ... to assure that custody litigation occurs in the place where the child and his or her family have the closest connection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\"><em>[Ganz v. Rust, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 335, 690 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>Ivaldi </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 685 A.2d 1319.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We now address the substantive decisions under review: first, the decision to enjoin Kevin\u2019s return to his mother in August 2001, and second, the decision to change primary physical custody to his father in January 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">When one parent seeks emergent relief on the ground that the child will be endangered by return to the custody of the other parent, whether in or outside the state, the court finds itself on the proverbial horns of a dilemma, a dilemma which requires the most thoughtful exercise of discretion. On one hand, the court must be mindful of the possibility of exaggeration (not to say bad faith) on the part of the petitioner. On the other hand, the court\u2019s first priority must be to protect the child. In addition, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>keep in mind that a temporary decision to change custody can take on a life of its own, creating a new status quo. Nominally temporary orders involving the custody of a child have a tendency to become permanent, first de facto and then de jure, because a child\u2019s interest in stability can be difficult to balance against a parent\u2019s legal rights. The child\u2019s \u201chome-state\u201d by law changes after six months, and new connections and evidence deyelop. The overriding fact is that the child\u2019s life goes on. He is not property to be handed back and forth each time an order is sought or appealed. Because the judge\u2019s immediate decision in response to an application for emergent relief is necessarily discretionary, we exercise great restraint in interfering, as long as there is a rational basis in the record for the relief granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s initial showing, as indicated on its face by the first judge\u2019s order, did not establish sufficient grounds for an immediate though nominally temporary change in custody, enjoining his return to his mother, his home, and his school. Concerns that \u201cmay\u201d lead to irreparable harm are not enough. <em>See Crowe v. De Gioia, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>126, 132-34, 447 A.2d 173 (1982). This was especially so where plaintiff had a seven-year history of compliance with the parties\u2019 agreement by sending the child to New Jersey each summer and at Christmas and Easter holiday weeks, and where plaintiff was subject to the enforcement jurisdiction of another state\u2019s court operating under laws consistent with the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Under the standard required to establish the right to injunctive relief as set forth in <em>Crowe, </em>and long applied by New Jersey courts, it was defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate that (1) irreparable harm was likely if relief were denied, (2) the applicable law was well-settled, (3) the material facts were not substantially disputed and petitioner was likely to succeed on the merits, and (4) the hardship on plaintiff (and the child) did not outweigh the benefit to defendant (and the child). Defendant did not present any direct evidence that his contentions about plaintiff or Kevin\u2019s life with plaintiff and his half-brother in Oklahoma were true. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Defendant offered little or no independent evidence of the facts concerning Kevin\u2019s life with his mother in Oklahoma, other than his own opinions and speculation. <em>Compare Marcrum v. Marcrum, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 363, 437 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1981) (\u201c[a]nnexed to the verified complaint were two reports of psychological evaluations and a hospital \u25a0 record detailing the wife\u2019s alleged alcoholic problem.\u201d), <em>certif. granted, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>402, 446 A.2d 136, <em>and appeal dismissed, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>232, 460 A.2d 645 (1982). In <em>Marcrum, </em>based on such evidence, Judge (now Justice) Coleman wrote for this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">We are satisfied that when children are residing in New Jersey with a parent for a significant period of time, and that parent alleges that the children will be mistreated and irreparably harmed if they are returned to the nonresident parent, New Jersey has and should exercise jurisdiction and conduct a plenary hearing to determine the merits of such allegations. The polestar in such cases is, as it should be, the best interest of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[Id. at 365, 437 A.2d 725.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">By contrast, defendant\u2019s certification in support of injunctive relief in this case consisted of conclusory allegations with little evidentiary support. <em>Compare Dorfman v. Dorfman, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 517-18, 719 A.2d 178 (App.Div.1998) (where we noted that the child\u2019s problems with a shared parenting arrangement had been well documented and therefore warranted at least \u201can investigation of the problem.\u201d). In light of defendant\u2019s allegation of statistical evidence purporting to show \u201cthe high percentage of ... anti-social behavior by juveniles living in single-mother households,\u201d and his contention that those statistics supported a change in custody (to the father\u2019s single-parent household), defendant\u2019s allegations respecting Kevin\u2019s life with his mother might have warranted some degree of skepticism by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The timing of defendant\u2019s application by Order to Show Cause, as plaintiffs attorney pointed out at the first argument on August 13, also suggested a closer look. The attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">Mr. Peregoy \u2014 according to his papers it would seem that these concerns were present at the beginning of the summer and he could have started this application at the beginning of the summer. He waited until a week before the child was due to be returned to school, Judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>____[I]f there was genuine concern, the application would have been brought much sooner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In the seven years that Kevin had lived with his mother in Oklahoma, spending summers and periodic weeks with his father in New Jersey, defendant never sought the intervention of the courts in any aspect of Kevin\u2019s custody. Nor had he sought the assistance of any child welfare agency in New Jersey or Oklahoma with respect to Kevin\u2019s well-being. That seven-year history does not appear to have received consideration either in the entry of the order to show cause or in continuing the injunction on the return date.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Among defendant\u2019s allegations, repeated by Dr. Weinstein, were that plaintiffs physical custody of Kevin during most of the year interfered with defendant\u2019s relationship with Kevin. Clearly that was not a proper factor in the decision to issue injunctive relief. Defendant had agreed to plaintiff moving with Kevin to Oklahoma seven years earlier and had lived with that arrangement without any record of objection for seven years. Moreover, we can assume that any reversal of the custody and visitation arrangement would similarly affect plaintiffs relationship with Kevin. That is the nature of a two-state parenting arrangement. <em>See generally, Baures v. Lewis, 167 N.J. </em>91, 770 A.2d 214 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Subsumed in the determination that defendant\u2019s allegations met his burden under <em>Crowe </em>for injunctive relief, was a determination that he presented a prima face case of changed circumstances, which in turn triggered a full custody investigation. <em>See M.P. v. S.P., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>425, 431, 404 A.2d 1256 (App.Div.1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">Since the conditions which would satisfy the best interests of a child during all of its minority cannot be conclusively determined in a single decree, custody orders are always held to be modifiable upon a showing of changed circumstances that would affect the welfare of the child. The party seeking the modification bears the burden of showing sufficient changed circumstances so as to require modification. In assessing a claim of changed circumstances deference is given to the length and stability of the ejdsting custody relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">We do not fault the first judge\u2019s discretionary decision to initiate a custody investigation, although as noted, defendant\u2019s prima facie case was suspect. However, such an investigation could surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>have been conducted under the auspices of an Oklahoma court. Moreover, we see no evidence that a full custody investigation ever took place in New Jersey, as required by <em>R. </em>5:8-1. In any event, we cannot condone the second judge\u2019s decision to change Kevin\u2019s residential custody from his mother to his father on a permanent basis without the benefit of a plenary hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Mackowski v. Mackowski, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 721 A.2d 12 (App.Div.1998); <em>G.C. v. M.Y., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 367, 651 A.2d 110; <em>Luedtke v. Shobert, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 776 A.2d 233 (App.Div.2001). Our courts have repeatedly held that so drastic a decision as a change in child custody cannot be made on the basis of conflicting certifications, as occurred here. <em>E.g., P.T. v. M.S., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>193, 214, 738 A.2d 385 (App.Div.1999); <em>Wilke v.

Fusco, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 327, 452 A.2d 681 (App.Div.1982). The Oklahoma report, which detailed the family\u2019s history and present living arrangements, concluded with the recommendation that Kevin be returned to plaintiffs custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judge\u2019s decision here was made without the benefit of interviewing the child, and without any explanation for declining plaintiffs request to do so.

Ms. Holt\u2019s credentials are not set forth in the record. We recognize the value of a Probation Department social worker\u2019s investigation in a child custody matter. The social worker can provide valuable, objective information to the court respecting the child\u2019s living conditions at home, his schooling, and other activities. No such detailed investigation is evidenced in the record.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The brief note submitted to the court by Ms. Holt did not constitute either expert psychological opinion respecting the child\u2019s best interest or the fruits of an in-depth study. While truly expert testimony in a child custody case can be invaluable, <em>Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 318-19, 696 A.2d 556 (1997), no court may delegate its responsibility for a final custody or visitation decision to any expert, no matter how well qualified. <em>P.T. v. M.S., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216, 738 A.2d 385. It was clearly error to make a final decision in this disputed custody matter on the return date of a motion, to reject plaintiffs request to consider the Oklahoma report and to conduct a plenary hearing, and not to provide findings of fact, contrary to <em>R. </em>1:7-4 as well as <em>R. </em>2:10-5.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">It is axiomatic that the courts have a special obligation to protect children who are the subject of disputed claims to custody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The \u201cbest-interest-of-the-child\u201d standard is more than a statement of the primary criterion for decision or the factors to be considered; it is an expression of the court\u2019s special responsibility to safeguard the interests of the child at the center of a custody dispute because the child cannot be presumed to be protected by the adversarial process. That responsibility was perhaps best articulated by Judge Cardozo: [The Chancellor] acts as parens patriae to do what is best for the interest of the child.

In furtherance of the federal statute's purpose to prevent conflicting orders concerning a child\u2019s custody, and also to discourage parents from fleeing with a child to seek a more favorable determination in another forum, the federal act requires the second forum to defer to the continuing jurisdiction of the original forum in most cases, unless that court determines either that it has lost or should not exercise jurisdiction.

The report was provided to the New Jersey court by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services after correspondence with Ms. Holt in the Ocean County Probation Department. It was not plaintiffs submission, for which she reasonably could be held responsible for its filing or service. Moreover, where critical information relative to a child's best interests is known to be available, the courts must be flexible in applying otherwise applicable procedural rules. <em>Cf. Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 318-19, 696 A.2d 556 (1997) (rules of evidence applicable to most adversary proceedings must be flexibly applied in child custody matters).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> The January 12 order says: \"Custody of minor child shall remain with father in New Jersey.
