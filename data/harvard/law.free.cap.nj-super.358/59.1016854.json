The bar featured dancing to Latin music on weekends, and the lot was crowded with departing patrons. There were several disputes ongoing in the lot \u2014 a condition, discovery suggests, that was not unusual as the bar emptied out on weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Viewed most favorably to plaintiff, the proofs showed that after Lucena had backed out of his parking space, a man was standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in front of Lucena\u2019s station wagon, blocking its exit. Lucena honked the horn, and the man began pounding on the hood. Lucena left the car, ostensibly to facilitate its movement by addressing the person who was pounding the hood. He was immediately assaulted and knocked down by several people.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In Negron\u2019s words, \u201che was knocked down in the ground, and that\u2019s when I opened the door, and I went to help him ...\u201d Asked, \u201c[w]hat was your intention in getting out of the car[?],\u201d Negron answered, \u201c[t]o help my brother-in-law.\u201d Negron did not remember what happened after he got out of the car. According to eyewitnesses, he was struck violently from the rear on the side of his head by someone wielding an object, possibly a beer bottle. Negron sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">One witness said Negron had gone around to the back of the vehicle before he was hit. Another witness, the second passenger of the Lucena vehicle, described it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">The first one that got hit was Carlos. Seconds. Ismael was with Carlos in the ear. Carlos [sic] opened the door and when he seen Carlos was on the floor that\u2019s why he went to find out what\u2019s going on. He went around the car and this other guy came at him with a bottle. Boom. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">As amended at the time of the March 1999 injury, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 required that automobile insurance policies,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">shall contain personal injury protection benefits for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault ... to ... persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with permission of the named insured ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The motion judge concluded that the record presented a situation where the plaintiffs purpose in exiting the vehicle was to help his brother-in-law who had been injured in a fight. Relying primarily upon our opinion in <em>Vasil v. Zullo, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 570 A.2d 464 (App.Div.1990), the judge reasoned that, however commendable, such purpose was not sufficiently \u201centwined with normal use\u201d of a vehicle to bring this case within the ambit of PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Negron argues on appeal th\u00e1t a passenger who goes to the aid of a driver who has been attacked while protecting or clearing the path of an automobile is entitled to PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">A substantial body of case law has developed concerning the statutory words \u201coccupying ... or using\u201d an automobile in the context of eligibility for PIP benefits. The broad principle developed by case law has been summarized with disarming simplicity in Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 6:2-3, pg. 119 (Gann 2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">[I]t is not necessary that the ipjury be directly or proximately caused by the automobile or by its motion or operation, so long as there is a substantial nexus between the occupancy or use of the vehicle and the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Cases considering the issue of substantial nexus in PIP matters were surveyed in <em>Lindstrom v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 247-53, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994). More recent cases, like <em>Ohio Casualty Group v. Gray, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 732 A.2d 1145 (App.Div.1999); <em>Svenson v. National Consumer Ins. Co., 322 N.J.Super. </em>410, 413-17, 731 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1999); and <em>Stevenson v. State Farm Indemnity Co., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 372-73, 709 A.2d 1359 (App.Div.1998), have addressed the issue with similar surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">In support of his argument on appeal, Negron urges that his actions were directly linked to the use of the automobile in which he was traveling because he was acting to aid the driver of his car, to clear a path of travel and to stop third parties from damaging the vehicle. He invokes particularly <em>Smaul v. Irvington General Hosp., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>474, 477, 530 A.2d 1251 (1987); <em>Ohio Casualty Group, supra; </em>and <em>Vicari v. Nationwide Ins., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 416 A.2d 977 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>464, 427 A.2d 562 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">We have considered the above cases, along with our decision in <em>Burns v. Market Transition Facility of N.J., </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 657 A.2d 472 (App.Div.1995), where. PIP coverage was afforded to a good Samaritan injured while partially inside an automobile for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the purpose of rendering emergency assistance to its injured driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Supreme Court was careful in <em>Lindstrom </em>to recognize that <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4 was not designed to function as general crime insurance, and that its ruling in that case was not applicable to cases where other circumstances intervene between use of the vehicle and a criminal act of violence. <em>Lindstrom, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 649 A.2d 1272. This distinction appears to have been anticipated in <em>Vasil, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 577, 570 A.2d 464, and recognized by Judge Curio in her oral decision on the motion. The judge pointed out that Negron\u2019s stated purpose was to assist his brother-in-law who had been knocked to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We find nothing in the record to support the factual contention made on appeal that Negron left the car for the purpose of clearing a path or assessing damage done to the vehicle. The requisite <em>substantial </em>nexus is absent because of the intervening circumstances that prompted Negron\u2019s departure from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">It also appears to be suggested on appeal that, as Lucena was injured while arguably still in occupancy or in use of the vehicle because of a purpose to clear a passage free of the obstructing individual, Negron\u2019s attempt to render aid to his injured brother-in-law (who was then outside of the car) should be deemed to acquire the aura of occupancy or use surrounding Lucena.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">This stretches the liberal-construction mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16 beyond existing case law and, we think, beyond the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">As observed by the concurring judge in <em>Bums, </em>\u201c[n]ot everyone who might be a good Samaritan attempting to aid a motorist will be entitled to PIP benefits and rescue will not always invite such benefits.\u201d <em>Burns, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 311, 657 A.2d 472. (Conley, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Among the purposes of the Act was an effort to address premium cost reduction. The latter legislative objective has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>re-emphasized by adoption of the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act, <em>L. </em>1998, c. 21, amendments to the no-fault laws. Extension of the nexus rationale beyond present boundaries cannot be calculated to lower premium costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
