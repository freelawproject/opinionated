Their motion for reconsideration was denied. The claims brought by plaintiffs against defendants, the law firm of Nagel, Rice, Dreifuss &amp; Mazie, L.L.P., and its principals, alleged that the defendants orchestrated a campaign to destroy the good name and medical practice of Dr. Dello Russo. The complaint alleged defamation, extortion, attempted harmful actions, and tortious interference with plaintiffs\u2019 contract and business opportunity. Dr. Dello Russo\u2019s wife, Stephanie Dello Russo, also alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress. A <em>per quod </em>claim was then asserted on behalf of Dr. Dello Russo based bn the asserted emotional distress suffered by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">On appeal plaintiffs argue that the motion judge erred: (1) in dismissing their complaint because a cause of action upon which relief may be granted was pled; (2) when he found that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>dants\u2019 defamatory statements were not actionable and were subject to privilege because the advertisement placed by the respondents was defamatory; (3) in determining, as a matter of law, that defendants\u2019 actions did not constitute an actionable claim for tortious interference with plaintiffs\u2019 contract and business opportunity; (4) in dismissing Stephanie Dello Russo\u2019s complaint based upon negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (5) in dismissing Joseph Dello Russo\u2019s <em>per quod </em>claim which relied on his wife\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Between March and November 2001, the law <em>firm of </em>Nagel Rice Dreifuss &amp; Mazie, filed four separate civil lawsuits against Dr. Dello Russo. The first two cases, <em>DeAngelis v. New Jersey Eye Center, et al., </em>and <em>Cucopulis v. New Jersey Eye Center, et al., </em>alleged: (1) negligent medical care in connection with laser eye surgery, and (2) fraud and battery arising from post-operative care provided by William T. Kellogg when his medical license was revoked. The third case, <em>Dell\u2019ermo v. NJ Eye Center, et al., </em>asserted medical malpractice arising out of the performance of laser surgery on a man who was an inappropriate candidate. The fourth ease was <em>Macedo v. NJ Eye Center, et al. </em>which sought class action status on behalf of all persons claiming improper treatment by Kellogg, who was asserted to be an unlicensed doctor who was allegedly held out by Dr. Dello Russo to be a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">According to the record of this appeal, at a meeting at the Nagel firm, Dr. Dello Russo\u2019s attorney offered defendants $2 million, provided, among other things, that the firm would agree not to sue Dr. Dello Russo in the future. That offer was rejected. Plaintiffs contend that Bruce Nagel demanded $3 million from Dr. Dello Russo personally to make matters go away. Dr. Dello Russo asserted that Nagel allegedly threatened that if he did not comply, Nagel would go public, contact the media, call a press conference and also place an ad in the newspapers. Dr. Dello Russo refused his demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>On August 1, 2001, the defendant law firm ran a newspaper advertisement for the purposes of soliciting potential claimants who might have complaints against Dr. Dello Russo. The advertisement asked whether readers were \u201ctreated by Dr. Dello Russo or Dr. William Kellogg at the NJ Eye Center,\u201d and whether they \u201csuffered a bad result from eye surgery,\u201d and if so, defendants offered a \u201cfree consultation to discuss your legal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">After this newspaper advertisement was published, Dr. Dello Russo sought injunctive relief against the law firm and sought to prevent it from interviewing potential witnesses in connection with the four pending lawsuits instituted on behalf of the firm\u2019s clients against Dr. Dello Russo and his business. This application was denied and the action was dismissed for failure to state a legally cognizable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Dr. Dello Russo contends that the result of this publication had an immediate and continuing impact on his medical practice and his reputation. He asserts that many of his patients canceled their surgeries and his office suffered a significant drop-off in new patients, and that defendants contacted several of his patients seeking information regarding their treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) is granted with great caution. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 771-772, 563 A.2d 31 (1989); <em>Leon v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 466, 774 A.2d 674 (App.Div.2001). The test is whether a cause of action is suggested by the facts alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The first, second, third, and fifth counts of the verified complaint were predicated on claims that plaintiffs were defamed. Whether a statement is defamatory is a matter of law to be determined by the court. <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hosp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 426, 730 A.2d 327 (1999). To establish a prima, facie case of defamation, whether denominated libel or slander, a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>must show that defendant communicated a false statement about plaintiff to a third person that harms plaintiffs reputation in the eyes of the community or deters third persons from associating with the plaintiff. <em>Lynch v. N.J. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>152, 164-165, 735 A.2d 1129 (1999). Plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof for each of the elements of defamation is by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Rocci v. Ecole Secondaire MacDonald-Cartier, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>149, 159, 755 A.2d 583 (2000); <em>Lynch, supra </em>(161 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 735 A.2d 1129).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">When determining if a statement is defamatory on its face \u201ca court must scrutinize the language \u2018according to the fair and natural meaning which will be given it by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 290, 537 A.2d 284 (1988)). The threshold issue is whether the language used is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning. <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 424, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989); <em>Romaine, supra </em>(109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290-291, 537 A.2d 284); <em>Kotlikoff v. The Cmty. News, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67, 444 A.2d 1086 (1982). If the statement is susceptible of only a non-defamatory meaning, it cannot be considered defamatory, and the complaint must be dismissed. <em>Romaine, supra </em>(109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 537 A.2d 284). However, where the statement is capable of more than one meaning, one of which is defamatory and another not, the question of whether its content is defamatory must be resolved by the fact finder. <em>Id. </em>at 290-291, 537 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In deciding whether a statement is defamatory a court examines its content, verifiability, and context. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 735 A.2d 1129; <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>516, 529, 643 A.2d 972 (1994). A statement\u2019s content is judged by its objective meaning to a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence. <em>Lynch, supra </em>(161 <em>N.J. </em>at 167-168, 735 A.2d 1129). Secondly, only verifiable statements can be defamatory. <em>Ibid.; Ward, supra </em>(136 <em>N.J. </em>at 530-531, 643 A.2d 972). Finally, a statement\u2019s meaning can be affected by its context. <em>Lynch, supra </em>(161 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 735 A.2d 1129). The focus is on the effect of the alleged defamatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>statement on third persons, that is, whether they viewed the plaintiff in a lesser light as a result of hearing or reading the offending statement. <em>Arturi v. Tiebie, </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 223,179 A.2d 539 (App.Div.1962); <em>Scelfo v. Rutgers Univ., </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>403, 411, 282 A.2d 445 (Law Div.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the newspaper advertisement placed by defendants is actionable because of the use of the language \u201cbad result\u201d in the advertisement. As noted, the advertisement consisted of questions and an offer to consult with potential clients. Although attorneys are constitutionally and ethically permitted to advertise,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiffs contend that the use of the language \u201cbad result\u201d is not a communication of factual information by the defendants\u2019 law firm that is permitted in attorney advertising. Plaintiffs contend that the advertisement sends the message that Dr. Dello Russo conducts such bad surgery that his patients should sue him. Dr. Dello Russo argues that an acceptable advertisement would have to mention the total number of his successful surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Mick v. American Dental Assoc., </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 139 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>74, 141 A.2d 318 (1958), where we sustained the dismissal of a libel action brought against the American Dental Association by a member-dentist who opposed fluoridation of public drinking water. Thereafter, the Association responded to an inquiry about the dentist by stating it believed his views \u201cto be based on complete misinformation and to be totally irresponsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 139 A.2d 570. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>commented that the letter was not so unambiguous that a court could hold as a matter of law that it was capable only of the non-defamatory interpretation that there was no attack on the plaintiffs ability or competence as a dentist. Readers of the publication could have lessened esteem for a dentist whose views on fluoridation were \u201cirresponsible,\u201d with the implication that his professional reputation would suffer. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 139 A.2d 570. However, the defamation action based on the letter was barred as to the addressee of the letter on the theory of invitation or consent. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 139 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Mick </em>is misplaced because there was ambiguity as to whether the allegedly defamatory statements in that case were in fact defamatory. Here, the advertisement does not state that Dr. Dello Russo is incompetent or that he has a history of bad results. Rather, it asks whether patients who had been treated at the New Jersey Eye Center by either Dr. Dello Russo or Kellogg suffered a bad result. The motion judge reasoned that the term \u201cbad\u201d used by defendants was not significant because the defendants were trying to limit the patients who contacted them to those who experienced unfavorable results. We agree. The judge properly concluded that defendants\u2019 advertisement was not defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Plaintiffs also contend that they were defamed by statements made by defendants in a settlement meeting. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not refer to specific statements, but presumably they refer to defendants\u2019 threat during the settlement conference to go public if Dr. Dello Russo did not settle. Generally, however, the litigation privilege protects a litigant from liability for statements made in the course of judicial, administrative, or legislative proceedings by a litigant or other trial participant. <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., Inc., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 563, 569 A.2d 793 (1990) (citing Rainiers <em>Dairies v. Raritan Valley Farms, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>552, 558, 117 A.2d 889 (1955)). The litigation privilege extends to \u201c \u2018any communication (1) made in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>rized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hawkins v. Hards, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>207, 216, 661 A.2d 284 (1995) (quoting <em>Silberg v. Anderson, </em>50 <em>Cal.</em>3d 205, 266 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>638, 786 P.2d 365, 369 (1990)). Thus, provided the communication has a nexus with the litigation, it would be privileged. Indeed, it covers statements made- during settlement negotiations or while engaged in a private conference with an attorney regarding litigation. <em>Ibid. </em>It would not, for example, properly apply to a threat of criminal prosecution unless some concession is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The litigation privilege is not absolute. For example, it does not insulate a litigant from liability for malicious prosecution. <em>Rainer\u2019s Daides, supra </em>(19 <em>N.J. </em>at 564-566, 117 A.2d 889). Nor does it protect against professional discipline for an attorney\u2019s unethical conduct. <em>Ruberton v. Gabage, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 134, 654 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>451, 663 A.2d 1358 (1995). \u201cThe potential harm which may result from an absolute privilege is mitigated by the comprehensive control of the trial judge and the rules of professional' conduct which govern attorney conduct.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Ballard, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 588, 679 A.2d 657 (App.Div.1996) (citing <em>Hawkins, supra </em>(141 <em>N.J. </em>207, 661 A.2d 284)). <em>See also R.P.C. </em>3.4(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>Ruberton, supra </em>(280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133-134, 654 A.2d 1002), in the context of an abuse of process case, we held that threats of criminal prosecution made by an attorney during a settlement conference, even if tortious, were protected by the litigation privilege. We reasoned that \u201cduring such conferences an attorney must be free to advance the strengths of his or her client\u2019s case in a candid and objective way, unfettered by the fear that the attorney may be the subject of a tort action, whether sounding in defamation or any other \u2018action under a different label.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-134, 654 A.2d 1002 (quoting <em>Rainier\u2019s Daides, supra </em>(19 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 117 A.2d 889)). However, we would not necessarily apply <em>Ruberton </em>to all threats of criminal prosecution made by an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The motion judge held that the statements that were made in the settlement meeting did not constitute defamation, and rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. Here, the judge properly ruled that defendants\u2019 statements during the settlement negotiations were protected by the litigation privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The sixth count of the verified complaint alleged the crime of theft by extortion. <em>N.J.S.A, </em>20:20-5 provides that a person is guilty of theft by extortion if he purposely and unlawfully obtains property of another by extortion. In pertinent part, a person extorts if he purposely threatens to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">b. Accuse anyone of an offense or cause charges of an offense to be instituted against any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">c. Expose or publicize any secret or any asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">g. Inflict any other harm which would not substantially benefit the actor but which is calculated to materially harm another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Defendants respond that as a matter of law, there is no civil cause of action for theft by extortion and the criminal statute does not provide a civil remedy. Defendants are correct in their assertion. The motion judge properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims because there is no civil cause of action for theft by extortion. In any event, the record does not establish the elements of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The fourth count of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that defendants committed a wrongful act when they \u201cattempted to contact and in fact directly contacted and solicited current and former patients of plaintiffs in an attempt to have such patients discuss their medical treatment with defendants.\u201d It is hardly clear exactly what cause of action plaintiffs allege in this count. In any event, the judge correctly dismissed this count because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>cause of action was identified or suggested by the facts in this count of the complaint. <em>See Printing Mart, supra </em>(116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The third count of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that defendants\u2019 defamatory statement was an act of tortious interference with plaintiffs\u2019 prospective economic opportunity and business interests. The fourth count also alleged that defendants contacted plaintiffs\u2019 patients and during those contacts defamed plaintiff which was an act of tortious interference with plaintiffs\u2019 contract. Plaintiffs claim that the motion judge erred in dismissing those counts of their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">To establish a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must prove: (1) actual interference with a contract; (2) that the interference was inflicted intentionally by a defendant who is not a party to the contract; (3) that the interference was without justification; and (4) that the interference caused damage. <em>214 Corp. v. Casino Reinvestment Dev. Auth., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>624, 628, 656 A.2d 70 (Law Div.1994) (citing <em>Printing Mart, supra </em>(116 <em>N.J. </em>at 751-752, 563 A.2d 31)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Interference with a contract is intentional \u201cif the actor desires to bring it about or if he knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) Torts, </em>\u00a7 766A, comment e (1977). \u201cAn individual acts with malice when he or she intentionally commits a wrong without excuse or justification.\u201d <em>Cox v. Simon, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 433, 651 A.2d 476 (App.Div.1995). However, the fact that a breaching party acted \u201cto advance [its] own interest and financial position\u201d does not establish the necessary malice or wrongful conduct. <em>Sandler v. Lawn-A-Mat Chem. &amp; Equip. Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 451-452, 358 A.2d 805 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>503, 366 A.2d 658 (1976). A claim for tortious interference with the performance of a contract must be based, in part, on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>facts claiming that the interference was done intentionally and with \u2018malice.\u2019 ... For purposes of this tort, \u2018[t]he term malice is not used in the literal sense requiring ill will toward plaintiff.\u2019 ... Rather, malice is defined to mean that the harm was inflicted intentionally and without justification or excuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\"><em>Printing Mart, supra </em>(116 <em>N.J. </em>at 751, 563 A.2d 31) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Defendants argue that the complaint was properly dismissed because it failed to identify specific words of defamation which led to tortious interference. In order to properly plead a claim for libel or slander the defamatory words must be identified. <em>Zoneraich v. Overlook Hospital, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 514 A.2d 53 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>32, 526 A.2d 126 (1986); <em>Lands v. Baseman, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 491 A.2d 47 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>281, 501 A.2d 945 (1985). Here, we are satisfied that the motion judge properly dismissed this count of the complaint because it failed to identify any defamatory statements that were allegedly made to Dr. Dello Russo\u2019s patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The seventh and eight counts of the complaint sought damages for emotional distress for Dr. Dello Russo\u2019s wife, Stephanie Dello Russo, and a <em>per quod </em>claim on behalf of Dr. Dello Russo for the emotional distress suffered by his wife. The defendants argue that Stephanie Dello Russo cannot prove the elements of her emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress \u201ccan be understood as negligent conduct that is the proximate cause of emotional distress in a person to whom the actor owes a legal duty to exercise reasonable care.\u201d <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 429, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989). Thus, under a basic negligence analysis, the elements of the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress are: (a) defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to plaintiff; (b) defendant breached that duty; (c) plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and (d) defendant\u2019s breach of duty was the proximate cause of the injury. <em>Ibid. </em>Whether the defendant has a duty of care to the plaintiff depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>on whether it was foreseeable that the plaintiff would be seriously, mentally distressed. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 561 A.2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Tornquist v. Perkowski, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89, 504 A.2d 1226 (Law Div.1984), in contending that the Dello Russos presented a claim against defendants based upon negligent infliction of emotional distress. However, <em>Tomquist </em>is inapposite. That case addressed comparative fault in the context of a <em>per quod </em>claim and allowed a Portee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> type claim for a spouse who also had a <em>per quod </em>claim for loss of consortium. Moreover, <em>Tomquist </em>was overruled by <em>Tichenor v. Santillo, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 174, 527 A.2d 78 (App.Div.1987), where we held that a <em>per quod </em>claim will be reduced by the percentage of negligence attributable to the injured spouse, and by the percentage of any negligence attributable to the spouse asserting the <em>per quod </em>claim. Regardless, these cases have nothing to do with extending causes of action for emotional distress injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In the present case, Mrs. Dello Russo\u2019s emotional distress claim does not allege, nor do the factual allegations support, a cause of action based on bodily injury or sickness resulting from fright or apprehension of danger. <em>Falzone v.
