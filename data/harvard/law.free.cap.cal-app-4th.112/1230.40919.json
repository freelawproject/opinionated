The issue presented to us in this case is: when the court \u201celects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on . . . multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602\u201d (\u00a7 726), must the court necessarily aggregate the period of physical confinement on all previously sustained petitions? As we shall explain, in our view the answer is no.  We hold that when the minor has (as in this case) exhausted his available confinement time on one or more previously sustained petitions, the court need not include those petitions when the court \u201celects to aggregate the period of confinement on . . . multiple petitions\u201d under section 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Appellant was adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to section 602 on six separate occasions. A petition filed on September 11, 1997 resulted in appellant admitting a violation of Penal Code section 602 (trespassing). A December 18, 1997, petition resulted in appellant admitting a violation of Penal Code section 647.6 (misdemeanor molestation) and admitting to violating the terms of his probation (\u00a7 777). A July 2, 2001, petition resulted in appellant admitting a violation of Penal Code section 488. A September 18, 2001 petition resulted in appellant admitting a violation of Penal Code section 524 (misdemeanor attempted extortion) and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation (\u00a7 777). An October 23, 2001 petition (later amended on November 7, 2001) resulted in appellant admitting another violation of Penal Code section 488 and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation (\u00a7 777). The sixth petition, filed on July 23, 2002, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>resulted in appellant admitting another violation of Penal Code section 488 and again admitting to violating the terms of his probation (\u00a7 777).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">At an August 20, 2002 dispositional hearing on the sixth petition, the court ordered appellant continued on terms of probation not to exceed his 21st birthday. The court removed appellant from the custody of his mother, ordered placement and care of appellant to be vested with the probation department, ordered appellant to be delivered to juvenile hall pending placement, and made other appropriate orders. The court also set the maximum confinement time at one year, six months, less 70 days credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">THE COURT PROPERLY AGGREGATED THE PERIOD OF PHYSICAL CONFINEMENT ON PREVIOUSLY SUSTAINED PETITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The court\u2019s method of computing the maximum confinement time after appellant\u2019s sixth (the July 23, 2002) petition was sustained is the topic of dispute on this appeal. The court elected to \u201caggregate the period of physical confinement on . . . multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions.\u201d (\u00a7 726.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After appellant\u2019s second (the December 18, 1997) petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>was sustained, the court had aggregated appellant\u2019s available confinement time and had determined that to be one year and two months. Appellant was then in and out of six different group homes, and exhausted his available confinement time by December 28, 2000, i.e., before the third (the July 2, 2001) petition was filed. Thus, after the sixth (July 23, 2002) petition was filed and was ultimately sustained, the court concluded that there was no more available confinement time from appellant\u2019s first two petitions. It aggregated the available confinement time from the last four petitions. Following the dictates of Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a) and section 726, the court calculated the available confinement time as one year and six months by using the principal term of one year on the Penal Code section 524 offense from the fourth sustained petition, and two months each from the third, fifth and sixth sustained petitions (i.e., the three Pen. Code, \u00a7 488 offenses).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Appellant contends, however, that the court should have utilized all six sustained petitions in calculating his available confinement time after the sustaining of his current (sixth) petition. His argument is that all six sustained petitions involve \u201coffenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court\u201d within the meaning of the second paragraph of section 726. Therefore, he argues, section 726 requires the court to utilize all of the offenses in the six sustained petitions in making the Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a) calculation of the \u201caggregate term of imprisonment\u201d to be used as the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d in section 726, i.e., the maximum available period of \u201cphysical confinement\u201d for the minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>as a result of the sixth sustained petition. (\u00a7 726.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, however, the flaw in appellant\u2019s argument is that his conclusion does not logically follow his premise. He is correct that all six of his sustained petitions involve \u201coffenses which brought or continued [him] under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d  But even an adult convicted of those very same six offenses would not be required to serve additional time on his first two offenses if that adult served his entire sentence on the first two offenses before being convicted of the subsequent four offenses. To require a minor to do so would appear to us to be ignoring the objective of section 726 rather than adhering to its requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">\u201cIn interpreting a statute, a court \u2018should seek to effectuate the intent of the law, acting in a reasonable fashion to give the statute a sensible construction in accordance with the purpose of the lawmakers, to promote rather than defeat the policy underlying the legislation.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Price) (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 486, 489 [198 Cal.Rptr. 61].)  Consequently, we must look to the overall purpose of the statute, which, in this case, is to ensure that a minor is not held \u2018in physical confinement for a period <em>in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an </em>adult\u2019 for the same offenses. (. . . \u00a7 726, italics added; <em>In re James A. </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 332, 338 [161 Cal.Rptr. 588].)\u201d <em>(In re Prentiss C. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1487 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 541].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375], the court held that youthful misdemeanants may not be subjected to the control of the Youth Authority for any period of time in excess of the maximum jail term that might be imposed upon adult misdemeanants committing the same offense. To do so, the court concluded, would constitute \u201ca denial of equal protection in violation of article I, section 7, of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(People v. Olivas, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 236, 243, fn. omitted.) In response to <em>Olivas, </em>the Legislature in 1976 amended section 726 to state in relevant part: \u201cIn any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian as the result of an order or wardship made pursuant to Section 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1071, \u00a7 29, p. 4827.) In <em>In re Aaron N. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 931 [139 Cal.Rptr. 258], the court construed this language to mean that \u201cwhere, as here, the minor violates several provisions of criminal law by his repeated misconduct for which he is declared a section 602 ward of the court, each and every criminal violation may constitute the offense which brings him under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and may serve as a measurement for his physical confinement under the broad language of sections 726 and 731 without violating the basic precept of equal treatment of the adult and juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>(In re Aaron N., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.3d at pp. 939-940.) In 1977 the Legislature then essentially codified <em>Aaron N. </em>and attempted to clarify section 726 by changing the words \u201cthe offense which brought the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court\u201d to \u201cthe offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,\u201d and by adding the three ensuing paragraphs defining \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 1238, \u00a7 1, p. 4158; see also Cal. Juvenile Court Practice (CEB 1981) \u00a7 9.42.) Thus after the 1977 amendments, section 726 read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\u201cIn any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to Section 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">\u201cAs used in this section and in Section 731, \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 means the longest of the three time periods set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, but without the need to follow the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code or to consider time for good behavior or participation pursuant to Sections 2930, 2931, and 2932 of the Penal Code, plus enhancements which must be proven if pled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">\u201cIf the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602, the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be specified in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">\u201cIf the charged offense is a misdemeanor or a felony not included within the scope of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 is the longest term of imprisonment prescribed by law.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 1238, \u00a7 1, pp. 4158-4159.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In 1994 the Legislature amended the third above-quoted paragraph of section 726 to clarify the meaning of, \u201cthe \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be specified in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code.\u201d After the 1994 amendment this paragraph read: \u201cIf the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602, the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be the aggregate term of imprisonment specified in subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code, which includes any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667, 667.5, 667.6, or 12022.1 of the Penal Code, and pursuant to Section 11370.2 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Stats. 1994, ch. 181, \u00a7 1, pp. 1667-1668.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This paragraph has remained essentially unchanged to this date.  The history of this statute appears to demonstrate refinements and clarifications of the basic principle embodied in the statute\u2014that the minor\u2019s maximum period of physical confinement is to be determined in a manner analogous to that of the maximum sentence of a similarly situated adult offender.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The case of <em>In re Dana G. </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 678 [188 Cal.Rptr. 866] is also instructive here. In <em>Dana G. </em>a section 602 petition was sustained and the minor was found to have violated Vehicle Code section 31 (giving false information to a police officer). The maximum commitment time for a violation of Vehicle Code section 31 was six months (Veh. Code, \u00a7 42002). The court set the maximum period of physical confinement at two years. It did this by \u201cadding to the term for the misdemeanor charge of giving false information, the unspent custody time from two prior wardships.\u201d <em>(In re Dana G., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 680.) But each of the two prior wardships had been terminated prior to the minor\u2019s Vehicle Code section 31 violation, and the appellate court agreed with the minor\u2019s contention that her maximum period of physical confinement \u201ccannot include unserved custody time from prior terminated wardships.\u201d <em>(In re Dana G., supra, </em>139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>Cal.App.3d at p. 680.) The respondent in <em>Dana G. </em>argued that unserved custody time from the prior terminated wardships should be aggregated and included in the computation of the maximum period of physical confinement for the sustained petition on the Vehicle Code section 31 violation. Even though the first two wardships involved \u201coffenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court\u201d (just like the first two sustained petitions in the case presently before us), the <em>Dana G. </em>court relied on the basic principle embodied in the statute\u2014that the minor\u2019s maximum period of physical confinement is to be determined in a manner analogous to that of a similarly situated adult offender. The court stated, with regard to section 726: \u201cThe section . . . not only <em>permits </em>aggregation but <em>requires </em>a maximum term of confinement no longer than the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses. If the juvenile court aggregated unspent time on petitions which had been dismissed, this latter requirement of the section would not be met. An adult may not have his term increased by unspent custody time on dismissed charges. When the adult is released from his custody and parole time, he cannot be required to serve any unserved time on a new charge.\u201d <em>(In re Dana G., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 680.)  Similarly, when an adult serves his entire term of imprisonment on a first conviction, that sentence cannot magically be lengthened upon a subsequent conviction, with the magically lengthened portion of the first sentence added on to the term of imprisonment imposed on the defendant\u2019s second conviction. A first conviction can in some instances result in a longer sentence on a second conviction, i.e., when a prior conviction enhancement allegation is pled and proven in the second case, but that scenario is accounted for in the language of section 726 and Penal Code section 1170.1. (See also Cal. Juvenile Court Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">OTHER ISSUES<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">IH.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The juvenile court is directed to modify that portion of its August 20, 2002 order stating, \u201cthe available confinement time is 1 year(s), 06 months, less 70 day(s) credit for time served\u201d to read \u201cthe available confinement time is 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>year(s), 06 months, less 71 day(s) credit for time served.\u201d As modified, the August 20, 2002 order is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Levy, J., and Gomes, L, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 28, 2004.
