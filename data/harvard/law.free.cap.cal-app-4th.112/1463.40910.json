INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Defendant Christopher Anthony Gutierrez was convicted by a jury of forcible oral copulation and forcible sexual penetration with a foreign object while acting in concert. Prior to trial, Gutierrez moved for Pitchess<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> disclosure of information in the personnel records of the two officers who arrested him. The trial court declined to conduct an in camera hearing, finding Gutierrez had failed to establish good cause as required by Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">Gutierrez contends that the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>framework, as applied in criminal cases, conflicts with the principles expressed in <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194], in violation of his due process rights. According to Gutierrez, the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures (1) impermissibly interfere with the prosecutor\u2019s duty to ascertain and disclose material, exculpatory evidence to the defense, and (2) improperly place upon the defendant the burden of establishing good cause for <em>Brady </em>disclosure. Gutierrez further contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior conviction pursuant to Evidence Code section 1108, a statute he complains is unconstitutional; admitting hearsay evidence; and instructing the jury with CALJIC Nos. 2.50.02 and 17.41.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">In the published portion of this opinion, we reject Gutierrez\u2019s claims that the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures run afoul of <em>Brady. </em>In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject Gutierrez\u2019s other claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">H. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">A. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">On August 12, 2001, shortly before midnight, the victim, Sandra C., was working as a prostitute. Gutierrez and Robert Ruiz were driving in a Honda Civic when they encountered Sandra and agreed to pay her $15 or $20 for sexual services for both of them. Sandra entered the car and directed them to drive to a motel, but Ruiz, who was driving, took her to another location. When Sandra entered the Honda, she stated, \u201cI get paid first.\u201d Gutierrez replied, \u201cShut up, bitch. Bitch, you\u2019re going to do what we tell you to do.\u201d He put his hand around Sandra\u2019s throat and shoved her back into the car, causing abrasions on her shoulder. Gutierrez lowered his pants. Sandra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>remained huddled in the comer of the car and asked whether Gutierrez was going to hurt her. He replied, \u201cNo. As long as you do what we tell you to do.\u201d Gutierrez forced her to orally copulate him and digitally penetrated her vagina. From comments made by Gutierrez and Ruiz, Sandra surmised they were armed with a gun. She was afraid of them. Ruiz at one point stated, \u201cWhat do we do if the cops come[?]\u201d Gutierrez replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll just blast them. You got your nine?\u201d Ruiz replied affirmatively. When Sandra pleaded to leave and promised not to tell police about the incident, Gutierrez replied, \u201cNo. You\u2019re just gonna do what we tell to you do [szc].\u201d Ruiz also forced her to orally copulate him while Gutierrez digitally penetrated her anus. Gutierrez then forcibly removed all Sandra\u2019s clothing and Ruiz attempted to rape her. Ruiz stated, \u201cAh, man, she got a good look at our face. What are we gonna do now?\u201d Gutierrez did not reply but forced Sandra to orally copulate him again. During this episode, when Sandra saw the lights of passing cars, she attempted to exit the Honda, but was prevented by Gutierrez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Officer Jason Schwab of the Los Angeles Police Department and his partner were on patrol in the area and pulled alongside Gutierrez\u2019s car. When Schwab illuminated the Honda with a spotlight, Sandra pulled her head from Gutierrez\u2019s lap area, jumped from the vehicle, naked and \u201chysterical,\u201d and said, \u201cHelp me. They\u2019re raping me.\u201d She informed Schwab that the men had a gun. When Sandra had raised her head before jumping out of the vehicle, Gutierrez had attempted to push her head back down. According to Schwab, prostitutes normally do not completely disrobe when working in vehicles, in order to make it \u201charder for vice to try to catch them.\u201d Sandra\u2019s dress, missing its straps, and her bra were found in the Honda. No gun was discovered. The two men only had $6.10 in cash between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Ruiz pleaded guilty to rape in concert in exchange for a three-year prison sentence. Part of the plea agreement was that Ruiz would testify truthfully and completely at all future proceedings regarding the incident. Sandra\u2019s whereabouts were unknown at the time of trial, and she did not testify. Her statements to Officer Schwab recounting the incident were admitted into evidence as spontaneous statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">B. <em>Procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Trial was by jury. Gutierrez was found guilty of forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object while acting in concert (Pen. Code, \u00a7 264.1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2)). The jury acquitted Gutierrez of rape while acting in concert, of one count of forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object, and of unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle. In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true allegations that Gutierrez had suffered a prior \u201cstrike\u201d conviction for attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 667, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>subds. (a)(1), (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)). The trial court further found Gutierrez had served one prior prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). It denied his Romero<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> motion to strike a prior conviction allegation and sentenced him to a total term of 55 years in state prison. It also imposed restitution, parole revocation, and other fines. Gutierrez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">A. <em>California\u2019s statutory Pitchess scheme does not infringe upon Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights or violate Brady v. Maryland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">1. <em>Additional facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\"><em>Gutierrez </em>filed a pretrial <em>Pitchess </em>motion seeking disclosure of personnel and administrative records of Officer Schwab and his partner, Officer Farell, \u201cconcerning any acts involving falsification of testimony, fabrication of evidence, false police reports, perjury, aggressive behavior, racial or gender bias,\u201d and actual or attempted violence and excessive force. Defense counsel\u2019s supporting declaration averred that the requested discovery was material and relevant because the encounter between Gutierrez and Sandra was consensual; Sandra was alleging rape as a way to avoid prosecution for prostitution; and the arresting officers were \u201clying when they allege [Gutierrez] was holding the victim\u2019s head down forcibly ... in order to bolster [the] victim\u2019s rape claim.\u201d In his memorandum of points and authorities in support of the requested disclosure, Gutierrez argued, <em>\u201cPitchess </em>compliance must include and be consistent with the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to <em>Brady </em>evidence.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">The trial court denied the <em>Pitchess </em>motion because Gutierrez had failed to show good cause. Gutierrez\u2019s allegations, the trial court found, amounted to nothing more than a general denial of the charges, and the theory advanced in his moving papers was implausible. The trial court pointed out that officers would have been unlikely to fabricate the fact that Gutierrez held the victim\u2019s head down because such action was not an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Gutierrez urges that his convictions must be reversed because the trial court failed \u201cto order full disclosure of police officer character evidence under <em>Brady v. Maryland.\u201d </em>He does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>failed to establish good cause for the disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, he contends that the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures (sections 832.5, 832.7, 832.8, and Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045) unconstitutionally infringe upon his due process rights in three respects. First, he asserts, <em>\u201cBrady </em>dictates more generous discovery than Pitchess,\u201d and to the extent the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>scheme shields <em>Brady </em>evidence from disclosure, the <em>Pitchess </em>provisions are invalid. Second, he posits that <em>Brady </em>imposes upon prosecutors a duty to examine the personnel records of \u201call significant police officer witnesses\u201d and disclose any exculpatory or impeaching information. The statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures, he complains, undercut the prosecutor\u2019s ability to carry out these duties. Third, he argues the statutory scheme impermissibly burdens a defendant by requiring that he or she establish good cause for disclosure of information that the prosecutor is already under a duty to disclose. For these reasons, he contends, the <em>Pitchess </em>procedures are unconstitutional when applied in criminal cases. We disagree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gutierrez\u2019s claims are foreclosed by the California Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (Brandon) </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 1 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 52 P.3d 129] (Brandon) and <em>Alford </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 63 P.3d 228].</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">a. <em>Brady disclosure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Under <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at page 87, a prosecutor must disclose any evidence that is favorable to the defendant and material on the issue of guilt or punishment. <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 7; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 349, 358 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 434].) The <em>Brady </em>disclosure obligation encompasses both impeachment and exculpatory evidence, and exists regardless of whether the defendant makes a specific request for the information. <em>(Strickler v. Greene </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 263, 280 [144 L.Ed.2d 286, 119 S.Ct. 1936]; <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 667, 676 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 105 S.Ct. 3375]; <em>Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 8; <em>In re Brown </em>(1998) 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>Cal.4th 873, 879 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 952 P.2d 715].) \u201cThe scope of this disclosure obligation extends beyond the contents of the prosecutor\u2019s case file and encompasses the duty to ascertain as well as divulge \u2018any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf,\u201d including the police. <em>(In re Brown, supra, </em>at p. 879; <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Greene, supra, </em>527 U.S. at pp. 280-281; <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 419, 437-438 [131 L.Ed.2d 490, 115 S.Ct. 1555].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Evidence is material under <em>Brady </em>if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed. <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 7-8; <em>Strickler v. Greene, supra, </em>527 U.S. at pp. 289-290.) \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result is accordingly shown when the government\u2019s evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kyles v. Whitley, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 434; <em>In re Brown, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 886.) \u201cAlthough <em>Brady </em>disclosure issues may arise \u2018in advance of,\u2019 \u2018during,\u2019 or \u2018after trial\u2019 [citation], the test is always the same. [Citation.] <em>Brady </em>materiality is a \u2018constitutional standard\u2019 required to ensure that nondisclosure will not \u2018result in the denial of defendant\u2019s [due process] right to a fair trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 8.) <em>Brady, </em>however, does not require the disclosure of information that is of mere speculative value. \u201c[T]he prosecution has no general duty to seek out, obtain, and disclose all evidence that might be beneficial to the defense.\u201d <em>(In re Littlefield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 122, 135 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 851 P.2d 42], italics omitted; <em>Kyles v. Whitley, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 436-437; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 361.) <em>Brady </em>did not create a general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case. <em>(People v. Jordan, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">b. <em>Pitchess disclosures.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">\u201cFor approximately a quarter-century our trial courts have entertained what have become known as <em>Pitchess </em>motions, screening law enforcement personnel files in camera for evidence that may be relevant to a criminal defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>(People v. Mooc </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1225 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 36 P.3d 21], fn. omitted.) In 1978, the Legislature codified the <em>Pitchess </em>privileges and procedures, and they are now embodied in sections 832.5, 832.7 and 832.8, and Evidence Code sections 1043 through 1047. <em>(People v. Mooc, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1226; <em>Alford v. Superior Court, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1037; <em>Brandon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 8-9.) This statutory scheme provides that peace officer personnel records are confidential and may be discovered only pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Evidence Code. <em>(Alford, supra, </em>at pp. 1037-1038; <em>Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 9.) Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045 establish a two-step procedure for a criminal defendant\u2019s discovery of peace officer records. <em>(California Highway Patrol </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1019 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 379].) First, pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043, the defendant must file a written motion for discovery, including a description of the type of information sought, and supported by affidavits showing, among other things, good cause for the discovery and setting forth the materiality of the requested information to the subject matter of the pending litigation. <em>(People v. Mooc, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1226; <em>California Highway Patrol, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 1019.) The threshold for discovery embodied in Evidence Code section 1043 is \u201crelatively low.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 83 [260 Cal.Rptr. 520, 776 P.2d 222] <em>(City of Santa Cruz); Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 10.) The accused \u201c \u2018may compel discovery by demonstrating that the requested information will facilitate the ascertainment of the facts and a fair trial.\u2019 [Citation.] In contrast to the detailed showing required by some civil discovery statutes [citations], the requisite showing in a criminal matter \u2018may be satisfied by general allegations which establish some cause for discovery\u2019 other than a mere desire for all information in the possession of the prosecution.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 84\u201485; <em>Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"AEC\">If a defendant shows good cause, the trial court examines the relevant materials in camera to determine whether disclosure should be made. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1045, subd. (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mooc, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1226; <em>City of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 83.) The \u201crelatively relaxed\u201d standards for a showing of good cause under Evidence Code section 1043, subdivision (b), i.e., \u201cmateriality\u201d to the subject matter of the pending litigation and a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the agency has the type of information sought, ensure that all potentially relevant documents will be produced for inspection. Evidence Code section 1045\u2019s in camera review procedure and disclosure guidelines, on the other hand, balance the officer\u2019s privacy interests against the defendant\u2019s need for disclosure. <em>(Alford v. Superior Court, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">c. <em>The statutory Pitchess procedure does not unconstitutionally infringe upon Gutierrez\u2019s due process rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">Gutierrez must meet a heavy burden to prevail upon his claim that the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures are unconstitutional. <em>(Brandon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 10.) \u201c \u2018The courts will presume a statute is constitutional unless its unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears; all presumptions and intendments favor its validity.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Contrary to Gutierrez\u2019s assertion, the <em>Pitchess </em>scheme does not unconstitutionally trump a defendant\u2019s right to exculpatory evidence as delineated in <em>Brady. </em>Instead, the two schemes operate in tandem. <em>\u201cPitchess . . . </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>and its statutory progeny are based on the premise that evidence contained in a law enforcement officer\u2019s personnel file may be relevant to an accused\u2019s criminal defense and that to withhold such relevant evidence from the defendant would violate the accused\u2019s due process right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mooc, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1227.) <em>Brandon </em>rejected a claim that Evidence Code section 1045\u2019s five-year limitation on discovery was contrary to <em>Brady </em>and violated a defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 11-12.) <em>Brandon </em>explained that the \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cPitchess </em>process\u201d operates in parallel with <em>Brady </em>and does not prohibit the disclosure of <em>Brady </em>information.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 14; see also <em>People v. Mooc, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1225 <em>[Pitchess </em>procedural mechanism \u201cmust be viewed against the larger background of the prosecution\u2019s constitutional obligation to disclose to a defendant material exculpatory evidence so as not to infringe the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">In other words, the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures implement <em>Brady </em>rather than undercut it, because a defendant who cannot meet the less stringent <em>Pitchess </em>standard cannot establish <em>Brady </em>materiality. \u201cOur state statutory scheme allowing defense discovery of certain officer personnel records creates both a broader and lower threshold for disclosure than does the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. 83. Unlike <em>Brady, </em>California\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>discovery scheme entitles a defendant to information that will \u2018facilitate the ascertainment of the facts\u2019 at trial [citation], that is, \u2018all information pertinent to the defense\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 14.)  To obtain disclosure \u201c[u]nder <em>Pitchess, </em>a defendant need only show that the information sought is material \u2018to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Because Brady\u2019s constitutional materiality standard is narrower than the Pitchess requirements, any citizen complaint that meets Brady\u2019s test of materiality necessarily meets the relevance standard for disclosure under Pitchess. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 10, italics added.) Thus, if a defendant meets the good cause requirement for <em>Pitchess </em>discovery, any <em>Brady </em>material in an officer\u2019s file will necessarily be included. Stated conversely, if a defendant cannot meet the less stringent <em>Pitchess </em>materiality standard, he or she cannot meet the more taxing <em>Brady </em>materiality requirement. Therefore, Gutierrez\u2019s premise, that <em>\u201cBrady </em>dictates more generous discovery than <em>Pitchess,\u201d </em>is flawed in respect to the issue presented here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Gutierrez\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor was obliged to conduct a review of the files of \u201call significant police officer witnesses\u201d and disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>any <em>Brady </em>material likewise fails. The <em>Pitchess </em>procedure is the only avenue by which citizen complaints may be discovered. <em>(People v. Jordan, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.) <em>Alford </em>held that a prosecutor is not entitled to the fruits of a successful <em>Pitchess </em>motion made by the defense. <em>(Alford, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1046.) While the prosecution is free to seek such information by bringing its own <em>Pitchess </em>motion in compliance with the procedures set forth in Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045, \u201c[ajbsent such compliance . . . <em>peace officer personnel records retain their confidentially vis-a-vis the prosecution.\u201d (Alford, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1046, italics added.) Given <em>Alford\u2019s </em>limitation on disclosure to prosecutors, the <em>Brady </em>review suggested by Gutierrez is not tenable. As we recently explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at page 358, a \u201cprosecutor\u2019s duty under <em>Brady </em>to disclose material exculpatory evidence applies to evidence the prosecutor, or the prosecution team, <em>knowingly possesses or has the right to possess\u201d </em>that is \u201cactually or constructively in its possession or accessible to it.\u201d (Italics added.) Because under <em>Alford </em>the prosecutor does not generally have the right to possess and does not have access to confidential peace officer files, Gutierrez\u2019s argument for routine review of the complete files of all police officer witnesses in a criminal proceeding necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Gutierrez\u2019s further argument that the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>scheme offends constitutional due process by requiring that a defendant establish good cause for the disclosure of evidence the prosecution is already \u201cunder a pre-existing obligation to provide,\u201d is likewise unavailing. First, as we have explained, <em>Alford\u2019s </em>holding obviously prohibits a prosecutor from routinely reviewing peace officer personnel files, and therefore implicitly suggests that imposition of the <em>Pitchess </em>good cause requirement is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Second, a demonstration of materiality is a valid prerequisite to the disclosure of evidence in conditionally privileged state agency files, such as the peace officer records at issue here. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 39 [94 L.Ed.2d 40, 107 S.Ct. 989] <em>(Ritchie), </em>the defendant was charged with molesting his 13-year-old daughter. He sought disclosure of reports compiled by the state protective services agency that had investigated the charges. Because the records were conditionally privileged under Pennsylvania law, the agency refused to disclose them. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to discover exculpatory evidence did not \u201cinclude the unsupervised authority to search through\u201d the state\u2019s files. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 59.) Both the defendant\u2019s and the state\u2019s interest could be protected by requiring that the files be submitted to the trial court for an in camera review, in which the court could ascertain whether the records contained <em>Brady </em>material, i.e., evidence that probably would have changed the outcome of his trial. <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>at pp. 57-61.) Most significant here, the Court further clarified: \u201c[The defendant], of course, may not require the trial court to search through the [agency] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>file without first establishing a basis for his claim that it contains material evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 58, fn. 15; <em>Brandon, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 14-15 [citing Ritchie].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">The material at issue here is conditionally privileged under California law. The <em>Pitchess </em>statutory scheme \u201c \u2018carefully balances two directly conflicting interests: the peace officer\u2019s just claim to confidentiality, and the criminal defendant\u2019s equally compelling interest in all information pertinent to his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Alford, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1039, quoting <em>City of Santa Cruz, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 81-84.) Therefore, <em>Brady </em>is not violated by requiring disclosure only after an in camera review conditioned upon a showing of materiality. <em>(Brandon, supra, </em>at p. 15.) Accordingly, we discern no constitutional infirmity in the statutory <em>Pitchess </em>procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">B.-R<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Klein, P.
