Keller <em>v. </em>Roberts.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b109-4\">[April, 1847.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-5\">The legislature can compel witnesses to answer questions, the answers to which may not show them to be criminal, but may involve them in shame and reproach: <em>therefore, </em>a witness may be compelled to answer, under the act of 16th March, 1847, whether he has purchased lottery tickets from the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">This was a <em>habeas corpus, </em>directed to Edward Roberts, a constable. It appeared that one Edward Parker had been charged, before Alderman Brazer, with the offence of selling lottery tickets; on the hearing of which case the relator, Peter Keller, was called as a witness. The' following question was asked him: \u2014 \u201c Did you ever purchase any lottery tickets from the defendant ?\u201d \u2014 which he refused to \u2019answer, alleging that his answer to the question would involve him in shame and reproach. Whereupon, the aider-man committed him until he should fully answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">The act of 16th March, 1847, <em>[Pamph.p. </em>476,) provides that \u201cthe purchaser of any such lottery ticket shall not be held liable to punishment by this or any other law of the state, <em>but shall be a competent witness in the cause P</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Doran, for the relator, argued,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzQ\">\u2014 1. That the act of assembly does not relieve the purchasers of tickets from their liability for the purch\u00e1se of any other ticket than that which forms the subject of the indictment. That the acts of 1762 and 1833, making the sale or purchase of tickets a crime, was still in force; and if a person testified that he bought any other ticket than that which forms the subject of the indictment, he could be punished therefor. 2. That the answer might involve him in shame and reproach.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-5\">Champneys, attorney general,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASK\">examined at length the doctrine of privilege as laid down by the English and American authorities.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-6\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">\u2014 The constitution provides that no person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself. If the question were, as to whether he had committed murder, felony, or other crimes against the law of nature, he would be protected. But the legislature can compel witnesses to answer questions, the answers to which may not show them to be criminal, but may involve them in shame and reproach. The prohibition against the sale of lottery tickets is a statutory offence only. The purchase and sale of them was formerly recognised by our laws, and is still sanctioned in many states of the union. Apart from the legislative prohibition, founded in public policy, no disgrace could be attached to those who buy or sell them. If the relator were fraudulently insolvent, in consequence of the purchase of lottery tickets, and he were asked if such was not the cause of his failure, he could not be compelled to answer. The act of assembly applies to such a case as the present: the prisoner is, therefore, remanded, until the question is answered. Relator remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Mr. Keller gave security for his future appearance before the alderman, to answer the question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
