Secondly, no authority was given by the warrant to enter the judgment at the December term. It read, \u201c to confess judgment against me as of the last, next, or any subsequent term,\u201d thereby excluding authority to enter judgment at the then present term. A warrant to appear and confess judgment of a particular term must be entered of that term, and cannot be entered of any other. Bing, on Judgments 44; 2 Ch. Arch. Pr. 679. Thirdly, the prothonotary, in entering the judgment, had not complied with the act of 24th February, 1806, (Purd. Dig. 256,) which requires him \u201c particularly to enter on his docket the date and tenor of the' instrument of writing on which the judgment is founded.\u201d The prothonotary had not entered on his docket the special agreement for the stay of execution, which was an essential part of the warrant, and of great consequence to the defendant: certainly a part of the tenor of the instrument. <em>Helvete </em>v. <em>Rapp, </em>7 S. &amp; R. 306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-4\">As to the execution, it was a conclusive objection to it, that it had been issued without a <em>scire facias </em>having been first sued out, or any suggestion put upon the record of the happening of any of the contingencies named in the warrant, or without leave of the court. The docket showed that none of the notes had matured; and it did not show the happening of any event which would entitle the plaintiff to execution. It must first appear that the defendant has made default, which could not be properly done except by a <em>scire facias. </em>The cases showed such a step to be necessary. <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 Penn. Rep. 460; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>5 Watts 289. It was true, the plaintiff had taken depositions to prove the dissolution of the partnership, but it was sufficient for the defendant to deny that fact, and to ask the court to direct an issue to be formed to decide the question, or else require the plaintiff to sue out a <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-5\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Lex, </em>for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS\">argued that the entry by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the prothonotary of judgment, without filing a <em>narr. </em>was good, although the warrant only authorized such an entry after declaration filed; \u2014 they relied on the 28th section of act of February 24, 1806; <em>Helvete </em>v. Rapp, 7 S. &amp; R. 306; <em>Com. </em>v. Conard, 1 R. 249; \u2014 that an execution might be issued without a <em>sci. fa. </em>or notice to defendant, and without first obtaining leave of the court \u2014 and that upon the happening of either of the events specified in the condition of the bond, the whole of the amount intended to be secured, became due. <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>6 S. &amp; R. 163; <em>Smith </em>v. James, 1 Miles 162; <em>Monell </em>v. Smith, 5 Cowen 441.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-4\"><em>Brooke, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFJ\">adverted to the fact that this rule was obtained at the instance of the defendant, and not upon the application of a creditor, as appeared to be the case in several of the authorities cited on the other side. He remarked, that.judgments were frequently sustained between creditors, which would be held to be void in a contest between the parties. In <em>Helvete </em>v. <em>Rapp, </em>the defence was taken by a judgment creditor. The terms of the warrant are omitted in the report, but it is not alleged in any part of the case, that the docket entry did not set forth particularly the \u201cdate and tenor\u201d of the bond. The question presented was, whether, notwithstanding all the particulars were spread upon the docket, the omission of the prothonotary to state, in words, that judgment was entered, rendered the entry nugatory. This case does not bear any analogy to the present. The <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conard, </em>was an action against the prothonotary for an alleged breach of duty in omitting to enter on his docket the stay of execution provided for in the warrant of attorney, and the question was whether, under the circumstances, in the absence of particular instructions, the prothonotary acted in bad faith. Neither of these authorities touch the positions taken by the defendant. The cases cited in support of these positions, clearly show that the entry of this judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ment is not in accordance with the warrant, nor in pursuance of the act of assembly; and it is therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\">But even if the judgment was regularly entered, the execution cannot stand. It is alleged that one of the contingencies mentioned in the warrant has arisen, to wit, the dissolution of the partnership. What constitutes a dissolution may be a question, and upon that point the defendant has a right to be heard before a tribunal competent to determine the fact. The establishment of this fact is necessary to entitle the plaintiff to issue the execution. He cannot assume it, and call upon the defendant to disprove it. He must show affirmatively that the event has happened. And for this purpose a <em>scire facias </em>should have been issued. <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>has been relied upon as a case in point to show that a <em>sci.fa. </em>was unnecessary. The facts in some respects are similar, but in that case there was an explicit admission, upon the record, by the defendant\u2019s attorney, at the time of confessing the judgment, that the partnership was dissolved. This rendered a <em>scire facias </em>useless. The other cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel belong to a peculiar class, and are easily distinguishable from the present.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b84-6\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">\u2014 (After consulting with Mr. Justice Kennedy, who came into court at the close of the argument,) pronounced his decision as follows: \u2014 The first objection which has been taken to the judgment is, that it was entered without a declaration having been filed, according to the terms of the warrant, which is of an anomalous character, as it and the bond are incorporated together, and form in fact but one instrument. But I think that a strict compliance with such a clause in a warrant of attorney accompanying a bond, has been dispensed with by the act of 24th February, 1806. The 28th section of that act requires the prothonotary of any court of record within this commonwealth, on the application of any person being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>holder of any instrument of writing containing a warr\u00e1nt to any attorney at law to confess judgment, to enter the judgment without the agency of an attorney, or declaration filed. This section seems to control the language contained in the warrant of attorney in this case. It is next urged that the judgment has been entered of the wrong term. It appears to me, however, that the expression \u201c last term,\u201d in a warrant, includes the term of the execution of a bond and warrant, as the words are referable to the commencement of the existing or present term. It is also contended that the omission of the prothonotary to transcribe on the docket the terms of the agreement for stay of execution, avoids the entry of the judgment. Such an objection might, as in the cases cited in support of this point, be of consequence between the plaintiff and the prothonotary, or between the plaintiff* and the sheriff*, but it is a matter of no importance as between the plaintiff* and defendant, on a question as to the validity of the judgment. These are the grounds upon which the rule has been taken to set aside the judgment, but I do not think they are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The objection to the execution is, that the plaintiff* did not first issue a <em>scire facias </em>calling upon the defendant to show cause why the plaintiff* should not have execution of his judgment, because of the happening of. one of the contingencies specified in the warrant, other than the nonpayment of the several notes. lam inclined to think that the plaintiff* was bound to follow this course. The issuing of a <em>scire fdcias </em>is the most direct and appropriate method to ascertain whether the terms upon which execution was to stay, have been violated by the defendant, or whether any of the contingencies upon which it was to issue have ever happened. Here the plaintiff* alleges, that although none of the notes have matured, yet the partnership between the defendant and William Montelius, Jr., has been dissolved, which, if true, would give the plaintiff* a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>issue an execution. But this is denied by the defendant. Can the court decide between the parties ? A partnership may be dissolved in a variety of ways, but only on a certain state of facts which must be established before a jury, and not assumed by the court. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the <em>scire facias </em>must be issued, as the case is somewhat like that of <em>Adams </em>v. Bush, 5 Watts 289, where this court seems to have decided the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Execution set aside.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\"><em> </em>In debt on bond with condition for the payment of money by instalments, the plaintiff must proceed according to the provisions of the statute of 8 &amp; 9 W. 3, c. 11; and, therefore, if judgment be obtained for want of an affidavit of defence or otherwise, in such action commenced by writ, the plaintiff cannot have execution upon motion as to instalments falling due after the impetration of the writ; but must proceed by <em>scire facias, </em>&amp;c. <em>Longstreth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>1 Watts 60. But it is otherwise upon a judgment by bond and warrant of attorney, without writ, for the payment of money by instalments, for then, though the better course is to move the court for leave to issue execution for a particular sum, in the first instance, yet this is not the only course, and an inquiry as to whether too much is demanded is equally open to the defendant after execution as before. <em>Skidmore </em>v. Bradford, 4 Barr 296. Judgments on warrants of attorney have never been considered as within the statute. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>6 Barr 465; <em>Bank of Chester </em>v. <em>Ralston, </em>7 Barr 482.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
