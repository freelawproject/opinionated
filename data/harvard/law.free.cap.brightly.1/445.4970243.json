Though the principle has been recognised as a general one it seems to have been thought that in all cases where a grantee takes an estate by a deed poll, he may be compelled to perform the conditions of the grant by an action of covenant, instead of an action of debt or assumpsit; and this supposition had its root in the case obscurely stated in Co. Litt. 331 a; but it is clearly shown by Mr. Platt, the only lawyer who has searched the original roll, that there has been a prodigious misconception of the language of Lord Coke, which was predicated, not of an action of covenant, but of an action of debt. Yet the same misconception existed in the mind of Chief Justice Abbott, in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>5 B. &amp; C. 589, by which, however, he affirmed the principle to which he supposed the case put by Lord Coke to be an exception. But the singularity of the exception ought to have sent the-profession to the year-books for the original cases to which references were given, and in which they would have found that the action in each of them was not covenant but debt. It ought to have occurred to them that forms of pleading are touchstones of the law, and that the most dexterous pleader would find himself unable to make a successful profert of a deed poll as the act of one who had not sealed it. Mutual covenants may be contained in the same instrument; but each party must seal and deliver his own, exactly as if they were contained in the several parts of it.\u201d 7 Barr, 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
