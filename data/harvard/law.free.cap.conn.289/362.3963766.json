We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the present appeal. On November 21, 2006, the plaintiff, Aimee L. Dutkiewicz, served the defendant with a complaint seeking the dissolution of their marriage. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a) (6), this filing triggered an automatic order requiring the parties to attend a parenting education program, designed by the judicial branch, as authorized by \u00a7 46b-69b, within sixty days of the return day, which was set for December 5, 2006. On December 7, 2006, the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-69b (b), filed a motion for exemption from the parenting program on the ground that it is unconstitutional to require a parent to attend such a program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 6, 2007, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-69b and denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The trial court concluded that \u00a7 46b-69b is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>because it applies only to parents with minor children who are parties to one of four specified family law actions; see Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a); and has as its purpose maintaining familial harmony through a difficult transition. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the outset, because the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-69b (b) (1), approved the parties\u2019 agreement not to participate in the parenting education program; see footnote 5 of this opinion; we first must address whether the present appeal is moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>264 Conn. 498, 505, 823 A.2d 1208 (2003); <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 492-93, 778 A.2d 33 (2001). In the present action, because the trial court ultimately waived the defendant\u2019s participation in the parenting education program, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>we cannot grant the defendant any practical relief. Accordingly, unless the defendant\u2019s claim falls under an exception to the mootness doctrine, the claim is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The mootness doctrine does not preclude a court from addressing an issue that is \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 378, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). \u201c[F]or an otherwise moot question to qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 382-83. We discuss these three requirements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The first requirement is that the challenged action \u201cmust be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded.\u201d Id., 382. As we stated in <em>Loisel, </em>a party typically satisfies this prong if there exists a \u201cfunctionally insurmountable time [constraint].\u201d Id., 383. The statutory structure of the parenting education requirement establishes such a time constraint. Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a) (6) requires parents to attend the parenting education program within sixty days of the return day. Given this requirement, there is a strong likelihood that few, if any, appellate claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>challenging the validity of \u00a7 46b-69b could be resolved within the sixty day period. The present appeal illustrates this principle. The plaintiff initiated the present action by serving the defendant on November 21, 2006, automatically triggering the sixty day period, measured from the return date of December 5, 2006, within which the parties had to comply with the parenting education requirement set forth in \u00a7 46b-69b. See Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a). Service of the complaint on the defendant simultaneously triggered a ninety day waiting period, also measured from the return date, required by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-67 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 46b-67 (a), the trial court cannot even <em>hear </em>the case until after the ninety day period expires, which is thirty days after the expiration of the sixty day period set by \u00a7 46b-69b for compliance with the parenting education program. See Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a). Even assuming that the trial court rendered a judgment of dissolution immediately upon hearing the case, and that one of the parties immediately appealed from the \u00a7 46b-69b automatic order, the time for compliance with that order already would have passed, and the trial court either would have waived the requirement or not. In either scenario, the issue would evade review because it would have been rendered moot. That is precisely what happened in the present case. As measured from the return date of December 5, 2006, the parties had sixty days within which to comply with the automatic order\u2014by February 5, 2007. The court did not render a judgment of final dissolution until March 27, 2007, a few weeks after the \u00a7 46b-67 ninety day waiting period had expired. Prior to rendering the judgment of dissolution, the court had denied the defendant\u2019s motion for exemption from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the parenting education requirement. At the time of the judgment, however, the court waived the requirement because the parties had agreed not to participate in the program. By the time the defendant filed this appeal, the time period for compliance with the parenting education requirement already had passed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u201cSecond, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate.\u201d <em>Loisel </em>v. Rowe, supra, 233 Conn. 382. \u201cThis analysis entails two separate inquiries: (1) whether the question presented will recur at all; and (2) whether the interests of the people likely to be affected by the question presented are adequately represented in the current litigation.\u201d Id., 384. With respect to the first question, it is clear that the issue is likely to recur because Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a) (6) specifies that an automatic order requiring participation in the parenting education program, as authorized by \u00a7 46b-69b, will be issued for any parent with minor children, in an action for dissolution of a marriage or civil union, legal separation, annulment, or application for custody or visitation. With respect to the second question, because \u00a7 46b-69b (b) provides that \u201c[n]o party shall be required to participate in such program more than once,\u201d the requirement cannot affect the same complaining party. Accordingly, we must determine whether the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>can act as a surrogate for a reasonably identifiable group. The surrogate requirement is necessary to ensure that \u201cjudicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each side fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 385. \u201cThis premise, however, does not mandate a strict rule that the identical party must be likely to be affected in the future. See, e.g., <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>[228 Conn. 106, 115, 635 A.2d 285 (1993), after remand, 232 Conn. 175, 653 A.2d 157 (1995)] (noting that [n]o one factor [including the same person factor] is controlling).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 385. \u201cThere is, nonetheless, a need for some nexus between the litigating party and those people who may be affected by the court\u2019s ruling in the future. It is this nexus that the \u2018surrogacy\u2019 concept addresses.\u201d Id., 386. Ultimately, whether a party is an appropriate surrogate must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Id., 387. On the present record, there is nothing to indicate that the defendant cannot serve as an adequate surrogate for other parents with minor children who are subject to the automatic order. See id. (noting that plaintiff certainly would qualify as surrogate for other general assistance recipients). Although we are careful to observe that both parties are proceeding pro se, we note both our lenient rules with respect to pro se parties and also that, at this point in our jurisprudence, we have not established a minimum requirement for adequacy of representation within the surrogacy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Third, the claim must have some public importance. \u201cThe requirement of public importance is largely self-explanatory.\u201d Id. \u201cConsideration of the importance of the issue represents a sound means for distinguishing those cases that should be reviewed and those that should not.\u201d Id. <em>In Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 216, 789 A.2d 431 (2002), we recognized that \u201cparents\u2019 inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>est in the care, custody and control of their children, [i]s \u2018perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the Supreme] Court.\u2019 <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>[530 U.S. 57, 65,120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000)].\u201d As we discuss in part II of this opinion, because the present claim raises the question of whether \u00a7 46b-69b infringes on the fundamental right of a parent to raise his or her children free from unnecessary governmental interference, we conclude that the claim raises an issue of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Because the defendant has satisfied the three-pronged test outlined in <em>Loisel, </em>his claim falls under the exception to the mootness doctrine for claims that are capable of repetition but evading review. We turn next to the defendant\u2019s substantive claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 46b-69b is facially unconstitutional because it violates his right to substantive due process guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the statute unconstitutionally infringes on a parent\u2019s right to exercise care, custody and control over his or her child because, absent a showing of harm to the child or parental unfitness, the state does not have a compelling interest to issue an automatic order for the parties to attend the parenting education program. The trial court observed that, consistent with United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>States Supreme Court jurisprudence, a parent\u2019s interest in making decisions concerning the care, custody and control of his or her child is a fundamental right. The trial court concluded, however, that \u201c[o]n its face, the language of the statute fails to implicate the care, custody or control that a parent exercises over a child.\u201d Despite this conclusion, the trial court nonetheless applied strict scrutiny and held that the statute was constitutional. The trial court concluded that the statute was narrowly tailored, in that it applies only to parents with minor children who are parties to four specified family law actions; see Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a); and that the statute achieved a compelling state interest by aiming to maintain familial harmony through a difficult transition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We first note that \u201c[t]he constitutionality of a statute presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. ... It is well established that a validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, [and that] those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The court will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality .... Therefore, [w]hen a question of constitutionality is raised, courts must approach it with caution, examine it with care, and sustain the legislation unless its invalidity is clear.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 500, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">At the outset, we must determine the level of scrutiny that applies to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim. We agree that a parent\u2019s interest in the care, custody and control over his or her child is a fundamental right. In <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 66, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]n light of [its] extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>precedent, it cannot now be doubted that the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause of the [fourteenth [a]mendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d See also <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 218 (stating that \u201cconsistent with the [United States Supreme] [C]ourt\u2019s determination that a parent\u2019s interest in the care, custody and control over his or her children is perhaps one of the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by [the] [c]ourt . . . the application of the strict scrutiny test is required to any <em>infringement </em>it may suffer\u201d [citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]). If \u00a7 46b-69b <em>infringes </em>on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to exercise care, custody and control over his or her child, we must apply strict scrutiny. We conclude, however, that \u00a7 46b-69b does not inflinge on this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">It is necessary to describe the contours of this fundamental right. <em>In Roth v. Weston, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 228-29, we relied on United States Supreme Court precedent to conclude that government interference with a parent\u2019s right to raise his or her child is justified only when it can be demonstrated that there is a compelling need to protect the child from harm. Because the defendant in this case has advanced his claim solely on the basis of the federal constitution, we look to federal law. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s case law discussing the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of his or her children has focused on whether the government has interfered with the parent\u2019s exercise of that decision making. For example, in one of the earlier, and certainly one of the most influential cases on this issue, <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 530, 536, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925), the court struck down an Oregon compulsory education law that required children ages eight to sixteen to attend public school. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>affirming the parents\u2019 right to send their children to private school, the court stated that the law \u201cunreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. . . . The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this [u]nion repose excludes any general power of the [s]tate to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.\u201d Id., 534-35. In other words, the court concluded that the state did not have the power to make the decision whether children should attend public or private school; the fundamental right to make that decision rested with the parents. Id. The court observed that a decision to send a child to private school, as opposed to public school, was \u201cnot inherently harmful . . . .\u201d Id., 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>supra, 268 U.S. 534, the court relied in part on its decision in <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 397, 403, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923), in which it held unconstitutional a Nebraska law that forbade foreign language instruction in any school until the pupil had attained and successfully passed the eighth grade. Under that law, even if a parent wanted his or her pre-eighth grade child to learn French, German, Italian or Spanish, the state prohibited such instruction. Id., 401. The court held that the legislature, in enacting the prohibition, \u201c[had] attempted materially to interfere . . . with the power of parents to control the education of their own.\u201d Id. The court noted that \u201cproficiency in foreign language ... is not injurious to the health, morals or understanding of the ordinary child.\u201d Id., 403. The court characterized the prohibition as an attempt on the part of the state to \u201cfoster a homogeneous people\u201d; id., 402; and compared the law to the proposal of Plato in The Republic, to separate children from their parents at birth, and entrust the rearing and education of the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>dren to persons in his envisioned utopian society whose sole job and particular expertise was to provide such services. Id., 401-402; Plato, Republic of Plato (Benjamin Jowett trans., Oxford University Press 3d Ed. 1888) Book V, p. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">More recently, in <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 207, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972), Amish parents challenged the constitutionality of a Wisconsin compulsory school attendance statute that required children to attend public or private school up to age sixteen. In that case, the parents had sought to remove their children from schooling at the ages of fourteen and fifteen, so that the children could focus more intently on their faith and be free from the dangers that modem society presented to the Amish lifestyle. Id., 207 n.1, 209. The state prosecuted and convicted the parents for violation of the statute. Id., 208. In holding the statute unconstitutional, the court noted that the case implicated \u201cthe fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of the [sjtate, to guide the religious future and education of their children.\u201d Id., 232. The court concluded that the fundamental right may be infringed only \u201cif it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.\u201d Id., 233-34. The court concluded that the Amish children would not be harmed by receiving an Amish education. Id., 230, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 60-61, a mother challenged the constitutionality of a Washington visitation statute after the paternal grandparents of her children sought additional visitation after the death of their son. The statute in that case stated that \u201c[a]ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited to, custody proceedings. The court may order visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child whether or not there has been any change of circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>stances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 61; Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 26.10.160 (3) (1994). \u201cPursuant to \u00a7 26.10.160 (3), the trial court awarded the grandparents more visitation than the mother desired. <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 61. In striking down the statute as unconstitutional, the court concluded that \u201cthe [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause does not permit a [s]tate to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a \u2018better\u2019 decision could be made.\u201d Id., 72-73. Under the facts presented, the court was reluctant to uphold the statute as constitutional as applied, absent a showing of parental unfitness. Id., 68. The court characterized the trial court\u2019s decision thusly: \u201c[T]his case involves nothing more than a simple disagreement between the Washington Superior Court and [the mother] concerning her children\u2019s best interests.\u201d Id., 72. Put another way, the trial court impermissibly substituted its own decision regarding the best interest of the children in place of the mother\u2019s decision, thus infringing on her fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Finally, we look to our decision in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 202, which, like the present case, applied federal constitutional law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The factual background <em>in Roth </em>was similar to the background in <em>Troxel. </em>In <em>Roth, </em>this court considered the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59, which allowed a court to \u201cgrant right of visitation to any person . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 204 n.1. In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 46b-59 was unconstitutional as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to the facts of <em>Roth, </em>\u201cto the extent that the trial court, pursuant to the statute, permitted third party visitation contrary to the desires of a fit parent and in the absence of any allegation and proof by clear and convincing evidence that the children would suffer actual, significant harm if deprived of the visitation.\u201d Id., 205-206. We concluded that the statute implicated the fundamental right of parents \u201cto make decisions regarding [the child\u2019s] care, control, education, health, religion and association.\u201d Id., 216-17. We agreed, however, with Justice Kennedy\u2019s caution in his dissent in <em>Troxel, </em>that courts \u201cmust use considerable restraint, including careful adherence to the incremental instruction given by the precise facts of particular cases, as they seek to give further and more precise definition to the right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 214, quoting <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 95-96 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In <em>Roth, </em>we referred to <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981), to explain the nature of the right: \u201cThe family entity is the core foundation of modem civilization. The constitutionally protected interest of parents <em>to raise their children without interference </em>undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection of the greatest possible magnitude.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra, 228. In other words, we stated, the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of his or her children protects against \u201cunwarranted intrusion[s] into family autonomy.\u201d Id., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">From the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that the question of whether the parental right to exercise care, custody and control over children is infringed must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Id., 214, citing <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 95-96 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). On the other hand, although the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>case law indicates that it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly when the state oversteps its bounds and infringes on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise his or her children; see <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 96; the contours of the right are not completely amorphous. All of the cases in which the United States Supreme Court or this court, in applying federal constitutional standards, have concluded that the parental right to exercise care, custody and control over children was implicated, involved situations in which the state intervened and substituted its decision making for that of the parents. The result is that a parent\u2019s <em>decision </em>with respect to the care, custody and control of his or her child cannot be overridden by the state in the absence of a showing that the parent is unfit or that the parent\u2019s decision will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or will have a potential to impose significant social burdens. See, e.g., <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>supra, 406 U.S. 233-34; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 228-29. It is axiomatic that to infringe on this fundamental right, the state must in some way attempt to override or at least limit<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the <em>decision </em>of a parent with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>care, custody and control over his or her child. Such is not the case here. In other words, for there to be an infringement of this fundamental right that triggers strict scrutiny, the hand of the state must intrude improperly into the parent\u2019s decision-making authority over his or her child. In each of the United States Supreme Court cases, the parent\u2019s decision with respect to his or her child was squarely at odds with the state\u2019s decision. In <em>Troxel, </em>the parent wanted to limit third party visitation, and the state did not; <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 60-61; in <em>Yoder, </em>the parents wanted to give their children an Amish education, and the state wanted them to continue to attend public school; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>supra, 207-208; in <em>Pierce, </em>the state sought to prevent parents from choosing to send their children to private school; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>supra, 268 U.S. 530; and in <em>Meyer, </em>the state sought to prohibit parents from choosing to instruct their children in a foreign language before the eighth grade. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>supra, 262 U.S. 396-97.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the present action there is no such intrusion on the parent\u2019s decision-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A closer examination of the statute\u2019s provisions will illuminate this point. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-69b (a), \u201c \u2018parenting education program\u2019 means a course designed by the Judicial Department to <em>educate </em>persons, including unmarried parents, on the impact on children of the restructuring of families.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46b-69b (a) also provides that \u201c[t]he course shall include, but not be limited to, <em>information </em>on the developmental stages of children, adjustment of children to parental separation, dispute resolution and conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>management, guidelines for visitation, stress reduction in children and cooperative parenting.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear from the text of the statute that the purpose of the course is to educate parents and provide them with information aimed at lessening the adverse impact on children that may result from the restructuring of the family. As the trial court concluded, \u201c[o]n its face, the language of the statute fails to implicate the care, custody or control that a parent exercises over a child.\u201d We agree. The course merely provides information to parents regarding the effects of family restructuring on children. Although the legislature intended to provide useful educational material, what parents choose to do with the information is entirely up to them. Parents can choose to apply the skills gleaned from the course or parents can choose the opposite\u2014that is, to ignore the information and to <em>decline to </em>use it in their familial interactions. There is no legal requirement for parents to use the information in exercising care, custody and control over their children. Nothing in the statute requires parents to make any decision regarding the care, control and custody of their children in accordance with the state\u2019s judgment of what would be in the best interests of the children. Put another way, nothing in the statute requires parents to change the way that they care for their children; nothing in the statute authorizes the state to deprive parents of control or custody of their children. It merely requires parents who are using the court system to effect a significant change in the family unit\u2014one likely to impact both the parents and the children\u2014to attend a parenting education course.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Moreover, the education program does not involve the children themselves. There is no requirement that the children attend any of the presentations. The statute does not authorize the providers to enter the home. Nor does the statute authorize the providers to interview or counsel the children. We conclude that \u00a7 46b-69b does not infringe on parents\u2019 fundamental right to <em>exercise </em>care, custody and control over their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because \u00a7 46b-69b does not violate a fundamental right, rational basis review applies. See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 728, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (applying rational basis review upon concluding that Washington law did not infringe on fundamental right); see also <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>193 Conn. 93, 105, 475 A.2d 289 (1984) (applying rational basis test after concluding that school board decision did not infringe on fundamental right to elementary and secondary education under state constitution). Under rational basis review, if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, then the law is held valid. \u201cThe court\u2019s function ... is to decide whether the purpose of the legislation is a legitimate one and whether the particular enactment is designed to accomplish that purpose in a fair and reasonable way. If an enactment meets this test, it satisfies the constitutional requirements of due process . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 315, 417 A.2d 343 (1979). \u201cIn determining whether the challenged classification is rationally related to a legitimate public interest, we are mindful that [t]he test . . . is whether this court can conceive of a rational basis for sustaining the legislation; we need not have evidence that the legislature actually acted upon that basis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Contractor's Supply of Waterbury, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>283 Conn. 86, 93, 925 A.2d 1071 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(2007). \u201cRational basis review is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification .... [I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. ... To succeed, the party challenging the legislation must negative every conceivable basis which might support it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 46b-69b is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, that is, the state\u2019s legitimate interest in promoting the welfare of children. See, e.g., <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Bazzetta, </em>539 U.S. 126, 133, 123 S. Ct. 2162, 156 L. Ed. 2d 162 (2003) (\u201c[protecting children from harm is ... a legitimate goal\u201d); <em>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>518 U.S. 727, 755, 116 S. Ct. 2374, 135 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1996) (protection of children is compelling interest). Section 46b-69b (a) describes the contents and purpose of the parenting education course, stating that it is \u201ca course designed by the Judicial Department to educate persons, including unmarried parents, on the impact on children of the restructuring of families. The course shall include, but not be limited to, information on the developmental stages of children, adjustment of children to parental separation, dispute resolution and conflict management, guidelines for visitation, stress reduction in children and cooperative parenting.\u201d As previously noted in this opinion, the requirement applies in the context of actions for \u201cdissolution of marriage or civil union, legal separation, or annulment, or of an application for custody or visitation.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 25-5 (a). These types of legal actions are likely to impact the welfare of children and simultaneously are likely to present parents with extreme emotional or psychological challenges as the family is restructured.
