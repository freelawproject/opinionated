The plaintiffs in this class action, who are former employees of the defendants, argue that the forfeiture provisions of the plans violate the wage statutes because: (1) they enable the defendants to withhold accrued wages, including bonuses, from their employees; (2) the plaintiffs did not knowingly and voluntarily authorize the deductions; and (3) the state department of labor (department) never approved the deduction form. We answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The record certified by the District Court reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff class representative, William Lomas,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>employed in Connecticut as a broker for the defendant Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., formerly Smith Barney Shearson, from 1994 until 1998, whenhe resigned to join Merrill Lynch. Lomas, like other financial consultants employed by the defendants, participated in the various plans. The March 10, 1994 payroll plan election document that Lomas signed provides in relevant part: \u201cI elect to participate in the Capital Accumulation Plan (CAP) subject to all of the provisions and administrative rules of the Plan. I hereby <em>irrevocably </em>direct my employer, Smith Barney Shearson, to pay me the percent indicated below in the form of restricted stock out of all cash compensation paid to me during the period indicated below. I understand if I leave Smith Barney Shearson voluntarily or am terminated with Cause before the restrictions lapse on shares of restricted stock received under the Plan, <em>I will forfeit the stock as well as the money I am hereby authorizing to be paid in the form of such restricted stock. </em>I further understand and agree that, in the sole discretion of the Committee, the shares to be awarded to me may be issued under another similar plan, on the same terms and conditions as described in the CAP enrollment package sent to me. . . .\u201d (Emphasis altered.) The payroll plan permitted the participating employees to elect to receive 5, 10, 15 or 20 percent of their compensation in the form of restricted stock, and to make that election effective for six month periods, including January through June, 1994, and July through December, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Once the employees elected to participate in the payroll plan, the defendants would deduct the selected percentage from their gross pay and award them restricted stock shares twice each year, with the awards being evidenced by restricted stock award agreements. The number of shares awarded is determined by using the monetaiy value of the employee\u2019s contribution to purchase restricted shares of stock at a 25 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>discount from their fair market value.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That discount reflects the risk of forfeiture and the restrictions on the sale or assignment of the stock, which last for two years from the date of the award. During that two year period, the payroll plan participant may not sell, transfer or assign the restricted shares, and, as stated on the election form, forfeits any unvested shares and the cash compensation used to pinchase those shares if he or she terminates his or her employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The participant does, however, receive dividend or dividend payment equivalents for those restricted shares, and may direct his or her votes even before they vest. Furthermore, under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 83, the participant may defer the payment of taxes on the award of the stock until after the expiration of the restriction period, because the shares are subject to a \u201csubstantial risk of forfeiture ....\"</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Other employees participated in the bonus plan that paid portions of discretionary bonuses to employees in the form of restricted stock. The percentages of the bonuses paid in restricted stock as opposed to cash varied over time, depending on the amount of the bonus and the employee\u2019s total compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>payroll plans, the bonus amounts were used to purchase the restricted shares at a 25 percent discount from the fair market value, and the restricted shareholders could vote their shares and receive dividends and equivalents, as well as defer taxes until after vesting; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 83; but would forfeit the shares and their cash value in the event of termination, either voluntary or for cause. Bonus plans in effect prior to 1994 had a two year restriction period, plans after 1994 had a three year restriction period, and current plans now have staggered vesting schedules that vest 25 percent of the stock on each one year anniversary for four years following the initial award. Smith Barney Shearson retail branch managers participated in similar bonus plans as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">By way of example, Lomas elected to participate in the payroll plan and receive varying percentages of his compensation in the form of restricted stock during his employment, including 20 percent of his compensation during the two six month periods from January through June, 1994, and July through December, 1994. He received 10,981.46 shares of vested Citigroup, Inc., stock, with a market value of $183,536.42 upon vesting, as a result of his participation. When Lomas terminated his employment, however, he forfeited 3105.08 shares of restricted stock. Had he not participated in the plans, Lomas would have received $35,965.96 in cash compensation, rather than forfeiting those shares and the funds used to purchase them.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Lomas filed this class action complaint on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated former employees of the defendants in the Superior Court, alleging that the forfeiture provisions of the plans: (1) violated the wage statutes, specifically General Statutes \u00a7\u00a731-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>71b (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 31-71c<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 31-71e;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) constituted conversion; (3) required the imposition of a constructive trust; (4) breached the fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs; (5) violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (6) constituted unjust enrichment. The defendants removed the action to the United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>for the District of Connecticut pursuant to the federal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, and the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for coordinated pretrial proceedings. Thereafter, the District Court, Keeton, J., certified a class of \u201call former employees of Citigroup [Inc.], Salomon Smith Barney [Inc.], Travelers Group, Inc., or related and affiliated companies in Connecticut who participated in the Capital Accumulation Plan of Citigroup, Inc., Travelers Group, Inc., Travelers, Inc., and/or Primerica Corporation who resigned or who were terminated on or after March 13, 1994 and as a consequence lost the right to receive shares of stock and/or options and/or other earned income under the terms of the plan upon termination.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment pursuant to rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the first count of the complaint, which alleged violations of Connecticut\u2019s wage statutes. The District Court, Keeton, J., denied that motion, noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim presented a question of first impression under Connecticut law. Thereafter, the District Court, Gertner, J., certified the following question of law to this court: \u201cDoes the forfeiture provision of the Citigroup [Inc.] Capital Accumulation Plan violate ... \u00a7 31-71a et seq.?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the forfeiture provisions of the payroll, bonus and branch manager plans violate the wage statutes because: (1) the defendants did not pay their employees the wages due, but, rather, made payroll deductions that are unauthorized by the wage statutes; (2) the wage deductions were not knowingly and voluntarily authorized by the employees; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the department did not approve the wage deduction form. We conclude that the bonuses, including those paid to branch managers, are discretionary merit bonuses not subject to Connecticut\u2019s wage statutes. With respect to the payroll plan, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 consent to the deductions was knowing and voluntary, and that the defendants\u2019 failure to receive the department\u2019s approval of the form does not invalidate the deductions or provide a right of action for the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Analysis of the certified question in this case requires us to begin with the threshold question of whether the various plan deductions are themselves \u201c '[w]ages,\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We begin with the bonus and branch manager plans. Citing numerous Superior Court decisions; see footnote 14 of this opinion; the plaintiffs claim that these bonus plans constitute wages subject to \u00a7 31-71a et seq. In response, the defendants argue that the bonuses were not wages because they were not linked to the ascertainable work performed by an individual, but rather, were discretionary and tied to the performance and profitability of the defendants\u2019 firms. We agree with the defendants, and conclude that the bonus and branch manager plans did not constitute wages under the wage statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Whether a bonus constitutes a wage under \u00a7 31-71a (3) \u201craises a question of statutory construction, which is a [question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ing the question of whether the language does so apply. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan </em>Cos., 286 Conn. 454, 464-65, 944 A.2d 315 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We begin with the text of \u00a7 31-71a (3), which defines \u201c \u2018[w]ages\u2019 \u201d as \u201ccompensation for labor or services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece, commission or other basis of calculation . . . .\u2019\u2019In our view, the statutory language is ambiguous because it is subject to two different reasonable readings: A bonus, even if discretionary or not specifically tied to identifiable extra work performed by an employee, could be considered \u201ccompensation for labor or services rendered\u201d by that employee; General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (3); it similarly is reasonable to read that language as linked expressly to identifiable extra work or services performed by a particular employee. Accordingly, \u00a7 l-2z permits us to consult extratextual sources in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>We first note that the legislative history from when \u00a7 31-71a (3) was enacted as No. 714, \u00a7 1, of the 1967 Public Acts, is silent about whether a bonus constitutes a wage. We find, however, the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Truelove </em>v. <em>Northeast Capital &amp; Advisory, Inc., </em>95 N.Y.2d 220, 738 N.E.2d 770, 715 N.Y.S.2d 366 (2000), to be highly persuasive. In that case, the plaintiff brought an action against his former employer to recover the unpaid balance of a profit sharing bonus. Id., 222. The distribution of the bonus was subject to the chief executive officer\u2019s sole discretion, with the payments contingent on the recipient\u2019s continued employment with the firm. Id., 222-23. After the plaintiff had resigned from the firm, the firm refused to make any further bonus payments, and the plaintiff brought an action claiming that the firm had violated New York\u2019s wage statutes by failing to pay him. Id., 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The court concluded that the plaintiffs bonus was not subject to the wage statutes because it was not a wage, as defined by N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 190 (1) (McKinney 2002), which is similar to \u00a7 31-71a (3), in that it defines wages, in relevant part, as \u201cthe earnings of an employee <em>for labor or services rendered, </em>regardless of whether the amount of earnings is determined on a time, piece, commission or other basis. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court emphasized that the \u201cterms of the [firm\u2019s] bonus compensation plan did not predicate bonus payments upon [the employee\u2019s] own personal productivity nor give [the employee] a contractual right to bonus payments based upon his productivity. To the contrary, the declaration of a bonus pool was dependent solely upon his employer\u2019s overall financial success. In addition, [the employee\u2019s] share in the bonus pool was entirely discretionary and subject to the non-reviewable determination of his employer.\u201d Id., 224. Thus, the court concluded that \u201cthe wording of the statute, in expressly linking earnings to an employee\u2019s labor or services per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>sonally rendered, contemplates a more direct relationship between an employee\u2019s own performance and the compensation to which that employee is entitled. Discretionary additional remuneration, as a share in a reward to all employees for the success of the employer\u2019s entrepreneurship, falls outside the protection of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id.; see <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. </em>v. Fitzpatrick, 366 Md. 295, 303-305, 783 A.2d 667 (2001) (profit sharing bonus not \u201cwage,\u201d despite inclusion of \u201cbonuses\u201d under statutory definition of \u201cwage,\u201d when award of bonus was dependent on employer discretion or factors other than employee\u2019s efforts); see also <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc., </em>1 N.Y.3d 146, 154, 802 N.E.2d 610, 770 N.Y.S.2d 271 (2003) (distinguishing \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d forfeiture provisions in bonuses from those applicable to payroll deduction programs);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>cf. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>First Union Capital Markets Corp., </em>152 N.C. App. 205, 208-209, 567 S.E.2d 189 (2002) (bonus paid in form of restricted stock was wage, despite fact that it had not vested, because state statute specifically defined \u201cwages\u201d as including \u201cbonuses\u201d). We agree with the analysis in <em>Truelove, </em>and we conclude, therefore, that bonuses that are awarded solely on a discretionary basis, and are not linked solely to the ascertainable efforts of the particular employee, are not wages under \u00a7 31-71a (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Accordingly, we further conclude that the terms of the regular and branch manager bonuses in this case are not wages subject to Connecticut\u2019s wage statutes. Payments under both the bonus and branch manager programs are purely discretionary. Although the plaintiffs argue that the branch managers had to achieve \u201cspecific goals\u201d to receive the bonuses, thus rendering them compensation for services rendered, a review of the bonus plans cited in the parties\u2019 joint appendix, as well as the deposition of Robin Leopold, human resources director for Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., indicate that the bonus awards are tied to subjective factors such as diversity within a branch, and the profitability of the particular branches, which are factors not entirely predictable or within the control of the specific employee. Thus, we conclude that the bonus and branch manager programs are not wages contemplated by \u00a7 31-71a (3), and, therefore, the wage statutes are inapplicable to these particular claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">We next turn to the payroll plan. The plaintiffs claim that their pay stubs prove that the payroll plan was funded by deductions from the amount paid as \u201ccash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>compensation\u201d for the relevant pay period, compensation for which ordinarily would be due in full under \u00a7 31-7!c upon the termination of their employment, absent valid deductions under \u00a7 31-71e (2). See footnote 10 of this opinion. Accordingly, the plaintiffs contend that the forfeiture provision of the payroll plan violates \u00a7 31-71e (2) because they did not knowingly and voluntarily authorize those deductions, and the department never approved the election form.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We begin by assuming, without deciding, that the contributions to the plans were deductions from wages under \u00a7 31-71a(3), as explained by <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>260 Conn. 152, 159-60, 793 A.2d 1068 (2002).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, we assume that, under the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tiffs\u2019 employment agreement with the defendants, the wages due to them would be the gross compensation amount that had accrued during the relevant pay period, with the contribution to the plans being, therefore, a deduction from that gross amount.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc., </em>supra, 1 N.Y.3d 154 (rejecting argument that investment contributions are not deductions from wages because \u201cit is clear that plaintiff authorized periodic withholdings from his compensation to finance the eventual purchase of fund shares\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Accordingly, we address in turn the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the deductions violated the wage statutes, and specifically \u00a7 31-71e (2), because: (1) they were not knowingly and voluntarily authorized; and (2) the department never approved the election form prior to its use by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We begin with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the forfeiture provision in the plan violated \u00a7 31-71e (2) because the deductions were not knowing and voluntary. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that, because authorized deductions from wages amount to a waiver of the employee\u2019s right under the wage statutes to receive payment of earned wages in full and on time, established case law on the topic of waiver requires that the deductions be voluntary and with the understanding of the consequences thereof. They then claim that the information provided about the forfeiture provision in the plans fails to render the deductions knowing and voluntary. In response, the defendants argue that other courts have rejected challenges under their states\u2019 wage statutes to the forfeiture provisions of the same and other similar plans. The defendants also emphasize that the plan participants clearly gave informed written authorization for any deductions, and understood the benefits and risks attendant to the plans. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Prior to its amendment by No. 08-118, \u00a7 1, of the 2008 Public Acts, which does not affect the claims in this case; see footnote 10 of this opinion; \u00a7 31-71e provided: \u201cNo employer may withhold or divert any portion of an employee\u2019s wages unless (1) the employer is required or empowered to do so by state or federal law, or (2) <em>the employer has written authorization from the employee for deductions on a form, approved by the commissioner, </em>or (3) the deductions are authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the employee, in writing, for medical, surgical or hospital care or service, without financial benefit to the employer and recorded in the employer\u2019s wage record book.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs contend, and the defendants do not extensively dispute for the purpose of this argument,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that a wage deduction that is not knowing, informed and voluntary does not satisfy the written authorization requirement of \u00a7 31-71e (2). Indeed, other states\u2019 case law, including that addressing these or similar plans, appears to import such a requirement into their wage statutes. See <em>Caviness </em>v. <em>Andes &amp; Roberts Bros. Construction Co., </em>508 S.W.2d 253, 255 (Mo. App. 1974) (Discharged employee failed to state a claim under the wage statute for the recovery of sums in his employer\u2019s payroll savings fund because the \u201c[p]laintiff by his voluntary choice elected to have [$20] of his wages deducted each week for deposit into the payroll saving fund. When that money was deducted weekly and invested, it was separated and changed in character from wages just as effectively as if the deduction were for the purchase of United States [g]ovemment [sjavings [b]onds.\u201d); <em>Coast Hotels &amp; Casinos, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Labor Commission, </em>117 Nev. 835, 842-43, 34 P.3d 546 (2001) (wage statute \u201ccontemplates a written authorization that is voluntary\u201d and requires employee to execute \u201cknowing and intelligent waiver of . . . right to receive full pay\u201d with respect to deductions to compensate casino for shortages in employee\u2019s cash drawer); <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Inc., </em>393 N.J. Super. 578, 586, 925 A.2d 32 (App. Div. 2007) (no statutory violation when \u201c[w]ithout question, the [capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>accumulation plan] terms were fully disclosed and plaintiffs\u2019 participation was pursuant to a written agreement\u201d), aff'd, 195 N.J. 423, 425, 950 A.2d 205 (2008) (no statutory violation when \u201cthe plan in which these plaintiffs participated, was entirely voluntary and its terms were fully disclosed to each of them\u201d); <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc., </em>supra, 1 N.Y.3d 156 (rejecting wage statute claims and concluding that \u201cthe disclosed risks do not negate the multiple benefits that these knowledgeable employees receive from their voluntary participation in the program\u201d); see also <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>368 Ill. App. 3d 298, 306, 856 N.E.2d 639 (2006) (noting that text of Illinois wage statute, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 115/9 [West 2002], requires \u201c \u2018express written consent of the employee, given freely at the time the deduction is made\u2019 \u201d), appeal denied, 222 Ill. 2d 609, 862 N.E.2d 235 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We conclude that the written authorization herein was informed and voluntary. The payroll plan election document recited in the statement of undisputed facts, signed by the class representative, is a model of clarity, providing in relevant part: \u201cI elect to participate in the Capital Accumulation Plan (CAP) subject to all of the provisions and administrative rules of the Plan. I hereby <em>irrevocably </em>direct my employer, Smith Barney Shearson, to pay me the percent indicated below in the form of restricted stock out of all cash compensation paid to me during the period indicated below. <em>I understand if I leave Smith Barney Shearson voluntarily or am terminated with Cause before the restrictions lapse on shares of restricted stock received under the Plan, I will forfeit the stock as well as the money I am hereby authorizing to be paid in the form of such restricted stock. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis altered.) Indeed, after reading this statement, Lomas elected to receive 20 percent of his compensation in the form of restricted stock, and renewed that election in varying percentages until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>left the defendants\u2019 employ in 1998.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the payroll plans complied adequately with the written authorization requirement of \u00a7 31-71e (2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We next address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they are entitled to damages under the wage statutes because the deductions were not \u201con a form approved by the commissioner\u201d of the department, as is required by \u00a7 31-71 e (2). The plaintiffs rely on <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 394 A.2d 731 (1978), and contend that this portion of the statute is a mandatory provision, which \u201cinvalidates any wage deductions that resulted from the use of an unapproved form.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>response, the defendants contend that their failure to seek the department\u2019s approval of the form does not invalidate the deductions because the violation did not fall within the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 31-72,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which affords employees a private right of action for the failure to pay wages. The defendants also argue that the statute is directory, rather than mandatory, because it is drafted in affirmative, rather than negative terms, and does not explicitly provide a penalty or a right of action for noncompliance, or provide guidance for the department\u2019s decision to approve or deny a particular form. We agree with the defendants, and conclude that this portion of \u00a7 31-71e (2) is directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We begin by noting that the narrow question presented by this aspect of this case is whether the failure to obtain the department\u2019s approval of a wage deduction form invalidates and requires a refund of the deductions, even when, as we concluded in part II A of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>opinion, the written authorization itself is legally sufficient. The language of \u00a7 31-71e provides in relevant part: \u201cNo employer may withhold or divert any portion of an employee\u2019s wages unless ... (2) the employer has written authorization from the employee for deductions on a form approved by the commissioner . . . .\u201d The key, then, is whether the requirement that the commissioner approve of the form is mandatory or directory, which raises a question of statutory interpretation. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. ... If, however, the . . . provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Teresa T. </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 734, 746, 865 A.2d 428 (2005). Linguistically, a statutory provision generally is considered directory if \u201cthe requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 19, 848 A.2d 418 (2004); see also <em>Santiago </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>State, </em>261 Conn. 533, 534 n.1, 540, 804 A.2d 801 (2002) (relying on negative language, specifically, \u201c \u2018[n]o appeal may be taken from a judgment denying a petition for a new trial\u2019 \u201d without judicial certification, as well as statute\u2019s policy objective of avoiding frivolous appeals, in concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 [a] appeal certification requirement is mandatory). Furthermore, the lack of a penalty provision or invalidation of an action as a consequence for failure to comply with the statutory directive is a significant indication that the statute is directory. See, e.g., <em>Teresa T. </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>supra, 746-47 (\u201c[t]he absence of a penalty if the commissioner fails to invoke the ninety-six hour hold after making a finding of probable cause further suggests that [General Statutes] \u00a7 17a-101g [c] does not impose a mandatory duty\u201d); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 466, 692 A.2d 742 (1997) (statute directory because \u201calthough [it] uses the word, \u2018shall,\u2019 there is no language expressly invalidating a defective notice\u201d); <em>Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>239 Conn. 437, 446-47, 685 A.2d 670 (1996) (\u201cNeither [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-180 [c] nor [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-183 [c] contains language that would invalidate an action that failed to comply strictly with the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 [c]. This omission indicates a legislative intent that the provisions operate to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The statute at issue in this case is drafted at least partially in negative language, which supports the plaintiffs\u2019 argument.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 31-71e (\u201c[n]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>employer may withhold </em>or divert any portion of an employee\u2019s wages unless ... [2] the employer has written authorization from the employee for deductions on a form approved by the commissioner\u201d [emphasis added]). The statute does not, however, expressly invalidate deductions made on unapproved forms, and the only penalty provision that arguably is implicated by the failure to seek department approval is General Statutes \u00a7 31-71g,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which does not invalidate the transaction, but provides merely for fines, a term of imprisonment or both.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Even the applicability of \u00a7 31-71g is doubtful, however, because even the most minor penalties available under that statute contemplate the presence of \u201cunpaid wages,\u201d a predicate not present herein, inasmuch as the plaintiffs gave knowing and voluntary consent to specific deductions from the gross wages owed to them. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-71g (\u201c[a]ny employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>or any officer or agent of an employer or any other person authorized by an employer to pay wages who violates any provision of this part may be . . . [4] fined not less than two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than three months or both for each offense if <em>the total amount of all unpaid wages owed to an employee is five hundred dollars or </em>less\u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, those employees who intelligently elected to participate in the plans and adhered to their terms by maintaining their employment until the restricted shares vested received the benefits of discounted shares, as well as a tax deferral. Thus, a review of the statutory language, which lacks a provision holding deductions on unauthorized forms invalid per se, indicates that the department approval requirement is directory.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Moreover, as the defendants point out, an interpretation of \u00a7 31-71 e requiring the automatic invalidation and refund of <em>any </em>wage deductions made on unapproved forms conceivably could result in unwarranted windfalls for employees, such as in the hypothetical posited by the defendants of an employer deducting money from an employee\u2019s paycheck to pay for homeowner\u2019s insurance offered as a voluntary employee benefit. Invalidating and requiring a refund of those deductions based on the employer\u2019s failure to seek the department\u2019s approval of the form would give the employee the windfall of free insurance. Although it is well established that the wage collection statutes are \u201cremedial in nature,\u201d namely, intended \u201cto prevent the employer from taking advantage of the legal agreement that exists between the employer and the employee\u201d; <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 160-61; and should be construed liberally in the employees\u2019 favor; see, e.g., <em>Schoonmaker v. Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 240, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); that construction does not require windfalls for technical violations. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 failure to seek the department\u2019s approval of the plan election form does not, by itself, require the invalidation of the authorized payroll plan deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The certified question is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> General Statutes! 51-199b (d) provides: \u201cThe Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States or by the highest court of another state or of a tribe, if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> Citigroup, Inc., is the parent company of the defendants Travelers Group, Inc., Salomon Smith Barney Holdings, Inc., and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.

We decline to address this claim because it is outside the scope of the certified question, which is limited to whether the various plans violate the wage statutes, which in any event constitute the legislature\u2019s expression of our state\u2019s public policy in this field. See <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Design Group One Architects, LLC, </em>260 Conn. 691, 715, 802 A.2d 731 (2002) (\u201cjust as the primary responsibility for formulating public policy resides in the legislature ... so, too, does the responsibility for determining, within constitutional limits, the methods to be employed in achieving those policy goals\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> In <em>Mytych, </em>we rejected the claim brought by shoe salespersons that the defendant department stores\u2019 practice of calculating commissions by deducting the employee\u2019s pro rata share of the unidentified merchandise returns from the gross amount violated Connecticut\u2019s wage statutes. <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 163-64. We stated that\" \u2018[w]ages\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 31-71a (3) is a \u201c[broad]\u201d definition that \u201clists certain nonexclusive factors that may assist in the computation of an employee\u2019s wage, [and] it fails to set forth a specific formula by which wages must be calculated or determined. Rather, it merely requires that wages be paid as compensation to an employee for services rendered. The determination of the proper amount to be tendered purposely is left vague by the reference to \u2018or other basis of calculation\u2019 contained in \u00a7 31-71a (3).\u201d Id., 159. We further concluded that \u201c[t]he language used in \u00a7 31-73 (b) also suggests that the legislature intended that the employer-employee agreement, as opposed to a statutory formula, control the manner in which wages are calculated. Section 31-73 (b) provides in relevant part: No employer . . . shall, directly or indirectly, demand, request, receive or exact any refund of wages ... or deduct any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>part of the wages agreed to be paid, upon the representation or the understanding that such refund of wages ... or deduction is necessary to secure employment or continue in employment. . . . Although the statute does not define the term \u2018agreement,\u2019 it provides that the agreement shall not be violated by any deductions or other conditions. Similarly, \u00a7 31-71e provides that [n]o employer may withhold or divert any portion of an employee\u2019s wages .... The statute does not purport to define the wages due; it merely requires that those wages agreed to will not be withheld for any reason.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 159-60; see also id., 160 (\u201c{T]here are no formulaic strictures provided. Instead, the formula by which an employee\u2019s wage is calculated is determined by the agreement between the employer and the employee.\u201d). Accordingly, we concluded that the pro rata deduction for returns was not an illegal deduction from wages, because the employees had agreed to that method of calculating their commissions. Id., 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> Supporting this assumption is the undisputed fact that the plaintiffs could have opted not to participate in the payroll plans, thereby entitling them to full cash compensation instead of a hybrid of cash and restricted stocks. We note, however, that the defendants argue that the restricted stock did not constitute a wage under \u00a7 31-71a (3) since it had not vested under the agreed upon terms of the payroll plan, and if it was considered a wage that had currently accrued, it would not have been subject to a \u201csubstantial risk of forfeiture\u201d for federal tax purposes. Our independent research has revealed some recent authority supporting the defendants\u2019 argument, and concluding that stock options are not wages subject to Idaho\u2019s wage statutes, which define wages identically to \u00a7 31-71a (3). See <em>Paolini </em>v. <em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>143 Idaho 547, 549-50, 149 P.3d 822 (2006) (relying on methods of payment directed in related statutes in concluding that \u201c[n]on-monetary compensation such as stock options cannot be wages because that form of compensation is not payable in cash, with a check, or by deposit into the employee\u2019s account\u201d). Nevertheless, for the purpose of this analysis, we decline to address the defendants\u2019 argument on this point, and assume that the gross compensation amount constituted the wage, with the payroll plan contributions being deductions therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\"> The defendants posit that whether the authorization is sufficiently informed might support a claim for breach of contract, but is not relevant to whether the statutory prerequisite has been satisfied. They do not, however, offer any further analysis with respect to the substantive content of the written authorization requirement under \u00a7 31-71e (2), proceeding instead to argue that the authorizations given by the plaintiffs herein were sufficiently informed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\"> The plaintiffs, citing the deposition testimony of Leopold, emphasize that much of the consent was \u201cnegative consent,\u201d as many of the employees participating in the plans signed the enrollment form only once. Leopold stated that negative consent was utilized for several years, and that Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., automatically reenrolled employees in the plans when they had participated in previous years. As the defendants point out, however, they sent periodic negative consent notices to their employees advising them of the opportunity to change their election percentage. Indeed, Lomas availed himself several times of that opportunity, and changed his stock allocation from 20 to 10 to 5 to 10 percent during the course of his participation in the payroll plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> Indeed, our conclusion that these forms provided adequate disclosure prior to the employees\u2019 election to participate in the plan is consistent with sister state decisions that have rejected challenges, albeit under somewhat differently worded statutes, either to these particular plans, or to similar restricted stock programs.

The record does not reveal, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>any responses to Lemaire\u2019s concerns by legislators that might shed light on the consequences of violating \u00a7 31-71e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-71g provides: \u201cAny employer or any officer or agent of an employer or any other person authorized by an employer to pay wages who violates any provision of this part may be: (1) Fined not less than two thousand nor more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both for each offense if the total amount of all unpaid wages owed to an employee is more than two thousand dollars; (2) fined not less than one thousand nor more than two thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year or both for each offense if the total amount of all unpaid wages owed to an employee is more than one thousand dollars but not more than two thousand dollars; (3) fined not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both for each offense if the total amount of all unpaid wages owed to an employee is more than five hundred but not more than one thousand dollars; or (4) fined not less than two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than three months or both for each offense if the total amount of all unpaid wages owed to an employee is five hundred dollars or less.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\"> Indeed, unpaid wages similarly are a factual predicate for recovery under \u00a7 31-72, which permits an employee to bring a civil action to recover unpaid wages, including double damages and attorney\u2019s fees if the failure to pay wages arises from the employer\u2019s \u201c \u2018bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>219 Conn. 217, 229, 592 A.2d 931 (1991); see also footnote 21 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b815-5\"> We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 129-30, in which this court concluded that, under General Statutes \u00a7 5-209, the approval of the state personnel commissioner was mandatory before a state employee could be compensated at a higher rate for performing tasks attendant to a higher job classification for more than sixty days. The statutory language in question provided: \u201c \u2018Any state employee who is assigned, by his appointing authority, duties and responsibilities of a job classification higher than the class in which he is placed, on a continuous basis for a period of more than sixty working days, shall be compensated for such time in excess of sixty days at a rate in the higher class which shall not be less than one step in that class above his existing rate of pay, <em>provided such payment shall be approved by the personnel commissioner. </em>Service in a higher classification under this section shall not constitute permanent status in such class.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 129, quoting General Statutes \u00a7 5-209. This court rejected a state employee\u2019s claim that the commissioner\u2019s approval was not necessary for her to be paid at a higher level, stating that \u201c[ajdopting the plaintiffs position would effectively eliminate the proviso from the statute. The statute expressly makes payments contingent on approval by the personnel commissioner; if the commissioner is powerless to withhold approval once the work has been performed, then the proviso is meaningless.\u201d <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>supra, 129. The court further noted that the proviso was important to the essence of the civil service statutes, which were intended to give the \u201cpersonnel commissioner . . . broad powers to administer the state personnel system and was to supervise carefully any changes in employee placement,\u201d as well as to limit provisional and emergency appointments. Id., 133. Requiring the approval of the personnel commission avoided the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>of all appointing authorities from using \u201c\u00a7 5-209 to circumvent other requirements of the State Personnel Act, and perhaps even subvert the goals of the merit system.\u201d Id., 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"A33I\">In our view, <em>Engle </em>is distinguishable from the present case. First, \u00a7 31-71e (2) lacks the explicit proviso language of \u00a7 5-209. Second, the essence of the wage statutes is to protect employees from being taken advantage of by their employers. See, e.g., <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 160-61. If the employee has knowingly and voluntarily consented to the deduction at issue, and even benefited from it, then invalidating deductions because of a technical violation does not further the purpose of the wage collection statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
