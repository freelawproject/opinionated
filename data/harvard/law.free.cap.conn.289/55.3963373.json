The Appellate Court rejected those claims in a comprehensive opinion. Id., 388, 392, 396. We subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court improperly hold that the admission of an oral statement made by the defendant, while being subjected to custodial interrogation by a Bristol police officer, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zubrowski, </em>283 Conn. 912, 928 A.2d 539 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>admission of his statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the state expressly had relied on that statement to prove his intent to kill and the other evidence establishing that intent was not overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\"> An individual\u2019s intoxication may negate the specific intent to violate \u00a7 53a-54a. <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 239, 710 A.2d 732 (1998) (\u201c[w]hile intoxication is neither a defense nor an affirmative defense to a murder charge in Connecticut, evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication is relevant to negate specific intent which is an essential element of the crime of murder\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
