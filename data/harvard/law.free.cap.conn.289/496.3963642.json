We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the night of June 28,2004, the tactical narcotics team (team) of the Bridgeport police department initiated a narcotics investigation in the area of Washington Avenue and Sanford Place in Bridgeport. The team targeted the area for investigation because it was considered a \u201chigh drug area\u201d in which narcotics officers previously had made numerous drug related arrests. Clive Higgins, an undercover officer assigned to the team, testified that his role in the investigation was to purchase drugs. Higgins was equipped with a listening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>device that enabled other team members to monitor his activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At approximately 10 p.m., Higgins approached the defendant, who was located on the comer of Washington Avenue and Sanford Place, and asked where he could \u201cget some . . . slabs.\u201d Higgins explained to the jury that a slab is a \u201cziplocked [bag] containing narcotics or cocaine.\u201d The defendant then told Higgins, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to my man,\u201d and asked Higgins how many slabs he wanted. After Higgins requested two slabs, he accompanied the defendant to a building located at 40 Sanford Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">William Reilly, the officer who was assigned to watch Higgins and to monitor his conversations by way of the listening device, saw Higgins and the defendant enter the building and he heard \u201cfootsteps going up stairs.\u201d Higgins and the defendant proceeded to the fourth floor of the building, where the defendant knocked on the only door without an apartment number. When the occupant of the apartment opened the door, the defendant instructed Higgins to give the defendant money. Higgins handed the defendant a marked $20 bill, after which the defendant entered the apartment alone and closed the door. While the defendant was in the apartment, Higgins used the listening device to transmit information about his location to other officers on the team. A few seconds later, the defendant exited the apartment and handed Higgins two clear ziplock bags containing a white substance. Reilly saw Higgins and the defendant leave 40 Sanford Place together, and Higgins then signaled to Reilly that he was in possession of dmgs.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Orlando Rosado, another officer on the team, subsequently arrested the defendant, and he retrieved a crack pipe from the defendant when the defendant was brought to police headquarters. The white substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that the defendant handed to Higgins proved to be 0.143 grains of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">After his arrest, the defendant was charged in a long form information with sale of narcotics by a person who is not drag-dependent in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (b), sale of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 2 la-277 (a), and sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b). As an affirmative defense, the defendant claimed that he was drag-dependent at the time of the crime, and he called an expert witness, Guay Chatfield, a licensed clinical social worker, to substantiate that defense. On December 15, 2004, the jury rendered a verdict acquitting the defendant of the count alleging sale of narcotics by a person who is not drag-dependent and finding him guilty of the remaining two charges. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction as to those charges, from which the defendant appealed. We address the defendant\u2019s four claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant first claims that he was deprived of a fair trial by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He claims that his testimony gave rise to a defense of entrapment, thereby necessitating an instruction. The defendant claims that several key differences between his testimony and Higgins\u2019 testimony, \u201csupported the conclusion that the defendant . . . was induced to join [Higgins] (\u2018a feigned accomplice\u2019) in a search for someone from whom to purchase . . . crack.\u201d Specifically, he relies on his testimony, in contrast to Higgins\u2019 testimony, that Higgins approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the defendant and promised to get him high, that the defendant did not know the person from whom they purchased crack, and that the defendant never touched the money or the drugs in question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As a preliminary matter, we address the state\u2019s claim that the defendant failed to preserve his claim for appellate review. The defendant acknowledges that he failed to request an instruction on entrapment or to take exception to the omission of an entrapment instruction from the trial court\u2019s jury charge as required by Practice Book \u00a7 42-16,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tion of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 33 n.5, 917 A.2d 978 (2007). Should the defendant fail to meet any of these four conditions, \u201can appellate court is free to reject a defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Canales, </em>281 Conn. 572, 580, 916 A.2d 767 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Although the record is adequate for review in this case, this court consistently has concluded that \u201cthe defense of entrapment is not of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 211, 562 A.2d 481 (1989). In both <em>Grullon, </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>195 Conn. 70, 73, 485 A.2d 1302 (1985), we declined to review the defendants\u2019 unpreserved claims pertaining to the trial court\u2019s charge on the defense of entrapment because the defense was not of constitutional magnitude. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 197, 502 A.2d 858 (1985). Despite this clear precedent, the defendant urges us to conclude that the defense of entrapment is of constitutional magnitude on the ground that it is analogous to the defense of duress. The defendant offers no persuasive authority, however, to indicate why we should ignore well established precedent to the contrary. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim because he has failed to satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on accessorial liability because: (1) the evidence in the state\u2019s case did not support such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>an instruction; and (2) the court failed to inform the jury that it could not convict the defendant of the offenses charged on the ground that he was Higgins\u2019 accomplice because Higgins, as an undercover police officer, was not an actual principal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>277 Conn. 735, 756, 894 A.2d 928 (2006) (\u201canother person\u2019s commission of an offense is a condition precedent to the imposition of accessorial liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On the first day of trial, the state filed a preliminary request to charge the jury on accessorial liability pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel, at that time, indicated that she was planning to object to that portion of the charge after she had an opportunity to review it. After the close of evidence, the trial court indicated on the record that a charging conference had been held during which the court had stated that it would be instructing the jury on accessorial liability and defense counsel had voiced her intention to object to the charge. Defense counsel subsequently clarified that she was objecting to the prospective charge on the ground that an instruction on accessorial liability would confuse the jury because the state had charged the defendant as a principal, not as an accessory, and the state had not named any other party who could be considered a principal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the trial court instructed the jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>asked whether counsel had any exceptions to the charge, defense counsel merely indicated, \u201cI believe I\u2019ve placed my exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On appeal, the parties dispute whether the defendant\u2019s claim is properly preserved for appellate review. The state asserts that \u201c[although defense counsel objected to the accessory instruction at trial, the grounds for that objection asserted at trial are not the same grounds that have been argued on appeal.\u201d The defendant counters that defense counsel\u2019s \u201cvarious objections\u201d to the inclusion of an instruction on accessorial liability, coupled with defense counsel\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s request for such an instruction was at odds with the state\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence presented, were sufficient to preserve the claim for appellate review. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cIt is well settled . . . that a party may preserve for appeal a claim that an instruction . . . was . . . defective either by: (1) submitting a written request to charge covering the matter; or (2) taking an exception to the charge as given. . . . [T]he purpose of the [preservation requirement] is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials. . . . Thus, the essence of the preservation requirement is that <em>fair notice </em>be given to the trial court of the party\u2019s view of the governing law and of any disagreement that the party may have had with the charge actually given.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lin </em>v. <em>National Railroad Passenger </em>Corp., 277 Conn. 1, 13, 889 A.2d 798 (2006); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 42-16 (counsel taking exception shall state distinctly matter objected to and ground of exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In the present case, defense counsel objected to the charge on two specific grounds: (1) an instruction on accessorial liability would confuse the jury because the information charged the defendant as a principal only; and (2) no other individual was named as a principal. Neither ground alerted the trial court to defense counsel\u2019s concerns, voiced for the first time on appeal, that the evidence did not support a charge on accessorial liability and that the instruction failed to inform the jury that it could not convict the defendant of the offenses charged on the ground that he was Higgins\u2019 accomplice. Instead, both grounds rested solely on the premise that the information, which charged the defendant as a principal only and named no other person as a principal, was inconsistent with the accomplice liability charge, and would therefore confuse the jury. As a result, we conclude that the defendant failed to preserve his claim for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The defendant argues, alternatively, that he is entitled to review under <em>Golding. </em>See part I of this opinion. We disagree. Although the record is adequate for review, the defendant\u2019s claim is not of constitutional magnitude and does not satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">It is well established that \u201ca factual insufficiency regarding one statutory basis, which is accompanied by a general verdict of guilty that also covers another, factually supported basis, is not a federal due process violation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 539, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994). The defendant acknowledges this premise, but argues that his claim is of constitutional magnitude because it alleges the improper submission of a <em>legally </em>insufficient theory of liability, as opposed to a factually insufficient theory. See id., 539-40. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>caily, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s inclusion of an instruction on accessorial liability created a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted him on the ground that he was an accomplice to a police officer, and failed to inform the jury that the law did not permit a conviction on that ground. In addition, the defendant claims that once the concept of accessorial liability was introduced, \u201cthe jury could only have identified Higgins [as] the person whom the defendant intended to assist.\u201d As a result, the defendant claims, the instruction created a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted the defendant on the basis of the legally incorrect theory that he assisted Higgins in purchasing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We reject the defendant\u2019s argument because it rests on the faulty premise that Higgins was the <em>only </em>person whom the defendant could have assisted. In fact, both the defendant\u2019s testimony and Higgins\u2019 testimony supported an instruction that the defendant assisted the unnamed dealer at 40 Sanford Place in selling the drugs to Higgins. Moreover, as the state points out in its brief, \u201cunder both the state\u2019s theory and the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, Higgins was the narcotics buyer, not the seller,\u201d and because the defendant was charged with selling narcotics, and not with purchasing them, \u201cthe trial court did not have a reason to instruct the jury that the defendant could not have been Higgins\u2019 accomplice . . . .\u201d Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that it was reasonably possible that the jury convicted him of a legally incognizable theory of liability is untenable. Because the defendant\u2019s claim is not of constitutional magnitude, we decline to review it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant also claims that prosecutorial impropriety deprived him of his right to a fair trial and contravened the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in limine to limit the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s criminal record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the prosecutor went beyond the scope of the ruling, which permitted the prosecutor to refer to certain of the defendant\u2019s felony convictions as unnamed felonies and prohibited references to convictions that were more than ten years old. The defendant points to four alleged instances of impropriety: two during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant; one during the state\u2019s cross-examination of Chat\u00f1eld on the issue of drug dependency; and one during the state\u2019s closing argument. With the exception of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument, which the state concedes were improper, we reject the defendant\u2019s claims of impropriety. In addition, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u201cIn analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process. . . . The two steps are separate and distinct. . . . We first examine whether prosecutorial impropriety occurred. . . . Second, if an impropriety exists, we then examine whether it deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. . . . Whether that impropriety was harmful and thus caused or contributed to a due process violation involves a separate and distinct inquiry. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged [harmful] prosecutorial [impropriety] is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s [actions at trial] so infected [it] with unfairness as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. ... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial ... we must view the prosecutor\u2019s [actions] in the context of the entire trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201c[I]t is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole. . . . We are mindful throughout this inquiry, however, of the unique responsibilities of the prosecutor in our judicial system. A prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. ... By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. [The prosecutor\u2019s] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he [or she] should [nonetheless] be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 32-33. Having set forth these legal principles, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As a preliminary matter, the defendant concedes that he did not object to two of the alleged instances of prosecutorial impropriety at trial, and that he failed to state the grounds for his objections to the remaining two instances. \u201cOnce prosecutorial impropriety has been alleged, however, it is unnecessary for a defendant to seek to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239-40], and it is unnecessary for an appellate court to review the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding. . . . </em>The reason for this is that the touchstone for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>review of claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination must involve the application of the factors set out by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We turn first to the alleged improprieties during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant. The defendant claims that the prosecutor violated the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by asking the defendant about how many times he had been convicted and by referencing the ten year limitation period set by the trial court in its ruling on the motion in limine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The defendant alleges that the prosecutor\u2019s questions improperly implied that the defendant\u2019s criminal history was more extensive than the trial court had ruled was admissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">During direct examination, the defendant admitted that he had been convicted of six felonies in 2000, two felonies in 1999, one felony in 1994, and one felony in 1992. During cross-examination, the prosecutor first asked the defendant how many times he had been convicted during 2000, and then asked how many times he had been convicted during 1999. Although the defendant had testified about the very same information during direct examination, he seemed reluctant or unable to answer the prosecutor\u2019s questions. At that point, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve got some other felony convictions, too? . . . Ballpark, how many [convictions] do you think you have?\u201d When the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>objected to this question generally, the prosecutor clarified, \u201cJust within the last ten years, how many do you have?\u201d It is clear that this questioning, when considered in the context of the entire cross-examination, was focused on clarifying the number of times the defendant had been convicted within the time period permitted by the trial court\u2019s ruling, and was not an improper attempt to go beyond the scope of the ruling, as the defendant claims. Moreover, because the defendant already had testified during direct examination that he had been convicted of multiple felonies during a lengthy time period, the prosecutor\u2019s questions pertaining to the same convictions were no more likely to paint the defendant as a \u201ccareer criminal,\u201d as the defendant contends, than the defendant\u2019s own testimony, especially when the trial court specifically had instructed the jurors that they could not draw such an inference from evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questions during cross-examination of the defendant were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The defendant also contends that the prosecutor violated his right to a fair trial and contravened an order of the trial court during cross-examination of Chatfield. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly posed a hypothetical question about the defendant\u2019s criminal record and how it had impacted Chatfield\u2019s conclusion as to whether the defendant was dependent on drugs at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. Before Chatfield testified to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the court conducted a voir dire of the witness, during which Chatfield stated that she had used the defendant\u2019s drug possession convictions to corroborate the defendant\u2019s assertions that he had had a substance abuse problem for some time. Consequently, the state sought permission to question her as to her use of the defendant\u2019s criminal record and argued that \u201cpreviously unnamed felonies [should] now be named.\u201d The trial court ruled that the prosecutor, in questioning Chatfield about her use of the defendant\u2019s record, could name the charge of possession, or could refer to \u201cdrug convictions,\u201d but could not name the defendant\u2019s convictions for sale of narcotics.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">During direct examination, in the presence of the jury, Chatfield testified that she had evaluated the defendant and had concluded that he was drug-dependent at the time of the crimes charged. During cross-examination, when the prosecutor questioned Chatfield about her use of the defendant\u2019s criminal record in forming her conclusion, Chatfield stated that the facts underlying the defendant\u2019s drug convictions were not important to her evaluation, and that she had used the convictions for the sole purpose of corroborating statements made by the defendant and his sisters. When Chatfield reiterated, in response to several questions, that the facts underlying the convictions were insignificant to her, the prosecutor stated: \u201cLet\u2019s just say for hypothetical purposes . . . [that] he was convicted for sale.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Defense counsel immediately objected to the question, and the trial court instructed the jurors to \u201cignore that question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The defendant argues on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s question was improper because it violated the trial court\u2019s ruling prohibiting the prosecutor from naming the defendant\u2019s convictions for sale of narcotics. The state contends, to the contrary, that the question did not violate the trial court\u2019s ruling because it referred to the crime of sale hypothetically and did not reference charges for which the defendant actually had been convicted, and because the ruling did not prohibit all references to drug sale convictions. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tok, </em>107 Conn. App. 241, 260-63, 945 A.2d 558, cert. denied, 287 Conn. 919, 951 A.2d 571 (2008), the Appellate Court rejected a similar claim. The defendant in <em>Tok </em>claimed that the prosecutor had violated the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine that prohibited the prosecutor from referring to a witness\u2019 membership in a gang or gang affiliation. Id., 260. During cross-examination of the witness, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[p]eople associate themselves with different gangs,\u201d to which defense counsel immediately objected. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 261. After the trial court overruled the objection, the prosecutor asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that there can be sometimes different groups of people . . . they might be members of different gangs . . . ?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Although the defendant in <em>Tok </em>claimed that the prosecutor deliberately had violated a court order,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>late Court determined that the order had not been violated because the prosecutor\u2019s questioning \u201cwas directed at whether there was gang activity in [the defendant\u2019s] neighborhood and not whether [the defendant] was involved with gangs or gang activity.\u201d Id., 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Likewise, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning in the present case was focused on exposing flaws in Chatfield\u2019s evaluation methods by highlighting that she had concluded that the defendant was drug-dependent without considering the types and underlying facts of the defendant\u2019s drug convictions, and was not directed at establishing that the defendant actually had been convicted of selling drugs. The single objectionable question in this case, which was posed hypothetically and did not refer to an actual conviction, is similar to the prosecutor\u2019s general reference to gang activity in <em>Tok, </em>which the Appellate Court distinguished from an actual inquiry into the witness\u2019 gang affiliation. Id. In this case, as in <em>Tok, </em>the distinction between proper and improper questioning is subtle. Although the prosecutor in this case approached the line distinguishing the two, we cannot conclude that he crossed that line. Because the prosecutor did not refer to or ask whether the defendant had an actual conviction for sale of narcotics, and because his hypothetical reference to a conviction for selling drugs did not violate the trial court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that one of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during his rebuttal closing argument to the jury constituted prosecutorial impropriety. The prosecutor, in discussing Chatfield\u2019s testimony, stated: \u201cMoreover, [in] all of [the defendant\u2019s] other convictions, was he ever found to be drug-dependent? No.\u201d The state concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper because it referred to the defendant\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>use of the drug dependency defense when there was no evidence in the record that the defendant unsuccessfully had invoked that defense with respect to prior convictions. The state argues, however, that the impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cTo determine whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial, we must determine whether the sum total of [the prosecutor\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair, in violation of his right to due process. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety], therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties. . . . This inquiry is guided by an examination of the following <em>Williams </em>factors: the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 396, 897 A.2d 569 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The state does not argue, in this case, that the comment was invited by the defense. With respect to the second and third <em>Williams </em>factors, the misconduct, which consisted of a single remark, was neither frequent nor severe. \u201cIn determining whether the prosecutorial impropriety was severe, this court considers] it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to . . . the improper [remark], [to] request curative instructions, or [to] move for a mistrial. ... A failure to object demonstrates that defense counsel presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 51. Defense counsel did not object to the improper comment in this case. In addition, the fact that the jury ultimately acquitted the defendant of the charge of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent indicates that the impropriety, which pertained solely to the defense of drug dependency, was not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We turn now to whether the impropriety was central to the critical issue in this case. As the defendant acknowledges in his brief, the central theme in this case was \u201cthe credibility of the defendant versus the credibility of a police officer.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comment pertaining to drug dependency had no bearing on the issue of credibility. Moreover, although the impropriety was relevant to the issue of drug dependency, the jury obviously credited that defense, despite the prosecutor\u2019s remark, because it acquitted the defendant of the charge of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As to the issue of whether the trial court adopted curative measures to ameliorate the impropriety, it is significant that defense counsel did not object to the impropriety when it occurred nor did she request curative instructions. As noted previously, defense counsel\u2019s failure to voice her objection to the comment or to request a curative instruction \u201cmitigates against a finding that this misconduct by itself deprived the defendant of [a] fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 707-708, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Finally, the state\u2019s case was strong. As the defendant acknowledges in his brief, credibility was the deciding factor in this case. The testimony of the state\u2019s key witness\u2014Higgins\u2014was corroborated by other police officers, whereas the defendant\u2019s version of events was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>unsubstantiated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, both the defendant and Chatfield testified that the defendant had an extensive criminal history, which served to undermine his credibility. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-7 (evidence that witness has been convicted of crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year admissible to impeach credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">After considering the single instance of prosecutorial impropriety in the context of the entire trial, and applying the standard set forth in <em>Williams, </em>we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comment did not deprive the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the state adduced insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b). He contends that the state did not meet its burden of proving that the drug transaction had occurred within 1500 feet of a school because there was no testimony establishing that the school identified in the information as Kolbe Cathedral High School was an operating private secondary school. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The following facts axe relevant to our resolution of this claim. The state alleged in a long form information that the defendant had sold narcotics within 1500 feet of \u201cthe real property comprising a private secondary school, to wit: Kolbe Cathedral High School . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>At trial, Higgins identified 40 Sanford Place and Kolbe Cathedral High School on a map that had been introduced as a defense exhibit. Pointing to the school on the map, Higgins said, \u201cI believe the school is this right here.\u201d When the prosecutor asked, \u201cAnd that would be Kolbe Cathedral,\u201d Higgins answered, \u201cRight.\u201d Reilly later testified that 40 Sanford Place was within 1500 feet of a school, and identified the school as \u201cKolbe Cathedral High School.\u201d Likewise, Rosado testified that the transaction took place within 1500 feet of a school identified as \u201cKolbe Cathedral.\u201d Finally, James DeSanty, an investigator for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, testified that he measured the precise distance between the locations in question. When the prosecutor asked him the distance between \u201c40 Sanford Place [and] Kolbe Cathedral High School,\u201d DeSanty answered, \u201c911 feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of the count alleging the sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school, it was required to find \u201cthat [the alleged transaction] occurred in or on or within 1500 feet of the real property of a public or private elementary or secondary school. An elementary or secondary school is a school for any . . . combination of grades below grade seven. A secondary school is a school for any combination of grades seven through twelve, and may include any separate combination of grades of five and six or grades seven and eight.\u201d Defense counsel neither requested a particular definition of the term \u201cschool,\u201d nor took exception to trial court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Although the defendant\u2019s claim was not preserved at trial, we review it, nonetheless, because \u201cany defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>Golding.\u201d </em>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 76 n.7, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006), cert. denied, 549 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>U.S. 1269, 127 S. Ct. 1491, 167 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2007). In reviewing the defendant\u2019s sufficiency claim, we apply a two part test. \u201cFirst, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>283 Conn. 280, 329, 929 A.2d 278 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The essential elements of the crime of sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school are proof that the defendant sold narcotics and proof that the location of the transaction was within 1500 feet of a school. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 481, 668 A.2d 682 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>100 Conn. App. 671, 674-75, 918 A.2d 1036, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 919, 925 A.2d 1102 (2007). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>73 Conn. App. 386, 406-12, 808 A.2d 361 (2002), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 273 Conn. 138, 869 A.2d 192 (2005), the Appellate Court considered a sufficiency claim pertaining to the location element in the portion of \u00a7 21a-278a (b) that prohibits drug sales within 1500 feet of a public housing project. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the location element required the state to establish that \u201cthe Village Heights Apartments . . . was a state or federally subsidized multifamily housing project and that the housing project was run by a nonprofit corporation . . . .\u201d Id., 408. The court stated that \u201cthe element in issue that the state had to prove was that the criminal activity took place in a public housing project\u201d; id., 410; and concluded that the testimony of the property manager and a police officer that the apartment complex was a public housing project was sufficient to prove that element. Id., 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffreys, </em>78 Conn. App. 659, 677-81, 828 A.2d 659, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 913, 833 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>A.2d 465 (2003), the Appellate Court held that a police officer\u2019s affirmative response to the prosecutor\u2019s question as to whether Trumbull Gardens was a \u201cpublic housing project\u201d was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for selling narcotics within 1500 feet of a public housing project in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b). Finally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 675, the Appellate Court stated, albeit in dicta, that the rule articulated in <em>Jeffreys </em>also would apply in cases involving the sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school. The court noted that a police officer had testified \u201cunequivocally and without objection or challenge that the sale occurred within 1500 feet of Vincent E. Mauro School,\u201d and remarked that \u201c[t]his testimony alone would have been enough to satisfy the location element of the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffreys, </em>[supra, 678-81].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>supra, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Consistent with these cases, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the state failed to satisfy its burden of proof because it did not introduce sufficient evidence to prove that Kolbe Cathedral High School was an operating private secondary school. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Kolbe Cathedral High School was a school within the meaning of \u00a7 21a-278a (b). Four witnesses\u2014DeSanty, Higgins, Reilly and Rosado\u2014testified that 40 Sanford Place, where the narcotics transaction occurred, was within 1500 feet of a school. They referred to that school as \u201cKolbe Cathedral High School\u201d or \u201cKolbe Cathedral.\u201d In the present case, as in <em>Pagan, </em>the witnesses testified \u201cunequivocally and without objection or challenge . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 675. Defense counsel never suggested that the witnesses were incompetent to testify that Kolbe Cathedral High School constituted a school or questioned their testimony that it was a school. In addition, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>axiomatic that jurors \u201c[i]n considering the evidence introduced in a case . . . are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>104 Conn. App. 248, 256, 932 A.2d 1071 (2007). Although the defendant contends otherwise, the jurors, without question, were able to determine on the basis of the testimony adduced at trial and their common knowledge about the familiar topic of school, that Kolbe Cathedral High School constituted a school, as that term was identified by the trial court\u2019s instructions. Under the standard set forth in <em>Padua, Jeffreys </em>and <em>Pagan, </em>which we find persuasive, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to establish that Kolbe Cathedral High School was a school within the meaning of \u00a7 21a-278a (b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates section 21a-277 or 21a-278 by manufacturing, distributing, selling, prescribing, dispensing, compounding, transporting with the intent to sell or dispense, possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, giving or administering to another person any controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school . . . shall be imprisoned for a term of three years, which shall not be suspended and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of section 21a-277 or 21a-278.

App. 262; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>280 Conn. 686, 701 n.12, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006); the underlying determination of whether the prosecutor violated the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine is instructive in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> The defendant argues that his testimony was corroborated by the testimony of a family friend, Anthony Hicks. Although Hicks did corroborate the defendant\u2019s account of where the arrest took place, Hicks did not testify concerning any other issue in the case. Moreover, Hicks\u2019 credibility was called into question by his admission that he had been convicted of several felonies and had known the defendant all of his life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\"> We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the state, by alleging that Kolbe Cathedral High School was a private secondary school, became obligated to prove that the school was, in fact, a private secondary school. Although the state generally is limited to proving an offense charged in the manner alleged in the information, \u201cthe inclusion of additional details in the charge does not place on the state the obligation to prove more than the essential elements of the crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sam, </em>98 Conn.
