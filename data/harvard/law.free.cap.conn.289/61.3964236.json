(Medical Anesthesiology).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that: (1) the trial court improperly admitted evidence of a local standard of care with respect to the method of intubation performed on the plaintiff prior to surgery; (2) the trial court improperly permitted defense counsel to ask a prejudicial and confusing hypothetical question as to the standard of care that misled the jury; (3) defense counsel engaged in various improprieties during trial; and (4) the trial court improperly awarded various trial costs to the defendants. We affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the first three issues; we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court awarding costs to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 6, 2001, the plaintiff underwent disk surgery to alleviate neck injuries related to a slip and fall incident. Abraham Mintz and Gerard Girasole, orthopedic surgeons, performed the surgery at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital (St. Vincent\u2019s) in Bridgeport.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to surgery, Andrews and Alana Rotondi,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a muse anesthetist, intubated the plaintiff utilizing a standard endotra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>cheal intubation by laiyngoscopy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the surgical process, the plaintiff suffered a severe spinal cord injuiy. Despite subsequent surgeries, the plaintiff is a paraplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The plaintiff instituted the present action alleging that his injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendants. The controversy centers on whether the method of endotracheal intubation used by the defendants complied with the applicable national standard of care used to anesthetize a patient in the plaintiffs condition or whether the standard of care required the defendants to use an awake fiber-optic intubation method. The primary factual issue at trial revolved around the plaintiffs condition\u2014that is whether there was a medical distinction between a patient with \u201cinstability\u201d in his spine and a patient with an \u201cunstable\u201d spine. During trial, each side offered conflicting expert testimony regarding the plaintiffs condition and the corresponding standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">At the close of evidence, the trial court charged the jury that the applicable standard of care to determine whether the defendants were liable is a national standard of care.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After three days of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. In its answer to an interrogatory, the jury indicated that it found that the defendants did not breach the standard of care. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of a local standard of care for anesthesiologists regarding the methods of intubation practiced at St. Vincent\u2019s. The plaintiff argues that such evidence is irrelevant because the law requires the defendants\u2019 conduct to be evaluated in terms of a national standard of care. We conclude that the evidence establishing the standard of care at St. Vincent\u2019s was relevant to support the defendants\u2019 contention that the use of standard endotracheal intubation complied with the applicable national standard of care for a patient in the plaintiffs condition. The trial court properly admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. In their evaluation of the plaintiffs preoperative condition, the treating surgeons, Mintz and Girasole, diagnosed the plaintiff as having \u201cinstability\u201d in his spine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted, prior to surgery, the defendants intubated the plaintiff utilizing standard endotracheal intubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">To avoid confusion, we start out by simplifying the parties\u2019 claims. The plaintiff argues that the terms \u201cinstability\u201d and \u201cunstable\u201d are synonymous\u2014both mean that the spine is unstable\u2014and that the standard of care for a patient with an unstable spine requires fiber-optic intubation. The defendants agree that the standard of care for a patient with an unstable spine requires fiber-optic intubation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendants dispute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>however, that the plaintiffs spine was unstable. Instead, the defendants contend that instability is medically distinguishable from unstable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, the defendants argue, the standard of care for a patient with cervical instability permits endotracheal intubation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Despite the apparent congruence of instability and unstable, both Mintz and Girasole<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> testified that these terms represent two different degrees of injury\u2014that is, an unstable spine is an acute, more serious condition such as a traumatic injury, whereas a spine with instability is a chronic, less serious condition in which the spine is basically stable. The record reveals no instance in which the plaintiff disputed that the standard of care for a patient with a stable spine permits endotracheal intubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The plaintiff contends that no medical distinction exists between an unstable spine and a spine with instability. According to the plaintiff, therefore, fiber-optic intubation was the only relevant standard of care. Roger Kaye, a neurosurgeon who testified as an expert for the plaintiff, stated that the defendants were \u201ctrying to draw a distinction between [two] words where [he found] no distinction.\u201d Similarly, Floyd Heller, the plaintiffs anesthesiology expert, testified that the two terms represented the same condition. In fact, only the witnesses affiliated with St. Vincent\u2019s distinguished between the terms instability and unstable in their practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>We begin our analysis with the standard of review. The trial court\u2019s ruling is governed by an abuse of discretion standard. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence . . . [and its] ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>275 Conn. 395, 406, 880 A.2d 151 (2005). Furthermore, \u201c[b]efore a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. . . . The harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result. . . . When judging the likely effect of such a trial court ruling, the reviewing court is constrained to make its determination on the basis of the printed record before it. . . . In the absence of a showing that the [included] evidence would have affected the final result, its [inclusion] is harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Henne, </em>283 Conn. 361, 366, 926 A.2d 1024 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (a) governs the standard of care for liability in medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 301, 465 A.2d 294 (1983), we considered whether the standard of care should be limited geographically and concluded that the historical distinction between a statewide and national standard of care was no longer warranted because \u201c[u]nder contemporary conditions there is little reason to retain this vestige of former times when there was a substantial basis for believing that the rural doctor should not be held to the standards of the urban doctor, since the latter had greater access to new theories and had more opportunity to refine his method of practice. . . . We are not aware of any differences in the educational background and training of physicians practicing in Connecticut compared with those in other states. Medical literature of significance is normally disseminated throughout this country and not confined to a particular state.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 301-302. In malpractice cases, \u201c[t]he requirement of expert testimony . . . serves to assist lay people, such as members of the jury and the presiding judge, to understand the applicable [national] standard of care and to evaluate the defendant\u2019s actions in light of that standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Wofsey, Rosen, Kweskin &amp; Kuriansky, </em>231 Conn. 168, 188-89, 646 A.2d 195 (1994). In light of <em>Logan, </em>we conclude that expert testimony establishing a standard of care at a particular hospital is relevant <em>only if </em>it comports with an accepted, applicable national standard of care.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Cardiology Associates of New Haven, </em>46 Conn. App. 377, 390-91, 699 A.2d 271 (affirming trial court\u2019s exclusion, on relevancy grounds, of evidence related to procedures followed by hospital personnel for obtaining blood, and stating that evidence \u201cwould be relevant only if it was later supported by expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>testimony that a cardiologist would rely on a resident to order blood on an expeditious basis\u201d), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 933, 702 A.2d 640 (1997); <em>Koontz </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>870 S.W.2d 885, 892 (Mo. App. 1993) (\u201c[hospital] rules and regulations are not admissible to establish negligence <em>unless </em>expert testimony is offered to establish the standard of care\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In the present case, the defendants offered sufficient expert testimony to link the practices at St. Vincent\u2019s regarding the intubation of a patient in the plaintiffs condition with a national standard of care. Several defense witnesses testified as to the standard of care practiced by anesthesiologists at St. Vincent\u2019s. Mintz testified that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of the 500 to 750 disk surgeries he had performed at St. Vincent\u2019s, prior to the plaintiffs disk surgery, utilized standard endotracheal intubation. Similarly, Thomas Bladek,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> an anesthesiologist and chair of the anesthesiology department at St. Vincent\u2019s, testified that there were unwritten protocols at St. Vincent\u2019s for anesthesiologists to utilize standard endotracheal intubation with laryngoscopy for patients with spinal \u201cinstability.\u201d Andrews also testified that since the 1990s, it was consistent with his practice to use endotracheal intubation for a patient in the plaintiffs condition. In the absence of expert testimony linking the St. Vincent\u2019s practice to a national standard of care, the evidence would be inadmissible as irrelevant. The testimony of Jonathan Griswold, the defendants\u2019 anesthesiology expert, however, linked the St. Vincent\u2019s practice to an accepted national standard. In response to a hypothetical question, Griswold testified that \u201clooking at the standard of practice at [St. Vincent\u2019s] at the time and I think for\u2014in most places <em>around the country, </em>for cervical diskectomies,\u201d the standard of care is standard endotracheal intubation rather than fiber-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>optic intubation. (Emphasis added.) Although Gris-wold\u2019s testimony was not a model of clarity, his testimony, as reflected in the trial transcripts, indicates that he considered standard endotracheal intubation to be the applicable standard of care for a patient in the plaintiffs condition, both at St. Vincent\u2019s and at other institutions around the country. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony regarding the standard of care utilized by anesthesiologists at St. Vincent\u2019s because there was sufficient expert testimony linking that standard of care to an accepted national standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The plaintiff contends, nevertheless, that evidence of the local practice at St. Vincent\u2019s was irrelevant evidence of a local standard of care. We are not persuaded. The flaw in the plaintiffs argument is that it presupposes that the juiy found that an \u201cunstable\u201d spine and a spine with \u201cinstability\u201d represent the same degree of injuiy. Such an assumption would render evidence of the local standard of care irrelevant because neither party disputed that an unstable spine required fiber-optic intubation. In other words, the only way that evidence regarding the practices at St. Vincent\u2019s can be irrelevant\u2014and therefore inadmissible\u2014is if the defendants had presented insufficient evidence distinguishing the two terms as distinct medical conditions. As we shall further explain, however, the defendants produced sufficient evidence to warrant a finding by the juiy that the two conditions were different, and that a different standard of care applied\u2014standard endotracheal or fiber-optic intubation\u2014depending on its determination of the plaintiffs spinal condition. Although, admittedly, the lay distinction between these two terms appears strained, we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>285 Conn. 447, 461, 939 A.2d 581 (2008). Moreover, the jury is under no obligation to credit the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>dence offered by any witnesses, including experts; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>183 Conn. 514, 516-17, 440 A.2d 765 (1981); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 121, 123, 438 A.2d 842 (1981); even if that evidence is uncontroverted. <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 344, 430 A.2d 1 (1980). \u201c[T]he acceptance or rejection of an opinion of a qualified expert is a matter for the trier of fact unless the opinion is so unreasonable as to be unacceptable to a rational mind.\u201d <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>146 Conn. 578, 586, 153 A.2d 420 (1959); see also <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 145, 540 A.2d 666 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In the present case, the jury reasonably could have credited testimony that the two terms represent distinct medical conditions and disregarded the plaintiffs experts. Both surgeons, Mintz and Girasole, testified that an unstable spine represents an acute condition such as a patient with a destructive lesion or traumatic injury, and that a spine with instability represents a chronic, less serious condition, in which the spine is fundamentally stable. Robert Samo, the defendants\u2019 radiology expert, viewed the plaintiffs radiological films and concluded that the plaintiff \u201cdid not have an unstable spine.\u201d In addition, both Andrews and Rotondi testified that they believed the plaintiffs spine was stable prior to intubation. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the testimony of several of the plaintiffs experts that the plaintiffs spine was not unstable. Kaye testified that, as of July, 2001, the plaintiff was engaging in vigorous activity including swimming. Likewise, Heller testified that if a patient is myelopathic, it is mandatory to perform fiber-optic intubation, but he later admitted that the plaintiff did not have myelopathy. Because no party disputed that an unstable spine required fiber-optic intubation, the <em>only </em>way to construe the evidence in light of sustaining the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants did not breach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>standard of care is to conclude that the jury found a distinction between unstable and instability. We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that the jury reasonably could have found that the plaintiff did not have an unstable spine. Accordingly, the trial court properly admitted evidence supporting the use of standard endotracheal intubation at St. Vincent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the defendants\u2019 counsel to ask a prejudicial and confusing hypothetical question that misled the jury. The plaintiff principally argues that the hypothetical question was improper because the question incorporated: (1) facts that were not known to the defendants at the time of intubation; and (2) irrelevant evidence regarding the local standard of care at St. Vincent\u2019s. We conclude that because the hypothetical question was proper, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. During trial, defense counsel elicited expert testimony from Griswold via a long and complex hypothetical question. As we discussed previously, the hypothetical sought to elicit Griswold\u2019s opinion as to whether the defendants had complied with the applicable standard of care. The question itself contained a series of assumptions. The assumptions reasonably can be divided into two categories^\u2014assumptions that relate to the standard of care practiced at St. Vincent\u2019s, and assumptions about the plaintiffs medical condition. The assumptions with respect to the plaintiffs medical condition shared the commonality that they all tended to support the contention that the plaintiff did not have an unstable spine. For example, the hypothetical referenced medical reports, examinations and trial testimony indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that the plaintiffs spine was not unstable. Although each fact contained in the hypothetical was admitted into evidence at trial, it was undisputed that the information contained in the medical reports, examinations and trial testimony were unknown to the defendants at the time of intubation. Based on our reasoning in part I of this opinion, however, it is evident that the jury reasonably could have found, and likely did find, that each such assumption was a fact that <em>actually existed </em>at the time of intubation, but which was not personally known to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The plaintiff twice objected to the hypothetical question. In his first objection, the plaintiff asserted that \u201c[t]his isn\u2019t a hypothetical anymore. He\u2019s leading the witness through the entire thing.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection on the ground that the assumptions were trial testimony that could not be refuted. In his subsequent colloquy with the court, the plaintiff conceded that he had \u201cno problem with the trial testimony. \u201d The plaintiffs second objection was to the form of the question. The trial court also overruled that objection. In the plaintiffs postverdict motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, however, the plaintiff argued that the hypothetical was improper principally because it incorporated facts not known to the defendants at the time of intubation. In this appeal, the plaintiff renews that claim and adds a claim that the question was improper because it contained irrelevant evidence concerning the standard of care at St. Vincent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">As a threshold matter, we set forth our standard of review. The determination of the admissibility of a hypothetical question \u201ccalls for the exercise of a sound discretion as to whether the question, even though it does not contain all of the facts in evidence, presents the facts in such a manner that they [1] bear a true and fair relationship to each other and to the whole evidence in the case ... [2] is not so worded as to be likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mislead or confuse the jury, and [3] is not so lacking in the essential facts as to be without value in the decision of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 77, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-4 (c). We therefore review such questions under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The plaintiffs first contention is that the hypothetical question was improper because it incorporated facts that were not known to the defendants at the time of intubation, even though the jury reasonably could have found that such facts existed in actuality, i.e., that the plaintiffs spine was not unstable. In support of this argument, the plaintiff cites our decision in <em>Tomer </em>v. <em>American Home Products Corp., </em>170 Conn. 681, 687, 368 A.2d 35 (1976), for the proposition that determining whether a defendant has breached the standard of care cannot be proven with hindsight evidence. Essentially, <em>Tomer </em>holds that if the scientific knowledge at the time of the alleged breach established that \u201cmedicine X\u201d was safe for children, then a later discovery that \u201cmedicine X\u201d was indeed not safe for children would be inadmissible to show that a physician had breached the standard of care. See id. Although we agree with the underlying proposition in <em>Tomer, </em>we conclude that <em>Tomer </em>does not support the plaintiffs argument in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In this case, the facts assumed in the hypothetical bore a true and fair relationship to each other and to the facts that the defendants believed at the time of intubation. Andrews testified that, at the time of intubation, he believed the plaintiff \u201cdidn\u2019t have an unstable spine.\u201d Similarly, the facts assumed in the hypothetical also tended to show that the plaintiff did not have an unstable spine prior to intubation. In light of this conformity, the hypothetical did not require the expert to evaluate the defendants\u2019 conduct in hindsight. At its worst, the assumed facts were cumulative of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dants\u2019 own belief that the spine was not unstable at the time of intubation. In short, each assumption was based on a fact in evidence that the jury reasonably could have found, and likely did find, credible within the scope of the defendants\u2019 knowledge at the time of intubation. Such assumptions do not lack a true and fair relationship to each other, nor would they likely confuse and mislead the jury. In ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony, \u201c[t]he trial court has wide discretion . . . and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Viera </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>283 Conn. 412, 444, 927 A.2d 843 (2007). We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the hypothetical question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">As we discussed in part I of this opinion, the flaw in the plaintiffs argument is that it presupposes that the terms instability and unstable represent the same medical condition. The plaintiff contends, therefore, that because Andrews knew that the plaintiffs spine had instability, Andrews also knew the plaintiffs spine was unstable. In the plaintiffs scenario, the assumption in the hypothetical that the plaintiffs spine was <em>stable </em>would have been hindsight evidence because such evidence would have been in contrast to Andrews\u2019 belief at the relevant time. Andrews, however, testified that he interpreted instability, as that term was used by Mintz and Girasole, to mean that the spine was basically stable. Accordingly, as discussed, the assumption in the hypothetical that the plaintiffs spine was <em>stable </em>comported with Andrews\u2019 belief at the relevant time.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">With respect to the plaintiffs other claim, raised for the first time in this court, that the question was improper because it was based, in part, on irrelevant evidence regarding the standard of care at St. Vincent\u2019s, we conclude that the plaintiff did not preserve this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>evidentiary claim for our review. \u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is ordinarily limited to the specific legal [ground] raised by the objection of trial counsel. ... To permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than [that] raised during trial would amount to trial by ambuscade, unfair both to the trial court and to the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stenner, </em>281 Conn. 742, 755, 917 A.2d 28, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 883, 128 S. Ct. 290, 169 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2007); see <em>Skrzypiec </em>v. Noonan, 228 Conn. 1, 22 n.13, 633 A.2d 716 (1993) (declining to address appellate claim that testimony was prejudicial when objection at trial was based on relevance); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. The plaintiff failed to raise this particular claim either in his objection at trial or in his postverdict motion. Accordingly, it is unpreserved, and we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">We next address the plaintiffs claim seeking a new trial because of various alleged improprieties committed by defense counsel during trial. The plaintiff contends that a new trial is required because, among other actions, the defendants\u2019 counsel: (1) utilized an operating room schedule (schedule) that counsel promised not to rely on during trial; and (2) improperly referred during summation to his emotional attachment to Andrews,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> falsely accused the plaintiff of having changed his claims against the defendants, and, at one point, cried in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. The record reveals the following undisputed facts. The schedule contains a redacted list of various patients and the corresponding surgeries that were to be performed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>including the plaintiffs, on the same day as the plaintiffs surgery. For an unspecified reason, St. Vincent\u2019s did not include the schedule within the documents subpoenaed by the plaintiff. During trial, the plaintiff suspected that the defendants possessed an additional document that had not been included in the St. Vincent\u2019s disclosure. When defense counsel admitted that the defendants possessed the schedule, the trial court ordered them to release a copy of the schedule to the plaintiff. The defendants complied. At the time, defense counsel told the court and the plaintiff that he would neither use, nor have any expert rely on, the schedule during trial. The court, however, did not issue an order prohibiting the use of the schedule. Contrary to defense counsel\u2019s representation, however, he sought to elicit testimony from Mintz using the schedule. The plaintiff objected, but defense counsel withdrew the question before the trial court\u2019s ruling. Later, defense counsel did use the schedule in his direct examination of Andrews without objection. Defense counsel again referred to the schedule in his closing argument, but the plaintiff did not object. With respect to the other allegations of impropriety during defense counsel\u2019s summation, the plaintiff also did not object. It is important to note, however, that the trial court interrupted defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, and, at sidebar, instructed defense counsel to \u201cstop it right now\u201d after he displayed visible emotion in front of the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Subsequent to trial, the plaintiff raised the issues of the schedule and the summation improprieties in his postverdict motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial.

With respect to <em>Golding </em>review, a party \u201ccan prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the [party] of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the [opposing party] has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).

While the plaintiffs brief on this issue consists of five pages of argument, we do not find the number of pages related to a particular argument to be dispositive. With respect to the schedule, the plaintiffs brief consists of three pages of facts and <em>no </em>citation to any legal authority. We consider that claim to be abandoned. With respect to the alleged improprieties of defense counsel during summation, the plaintiffs brief is devoid of legal analysis regarding <em>any </em>of the <em>Golding </em>prongs or plain error review. In fact, the only discussion of <em>Golding </em>or plain error review in the plaintiffs brief consists of a lone citation, in a footnote, to <em>Golding </em>and to \u201cthe plain error doctrine.\u201d In addition, none of the cases that the plaintiff cites relate to either <em>Golding </em>review or plain error review. Having concluded that the plaintiff failed to brief adequately the issue of the alleged improprieties by defense counsel with respect to <em>Golding </em>and plain error review, we also conclude that the interests of justice do not require that we review this claim under our inherent supervisory authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 172 n.16.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly awarded the defendants various trial costs.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We set forth our standard of review.

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 294-95, 933 A.2d 256 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In the present case, it is clear that, standing alone, \u00a7 52-195 (b) does not authorize the recovery of the defendants\u2019 costs. Aside from the explicit authorization to recover attorney\u2019s fees not to exceed $350, \u00a7 52-195 (b) itself is not a basis for taxing any other particular cost, and the term \u201ccosts\u201d is not further defined by the statute. In <em>Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramidas, P.C. </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 434, we observed that Practice Book \u00a7 17-13 does not permit recovery for costs not otherwise authorized by statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See also <em>Arnone </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Enfield, </em>79 Conn.

We believe it is appropriate to construe Practice Book \u00a7 17-3 and \u00a7 52-195 in pari materia. Accordingly, \u00a7 52-195 requires a plaintiff to pay costs that are <em>authorized elsewhere in the statutes </em>if the plaintiff fails to recover more than the offer of compromise. Therefore, the defendants must rely on additional statutory bases to support the taxing of costs to the plaintiff. We address each item of costs awarded by the trial court in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial court awarded $7785.46 for the expense of daily expedited trial transcripts. Because no statute expressly authorizes these costs, we conclude that the transcript costs may not be recovered. In <em>Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramidas, P.C. </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 433-34, we addressed the issue of whether the trial court could tax trial transcript costs to a plaintiff. In that case, we observed that \u201c[n] either the defendant nor the trial court . . . has identified any statute authorizing [trial transcript] costs or provided any authority for the proposition that the costs referred to in [Practice Book] \u00a7 17-13 [the offer of judgment section] may include costs not otherwise authorized by statute.\u201d Id., 434. Similarly, in this case, because neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the defendants nor the trial court has identified a statutory authority for taxing trial transcript costs, the trial court improperly awarded these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The trial court awarded $1632.50 for expenses incurred when the defendants\u2019 attorney attended a deposition of Heller via videoconference. Because no statute expressly authorizes this cost, the defendants argue that \u00a7 52-257 (b) (12) substantiates the trial court\u2019s award because it \u201ccontemplates\u201d video. This reliance is misplaced. Section 52-257 (b) (12) permits recovery \u201cfor the recording, videotaping, transcribing and presentation of the deposition of a practitioner of the healing arts . . . that is used in lieu of live testimony in the civil action . . . .\u201d The plain meaning is clear. The text authorizes recovery only for the costs of videotaping a deposition used in lieu of live testimony. The defendants\u2019 argument fails for two reasons. First, the deposition was not used in lieu of five testimony. The deponent, Heller, testified at trial. Second, there is no authority to support the contention that the subsection\u2019s use of the prefix \u201cvideo\u201d is meant to permit recovery for any expense, other than that specifically referenced, which also happens to include the prefix \u201cvideo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The trial court awarded $16,500 for the expense of having the defendants and their employees testify at trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> No statute expressly authorizes the taxing of this cost. The defendants cite \u00a7 52-257 (b) (1) for the proposition that a plaintiff may be taxed for the expense of a defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Section 52-257 (b) (1) permits aparty to recover \u201c[f]or each witness attending court, the witness\u2019 legal fee and mileage . . . .\u201d Section 52-260 (f), more specifically refers to witness fees for any practitioner of the healing arts, which includes physicians and registered nurses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Ludington </em>v. Sayers, 64 Conn. App. 768, 780-81, 778 A.2d 262 (2001) (observing that \u00a7 52-260 [\u00b6] should be interpreted with regard to subsections [a] and [b] of \u00a7 52-257 because legislature is presumed to have created consistent body of law). While the statutes do not define the term \u201cwitness,\u201d the defendants do not cite any authority indicating that the legislature intended the term, as used in \u00a7 52-257 or \u00a7 52-260, to include fees for a plaintiff or a defendant testifying in his or her own case. In fact, such a construction runs counter to the American rule whereby \u201cordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 576, 582, 923 A.2d 697 (2007). It is difficult to conceive why a plaintiff or a defendant, both of whom are often present during trial, should be compensated for time spent sitting in the witness chair as opposed to time spent sitting at counsel table. Absent express statutory language to the contrary, we will not read such a construction into the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The plaintiff contests the trial court\u2019s award of the following costs for the defense experts\u2019 nontestimonial work: (1) $7700 for trial preparation time; (2) $3500 for travel expenses; and (3) $817.41 for transportation and hotel expenses. Because no statute expressly authorizes these costs, we agree with the plaintiff that they were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The question of whether costs for the trial preparation time of a defendants\u2019 experts can be taxed to a plaintiff who did not recover more than the offer of judgment is one of first impression. <em>In Levesque </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 234, 262, 943 A.2d 430 (2008), we observed that \u201c[i]n <em>[M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 710] ... we did not decide whether the trial court had the statutory authority to award costs to [the plaintiff] for the fee that it had incurred for its appraiser\u2019s trial <em>preparation </em>time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the present case, both parties argue that \u00a7 52-260 (f) is the relevant statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">At the outset, we observe that there is a split of authority among trial courts on the interpretation of \u00a7 52-260 (f) as it relates to an expert\u2019s trial preparation time. Compare, e.g., <em>Bonomo </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Docket No. CV-04-4001273-S (November 19, 2007) (44 Conn. L. Rptr. 492) (concluding that \u00a7 52-260 [\u00b6] authorizes award of costs for expert\u2019s trial preparation time); with <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Ciaburri, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. CV-02-0389926-S (April 19, 2007) (43 Conn. L. Rptr. 273) (concluding that \u00a7 52-260 [\u00b6] does not authorize award of costs for expert\u2019s trial preparation time).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">We first look to the text of \u00a7 52-260 (f) to determine whether the text itself and its relationship to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>statutes reveals a clear and unambiguous meaning. The relevant portion of \u00a7 52-260 (f) provides: \u201cWhen any practitioner of the healing arts . . . gives expert testimony in any action or proceeding, including by means of a deposition, the court shall determine a reasonable fee to be paid to such practitioner of the healing arts . . . and taxed as part of the costs in lieu of all other witness fees payable to such practitioner of the healing arts . . . It is clear that the language of \u00a7 52-260 (f) neither authorizes a reasonable fee for an expert\u2019s trial preparation time as distinguished from his or her in-court trial testimony, nor expressly authorizes costs for an expert\u2019s travel, transportation and hotel costs. Thus, as we noted in <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 717, \u201c[b]y its express terms, \u00a7 52-260 (f) treats as taxable only those costs that arise from an expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d Accordingly, absent such an express legislative provision, we find no reason to abrogate this state\u2019s long-standing adherence to the American rule that litigants are responsible for the payment of their own litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 234, does not control our conclusion in the present action. In that case, we concluded that the plain terms of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3) authorized the award of costs associated with the time spent by an expert in preparation for his or her deposition.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Id., 263. We relied on a federal District Court\u2019s inteipre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tation of rule 26 (b) (4) (C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is identical to \u00a7 13-4 (3) of the Connecticut rules of practice, to conclude that \u201c \u2018[t]ime spent preparing for a deposition is, literally speaking, time spent in responding to discovery . . . .\u2019 <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Woodridge, </em>197 F.R.D. 354, 357 (N.D. Ill. 1999).\u201d <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 259. Furthermore, we saw \u201cno reason why the broad language of \u00a7 52-260 (f) should be narrowly construed to conflict with the clear import of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (3).\u201d Id., 263. In the present action, however, there is no applicable provision within the rules of practice to authorize the cost expressly, nor is there a corollary federal rule to support a different inteipretation of \u00a7 52-260 (f) than the one derived from its plain meaning. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly awarded costs for nontestimonial work performed by the defendants\u2019 expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the award of certain costs only and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified to eliminate the award of costs in accordance with this opinion.
