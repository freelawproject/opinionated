We conclude that the defendant waived his first claim by agreeing to a limiting instruction regarding the hearsay statements at issue. With respect to the defendant\u2019s second claim, we conclude that his confrontation rights were not violated because the defense had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On Friday evening, June 27, 2003, the victim, Johnny Figueroa, and two of his friends, Peter Davila and Shavoyteay Sparks, attended a carnival at St. Bridget\u2019s Church in the town of Manchester. Sparks had driven the victim to the carnival and had parked his car behind the residence of Davila\u2019s grandmother, Marianne Risley. That residence, located at 18 Wood<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>land Street in Manchester, was a short walking distance from the carnival grounds. The victim also had attended the carnival earlier in the week and had overheard a group of men discussing the possibility of robbing him of the jewelry that he had been wearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">While at the carnival on Friday evening, the victim received a call on his cellular telephone from a friend, Megan Sears, who told him that she was in her car behind Risley\u2019s home. Thereafter, the victim, Davila and Sparks left the carnival to meet Sears. Upon leaving, the three men noticed that approximately fifteen to twenty men, including the defendant, were following them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">As the victim, Davila and Sparks approached Risley\u2019s residence, Davila separated from the victim and Sparks, apparently to take a shortcut. At about the same time, one of the men in the group that had been following the victim and his two friends called out to the victim. This person, who subsequently was identified as the defendant, stated that he wanted to speak to the victim. The victim ignored the defendant\u2019s overture, however, and he and Sparks continued toward the 18 Woodland Street residence. Upon arriving there, the victim and Sparks entered an enclosed porch attached to the residence. The defendant and several other men followed the victim and Sparks there, and demanded the victim\u2019s jewelry. At this time, Risley emerged from the house and told the defendant and his companions to leave or she would call the police. The defendant then shot the victim in the chest. The defendant and his companions then fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Thereafter, the defendant was charged with and tried for various offenses stemming from the shooting of the victim. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of two counts of assault in the first degree and one count of carrying a pistol without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>On appeal, the defendant raises two claims under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. First, he contends that his confrontation rights were violated when the trial court permitted the state to cross-examine him about certain statements that allegedly had been made to the police by an unavailable declarant, Geraldo Rivera, concerning Rivera\u2019s efforts to assist the defendant in disposing of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The defendant also maintains that his rights under the confrontation clause were violated when the trial court permitted the state to introduce into evidence a prior written statement of an eyewitness, Jerrod Smith, even though, at trial, Smith testified that he had no knowledge of the contents of that statement. We disagree with both of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The defendant first contends that his sixth amendment rights were violated when the trial court permitted the assistant state\u2019s attorney to introduce certain hearsay statements of Rivera during cross-examination of the defendant. In particular, the defendant claims that the challenged portion of his cross-examination violated his rights under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), pursuant to which the hearsay statements of an unavailable declarant that are testimonial in nature are barred under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment unless the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim because it was waived at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this claim. At trial, the defendant testified on direct examination that he had attended the carnival at St. Bridget\u2019s Church on June 27, 2003, with two friends, Rivera and Shane Johnson. The defendant also acknowledged that he had fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>lowed a group of people from the carnival to the residence located at 18 Woodland Street but testified that he had remained on the front lawn of that residence and did not enter the enclosed porch. According to the defendant, he ran from the area after hearing a noise that he presumed was a gunshot. That night, the defendant returned to his home and, thereafter, stayed at his brother\u2019s home in Rocky Hill for approximately one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On cross-examination, the assistant state\u2019s attorney questioned the defendant as to whether it was true that he had gone to Rivera\u2019s house on the morning of June 28, 2003, and asked Rivera to drive him to Hartford for the purpose of disposing of the weapon that he had used to shoot the victim. The defendant denied doing so. The assistant state\u2019s attorney then asked the defendant whether he knew that Rivera had given a statement to the police explaining that the defendant had arrived at Rivera\u2019s home on the morning after the shooting and, at that time, asked Rivera for assistance in disposing of the gun used in the shooting. The defendant admitted that he was aware of Rivera\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sel did not object to this portion of the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Following a recess, and outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel informed the trial court that he was concerned about the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questioning of the defendant regarding Rivera\u2019s statements to the police. Defense counsel explained that Rivera was unavailable because, if called on to testify, Rivera intended to invoke his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in response to any questions. Although defense counsel acknowledged that he had not raised a contemporaneous objection to any of the questions involving Rivera\u2019s statements, defense counsel requested that the court take some corrective action, ranging \u201cfrom a mistrial on one end of the spectrum to some sort of curative instruction [on the other end].\u201d After observing that defense counsel had failed to object when the questions were asked, the court pressed defense counsel to be more specific with respect to his request. Defense counsel responded: \u201cI guess what I would ask for, [at] this point in time, would be possibly some sort of curative instruction . . . [a]bout . . . Rivera not being available as a witness in this trial.\u201d Following further discussion between the court and counsel about Rivera\u2019s unavailability, the assistant state\u2019s attorney stated that he \u201ccertainly would not object to an instruction that . . . Rivera\u2019s statements] [were] not introduced for substantive purposes,\u201d and that \u201cprobably, the best thing is, as [defense counsel has] requested, [an] instruction that [Rivera is] unavailable.\u201d Defense counsel responded by expressing his agreement with such an instruction, adding that it was not necessary for the court to give the instruction until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the court delivered its final charge to the jury at the conclusion of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The following day, during a discussion about the charging conference that previously had occurred, the trial court stated: \u201cOkay. [The] [defendant's request, it was added to the instruction, something about . . . Rivera not being available to either side. And I believe both sides agreed on the language. Is that right?\u201d Both the assistant state\u2019s attorney and defense counsel responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In its final instructions to the jury following the closing arguments of counsel, the trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cDuring the evidentiary portion of this case, you heard about statements attributed to . . . Rivera. This court has determined that . . . Rivera was unavailable as a witness in [this] case through no fault of either party, the state or the defendant. . . . Rivera was not available for either direct or cross-examination as a witness, and, therefore, the statements attributed to . . . Rivera are not to be used as substantive evidence.\u201d Defense counsel took no exception to this portion of the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The defendant cannot prevail on his unpreserved constitutional claim because it falls squarely within the waiver doctrine that this court adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 481-82, 915 A.2d 872 (2007). Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>lessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable . . . and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 476-77. As we explained in <em>Fabricatore, </em>\u201c[i]n the usual <em>Golding </em>situation, the defendant raises a claim on appeal [that], while not preserved at trial, at least was not waived at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 478. As we also explained in <em>Fabricatore, </em>a constitutional claim that <em>has </em>been waived does not satisfy the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>test because, in such circumstances, \u201cwe simply cannot conclude that injustice [has been] done to either party ... or that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 482; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>283 Conn. 352, 361, 927 A.2d 825 (2007). To reach a contrary conclusion would result in an ambush of the trial court by permitting the defendant to raise a claim on appeal that his or her counsel expressly had abandoned in the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 482-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In the present case, defense counsel clearly and unequivocally agreed to the limiting instruction that the trial court gave to the jury concerning the statements that the assistant state\u2019s attorney had attributed to Rivera during cross-examination of the defendant. Although defense counsel suggested that he might seek a mistrial, he elected not to do so, instead expressing his satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant contends that he is not barred from challenging the propriety of the limiting instruction because the state has not demonstrated that waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>any claim under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36, was knowing and intelligent. Although a defendant will not be deemed to have waived certain constitutional rights unless the state can demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 202-203, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008) (defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel must be knowing and intelligent); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>277 Conn. 764, 780, 894 A.2d 963 (2006) (defendant\u2019s guilty plea must be knowing and voluntary); that requirement is inapplicable when, as in the present case, counsel has waived a potential constitutional claim in the exercise of his or her professional judgment. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, the state need not establish that defense counsel was aware of the applicability of <em>Crawford </em>to the factual scenario presented. In our adversary system, the trial court was entitled to presume that defense counsel was familiar with <em>Crawford </em>and had acted competently in determining that the limiting instruction was adequate to safeguard the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise would require the trial court to canvass defense counsel with respect to counsel\u2019s understanding of the relevant constitutional principles before accepting counsel\u2019s agreement on how to proceed. For good reason, there is nothing in our criminal law that supports such a requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim under <em>Crawford </em>because that claim has been waived as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s agreement with the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The defendant next contends that his confrontation rights were violated when the trial court permitted the state to introduce into evidence Smith\u2019s prior inconsistent statement under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are pertinent to our resolution of this claim. Smith, who had been present both at the carnival and at the 18 Woodland Street residence on the night of the incident, was called by the state as a witness. On direct examination, the assistant state\u2019s attorney attempted to refresh Smith\u2019s recollection of the events surrounding the June 27, 2003 shooting by showing Smith a written statement that, according to the state, Smith had provided to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Manchester police in the early morning hours of June 28, 2003. Although Smith acknowledged that he had given an oral statement to the police at that time and that the written statement bore his signature and initials, Smith further testified that the police never had reduced his oral statement to writing. Smith also stated that he did not recognize the written statement and that he did not recall telling the police most of what appeared in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The assistant state\u2019s attorney then was granted permission by the court to suspend his direct examination of Smith and to call Detective James Graham of the Manchester police department. Graham testified that he had interviewed Smith at the Manchester police headquarters on June 28, 2003. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Graham explained that Smith had told him that, prior to the incident in which the victim was shot, he had overheard the defendant tell someone that he was \u201cgoing to get . . . somebody ... at this carnival in Manchester . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Graham testified that Smith also had told him that, later, at the carnival, Smith saw the defendant, who told Smith that he had found the person whom he was looking for. Smith told Graham that the defendant, Smith and approximately twenty other people thereafter followed that person, who subsequently was identified as the victim, to the 18 Woodland Street address. Smith testified that he did not enter the 18 Woodland Street residence, and, when he heard the gunshot, he and the others fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Graham also testified that, after obtaining Smith\u2019s oral statement, he reduced that statement to a typewritten version on a desktop computer at police headquarters, verifying each piece of information with Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>who sat next to Graham as he typed. When the statement was completed, Smith reviewed it for any inaccuracies. Smith then acknowledged the accuracy of the typewritten statement<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and signed and initialed it. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s direct examination of Graham, the trial court permitted the state to introduce Smith\u2019s written statement as substantive evidence in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">After defense counsel had completed his cross-examination of Graham, Smith returned to the witness stand and was questioned briefly by the state. On cross-examination by defense counsel, Smith testified at length about his knowledge of the incident, his version of the police interview, and the discrepancies between his trial testimony and the written statement. In particular, Smith denied that the defendant ever had told him that he was going to \u201cget\u201d or harm anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the admission of Smith\u2019s written statement violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. Specifically, the defendant contends that, because Smith testified that the police never had obtained a written statement from him, Smith was functionally unavailable for cross-examination, and, therefore, the state was barred, under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68, from introducing the statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We commence our review of the defendant\u2019s claim with certain applicable principles of law. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 743, this court determined that an out-of-court statement is admissible as substantive evidence if (1) the statement is a prior inconsistent statement, (2) it is signed by the declarant, (3) the declarant has personal knowledge of the facts stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>therein, and (4) the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. Id., 753; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5 (1). The defendant\u2019s claim on appeal pertains only to the fourth prong of the <em>Whelan </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u201cUnder <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 68, the hearsay statements of an unavailable witness that are testimonial in nature may be admitted under the sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause only if the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>286 Conn. 634, 651-52, 945 A.2d 449 (2008). If, however, the declarant \u201cis deemed to have been available for cross-examination at trial, his statement does not implicate the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 78, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is foreclosed by <em>Pierre, </em>in which we rejected the contention of the defendant, Gregory Pierre, that, even though \u201c[the witness] took the stand and answered questions, he was \u2018functionally unavailable\u2019 for cross-examination as to the contents of his [prior written] statement [to the police]\u201d; id., 79; because of his claimed memory loss at trial and his testimony that he had signed the statement only to keep the police from harassing him. Id. We noted that Pierre\u2019s \u201cargument equate [d] a declarant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to remember prior statements made to the police with a general unavailability from cross-examination in its entirety.\u201d Id. In <em>Pierre, </em>\u201c[w]e relied on our previous <em>Whelan </em>jurisprudence, and sister state decisions that had interpreted <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>availability element; see id., 81-84; and concluded that \u2018a witness\u2019 claimed inability to remember earlier statements or the events sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>rounding those statements does not implicate the requirements of the confrontation clause under <em>Crawford, </em>[as] long as the witness appears at trial, takes an oath to testify truthfully, and answers the questions put to him or her during cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>supra, 286 Conn. 653, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Although Smith testified that he had never provided the police with a written statement, he took the stand, swore to testify truthfully, was subject to extensive cross-examination by defense counsel and answered all questions posed to him. During his testimony, Smith acknowledged that he had given an oral statement to the police and that his signature and initials appeared on the written statement. Smith was questioned about his recollection of the events relating to the shooting of the victim, his relationship with other persons involved in the incident, including the defendant, the statements that he had given to the police, and his contention that the police had threatened to arrest him if he refused to speak to them about the shooting incident. Consequently, there is no reason to conclude that Smith was functionally unavailable for cross-examination merely because he claimed that he had not given the police a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that this case is distinguishable from <em>Pierre </em>by virtue of the fact that Smith denied having provided a written statement to the police when the witness in <em>Pierre </em>did not. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 56. We see no material difference between <em>Pierre </em>and the present case. In each case, the witness disavowed the contents of his prior written statement. Moreover, although Smith claimed that he had not given the police a written statement\u2014despite his concession that the written statement attributed to him by the state contained his signature and initials\u2014 Smith did acknowledge giving the police an oral state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ment. The defense, therefore, had a full and fair opportunity to examine Smith about his version of the events surrounding his questioning by the police. The sixth amendment requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) and 53a-49 (a) (2), and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2) and 53a-48 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> The trial court imposed a total effective sentence of twenty-one years imprisonment, execution suspended after fourteen years, and five years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> See <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>300 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.

See footnote 10 of this opinion and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> Of course, in circumstances in which defense counsel\u2019s waiver of a constitutional claim cannot be justified, that is, when the waiver constitutes a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel, the defendant may seek recourse through habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings are available to safeguard the constitutional rights of any defendant who has been prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his or her attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> The defendant relies on <em>Reinke </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital </em>Assn., 175 Conn. 24, 392 A.2d 966 (1978), to support his contention that defense counsel\u2019s agreement to the limiting instruction does not foreclose his claim on appeal because the record does not reflect that counsel\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. In <em>Reinke, </em>an arbitration case, counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for the defendants agreed that they had confidence in the arbitrator and that he did not need to be sworn as required by statute. Id., 25. Although the governing statute expressly required a <em>written </em>waiver of the arbitrator\u2019s oath, no such written waiver was executed. Id., 26. After the arbitrator had rendered a decision for the defendants, the plaintiff filed an application to vacate the award, claiming that the arbitrator had not been sworn and that there was no written waiver of the oath. Id. The trial court rendered judgment granting the plaintiffs application to vacate; id.; and this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. See id., 30. In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, we stated, without elaboration, that \u201c[n] either the fact that the plaintiff raised the question of the oath, nor the fact that he agreed that no oath need be administered, indicates actual knowledge of a right which was intentionally relinquished.\u201d Id., 27-28. <em>Reinke </em>does not control our resolution of the present case because our decision in <em>Reinke </em>was governed by an express statutory waiver requirement. To the extent that <em>Reinke </em>remains good law, we see no reason to extend its limited holding to the factual scenario presented by this criminal case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> Defense counsel relied on <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36, as one of the bases for his objection to Graham\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of Smith\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> Graham testified that he had Smith raise his right hand and swear to the truthfulness of the typewritten statement, which Smith did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> The state does not claim on appeal that Smith\u2019s statements were not testimonial in nature within the meaning of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
