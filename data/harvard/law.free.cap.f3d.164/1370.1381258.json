Hitt was convicted of forty federal offenses, all arising out of his long-running and highly successful scheme to defraud the Veterans Administration by making false claims of physical disability. He appeals both his convictions and sentences. He challenges his convictions on the ground that the district court abused its discretion in permitting prosecution witnesses to answer questions such as the following1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-9\">If the defendant claimed that he had quit his job in March of 1979 at Ebasc'o because of his disability, is that correct or incorrect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-10\">If the defendant reported that he\u2019s unable to walk in 1985, is that true or false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-11\">If he claimed that he lost total use of his right hand to his disabilities, is that true or false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-12\">If he claimed those things to the Veterans Administration, tell the members of the jury is that true or false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-13\">If he claimed he was confined to a wheelchair when you knew him, is that true or is that a lie?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-14\">Hitt challenges his sentences on the ground that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level for obstruction of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-15\">The prosecutor\u2019s questions were clearly inappropriate, in that they sought opinion testimony concerning the validity of the claims of disability Hitt made to the Veterans Administration in carrying out his scheme to defraud. In essence, the witnesses were asked to answer the very questions the jury would be called upon to answer; the questions constituted nothing more than lawyer argument \u2014 the prosecutor\u2019s summation to the jury in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-17\">The problem with Hitt\u2019s challenge is twofold. First, his attorney hardly objected to the prosecutor\u2019s tack, and when he did the objection missed the mark. For example, when the prosecutor asked (witness West) the first question quoted above, the objection was \u201cObjection. Beyond this witness\u2019s knowledge.\u201d Second, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, and any error the court may have committed \u2014 by not sustaining the few objections that were made or by not calling the prosecutor to the sidebar and explaining the error of his ways \u2014 was absolutely harmless. Hence, we do not disturb Hitt\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-18\">As for Hitt\u2019s sentences, we conclude that the district court properly enhanced Hitt\u2019s base offense level for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.3(f)) (Nov. 1, 1997). The court based the enhancement on (1) the false statements (regarding his ownership of real estate) Hitt made to the magistrate judge at an indigency hearing held following his arrest to determine his eligibility for court-appointed counsel and (2) his statement to a Veterans Administration employee that he \u201cwould like to blow [investigating FBI Agent McBride\u2019s] brains out.\u201d Concerning the statements to the magistrate judge, we have rejected similar arguments \u2014 that the statements were irrelevant to the offenses alleged in the indictment and thus should not be considered as obstruction of justice, <em>see United States v. Ruff, </em>79 F.3d 123, 125 (11th Cir.1996) \u2014 and we do so again here. We also reject Hitt\u2019s argument that the court should not have considered the statement to the Veterans Administration employee because he neither intended, nor anticipated, that the statement would be communicated to McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
