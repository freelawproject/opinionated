Poe filed a complaint for judicial review in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and later moved for judgment on the pleadings. The judge affirmed the board\u2019s classification decision. Poe appealed, claiming (1) that he was denied due process and the equal protection of the law by the hearing officer\u2019s refusal, in accordance with 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(15) (2004), to consider his expert witness\u2019s written opinion that Poe was in \u201cthe moderate range for re-offending\u201d; and (2) that his hearing counsel provided ineffective assistance by offering in evidence two documents that Poe contends virtually ensured his classification as a level three sex offender. We granted Poe\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\"><em>Background. </em>In August, 1990, after his second conviction of open and gross lewdness, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, Poe became a \u201c[s]ex offender,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, subject to classification by the board. On or about May 6, 2003, based on its assessment of Poe\u2019s risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness, the board classified Poe as a level one sex offender. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L; 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06 (2004). In January, 2005, after Poe was charged with enticing a child under sixteen years of age, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C (\u00bf9, the board notified him that he had been reclassified a level three sex offender. Poe challenged the classification and requested an evidentiary hearing before a hearing examiner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>After being found indigent pursuant to G. L. c. 211D, counsel was appointed to represent him at the hearing. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L <em>(a), </em>(c); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.07-1.08 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">1. <em>The board\u2019s evidence. </em>At the hearing conducted on July 6, 2006, the board did not call any witnesses and offered only documentary evidence, specifically a classification report dated March 3, 2005; criminal history records; police reports; court dockets; and two sexual offender treatment status reports dated April 30, 2003, and January 5, 2005, of Poe\u2019s licensed therapist, Dr. Anthony Traniello. We summarize, in chronological order, the uncontested documentary evidence offered by the board regarding Poe\u2019s sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In October, 1982, Poe was accused of approaching young students and making obscene remarks to them. Poe was charged with lewdness, but the case was continued without a finding before being dismissed in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">On March 3, 1988, a boy who was a seventh-grade student and his friend observed Poe masturbating on the second floor of a video rental store. Poe was convicted of two counts of open and gross lewdness. He received two sixty-day suspended sentences with probation through December 11, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">On August 7, 1990, a fifteen year old boy was walking home when he observed a red automobile with Poe inside. As the boy passed by the vehicle, he noticed Poe masturbating. The boy yelled at Poe, and Poe drove away. The boy reported that Poe had done this to him and his thirteen year old brother in the past. Poe was convicted of one count of open and gross lewdness and received three years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">On October 25, 1990, a Brookline police officer responded to a report that several boys had been followed by Poe in his vehicle. When Poe observed one of the boys write down his registration plate number, Poe reversed direction and rapidly drove away. No charges were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">On February 22, 1991, the mothers of three young boys reported to the police that Poe had been following their sons for the previous two days. The responding officer approached Poe, who was in an ice cream store at the time, pretending to use the telephone. No charges were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">On January 15, 1993, according to Poe\u2019s criminal history rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ord, he was charged with one count of open and gross lewdness, but the charge was dismissed nine months later. The board did not introduce a police report or any other details related to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">On September 17, 2002, a Brookline police report documented that a male student was walking home when Poe drove by him and honked his horn. The student went into his house and then reemerged and walked toward school. Poe passed him twice more, staring at him both times. The boy was afraid and nervous, and when he arrived at school, he described Poe\u2019s actions to his principal, who notified the police. In response to police questioning, Poe admitted to having honked his horn and looked at the boy. The report also stated that another police officer had noticed Poe passing by a nearby school at least three times on September 9, 2002. Poe was charged with disorderly conduct as a result of the incident involving the boy walking to school, but the charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">On October 16, 2004, the Brookline police department received an electronic message (e-mail) that relayed electronically-transmitted text messages, or \u201cinstant messages,\u201d during an \u201conline conversation\u201d or \u201cchat,\u201d between Poe and a person posing as a fourteen year old boy, who was referred to in the police report as \u201cT.\u201d Poe began the conversation by typing, \u201c[H]i, i love really nice young teen boys ok with you i hope so.\u201d Poe stated that he lived in Massachusetts, and T responded that he flew into Boston when he went to visit his grandmother in New Hampshire. Poe said that he would \u201creally love\u201d to meet T and asked him to be his boy friend. Poe indicated his willingness to perform sexual favors on T. Poe also stated that he frequently had oral sex with two young brothers, one fifteen years of age and the other thirteen years of age, who lived near him. Near the end of the \u201cchat,\u201d Poe admitted that he was masturbating during the instant messaging exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">On November 3, 2004, T again sent to police, by e-mail, part of an online instant messaging chat in which Poe asked a fifteen year old boy to \u201cwork with [him] on his ranch\u201d taking care of horses. On November 29, 2004, Brookline police officers met with Poe, and he admitted to writing the nonsexual content of the online \u201cchat\u201d with T, but could not explain who typed the rest of the conversation, even though he admitted that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the only one with access to his online account. Poe acknowledged that he used to live near two brothers, one fifteen years of age and the other thirteen years of age, and that he would spend time with them when their mother borrowed his vehicle. He also stated that he had communicated with five or six boys in Internet \u201cchat rooms\u201d in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">As a result of this conduct, Poe pleaded guilty on October 7, 2005, to one count of enticing a child under the age of sixteen, and received a one-year suspended sentence in the house of correction with three years\u2019 probation. On the Commonwealth\u2019s recommendation, Poe was also ordered to attend sex offender counselling, provide a deoxyribonucleic acid sample, stay away from children under eighteen years of age, refrain from employment or volunteer work involving children under eighteen, and have no access to the Internet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">2. <em>Poe\u2019s evidence. </em>Poe called one witness at the hearing, Michael Reed, who first met Poe in 1982, and in 1989 became his case manager at the Department of Mental Retardation (department).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reed testified that intelligence testing conducted on Poe in 1982 indicated that he had an intelligence quotient of sixty-eight, which placed him in the mild retardation range. Poe \u201cfunctions on . . . probably about a sixteen, seventeen year old level.\u201d Poe, who was forty-eight years of age at the time of the hearing, had lived with his elderly parents since 2001.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When asked if plans had been made as to where Poe would live after his parents died, Reed said that Poe\u2019s parents had discussed purchasing a condominium unit for him, but if he needed a department placement in a residential facility and was classified a level three offender, he would be placed farther away from his relatives and would be under twenty-four hour supervision. Reed testified that Poe had been employed at the same super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>market for over three years, but a level three classification would probably cause Poe to lose his job and make it difficult for the department to find a work program for him that would be \u201csecure\u201d and not involve interaction with adolescents.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Reed testified that in the early 1990\u2019s Poe was prescribed a sex drive inhibitor, but he stopped taking it due to negative physical side effects. At the time of the hearing, Poe had an upcoming appointment with a new psychiatrist in hopes of finding a different medication. He had been seeing Dr. Traniello for sex offender treatment once per week for several years, and was preparing to begin group therapy as well. Reed testified that he envisioned Poe\u2019s treatment \u201ccontinuing forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Reed stated that he had discussed with Poe his latest conviction of enticing a child under the age of sixteen. He said that Poe was \u201cquite surprised\u201d by the prosecution because he did not believe his online conduct was \u201cthat big a deal\u201d and he \u201chad no intentions of acting on it.\u201d In addition, Reed testified that Poe denied ever engaging in sexual contact with an adolescent male, even though he claimed to have done so during the course of the online chat.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">During Poe\u2019s direct examination of Reed, Poe offered several exhibits in evidence, of which only one is relevant to this appeal: a letter from Dr. Traniello to Poe\u2019s counsel dated two days before the hearing, which expressed his opinion that Poe had made \u201cconsiderable progress\u201d and \u201csubstantially improved\u201d and that \u201chistorical and dynamic factors combined place him in the moderate range for re-offending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">On cross-examination, the board showed Reed a letter addressed to Reed and a follow-up note, both written by a neuropsychiatrist, Dr. Chandlee Dickey, who had treated Poe. The board was evidently unaware of Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter and follow-up note until Poe\u2019s counsel provided them during discovery. Poe\u2019s counsel interjected during Reed\u2019s cross-examination that he had intended to introduce these two documents but forgot, and offered them in evidence as Poe\u2019s final exhibits. Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter, dated September 3, 1996, reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">\u201c[T]he patient has exposed himself to young boys for much of his life, beginning at age 10 or 12. At 16, the patient\u2019s father knows that he exposed [himself] three or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>four times. At age 20, he started running up a large credit card bill. In 1982, he exposed himself to several boys and was put on probation. In 1990, he was caught masturbating in a car while watching a young boy. In 1991, he was accused of abusing a young boy. In 1993, he exposed himself to another boy. ... In 1994, he ran up quite a telephone bill using a 900 number gay sex line. He sent picture[s] of himself to a boy and these were used in extortion against him. Also in 1994, he was found masturbating in a window. In 1995, he invited some kids to his garage, drove with a boy, and started doing things that were clearly inappropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Dr. Dickey\u2019s follow-up note, dated October 1, 1996, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201cI received a note from Dr. Carol Ball, who had given the patient penile plethysmography, which showed deviant arousal pattern to infant females, teenage females, prelatency, latency, and preteen and teen males. She also noted that he has frankly masturbated with teenage boys. She believed that he is at high risk for repeat behavior .... Dr. Ball noted that he had no remorse about his inappropriate past sexual behavior and had difficulty comprehending that such behavior could be damaging to the young boys. ... I agree with Dr. Ball\u2019s assessment. The patient continues to deny any kind of inappropriate thoughts to me, although I have no idea whether he is being honest. I can only assume that he is continuing to have sexual fantasies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">On appeal, Poe argues that his attorney provided ineffective assistance by providing Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter and follow-up note to the board in discovery and by introducing them in evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">3. <em>Hearing examiner\u2019s decision. </em>The hearing examiner\u2019s written decision summarized at length all the evidence presented at the hearing. However, while the hearing examiner acknowledged that Dr. Traniello opined that Poe had only a moderate risk to reoffend, she stated that, in accordance with the board\u2019s regulations, she did \u201cnot consider his opinion\u201d because Dr. Traniello did not testify as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In her summary, the hearing examiner concluded that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>impression I have from all the evidence presented is that [Poe] presents a high risk to re-offend and poses a high degree of dangerousness and thus, a reclassification of his original classification level is warranted.\u201d She observed that, \u201c[a]fter being convicted of and sanctioned by the courts for sexually inappropriate behavior, after repeatedly being spoken to by police for following young boys on numerous occasions, and after being in sex offender treatment with [Dr.] Traniello almost two years, [Poe] solicited a young boy over the Internet with his first sentence being how he loves really nice young teens.\u201d She also observed that the results of the penile plethysmograph conducted by Dr. Ball in 1996 \u201cindicated that he was attracted to both male and female children, the youngest being infants.\u201d She noted that he was \u201ccapable of driving a car around the city, and maneuvering his way around the Internet chat rooms and conducting numerous communications through that media.\u201d She found these circumstances sufficient to support a level three classification, because \u201conly Internet dissemination [of his status as a sex offender] could adequately protect young boys from a pedophile and Internet predator who solicits young boys from around the country,\u201d and because \u201cno other sanctions or treatment have prevented this type of behavior that has continued for many years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The hearing examiner\u2019s refusal to consider Dr. Traniello\u2019s opinion as to the risk of sexual recidivism. </em>Under the board\u2019s regulations, one of the factors to be used in determining a sex offender\u2019s risk of sexual reoffense and degree of dangerousness is \u201cwhether documentation has been obtained from a licensed mental health professional that specifically indicates that a particular sex offender posed or poses a risk to reoffend.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(15) (2004). If such documentation is introduced in evidence at a classification hearing, the hearing examiner \u201cmay give the contents of this docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>mentation its appropriate evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, where the documentation is provided by an \u201c[e]xpert [wjitness\u201d who does not testify at the hearing, the hearing examiner \u201cshall exclude from evidence so much of the documentation that expresses any opinion as to the offender\u2019s risk to reoffend.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>citing 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.18(6) (2004). Poe argues that this regulatory restriction unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to have the hearing examiner consider the opinion of his treating psychologist that he posed only a moderate risk of reoffense.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\u201cA properly promulgated regulation \u2018has the force of law . . . and must be accorded all the deference due to a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002), quoting <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 723, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). Because Poe has no fundamental right to offer in evidence an opinion that cannot be tested on cross-examination, the regulation is constitutionally valid if it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>424 Mass. 236, 239, cert, denied, 522 U.S. 832 (1997). We conclude that the regulation satisfies the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The board reasonably has determined that, while the rules of evidence do not apply to classification hearings, \u201c[e]vidence may be admitted and given probative effect only if it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u00a7 1.19(1) (2004). It is equally reasonable for the board to determine that an opinion regarding an offender\u2019s risk of reoffense rendered by a mental health professional expressly for use at a classification hearing is not sufficiently reliable to be considered unless the expert testifies at the hearing and is subject to cross-examination. Risk of reoffense is one of the ultimate issues that the hearing examiner must decide in classifying the offender. \u201cIt goes without saying that the validity and significance of a particular expert opinion are often subject to debate.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764, 773 (2008). Permitting consideration of such an expert opinion only where the expert testifies at the hearing serves the board\u2019s legitimate interest in the fairness of the process and the accuracy of the outcome of classification hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Poe is correct that, at the time of his hearing, the board would grant an indigent sex offender\u2019s motion for funds to retain an expert only if the board also intended to rely on expert evidence prepared specifically for the classification hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 770. Poe is also correct that the board rarely, if ever, relied on expert reports or testimony, and did not do so in his case, so that, in practice, he, along with other indigent sex offenders, was denied the opportunity to present the opinion of an expert witness. <em>Id. </em>Poe, however, is not correct that this meant that the consequence of applying 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(15) was to deny him, because of his indigence, the opportunity to offer in evidence Dr. Traniello\u2019s opinion that he was \u201cin the moderate range for re-offending.\u201d Dr. Traniello, as Poe\u2019s treating psychologist, was a fact witness as well as an expert witness, and therefore Poe had the power to subpoena him to testify. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.17 (2004). There is no indication in the record that he attempted to do so. Therefore, Poe\u2019s failure to subpoena Dr. Traniello to testify at the hearing, not 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(15), deprived Poe of the opportunity to present Dr. Traniello\u2019s favorable expert opinion regarding his risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>reoffense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, both his facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of this regulation fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>We have not previously addressed whether sex offenders required to register with the board have a right to the effective assistance of counsel at classification hearings and, if so, whether the standard announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) <em>{Saferian), </em>governs claims of ineffectiveness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We now conclude that sex offenders are entitled to the effective assistance of counsel at classification hearings and that the civil formulation of the <em>Saferian </em>standard governs claims of ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In 1999, the Legislature revised the Sex Offender and Community Notification Act to provide indigent sex offenders a statutory right to counsel in board classification hearings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2. We have twice before, in other contexts, confronted the question whether a statutory grant of counsel means a right to the effective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>404 Mass. 372, 374 (1989) (grand jury proceeding); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 149 (1987) (care and protection proceeding). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 115 (2006) (person facing civil commitment as sexually dangerous person has statutory and constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel). In each instance, we have determined that the statutory right to counsel implies the statutory right to <em>effective </em>counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, supra </em>at 374-375; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, supra. </em>\u201cThe right to counsel is of little value unless there is an expectation that counsel\u2019s assistance will be effective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reach the same result today with respect to a sex offender\u2019s statutory right to counsel at a classification hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Regardless of the context in which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has arisen, we have consistently applied the two-part test of <em>Saferian </em>to examine and appraise counsel\u2019s performance. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, supra </em>(\u201cWe have addressed the question of effective assistance of counsel in the context of criminal representation, and we turn to those decisions as a guide in the context of care and protection proceedings\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, supra </em>(using \u201cfamiliar standards\u201d of <em>Saferian </em>as \u201cguide\u201d to ineffectiveness claim in civil commitment proceeding). Under that test, we first consider \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Saferian, supra. </em>If we find such poor performance by counsel, we then ask \u201cwhether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">In <em>Care &amp; Protection of Georgette, </em>439 Mass. 28, 33 n.7 (2003), we recognized that the language \u201cotherwise available, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>substantial ground of defense\u201d is \u201ccriminal law terminology that does not precisely fit\u201d civil cases in which there is a statutory right to counsel. In civil cases, we instead \u201cprefer to use the term \u2018prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We have defined prejudice in ineffectiveness claims as \u201ca \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that \u2018but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 15 (2004), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984). In declaring the term \u201cprejudice\u201d better suited to noncriminal cases, our intent is not to change materially the second prong of the <em>Saferian </em>standard. To succeed on an ineffectiveness claim in any case where a right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized, the effect of counsel\u2019s serious incompetency must always be prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 729 (1978). See also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 692 (\u201cany deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance must be prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the Constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">With the slight and apt modification of terminology announced in <em>Care &amp; Protection of Georgette, supra, </em>the <em>Saferian </em>test is appropriate to apply to counsel\u2019s performance at a sex offender classification hearing. At stake in a classification hearing is the sex offender\u2019s \u201cconstitutionally protected liberty and privacy interest in avoiding registration and public dissemination of registration information.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 100 (1998). Classification and registration entail possible harm to a sex offender\u2019s earning capacity, damage to his reputation, and, \u201cmost important, . . . the statutory branding of him as a public danger.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 144 (1997). In light of the serious ramifications of erroneous classification, the principle of fundamental fairness that underlies the statutory entitlement to counsel would be ill-served if sex offenders were afforded something less than what we usually refer to as the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Applying the civil formulation of the <em>Saferian </em>test to ineffectiveness claims brought by sex offenders also allows reliance on the rich body of case law interpreting this standard. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>decisions holding certain acts and omissions by counsel to be either effective or ineffective will be instructive to attorneys, hearing examiners, and judges alike. In short, \u201cthe <em>Saferian </em>test brings the benefit of familiarity.\u201d <em>Loe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 686 (2009) (Sikora, J., concurring). We are not inclined to reinvent a wheel that has served us well for over thirty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We turn now to Poe\u2019s claim that his hearing counsel provided ineffective assistance in giving Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter and follow-up note to the board in discovery and subsequently introducing them in evidence at the hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree that it was manifestly unreasonable for counsel to introduce these documents in evidence, and equally unreasonable to provide them in discovery to the board, where the board\u2019s regulations required such disclosure only if he intended to offer the documents in evidence. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.18(2). The letter and follow-up note each contained information that was damaging to Poe\u2019s case and that otherwise would not have been part of the record before the hearing examiner. The letter disclosed allegations of sexual offenses that were not mentioned in the evidence submitted by the board or elsewhere by Poe. It declared that Poe first began exposing himself to young boys at age ten or twelve, and exposed himself three or four times at age sixteen.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Most significantly, the letter included an accusation that he abused a boy, which was the only evidence that Poe had ever engaged in inappropriate touching.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The follow-up note stated that Poe had exhibited deviant arousal to \u201cinfant females, teenage females, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>prelatency, latency, and preteen and teen males.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The evidence in the hearing record did not otherwise suggest that Poe was attracted to girls, and certainly not infant females.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The note also declared that Dr. Ball had determined that Poe \u201chad no remorse about his inappropriate past sexual behavior and had difficulty comprehending that such behavior could be damaging to the young boys.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, the note contained Dr. Ball\u2019s opinion, which she had expressed to Dr. Dickey, that Poe was \u201cat high risk for repeat behavior.\u201d See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Characterizing counsel\u2019s introduction of these documents as a \u201ctrial tactic\u201d does not make it \u201cimmune from scrutiny.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 729. We do not see any information in the letter and follow-up note that reasonably could have helped Poe, but there is much that could have hurt him. We can discern no rationale for the introduction of these documents that \u201clawyers of ordinary training and skill\u201d would consider \u201ccompetent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, quoting <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir. 1974). Competent counsel would have recognized that the admission of these documents would only strengthen the board\u2019s argument that Poe was highly likely to reoffend and posed a substantial danger to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">While Poe has satisfied the first prong of <em>Saferian, </em>we conclude that he has failed to show that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s incompetence, that is, that there was a reasonable probability that his classification would have been lower if he had competent counsel. Before his 2005 conviction of enticement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>a child, Poe had been classified by the board as a level one sex offender. At oral argument, Poe conceded that, in light of this conviction, the best his attorney could have accomplished was a level two classification.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The question, therefore, is whether there is a reasonable probability that the introduction in evidence of Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter and follow-up note caused him to be classified as a level three offender where he otherwise would have been a level two offender. While these documents no doubt supported a level three classification, we conclude that there was not a reasonable probability that Poe would have been classified a level two offender if these documents had not been provided in discovery and admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Even without Dr. Dickey\u2019s documents, the hearing record contained evidence of Poe\u2019s many criminal charges and convictions that indicated \u201crepetitive and compulsive behavior,\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (a) (ii), and \u201ca continuing course of sexual misconduct\u201d that demonstrated a high risk of reoffense. 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2) (2004). For two reasons, Poe\u2019s most recent conviction of enticing a child over the Internet in October, 2004, effectively doomed him to a level three classification. First, the online \u201cchat\u201d revealed that Poe still wished to have sex with young teenage boys and was willing to use the Internet to entice boys to visit him for that purpose.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Second, he claimed to have had oral sex with two boys, ages thirteen and fifteen, who used to live near him. Consequently, the hearing officer found that Poe\u2019s conviction of enticing a child under the age of sixteen, in and of itself, demonstrates an increased risk to children and other vulnerable persons. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(b) </em>(iii); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(12) (2004). Not only did this sexual misconduct suggest that the weekly individual sex offender therapy sessions he had attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>since March, 2003, had failed materially to diminish his risk of sexual recidivism, but it also supported the conclusion of the hearing officer that, because Poe was capable of driving around the city and \u201cmaneuvering his way around the Internet chat rooms,\u201d only a level three classification, which provides for Internet dissemination of his identity, could adequately protect young boys from his solicitation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">On this record, even without Dr. Dickey\u2019s letter and follow-up note, there was not a reasonable probability that Poe would have been classified anything less than a level three offender. We, therefore, reject Poe\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Dr. Anthony Traniello\u2019s various reports reflected that he had seen Poe weekly for individualized sex offender treatment since March 31, 2003.

Consequently, as Poe acknowledged at the Superior Court hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, the hearing examiner properly considered Dr. Ball\u2019s opinion that Poe was \u201cat high risk to reoffend,\u201d even though she did not testify at the hearing, because Dr. Ball\u2019s opinion was not prepared expressly for use at a classification hearing.
