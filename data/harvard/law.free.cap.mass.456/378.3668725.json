L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A; possession of a class D substance (marijuana) with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C; and committing a drug offense within a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. At trial, the Commonwealth submitted in evidence, without objection, three State laboratory certificates of drug analysis (drug certificates) of the substances possessed by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was tried after our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279 (2005) <em>(Verde), </em>and before the United States Supreme Court issued <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009) <em>(Melendez-Diaz), </em>abrogating our decision in the <em>Verde </em>case. In an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2009). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, limited to the application of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>to the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now reverse the judgments, set aside the verdicts, and remand the cases for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as they properly could have been found by the jury. At around 2:20 a.m. on May 13, 2004, Officers Edward Cruickshank and Jim Barude of the Brockton police department responded to a passing motorist\u2019s report of a fight at a nearby gasoline station, where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>saw the defendant arguing with another man. After seeing the approaching cruiser, the defendant walked toward a parked automobile and then sat in its driver\u2019s seat; another man was sitting in the passenger seat. The officers, together with Sergeant Paul Binnaca, who had just arrived at the scene, approached the vehicle. After the defendant refused to comply with orders to keep his hands visible, Officer Cruickshank opened the driver side door, \u201cgrabbed\u201d the defendant\u2019s arm, and began to remove the defendant from the vehicle. At that point, both Officer Cruickshank and Sergeant Binnaca saw the defendant reach into his waistband, remove a plastic bag, and throw it over his shoulder into the back seat. Officer Cruickshank then pulled the defendant out of the automobile. After the officers had handcuffed the defendant, Sergeant Binnaca retrieved the bag and told Officer Cruickshank that there were narcotics in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">At trial, evidence apart from the drug certificates pertaining to the chemical nature of the substances recovered from the automobile consisted in its entirety in the following testimony of Officer Cruickshank and Sergeant Binnaca. Officer Cruickshank, who had been a police officer for seven years, and through whom all three drug certificates were admitted in evidence, described the bag the defendant had thrown into the rear seat as containing \u201c[ejight pieces of crack cocaine\u201d and six smaller bags of \u201ca green leafy substance believed to be marijuana.\u201d He testified that he found a bag containing \u201c22.5 grams of marijuana\u201d in the vehicle\u2019s center console. He later referred to the substances as the \u201csuspected marijuana and the crack cocaine,\u201d and as a \u201cgreen leafy substance\u201d and \u201ca white, rock-like substance\u201d that, in apparent reference to the drug certificates, were \u201cfound to be\u201d marijuana and crack cocaine, respectively. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Sergeant Binnaca, who testified that he had worked as a police officer for twelve years and had previously made drug arrests in the area near the gasoline station, testified that the bag the defendant had thrown into the rear seat of the vehicle contained a \u201cgreen leafy substance\u201d that in his \u201cestimation\u201d and \u201cexperience appeared to be marijuana.\u201d He later described the bag as containing \u201ca green leafy substance, marijuana,\u201d and numerous \u201cpieces of an off-white, hard, rock-like substance . . . known to me as \u2014 as possibly crack cocaine.\u201d The defendant did not object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>officers\u2019 testimony regarding the substances. There was no other testimony concerning the chemical composition, appearance, odor, feel, or other qualities of the substances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth correctly recognizes that the submission in evidence of the three drug certificates without the trial testimony of the analysts who signed the drug certificates violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Melendez-Diaz, <em>supra. </em>Although the defendant did not object at trial to the admission of the drug certificates, for the reasons explained in <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 355-360, we must determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. For the reasons stated below, under our established law, which we recently discussed at length in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 700-704 (2010), and in <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 360-368, we are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug certificates \u201cdid not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdicts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As the Commonwealth has conceded, the drug certificates, introduced as part of the prosecution\u2019s prima facie case, provided, in the words of the assistant district attorney on appeal, the \u201cmost powerful evidence\u201d that the substances at issue were \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201cmarijuana,\u201d proof of which was necessary to establish that the defendant had committed the crimes of which he was charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>443 Mass. 740, 745 (2005) (Commonwealth must prove \u201ceach\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d element of crime beyond reasonable doubt); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGilvery, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 511 (2009) (proof \u201cthat a substance is a particular drug\u201d is element of drag prosecutions). The judge did not give the jury a standard instruction that drug certificates are prima facie evidence of the identity of the substances, but the drag certificates, which the jury could review, stated as much. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Proof that a substance is a particular drag \u201cmay be made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>circumstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987), and in some circumstances not present here such evidence may be \u201cso powerful\u201d as to \u201cnullify any effect\u201d that the drug certificates \u201cmight have had on the jury or the verdictfs].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 704 n.44, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagraca, </em>447 Mass. 546, 555 (2006). Here, however, the arresting police officers, neither of whom was qualified as an expert in or had specialized training or experience in narcotics identification, offered only conclusory, and largely equivocal, testimony regarding the composition of the substances. The officers certainly \u201cdid not articulate how their expertise permitted them to identify the substances\u201d as cocaine and marijuana. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 233 (2010). Moreover, the judge did not make a finding that either officer\u2019s experience permitted him to offer an opinion that the substances were particular narcotics. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, supra </em>(when police or drug-user witness testifies as to nature of substance, trial judge \u201cwill first have to make a finding\u201d that witness\u2019s experience with drug would \u201cpermit him to give an opinion as to what drug a particular substance was\u201d). See also <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 365. There was no evidence that the officers detected any identifiable odors or recognized any other distinguishing characteristics of the substances beyond their appearance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, supra </em>(\u201cit would be a rare case in which a witness\u2019s statement that a particular substance looked like a controlled substance would alone be sufficient to support a conviction\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Cruickshank testified that he did not see any drug transaction occur, nor did he recall finding any money, cellular telephones, or pagers on the defendant. There was no mention of drugs in the report of the fight at the gasoline station to which the officers responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">There was, of course, evidence probative of some wrongdoing on the part of the defendant or of consciousness of guilt. The defendant was engaged in an argument in the middle of the night in an area known for drug dealing. There was evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>substances seized from the automobile were packaged in a manner consistent with drug distribution, as Detective Keating testified. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, when confronted by police, in addition to attempting to discard a plastic bag containing some substances, the defendant was uncooperative when the officers ordered him to keep his hands visible and attempted to escape from the police cruiser after his arrest. See note 2, supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oeun Lam, </em>420 Mass. 615, 617 (1995), and cases cited (\u201cEvidence of escape or attempted escape is admissible to prove consciousness of guilt\u201d). Such evidence did not, however, relieve the Commonwealth from proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the substances were, in fact, particular illegal narcotics, i.e., cocaine and marijuana. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, supra\\ Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGilvery, supra. </em>Taken separately or together, the police officers\u2019 testimony is not \u201cso powerful\u201d as to \u201cnullify any effect\u201d that the drug certificates \u201cmight have had\u201d on the jury or the verdicts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant \u201ctacitly stipulated\u201d to the nature of the substances and that reversal is not required because the nature of the substances was not a \u201clive issue\u201d at trial. Defense counsel did refer to the substances as \u201cdrugs\u201d in his opening statement; in questioning witnesses and in his summation he referred to the substances as \u201cmarijuana\u201d and \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d He also encouraged the jury to return verdicts of guilty on the lesser included offenses of simple possession. The defendant did not, however, stipulate to the composition of the substances. See <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2542 (defense attorneys and their clients \u201cwill often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the ordinary drug case\u201d). Although the defendant did not contest that the substances were drugs, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s theory of his case cannot relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 269 (1986). Further, as we explained in <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 368, by giving the defendant the benefit of the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, as we have, \u201cthe defendant is effectively in the same position as if he <em>had </em>objected to the admission of the drug certificates. A defendant who objects to a Federal (or State) constitutional error that goes to the heart of the government\u2019s case has no further obligation, if he wishes to chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>lenge that error on appeal, to contest the issue.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This is not a case where the facts independent of the drug certificates overwhelmingly prove the nature of the substances recovered from the automobile. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>411 Mass. 95, 102 (1991), cert, denied, 502 U.S. 1094 (1992), quoting <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 325-326 (1985) (erroneous intent instruction harmless beyond reasonable doubt where \u201cprincipals\u2019 intent was not in dispute\u201d because facts \u201c \u2018overwhelmingly preclude[d]\u2019 the absence of an intent to till\u201d on part of principals).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the District Court for a new trial consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Each drug certificate was prepared as a notarized affidavit, signed by an assistant analyst at the State Laboratory Institute of the Department of Public Health.
