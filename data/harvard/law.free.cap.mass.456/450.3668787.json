L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>a judge in the Superior Court permanently stayed arbitration of a dispute between the Department of State Police (department) and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists (MOSES), acting on behalf of Robert E. Pino, a chemist employed by the department and a member of MOSES. MOSES appealed, and we granted its application for direct appellate review. It contends that a collective bargaining agreement between MOSES and the Commonwealth required the department to arbitrate MOSES\u2019s claims that the colonel of the State Police (colonel) terminated Pino without just cause and in retaliation for union activity. Agreeing that under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, the colonel had the exclusive and nondelegable authority to remove Pino, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Background. </em>The record reflects the following facts. Pino was employed as a chemist in the department\u2019s criminal laboratory since 1984. As of 2007, Pino was classified as a \u201cChemist III\u201d and was the system administrator for the department\u2019s \u201cCombined DNA Index System\u201d (CODIS). He was a member of MOSES and shop steward for the criminal laboratory during his entire employment with the department, and included within unit 9, a bargaining unit certified by the division of labor relations (division).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On March 30, 2007, the department conducted a predisciplinary hearing concerning Pino\u2019s work performance, presided over by an agency hearing officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing officer made findings of fact and a recommendation to the colonel. On April 13, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the colonel informed Pino by letter that he found \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Pino\u2019s employment with the department under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The letter stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cHaving received the findings and recommendations of [the hearing officer] and upon review of the same, together with an examination of all evidence submitted at the March 30, 2007 pre-disciplinary hearing, I find just cause to terminate your employment as a CODIS Administrator/ Chemist III for the Department ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cAdditionally, I find your continued employment with the Department ... to be contrary to the public interest and the mission of the Department of State Police. In accordance with [G. L. c.] 22C, \u00a7 9, I have determined that your removal is necessary for the operation of the Department and hereby remove and discharge you from your appointment pursuant to that statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">At the time Pino received this letter, a collective bargaining agreement between MOSES and the Commonwealth (agreement), executed in 2005, governed the terms of Pino\u2019s employ- \u25a0 ment with the department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agreement expressly superseded any prior collective bargaining agreements. It covered bargaining unit 9 employees in various Commonwealth agencies, including, but not limited to, the department. The agreement addresses union fees, antidiscrimination policy, schedules, leave, salaries, insurance contributions, promotions, layoffs, training, performance evaluations, arbitration of disciplinary action, and a grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Relevant here, art. 23A of the agreement details a four-step grievance procedure to resolve disputes that in its fourth step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>provides for arbitration of grievances that the parties have not resolved under the first three steps. Section 23A.4 limits the scope of arbitration, providing that \u201c[t]he arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any provision of this Agreement or to issue any decision or award inconsistent with applicable law.\u201d Additionally, art. 28, entitled \u201csaving clause,\u201d states that \u201c[i]n the event that any Article, Section or portion ... is found to be invalid . . . then such specific Article, Section or portion shall be unenforceable . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On April 19, 2007, MOSES filed a grievance on Pino\u2019s behalf, claiming that the department had terminated his employment without just cause in violation of \u00a7 23.1 of the agreement, which provides that no employee with six or more consecutive months of service \u201cshall be discharged, suspended, or demoted for disciplinary reasons or given a warning or reprimand without just cause.\u201d Further, MOSES alleged that the department terminated Pino\u2019s employment in retaliation for his union activity in violation of \u00a7 6.6 of the agreement, which reads: \u201cThere shall be no discrimination by the Employer or its Agent against any employee because of his/her activity or membership in MOSES.\u201d MOSES sought the following remedy: \u201cReinstate grievant. Cease and desist retaliatory, discriminatory conduct. Make grievant whole. All lesser included remedies are incorporated herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The department argued to the arbitrator that G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9 (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>confers on the colonel nondelegable managerial authority to remove civilian employees, including Pino, and the arbitration of the grievance was therefore outside the arbitrator\u2019s authority. MOSES disagreed. It contended that the grievance was arbitrable because, among other reasons, Pino retained collective bargaining rights when he and other department of public safety employees were reorganized into the department, pursuant to St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 136.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On July 14, 2008, the arbitrator issued a prehearing ruling in which he (1) declined to address whether St. 1991, c. 412, \u00a7 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>(see note 20, <em>infra), </em>conflicted with G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, stating that \u201c[r]econciling conflicting statutes ... is reserved exclusively to the judiciary\u201d; and (2) determined that \u201cwhether the [cjolonel\u2019s statutory rights under [G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9,] are non-delegable rights of management that may not be abrogated by a collective bargaining agreement is a legal question for the courts.\u201d Despite finding these two issues outside his jurisdiction, the arbitrator concluded that the question whether the colonel had just cause to terminate Pino\u2019s employment was arbitrable nonetheless, because the colonel\u2019s authority to take that action stemmed from \u00a7 23.1 of the agreement in addition to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, and \u00a7 23.1 required just cause for Pino\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On July 25, 2008, the department filed in the Superior Court an application for a permanent stay of arbitration pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). </em>MOSES opposed the application. On September 9, 2008, after a hearing, the judge granted the stay, concluding that because Pino was an \u201cexpert\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, the agreement could not supersede the colonel\u2019s nondelegable right of management granted by that statute, and \u201can arbitrator could not issue an award which would interfere with this explicit prerogative.\u201d The judge rejected MOSES\u2019s contentions that its grievance sought remedies besides reinstatement and that arbitration was necessary to address \u201cprocedural standards,\u201d finding that MOSES had not alleged that the department had violated any particular procedures. The judge observed that MOSES had pointed to \u00a7 6.6 of the agreement, the provision barring antiunion discrimination, but determined that MOSES had cited \u201cno evidence of discrimination or retaliation based on Pino\u2019s union membership or activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">MOSES moved for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s order pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). In February, 2009, the judge denied the motion. In his accompanying decision, the judge addressed MOSES\u2019s alternative remedies argument. He noted that MOSES had raised factual allegations of antiunion discrimination in the Pino affidavit supporting its motion for reconsideration, but he concluded that even in light of the new allegations, an arbitrator still could not award any lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>relief without interfering with the colonel\u2019s nondelegable managerial prerogative set out in G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 150C, \u00a7 2 (b), authorizes a judge in the Superior Court to \u201cstay an arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened\u201d if the judge finds that two conditions are met: (1) \u201cthe claim sought to be arbitrated does not state a controversy covered by the provision for arbitration\u201d; and (2) \u201cdisputes concerning the interpretation or application of the arbitration provision are not themselves made subject to arbitration.\u201d As to the statute\u2019s first condition, \u201cwe regard an agreement to arbitrate a dispute which lawfully cannot be the subject of arbitration as equivalent to the absence of a controversy covered by the provision for arbitration.\u201d <em>Dennis-Yarmouth Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dennis Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 116, 119 (1977). See <em>Berkshire Hills Regional Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Berkshire Hills Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>375 Mass. 522, 526-527 &amp; n.5 (1978). Thus, the first issue to consider is whether the colonel\u2019s termination of Pino \u2014 the basis of the dispute MOSES seeks to arbitrate \u2014 legally could be the subject of arbitration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">General Laws c. 22C, \u00a7 9 (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>authorizes the colonel to \u201cappoint, transfer and remove experts, clerks and other assistants as he may deem necessary for the operation of the department.\u201d The import of this language is plainly to confer on the colonel exclusive managerial authority over the appointment, transfer, and removal of any person employed in one of the specified positions, authority that cannot be delegated to an arbitrator under a collective bargaining agreement. See, e.g., <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 125-128 (1992) (arbitrator exceeded authority in ruling that police officer\u2019s discharge at end of probationary period was arbitrable issue requiring city to prove just cause, where G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 34, vested discretionary authority in city to dismiss probationary police officer if work was not \u201csatisfactory to [city]\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>MOSES briefly argues that G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, does not apply in this case because as a. Chemist III, Pino was an \u201cother employee[]\u201d governed by G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 10, rather than an \u201cexpert\u201d covered by \u00a7 9. The contention lacks merit. As the judge concluded, c. 22C, \u00a7 10, applies to the uniformed branch of State police officers, while \u00a7 9 applies to civilian employees of the department, such as Pino. Aside from one reference to \u201cother employees\u201d in the first paragraph of \u00a7 10, all five paragraphs of the section concern the appointment and conditions of employment of the uniformed officers of the State police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the record offers no indication that the Governor authorized Pino\u2019s appointment, as the first paragraph of \u00a7 10 would seem to require if Pino were an \u201cother\u201d employee within the scope of that section. The explicit use of the term \u201cexpert\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>in \u00a7 9 also indicates that \u00a7 9 is intended to cover employees with specialized training such as chemists.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In sum, because we conclude that G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, applies to Pino, and that it grants the colonel exclusive and nondelegable authority to appoint and remove civilian \u201cexperts\u201d in the department, it follows that Pino\u2019s removal from his position as a Chemist HI was not legally arbitrable. Section 23.1 of the agreement, the provision granting employees \u201cjust cause\u201d protections after six months, conflicts with the colonel\u2019s statutory prerogative.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">MOSES argues that even if G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9, confers exclusive managerial authority on the colonel that cannot be delegated, under the exception to the nondelegability doctrine this court recognized in <em>Blue Hills Regional Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Flight, </em>383 Mass. 642 (1981) <em>(Flight), </em>MOSES\u2019s claim of discrimination based on union activity remains arbitrable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In <em>Flight, </em>this court confirmed an arbitrator\u2019s award that determined a school committee had violated a collective bargaining agreement by failing to promote the grievant teacher because of her gender, and that directed the school committee to promote the teacher with back pay. <em>Id. </em>at 643-644. In response to the argument that an award compelling the school committee to promote the grievant would violate the nondelegability doctrine, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>eluded that the case called for \u201can exception\u201d to the doctrine, referencing a case \u201cwhere we suggested an exception if committee action was \u2018a pretense or device actuated by personal hostility,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and also citing a decision by the Court of Appeals of New York where an exception to the doctrine was recognized if tenure was refused \u201cfor constitutionally impermissible reasons or in violation of statutory proscriptions.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 644. We noted that the collective bargaining agreement at issue \u201cprovided explicitly that appointments would be made without regard to sex,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 643, and that \u201c[d]enial of promotion to a public employee because of her sex is constitutionally impermissible and violates statutory proscriptions . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 644. We then stated that a \u201c[djecision by an arbitrator in such a case is no more intrusive than [a] decision by an independent commission, and does not unreasonably trespass on the managerial authority of the employing agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">MOSES is correct that similar to the treatment of gender discrimination in the agreement discussed in <em>Flight, </em>\u00a7 6.6 of MOSES\u2019s agreement with the Commonwealth expressly prohibits discrimination because of union activity or membership. Also similar to <em>Flight, </em>there is a statutory (but not constitutional) proscription against this type of discrimination. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>11. Nevertheless, cases decided since <em>Flight </em>suggest that the exception we made to the nondelegability doctrine in that case is a very narrow one, and does not apply where the claim is one of discrimination on account of union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, </em>416 Mass. 252 (1993) <em>(Massachusetts Coalition of </em>Police), the union claimed that the town\u2019s decision not to reappoint its member as a police officer was \u201cthe product of discrimination on account of [the officer\u2019s] union activities,\u201d in violation of a collective bargaining agreement\u2019s provision expressly barring such discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 257. After holding that the town\u2019s statutory authority to appoint police officers was nondelegable and that the matter was, therefore, not arbitrable, the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>dictum rejected the union\u2019s discrimination claim, stating that, even if the claim were not waived, \u201cwe are satisfied that [the discrimination claim] must fail . . . because it appears that no lawful relief could be granted without conflicting with the town\u2019s nondelegable managerial prerogative.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, in <em>Sheriff of Middlesex County </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Correctional Officers, Local R1-193, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 830 (2005), the Appeals Court rejected a union\u2019s contention that <em>Flight </em>excepted from the nondelegability doctrine \u2014 and therefore preserved for arbitration \u2014 the union\u2019s claim that its member was not reappointed in violation of the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s provision barring discrimination based on union activity. <em>Id. </em>at 833-834. Citing <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, supra, </em>the court determined that the <em>Flight </em>exception was not triggered where the discrimination claim was based on union membership and not membership in a constitutionally protected category such as gender or race. <em>Id. </em>at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We follow the lead of these cases. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Flight\u2019s </em>restricted exception to the nondelegability doctrine does not cover MOSES\u2019s discrimination claim based on Pino\u2019s union membership and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">MOSES also relies on our decision in <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>386 Mass. 414, 423 n.10 (1982) <em>(Southern Worcester), </em>as supporting the position that an arbitrator has authority to order reinstatement if the arbitrator determines the employee was discharged for union activity. The <em>Southern Worcester </em>case, however, concerned the statutory authority of the Labor Relations Commission (now division of labor relations, see note 2, <em>supra) </em>to remedy prohibited labor practices under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>&amp; 11<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the case was not concerned with the power of an arbitrator acting pursuant to a public employee collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There does not appear to be any reason that MOSES could not have sought relief under these statutes from the division for any discrimination that, in MOSES\u2019s view, motivated the colonel\u2019s termination decision in this case. See <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, </em>416 Mass. at 257 &amp; n.l (holding decision not to reappoint officer inarbitrable because \u201cno lawful relief could be granted [under arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement] without conflicting with the town\u2019s nondelegable managerial prerogative,\u201d but noting that \u201ca union charge of prohibited practice focused on discrimination and retaliation ... in connection with union activity was pending before the Labor Relations Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">MOSES also asserts that an arbitrator may remedy procedural violations without intruding on a public employer\u2019s exclusive management authority, and could have done so in this case. Accordingly, it contends, the stay of arbitration was in error. A public employer with nondelegable managerial authority \u201cmay be required to arbitrate with respect to ancillary matters, such as procedures that the employer has agreed to follow prior to making the decision\u201d at issue. <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Mun. Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>451 Mass. 493, 499 (2008), quoting <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 179 (1997). However, as the judge pointed out, MOSES has not alleged what, if any, specific procedures the department failed to follow. See <em>Sheriff of Middlesex County </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Correctional Officers, Local R1-193, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 835 (\u201cClaiming a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>of a general nondiscrimination provision is insufficient to find a procedural basis to reverse the stay of arbitration\u201d). Moreover, the nature of the dispute in this case precludes any remedy other than reinstatement. See <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, </em>416 Mass. at 256 (finding no arbitrable dispute where \u201carbitrator lawfully could neither order [officer\u2019s] reappointment nor provide a form of relief that might reasonably promote or advance the union\u2019s goal that [he] be reappointed\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>School Comm, of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Natick, </em>423 Mass. 34, 40 (1996). Cf. <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Mun. Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>451 Mass. at 499, quoting <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 184 (\u201cmayor\u2019s specific authority granted by G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, leaves \u2018nothing to bargain about\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We also reject MOSES\u2019s claim that Pino retains contractual rights from before the 1991 consolidation of law enforcement agencies,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> including a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard in a then-applicable collective bargaining agreement. Section 25.4 of the current agreement states: \u201cAny prior agreement covering employees in Bargaining Unit 9 <em>shall be terminated upon the effective date of this Agreement and shall be superseded by this Agreement\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(emphasis added). This language leaves no question that the current agreement\u2019s terms, and only its terms, apply.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Finally, we decline MOSES\u2019s request to allow arbitration for cathartic value, as doing so would undermine the colonel\u2019s managerial discretion under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The Superior Court judge properly allowed the department\u2019s application permanently to stay arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The Labor Relations Commission was renamed the division of labor relations.

In response to the district\u2019s argument that only a district or a school committee can grant tenure, and that allowing the Labor Relations Commission to do so violated the nondelegability doctrine, we said, \u201c[I]n this case, the school [district] has not attempted to delegate its authority over tenure to the commission. <em>Rather, the Legislature has limited the power of a school [district or] committee to deny tenure. </em>We therefore conclude that the nondelegability doctrine . . . does not apply to this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, </em>416 Mass. at 256, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201c[TJhis case is different from cases such as <em>School Comm, of W.

In those cases, the court held that, although decisions concerning whether to grant tenure to teachers are nondelegable, and therefore nonarbitrable, issues concerning the procedure to be followed in making such tenure decisions are arbitrable. In those cases, the procedure in issue was reasonably related to the hiring decision. Here, however, an order requiring a hearing to determine whether there was just cause for discharge would have little or no bearing on whether, from the town\u2019s point of view, reappointment was indicated.
