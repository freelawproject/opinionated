Having been notified by the shelter\u2019s director that the juvenile allegedly possessed a gun, the police officers determined that the director had the authority to consent to their entry and conducted a warrantless search of the juvenile\u2019s room with her consent. After the police found the gun, the juvenile made an unprompted inculpatory statement that suggested that the gun belonged to him. The juvenile was charged with delinquency by reason of the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After an evidentiary hearing, the judge ordered suppression of the gun and the statement to the police. A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the judge\u2019s order in the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The Appeals Court reversed the allowance of the juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>nile\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter P., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 85 (2008). We granted his application for further appellate review. We affirm the allowance of the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>Background. </em>In reviewing the allowance of a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>420 Mass. 542, 544 (1995), and cases cited. We summarize the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by uncontroverted facts in the record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000). We then determine \u201cthe correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The juvenile and his mother moved into a room at the Roxbury Multi-Service Center, Inc., Family House Shelter (shelter) in March, 2006. The shelter provides temporary housing for otherwise homeless families and assists them in securing more permanent living situations. Through a contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth, the shelter is obligated to accept families referred by the Department of Transitional Assistance if there are vacant rooms of appropriate size to house them. Families may remain at the shelter until they find a permanent living situation, unless they commit a violation of the shelter\u2019s mies and regulations. The typical stay is between four and eight months. Apart from a key deposit fee of thirty dollars, the families do not pay to five at the shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Each new resident of the shelter, including the juvenile and his mother, as part of the intake procedure, is given a manual setting forth the shelter\u2019s mies and regulations. According to the manual, residents are allowed to have visitors only during posted visiting hours, and may meet with them only in the visitors\u2019 lounge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Residents are not permitted to enter another resident\u2019s room at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>any time for any purpose. Because residents must commit to being actively engaged at least twenty hours per week in employment, education, or job training, or looking for employment or housing, the residents are required to be out of the shelter from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. every weekday. The residents are also required to abide by a curfew, which varies by the day of the week. Each resident and his or her family is provided a furnished room and given a key to his or her room.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The director, however, has a master key that opens every door in the shelter, and the staff members have a master key that opens every resident\u2019s room. Members of the shelter\u2019s staff have the right to enter any room \u201cfor professional business purposes (maintenance, room inspections, etc.),\u201d but only with the knowledge of the director. If a \u201cbusiness professional,\u201d such as a repair person or exterminator, requires entry to a resident\u2019s room, he or she must be escorted by a staff member, with the director\u2019s approval. The shelter staff may conduct \u201croom checks\u201d at any time without warning to monitor compliance with the shelter\u2019s \u201cGood Housekeeping Standard\u201d and other rules and regulations, including those affecting health and safety. The manual has a \u201czero tolerance policy in regards to violent acts committed by residents\u201d and the possession of any weapon; \u201c[ajny resident in possession of a weapon will be terminated immediately.\u201d The shelter \u201creserves the right to contact the Police should the situation warrant,\u201d but the manual does not state that the shelter director or a staff member may consent to a police search of a resident\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On October 25,2006, the shelter\u2019s director, Cynthia M. Brown, after having heard rumors that the juvenile had a gun, learned from a security officer that the juvenile had admitted to having a gun. Brown contacted the Boston police department and arranged a meeting for the following morning \u201cto figure out how [to] proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On October 26, 2006, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Detective Frank McLaughlin and four other police officers met with Brown at the shelter. The officers indicated their desire to \u201ctake care of [the situation] quietly\u201d out of \u201cconcern for all these families who were . . . in a time of turmoil in their own lives.\u201d Brown told the officers that the resident\u2019s manual authorized her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>enter residents\u2019 rooms to conduct room checks and that she had inspected residents\u2019 rooms several days earlier after reports of suspected drug use. The officers reviewed the portions of the manual authorizing staff to make controlled room entries. Detective McLaughlin confirmed with Brown that her authority to search residents\u2019 rooms included the ability to search closets, drawers, bureaus, and other places not in plain view. The detective testified at the evidentiary hearing that he \u201c[absolutely\u201d believed that Brown had the authority to consent to a police search of the juvenile\u2019s room. He based this belief on the shelter\u2019s rules and regulations in the resident\u2019s manual, as well as Brown\u2019s possession of a master key to the residents\u2019 rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Brown and the officers agreed that they would conduct a search of the juvenile\u2019s room \u201cunder her policies.\u201d They planned to ask the juvenile to relinquish possession of the gun and then, if he cooperated, summons him to court at a later date. They then proceeded upstairs to the room, where Brown knocked on the door and announced bat she was conducting a room check. When no one answered, she used her master key to open the door. The juvenile was in be room, and it appeared bat he had been lying in bed moments before. Brown explained that she was there to conduct a room check and had be police with her because of allegations that the juvenile had a gun in his possession. Detective McLaughlin asked the juvenile to step out of the room into the hallway, and be juvenile complied. Two or three officers began to search the room while be detective and Brown attempted to speak wib be juvenile, who denied having a gun. When Brown asked why he was not in school, he stated bat he was home sick that day. During their search of the room, the officers found a Clock .40 caliber firearm containing hollow point bullets in be clip undemeab a duffel bag in be closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The juvenile was then handcuffed and placed under arrest. Spontaneously, and not in response to any direct questioning by the police, be juvenile said, \u201cThe gun has no bodies on it; it\u2019s clean.\u201d After the juvenile made this statement, an officer read the juvenile the Miranda warnings, but the officers did not initiate questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The juvenile argues that be warrantless search of his room at the shelter and be seizure of his firearm violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; art. 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1. He also argues that his statement to the police regarding the firearm should be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d of the illegal search and seizure under <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">1. To determine whether the search of the room violated the Fourth Amendment; art. 14; or G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, we must first determine whether a search in the constitutional sense took place. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>410 Mass. 235, 244 n.3 (1991). \u201cThis determination turns on whether the police conduct has intruded on a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301 (1991), citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211 (1986). \u201cThe measure of the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy is (1) whether the defendant has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the search, and (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra. </em>\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of establishing both elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn examining the expectation of privacy question under art. 14, we do not necessarily reach the same result as under Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">If no one has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched, the police are free to search that place without a warrant and without probable cause, as often as they wish. See, e.g., <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39-41 (1988) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage left outside curtilage of home); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 660-661 (1990) (same). If a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the police may search the place, in the absence of exigency, only with a warrant supported by probable cause or with consent. See <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voisine, </em>414 Mass. 772, 783 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Generally, in determining whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched, we look to various factors, none of which needs be determinative, including the nature of the place searched, whether the defendant owned the place, whether he controlled access to it, whether it was freely accessible to others, and whether the defendant took \u201cnormal precautions to protect his privacy\u201d in that place. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 545, cert, denied, 498 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>832 (1990), and cases cited. These factors may provide guidance when the place searched is not the defendant\u2019s home. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>447 Mass. 494, 497 (2006) (search of files at law firm); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 653-654 (1995) (search of lieutenants\u2019 room at fire station); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra </em>at 301-302 (search of hallway\u2019s dropped ceiling); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, supra </em>at 544-546 (search of wallet left in halfway house where defendant no longer resided).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">However, where, as here, the place searched <em>is </em>the interior of the juvenile\u2019s home, we need not consult any such factors in deciding that the juvenile has a reasonable expectation of privacy, because the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 expressly provide that every person has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures in his home. See Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . .\u201d); art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions\u201d). \u201c[I]n the case of the search of the interior of homes \u2022\u2014 the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy \u2014 there is a ready criterion, with roots deep in the common law, of the minimal expectation of privacy that <em>exists, </em>and that is acknowledged to be reasonable\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Kyllo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 34 (2001). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court for the E. Dist. of Mich., </em>407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972) (\u201cphysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed\u201d). In view of the \u201csanctity of the home,\u201d <em>\u201call </em>details [in the home] are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Kyllo </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The room that the juvenile and his mother shared at the shelter was a transitional living space, but it was nonetheless their home. The juvenile slept and kept his belongings in the room. He and his mother possessed a key to the room, allowing them the degree of privacy inherent in a locked door. The facts that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>own the room, that he was limited in his use of the room, and that shelter staff members had a master key and could enter the room \u201cfor professional business purposes\u201d do not diminish the legitimacy of his privacy interest in the room. The same can be said of a patron of a hotel or a tenant in a boarding house, both of whom enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in their rooms. See <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California, </em>376 U.S. 483 (1964) (hotel patron); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 451 (1948) (boarding house tenant). Indeed, in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 98-100 (1990), the United States Supreme Court made clear that a guest who stays but one night in a friend\u2019s home \u2014 with or without a key, and with or without paying rent \u2014 \u201chas a legitimate expectation of privacy in his host\u2019s home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. \u201cThat the guest has a host who has ultimate control of the house is not inconsistent with the guest having a legitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the home. <em>Id. </em>at 99. In short, regardless of whether the juvenile resided in a palatial mansion or a single room in a transitional shelter, regardless of whether he owned the residence or was allowed to remain without paying rent, and regardless of whether his landlord or shelter director had a master key and could enter to ensure that he was abiding by the rules of the house, the juvenile had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>2. Because the juvenile had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his room and because the police entered his room without a search warrant and without any claim of exigency, the burden shifts to the Commonwealth to prove that the entry was reasonable because it had the consent of a person with actual or apparent authority over the room. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. <em>177, </em>181 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>434 Mass. 307, 310 (2001). Here, the juvenile did not consent to the entry, but Brown did, and her consent was \u201cunfettered by coercion, express or implied, and also something more than mere \u2018acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Voisine, supra </em>at 783, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 555, cert, denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976). The question, then, is whether Brown, as shelter director, had actual or apparent authority to consent to the search of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">A third party has actual authority to consent to a warrantless search of a home by the police when the third party shares common authority over the home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 106 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171 (1974). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>422 Mass. 64, 70 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>399 Mass. 785, 787-788 (1987). \u201cThe authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property . . . but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 110, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, supra </em>at 171 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The reasonableness of a consent search \u201cis in significant part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a function of commonly held understanding about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each other\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 111. The Supreme Court has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cIt is . . . easy to imagine different facts on which, if known, no common authority could sensibly be suspected. A person on the scene who identifies himself, say, as a landlord or a hotel manager calls up no customary understanding of authority to admit guests without the consent of the current occupant. ... A tenant in the ordinary course does not take rented premises subject to any formal or informal agreement that the landlord may let visitors into the dwelling, . . . and a hotel guest customarily has no reason to expect the manager to allow anyone but his own employees into his room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 112, citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U.S. 610, 617 (1961) (landlord could not give valid consent to police to enter space rented to tenant), and <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 489 (hotel clerk was without authority to consent to search of guest\u2019s room).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Consequently, common authority does not mean simply the right to enter the premises that the police wish to search. Landlords often contractually retain that right, and hotels routinely do, but that does not allow the landlord or hotel manager to consent to a police search of a defendant\u2019s apartment or hotel room. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 616-617 (express covenant may give landlord right of entry to \u201cview waste\u201d but not to permit police to search for contraband); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>342 U.S. 48, 51-52 (1951) (hotel patron gives \u201cimplied or express permission [to enter] to such persons as maids, janitors or repairmen in the performance of their duties\u201d but not to police); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>370 Mass. 416, 419 (1976) (locker attendant at Logan Airport may have had authority to conduct private search of defendant\u2019s locker, but had no power to authorize police search). We have held that, when a college student executes a residence hall contract that permits college officials to enter the student\u2019s dormitory room \u201cto inspect for hazards to health or personal safety,\u201d the college officials\u2019 authority to enter the room to conduct a health and safety inspection does not entitle those officials to consent to a police search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>for evidence of a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>423 Mass. 75, 76, 79-80 (1996). Here, the shelter\u2019s manual allowed shelter staff to enter the room for \u201cprofessional business purposes,\u201d such as to make repairs, exterminate insects and rodents, and monitor compliance with the shelter\u2019s \u201cGood Housekeeping Standard,\u201d and to escort \u201cbusiness professionals\u201d into the room to accomplish these purposes, but it did not permit shelter staff to allow the police to enter to search for and seize contraband or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Therefore, the entitlement of a shelter staff member under the terms of a contract or resident manual to enter a resident\u2019s room to search for health or safety risks or violations of house rules, to remove any contraband found during that private search, including firearms and narcotics, and to invite the police to seize that contraband does not entitle that shelter staff member to grant consent to the police to enter the room with her to conduct the search. See <em>id. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>386 Mass. 329, 333 (1982) (\u201cEvidence discovered and seized by private parties is admissible without regard to the methods used, unless State officials have instigated or participated in the search\u201d). The shelter staff member may grant the police such consent only if the resident of the room has agreed in writing that the third party may allow the police to enter to search for contraband or evidence of a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neilson, supra </em>at 79-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We understand that the police need clear guidance as to who has common authority over a residence and therefore who is entitled to give actual consent, because, as here, they rely on such consent in deciding to conduct a warrantless search, as opposed to securing the residence and applying for a search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we declare under art. 14 that a person may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>actual authority to consent to a warrantless search of a home by the police only if (1) the person is a coinhabitant with a shared right of access to the home, that is, the person lives in the home, either as a member of the family, a roommate, or a houseguest whose stay is of substantial duration and who is given full access to the home; or (2) the person, generally a landlord, shows the pohce a written contract entitling that person to allow the police to enter the home to search for and seize contraband or evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No such entitlement may reasonably be presumed by custom or oral agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Coinhabitancy need not be defined by any legal relationship, such as that of spouses or cotenants on a lease. See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 110-111 (2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 175-177 (1974) (unmarried person living together in same bedroom with juvenile may consent to search of bedroom). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>358 Mass. 282, 288 (1970). Rather, it should be defined by the person\u2019s demonstrated intent to make a residence his or her home for some substantial period of time. See generally <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, supra </em>at 110-112; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, supra </em>at 171 &amp; n.7. Therefore, an overnight houseguest would lack the authority to consent, unless his or her stay is substantial in its duration, and he or she is given \u201cthe run of the house.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turbyfill, </em>525 F.2d 57, 58-59 (8th Cir. 1975) (houseguest who had been staying for several weeks and was \u201coccupant of indefinite duration\u201d who \u201chad the run of the house\u201d could consent to police search). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clutter, </em>914 F.2d 775, 777 (6th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 499 U.S. 947 (1991) (\u201cAs a general consideration, there is every reason to suppose that mature family members possess the authority to admit police to look about the family residence, since in common experience family members have the run of the house\u201d); 4 W.R.

She was not a coinhabitant of the room, and the shelter manual did not permit her to allow the police to enter the room to search for contraband or evidence. Rather, the manual reserved the right of shelter staff to enter any residential room \u201cfor professional business purposes (maintenance, room inspections, etc.),\u201d and to accompany \u201cbusiness professionals\u201d allowed to enter for those purposes.

Having concluded that Brown did not have actual authority to consent to the search of the room by the police, we turn to whether she had the apparent authority to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 179, 186 (1990) <em>(Rodriguez), </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d is not violated when a warrantless entry of a home is based on the consent of a third party who the police, at the time of entry, reasonably, but mistakenly, believed had common authority over the premises. The Court reasoned, \u201c[T]o satisfy the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government \u2014 whether the magistrate issuing a warrant, the police officer executing a warrant, or the police officer conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement \u2014 is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-186. The Court concluded that \u201c[t]he Constitution is no more violated when officers enter without a warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe that the person who has consented to their entry is a resident of the premises, than it is violated when they enter without a warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe they are in pursuit of a violent felon who is about to escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. Apparent authority is \u201cjudged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment . . . \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the consenting party had authority over the premises?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, quoting <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Federal courts have universally limited apparent authority to reasonable mistakes of fact, not mistakes of law. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>428 F.3d 877, 882 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>332 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gutierrez-Hermosillo, </em>142 F.3d 1225, 1230 (10th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>cert, denied, 525 U.S. 900 (1998); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1148 (11th Cir.), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 822 (1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>961 F.2d 1039, 1041 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d 861, 865 (10th Cir. 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d 1071, 1073-1074 (D.C.

The <em>Rodriguez </em>decision \u201cthus applies to situations in which an officer would have had valid consent to search if the facts were as he reasonably believed them to be.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitfield, supra </em>at 1074. \u201cAn officer\u2019s mistaken belief as to the law, even if reasonable, cannot establish apparent authority.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 1170.

Detective McLaughlin and the other officers took considerable care to ascertain whether Brown had the authority to consent to a search of the room. Prior to entering the room, Detective McLaughlin conferred with Brown and reviewed the portions of the manual pertaining to staff searches of the rooms. They accurately understood the relevant facts regarding Brown\u2019s authority to consent to the search. They erred not in their understanding of the facts or in the diligence of their inquiry into Brown\u2019s authority to consent to the search, but in their understanding of the law; they believed that these facts gave them valid consent to search the room when, as a matter of law, they did not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Brown did not have actual or apparent authority to consent to the search, the warrantless search of the room was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment or art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">4. Having concluded that the officers\u2019 search of the room was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, we need not decide under art. 14 whether a warrantless search of a home may be justified by apparent authority. We choose to decide this issue because (1) the issue, at our request, has been fully briefed, (2) our earlier decisions have suggested, but not decided, that art. 14 adopts the doctrine of apparent authority, see infra, and (3) our trial courts are already obliged to apply this doctrine, because the Appeals Court has recently approved of a consent search based solely on apparent authority. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dejarnette, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 95-96 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Even before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>we suggested that apparent authority may justify a warrantless search where the person giving consent lacks actual authority, but we have never approved a warrantless search exclusively on apparent authority. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>399 Mass. 785, 787-788 (1987) (holding that live-in boy friend of defendant\u2019s sister could consent to police search because he \u201cappeared to be a lawful occupant with authority to permit the police to enter,\u201d while simultaneously recognizing actual authority of sister, who was also present, to consent); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wahlstmm, </em>375 Mass. 115, 118 (1978) (holding that employee of store had \u201csufficient appearance of authority\u201d to consent to police search but deciding case on basis of common, or actual, authority). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>444 Mass. 234, 248-249 (2005) (Greaney, J., dissenting) (officer\u2019s entry justified by apparent authority, in addition to actual authority); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 815, 831 n.4 (Lenk, J., dissenting), further appellate review granted, 455 Mass. 1103 (2009) (\u201cTo date, no warrantless police entry has been upheld in Massachusetts solely on the basis of apparent authority to consent. . .\u201d). Consistent with these past decisions but for the first time today, we explicitly adopt under art. 14 the doctrine of apparent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cThe right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one\u2019s privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>453 Mass. 818, 819 (2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 619 (2003). In general, art. 14 allows the police to enter a home in four circumstances: (1) a judicial warrant supported by probable cause, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>406 Mass. 343, 346 (1989); (2) probable cause plus exigency, such as hot pursuit of a violent suspect trying to escape, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paniaqua, </em>413 Mass. 796, 798 (1992); (3) under the \u201cemergency aid\u201d doctrine, where the police have \u201can objectively reasonable basis to believe that there may be someone inside who is injured or in imminent danger of physical harm,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>at 819; and (4) the voluntary consent of a person with common authority over the home, <em>supra </em>at 264-265.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In each of the first three circumstances, art. 14 is not violated by reasonable mistakes of fact. We evaluate the reasonableness of a police officer\u2019s conduct based on the information available to him at the time, not on what we later learn to be true. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 456 (1981) (\u201cwhether the response of the police was reasonable and therefore lawful [is] to be evaluated in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time, not as it may seem to a scholar after the event with the benefit of leisured retrospective analysis\u201d). If probable cause in a search warrant affidavit is based on information from a reliable source with personal knowledge, we do not conclude that there has been a violation of art. 14 if the information turns out to be inaccurate, provided the affiant did not know the information to be false or show reckless disregard for its truthfulness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkerson, </em>436 Mass. 137, 140-142 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 321 (1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980) (\u201cexistence of probable cause is determined \u2018at the moment of arrest,\u2019 not in light of subsequent events\u201d). If a police officer has probable cause to believe that a suspect has just committed a violent crime and reason to believe that he fled into an apartment, and if there is not time to obtain a warrant because of exigent circumstances, we do not conclude that there has been a violation of art. 14 if, when the police enter the apartment, the suspect is no longer there. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiSanto, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 694, 701 &amp; n.7, 702-703 (1979), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 855 (1980). If the police enter a home based on an objectively reasonable basis to believe that someone inside is injured or is in imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>danger of physical harm, we do not conclude that there has been a violation of art. 14 if it turns out that no one is home. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>at 824. By this same reasoning, we do not believe that art. 14 is violated if a warrantless search of a home occurs after a police officer obtains the voluntary consent of a person he reasonably believes, after diligent inquiry, has common authority over the home, but it turns out that the person lacked common authority. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 186 (1990). Apparent authority in the context of consent to search is a police officer\u2019s finding of actual authority based on a reasonable mistake of fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">While we conclude that a search of a home does not violate art. 14 if the police officer has the voluntary consent of an individual with the apparent authority to give such consent, we do so only if the reasonable mistake of fact occurs despite diligent inquiry by the police as to the consenting individual\u2019s common authority over the home.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To conduct a diligent inquiry, a police officer must take two basic steps. First, the police officer must base his conclusion of actual authority on facts, not assumptions or impressions. He must continue his inquiry until he has reliable information on which to base a finding of actual authority to consent. \u201c[I]n the absence of sufficient facts, officers have a duty to seek further information in order to determine whether they may reasonably infer that the inviter has the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>sary authority to consent to an entry or search of the premises.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>962 F.2d 733, 738 (7th Cir. 1992). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cos, </em>498 F.3d 1115, 1129-1130 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cgovernment must offer some additional evidence [beyond mere presence of third party on the premises] to support a claim of apparent authority\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>437 F.3d 644, 649 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 832 (2006) (police obligated to take \u201csufficient precautions to assure themselves of the truth\u201d of assertion of actual authority by person consenting to search); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>426 F.3d 838, 846 (6th Cir. 2005), quoting United States vs. McCoy, U.S. Ct. App., Nos. 97-6485, 97-6486, &amp; 97-6488 (6th Cir. May 12, 1999) (\u201cgovernment cannot establish that its agents reasonably relied upon a third party\u2019s apparent authority \u2018if agents, faced with an ambiguous situation, nevertheless proceed without making further inquiry. If the agents do not learn enough, if the circumstances make it unclear whether the property about to be searched is subject to \u201cmutual use\u201d by the person giving consent, \u201cthen warrantless entry is unlawful without further inquiry\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Second, even when the consenting individual explicitly asserts that he lives there, if \u201cthe surrounding circumstances could conceivably be such that a reasonable person would doubt its truth,\u201d the police officer must make further inquiry to resolve the ambiguity. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 188. The police officer owes a duty to explore, rather than ignore, contrary facts tending to suggest that the person consenting to the search lacks actual authority. Police must not only thoroughly question the individual consenting to the search with respect to his or her actual authority, but also pay close attention to whether the surrounding circumstances indicate that the consenting individual is truthful and accurate in asserting common authority over the premises.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cos, supra </em>at 1130 (ambiguous circumstances require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>officers to make additional inquiry); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, supra </em>at <em>646, </em>649 (defendant\u2019s girl friend taking cooking pans and bag of female clothing from apartment \u201cprovided adequate support for [her] representations\u201d that she lived there \u201con-and-off\u201d and could consent to search).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The juvenile argues that apparent authority is akin to the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897 (1984), and that we should refuse to adopt apparent authority under art. 14 for the same reasons we refused to adopt the good faith exception. It is true that we \u201cnever adopted the \u2018good faith\u2019 exception, and we do not adopt it now.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valerio, </em>449 Mass. 562, 569 (2007). The \u201cgood faith\u201d exception, however, is an exception to the exclusionary rule, and therefore applies only where there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. See <em>Herring </em>v. <em>United States, </em>129 S. Ct. 695, 699 (2009) (accepting \u201cparties\u2019 assumption that there was a Fourth Amendment violation\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, supra </em>at 925-926 (invalidity of search warrant not challenged). When the police conduct a warrantless search of a home based on consent and make a reasonable mistake of fact as to the consenting party\u2019s actual authority to consent, the search is not in violation of the Fourth Amendment or art. 14, and therefore the question whether the exclusionary mie should apply to the evidence seized during the search is never reached. It is perhaps for this reason that, although <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>was decided six years after <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>supra, </em>the <em>Leon </em>decision was not cited in the <em>Rodriguez </em>decision. Because apparent authority is not based on the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule, there is no logical conflict in our adopting apparent authority but not the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>5. Having concluded that the warrantless search was justified by neither Brown\u2019s actual authority to consent to the search nor her apparent authority to do so, the firearm seized by the police during the search must be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d See <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963). The juvenile\u2019s statement to the police must also be suppressed. While the judge found that the statement was \u201cmade spontaneously and not in response to any direct questioning by the police,\u201d the statement was made outside the room immediately after the juvenile was arrested and handcuffed following the seizure of the firearm in the room. As a result, the statement was the \u201cfruit\u201d of the unlawful search, and was not so distant in time or location from the unlawful search as to dissipate the taint arising from the search. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 460 (1985) (temporal proximity of arrest to the obtaining of evidence one factor \u201c[i]n determining whether the connection between the evidence and the improper conduct has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 554 (1974) (\u201cSince there was manifest a causal relationship between the finding of the [incriminating evidence] and the statements of the defendant, the statements should have been suppressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judge\u2019s decision allowing the motion to suppress is affirmed.

Because the juvenile is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h), </em>he has automatic standing to contest the reasonableness of the search of his room under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amendola, </em>406 Mass. 592, 601 (1990) (adopting doctrine of \u201cautomatic standing\u201d where defendant is charged with possessory offense and seeks to exclude evidence under Massachusetts Declaration of Rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The dissent contends that, \u201cin light of all the circumstances surrounding [the juvenile\u2019s] residency at the shelter,\u201d \u201cthere is no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the room.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 278. If this were so, a search of the room would not be a search in the constitutional sense, which would mean that the police lawfully could enter and search the room without any predication, as often as they wished, whenever they wished. The juvenile\u2019s room, according to the dissent, <em>post </em>at 276, 278, should be treated no differently from a common room in a fire station, shared by the officers on duty, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 653-654 (1995), or the dropped ceiling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of a common hallway in an apartment building, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 300-303 (1991). While we agree with the dissent that the shelter residents in this case surrendered a substantial amount of personal privacy in return for temporary housing, we do not agree that the rooms they call their homes should be treated as if they were a common area under the Fourth Amendment or art. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The third party\u2019s consent is nullified if another physically present resident expressly refuses consent. <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 120 (2006).

In <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Guirola, supra </em>at 822, the exterminator who was sent to a Boston Housing Authority (BHA) apartment by the property manager observed a sawed-off shotgun visible from the broom closet, ammunition in the kitchen, and white powder in one of the bedrooms, and informed the site manager, who telephoned a BHA police officer. The police officer entered the apartment, removed the sawed-off shotgun, and then obtained a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>We held that the housing police officer\u2019s entry into the apartment and seizure of the sawed-off shotgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>was constitutional because the lease allowed management entry without notice for emergency purposes, and the discovery of the sawed-off shotgun, ammunition, and white powder \u201cpresented a sufficient emergency to permit, under the lease, the BHA police officer\u2019s initial entry to the apartment for safety purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828. The court also upheld the police officer\u2019s entry into the apartment to seize the sawed-off shotgun under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, because of the \u201cdanger to the community and to the police posed by the sawed-off shotgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, 774-775, cert, denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>28 Mass.

Because the police waited one day after their initial conversation with Brown to enter the room, the Commonwealth does not contend here that the warrant-less police entry into the juvenile\u2019s room could be justified without consent as an appropriate response to an emergency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We declare this standard only under art. 14, rather than under the Fourth Amendment, even though it is consistent with Federal constitutional case law.

The diligence of the inquiry will be measured by what reasonably can be accomplished at the time and place of the consent.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>78 Haw. 433, 447 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>McLees, </em>298 Mont. 15, 26-27 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>156 Wash. 2d 1, 12 (2005). Each of these courts rested its conclusion on provisions in its State Constitution that provided a right to privacy, rather than provisions prohibiting unreasonable searches. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 446, citing art. I, \u00a7 7, of Hawai\u2019i Constitution (\u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against. . . invasions of privacy shall not be violated\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>McLees, supra </em>at 23, citing art. II, \u00a7 10, of Montana Constitution (\u201cright of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morse, supra </em>at 9, citing art. I, \u00a7 7, of Washington Constitution (\u201cNo person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law\u201d). Article 14 does not expressly provide a right to privacy beyond the right to \u201cbe secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>375 Mass. 795, 808 (1978). Massachusetts has a right of privacy, albeit one created by statute. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B (\u201cperson shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy\u201d). However, in determining the lawfulness of a search under this statutory provision, we have said that the analysis mirrors that under art. 14, because both hinge on the reasonableness of the police conduct. <em>O\u2019Connors. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 329-330 (1990) (\u201cWe think that it is highly unlikely that the Legislature intended to provide a right of action to a person whose privacy was substantially or seriously interfered with, but reasonably so\u201d). We are not persuaded by the decisions in these three States that our law of search and seizure will be improved by viewing these searches through the prism of a right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Supreme Court of Oregon, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico, and a Superior Court in Delaware have also refused to recognize the apparent authority doctrine under their State Constitutions. See State v.v. Devonshire, Del. Super. Ct., No. 0307010804 (Jan. 20, 2004) (unpublished opinion); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>v. <em>Wright, </em>119 N.M. 559, 564-565 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carsey, </em>295 Or. 32, 44-45 (1983). The Court of Appeals of New Mexico and the Superior Court in Delaware rest their refusal on their State Supreme Court\u2019s rejection under their State Constitutions of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897 (1984). See State v.s. Devonshire, <em>supra-, State </em>v. <em>Wright, supra </em>at 564. The Oregon Supreme Court, prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177 (1990), held that the consent of a person without actual authority to consent \u201cis, in effect, no consent at all\u201d and that the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the officers is \u201cirrelevant\u201d because a warrantless search without consent is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carsey, supra </em>at 44, 46. We have earlier discussed why we consider both of these analyses to be flawed. See <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b291-7\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">(dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins). I respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>fully dissent based on my conclusion that the juvenile has no \u201cconstitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301 (1991). I agree with the well-reasoned analysis of the Appeals Court in this regard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter P., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 91-94 (2008). It follows that the director of the Roxbury Multi-Service Center, Inc., Family House Shelter (shelter) acted well within her rights in admitting police to the juvenile\u2019s room, and suppression of the firearm and the juvenile\u2019s statements was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The problem with the court\u2019s view is that it ignores the situation \u201con the ground\u201d or \u2014 put differently \u2014 fails to acknowledge what the shelter is and the circumstances of its operation. The shelter services a transient population. It makes available a temporary space to live off the streets. In return, and for obvious reasons, the shelter requires that its residents surrender a considerable degree of personal freedom. Contrary to the fiction in which the court indulges, this is neither a hotel nor a dormitory. An examination of the characteristics of life at the shelter, in my view, puts to rest any premise that a resident could conceivably harbor a reasonable expectation that his or her privacy would limit the action of the shelter authorities in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Before obtaining a room at the shelter, all residents receive a copy of the shelter\u2019s \u201cResident\u2019s Manual\u201d (manual). This manual sets forth the rules that residents are expected to follow while living in the facility. A major purpose of these rules is the maintenance of order and safety in the shelter. Like members of all famihes that move into the building, the juvenile and his mother received and reviewed the manual at the beginning of their stay at the shelter. The motion judge found that \u201c[t]he family was required to review and sign-off on the manual before taking residence at the shelter.\u201d An intake worker explained the roles to them and noted the delivery of the manual on an intake form. By moving into the shelter, the residents (including the mother and the juvenile here) signify their assent to the rules. By agreeing to these rules, residents forgo a substantial amount of personal privacy in exchange for temporary housing and the other services the shelter provides.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Shelter rules dictate when residents can be present in the building. Residents must be out of the building from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. on weekdays,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and they must be in the shelter by a specified curfew time each evening. Each time residents enter or leave the facility, they must sign in or out at the front desk. Residents are also required to observe \u201cFamily Time Quiet Hour\u201d from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. each evening. During this time, \u201cthere is minimal noise,\u201d and parents are expected to \u201cgo[] over homework, read[] a book, or play[] family games\u201d with their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Additionally, the shelter regulates residents\u2019 use of their rooms. Residents \u201care not allowed access or permitted to enter another resident\u2019s room at any time,\u201d and they may meet with outside visitors only during stated times at designated locations in the building. The shelter\u2019s rules even forbid residents from rearranging the furniture in their rooms, limit the number of suitcases present in the room to \u201ctwo . . . per family member,\u201d and prohibit residents from placing items \u201con the windowsills.\u201d Alcohol and firearms are strictly forbidden in the facility, as are sexual activities (except between residents \u201ccoupled\u201d together).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In addition to regulating the use of residents\u2019 rooms, the shelter restricts many aspects of their personal conduct. Residents must spend \u201ca minimum of twenty hours per week actively engaged in employment, job search, skills/educational training and housing search.\u201d They must save thirty per cent of their monthly income and provide shelter staff with their banking records as proof of same. Furthermore, residents must attend weekly meetings with social service providers. In order to maintain the premises, the shelter requires residents to perform weekly chores and clean their rooms according to enumerated housekeeping standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The manual reveals a special concern for eliminating the presence of weapons in the shelter. The shelter forbids possession of \u201cweapons of any kind.\u201d The manual defines a weapon as \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>item that can be used to threaten or cause physical damage or harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Shelter staff may enforce these rules by \u201cperform[ing] random room checks and routine room inspections ... at any time.\u201d Such searches are authorized for investigating violations of any rule, from the rules prohibiting possession of drugs and weapons to the housekeeping rules requiring that \u201c[c]lathing is put away neatly,\u201d \u201c[b]eds are made daily,\u201d and \u201c[djiaper pails are . . . emptied every morning.\u201d The rules are enforced through an internal discipline system consisting of warnings for initial violations and termination of the residency for repeated violations. Residents who commit a violation that threatens the safety of other residents or staff, including the possession of a weapon, face immediate termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The reasonableness of the juvenile\u2019s expectation of privacy must be evaluated in light of all the circumstances surrounding his residency at the shelter. Where the shelter director can enter any resident\u2019s room essentially at will, there is no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the room. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 653-654 (1995) (whether area searched is freely accessible to others is relevant to reasonableness of expectation of privacy); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 545, cert, denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990) (defendant\u2019s control over area searched is relevant to reasonableness of expectation of privacy). Looked at from a different perspective, the shelter director possessed sufficient common authority over the premises to consent to a police search. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Considine, </em>448 Mass. 295, 301 (2007) (by prohibiting students on field trip from occupying hotel rooms during day, chaperones retained sufficient control to authorize search). The staff\u2019s plenary authority in the circumstances, including the right to conduct unannounced inspections, meaningfully differentiates the shelter from hotels, apartments, and university dormitories.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The court does not dispute that the conditions of the manual grant shelter staff the authority to enter residents\u2019 rooms to search for contraband, but it holds that this power does not extend to granting consent to the police to do the same. See <em>ante </em>at 264. This is an entirely unwarranted and impractical distinction, requiring that the shelter staff resort to self-help in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>order to obtain prompt enforcement of the prohibition on firearms. Shelter staff are not trained in dealing with guns or people armed with guns, and they cannot arrest those in possession of weapons. A commonsense reading of the provisions of the manual regarding weapons plainly communicates that shelter staff, at its choosing, may seek police assistance in undertaking their reserved right to control the premises. In sum, there was no objective basis in these circumstances for any expectation that the juvenile may have had that his room would be immune from the kind of entry that occurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">I do not suggest that the shelter could form a contract with a minor abrogating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the minor\u2019s right to privacy. See <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>437 Mass. 99, 107 (2002) (contract by minor voidable before minor reaches age of majority or within reasonable time thereafter). Instead, I rely on the fact that the juvenile\u2019s mother can consent on his behalf. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>422 Mass. 64, 70 (1996) (parent may consent to search of child\u2019s room).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The stated purpose of this requirement is to encourage residents to spend this time working, attending job training, or searching for employment or housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
