L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3. General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), in turn, provides, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>things, that a consumer \u201cwhose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), may bring an action in the Superior Court for damages and equitable relief. In 1996, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>adding the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (insolvency fund), as well as joint underwriting associations, to the definition of \u201cperson\u201d as that term is defined in G. L. c. 176D. St. 1996, c. 313 (1996 amendment). The 1996 amendment was adopted in the wake of <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, <em>777 </em>(1992) <em>(Barrett), </em>and <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Mass. 48, 53 (1994) <em>(Poznik), </em>in which this court held, respectively, that the insolvency fund (in <em>Barrett) </em>and the Massachusetts Medical Professional Insurance Association (medical insurance association), a joint underwriting association (in <em>Poznik), </em>were not subject to suit under G. L. c. 93A. In this consumer action against the insolvency fund, we are asked to determine whether the 1996 amendment caused the insolvency fund to be subject to G. L. c. 93A, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 1 (a), provides, in pertinent part, that a \u201c[pjerson\u201d is \u201cany individual, corporation, association, . . . any other legal entity or self insurer which is engaged in the business of insurance, including agents, brokers, and adjusters, the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund and any joint underwriting association established pursuant to law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The insolvency fund argues that its placement in that definitional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>section after the words \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d and after the words \u201cincluding agents, brokers, and adjusters,\u201d supports a conclusion that it is a \u201cperson\u201d for some purposes of G. L. c. 176D, but it is not a person \u201cengaged in the business of insurance\u201d for all purposes of that chapter. The insolvency fund, it argues, is subject to investigation and enforcement by the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) under G. L. c. 176D, but it is not subject to consumer actions under G. L. c. 93A. A judge in the Superior Court agreed and allowed the insolvency fund\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the 1996 amendment had the effect of subjecting the insolvency fund, among other things, to consumer actions brought pursuant to G. L. c. 93 A, \u00a7 9 (1). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We briefly summarize the allegations of the complaint, which we take as true. <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 529-530 (2002) (\u201cIn deciding a rule 12 [c] motion, all facts pleaded by the nonmoving party must be accepted as true\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In July, 2003, Legion Insurance Company (Legion), a Pennsylvania company that provided insurance for the town of Duxbury (town), was declared insolvent by a Pennsylvania court. Accordingly, pursuant to G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5 (1), the insolvency fund became obligated to pay certain claims arising under policies issued by Legion and to \u201cadjust, compromise, settle and pay covered claims to the extent of the [insolvency fund\u2019s] obligation,\u201d G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5 (1) <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>One of the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>concerned a negligence action commenced against the town by a student injured in the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In 2001, the plaintiff, Kirsten M. Wheatley, at the time a seven year old special education student who required the use of a walker and adult supervision to walk, was a student at a Duxbury public elementary school. On October 26, 2001, while walking to the school lunch room, Wheatley\u2019s walker collided with an obstacle on the floor of the hallway as she was leaving the special education center. Falling forward, she fractured a front tooth. She was then permitted by a school nurse to eat her lunch, during which she swallowed a different tooth knocked loose by the fall. In July, 2004, following unsuccessful negotiations with the town described below, Wheatley filed a negligence action against the town seeking to recover damages for these injuries. The case went to trial, and in April, 2008, a jury awarded Wheatley $20,786.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Wheatley first presented her claims to the town in August, 2003, see G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4, approximately one month after Legion had been declared insolvent. Neither the town nor the insolvency fund responded to Wheatley\u2019s presentment letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Wheatley filed her negligence action against the town, the insolvency fund defended the town, denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. Wheatley alleges that, by November, 2004, some fourteen months after Wheatley had made demand on the town and three months after she had commenced her negligence action against it, the insolvency fund had made no offer to settle her claims. She thereupon sent to the insolvency fund a demand letter pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), to which the insolvency fund did not respond within thirty days of receipt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wheatley alleges here that at \u201call times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>relevant\u201d the town\u2019s liability was \u201creasonably clear,\u201d because she was in the town\u2019s \u201cexclusive care, custody and control at the time of the accident\u201d and was \u201cunable to exercise any degree of care to protect herself from injury\u201d because of her age and disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In August, 2006, some twenty-two months after sending her G. L. c. 93A demand letter to the insolvency fund, Wheatley commenced this action alleging that the insolvency fund had not \u201ceffectuated a prompt, fair and equitable settlement\u201d of her claims, and that in the course of its defense of the town in the underlying negligence action, the insolvency fund had engaged in \u201cmultiple\u201d unfair claims settlement practices in \u201cwillful\u201d violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, including failure \u201cto acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (b); failure \u201cto adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (c); refusal to pay her claim \u201cwithout conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) <em>(d); </em>and failure \u201cto effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement!]\u201d of a claim \u201cin which liability ha[d] become reasonably clear,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) <em>(f). </em>The insolvency fund moved for judgment on the pleadings, which (as noted earlier) was allowed by a judge in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>The statutory scheme. A </em>consumer such as Wheatley may commence an action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), in two circumstances. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 564-565 (2001), and cases cited (noting two circumstances).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the first prong of \u00a7 9 (1), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>consumer who has been \u201cinjured by another person\u2019s use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or \u201cany rule or regulation issued thereunder\u201d may bring an action in the Superior Court for damages and equitable relief. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1). Under the second prong of the statute, a consumer \u201cwhose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> may do so. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1). A consumer asserting a claim under the second prong of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), may recover damages for violations of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9), \u201cwithout regard to whether the violation was unlawful under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 754 (1993). This is because of the \u201cexplicit statement to that effect\u201d in \u00a7 9 (1). <em>Id. </em>Wheatley asserts claims under both prongs of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">b. <em>The 1996 amendment to G. L. c. 176D. </em>In <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 775, a consumer sought to recover damages from the insolvency fund under the first prong of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (l).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Reasoning that the insolvency fund is, \u201cin essence, simply a conduit to which certain noninsolvent insurers, authorized to do business in the Commonwealth, pay a pro rata amount to enable\u201d the insolvency fund \u201cto pay \u2018covered claims\u2019 to insureds whose insurance companies become insolvent subsequent to the issuance of their policies and claims,\u201d this court held that a consumer could not maintain a G. L. c. 93A claim against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>insolvency fund because the insolvency fund \u201cdoes not engage in a \u2018trade\u2019 or \u2018commerce\u2019 and its activities are not performed within a \u2018business context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 775, 776-777. Shortly thereafter, in <em>Poznik, supra </em>at 50, 52-53, this court held that the medical insurance association also was not subject to suit under G. L. c. 93A, describing the medical insurance association as a statutorily mandated, \u201ctemporary, nonexclusive, nonprofit joint underwriting association whose purpose is to provide medical malpractice insurance on a self-supporting basis.\u201d The court relied expressly on <em>Barrett </em>for its conclusion that the medical insurance association was \u201cnot engaged in \u2018trade or commerce\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A,\u201d <em>Poznik, supra </em>at 53, reasoning that the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the medical insurance association was \u201csimilar\u201d to that of the insolvency fund, and that the medical insurance association\u2019s transactions, \u201clike those\u201d of the insolvency fund, are \u201cmotivated by legislative mandate, not business or personal reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, quoting <em>Barrett, supra </em>at <em>777.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Within eleven months of <em>Poznik, </em>the Legislature took action on two bills that eventually were merged and enacted as the 1996 amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the 1996 amendment provided that the insolvency fund and any joint underwriting association established pursuant to law be included in the definition of \u201cperson\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 176D. St. 1996, c. 313. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>We turn now to consider whether the 1996 amendment subjected the insolvency fund to consumer actions pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">c. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review de nova the judge\u2019s order allowing a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule 12 (c). <em>Okerman </em>v. <em>VA Software Corp., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 771, 775 (2007). See <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 529 (2002), quoting J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.16 (1974) (defendant\u2019s rule 12 [c] motion is \u201cactually a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>dismiss\u201d that \u201cargues that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d); <em>Minay a </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Credit Union Share Ins. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 904, 905 (1984), quoting <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist., </em>381 Mass. 717, 717-718 (1980) (\u201ceffect of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is \u2018to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, the issue in this case is one of statutory construction, which we also review de nova. <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Our primary duty in interpreting a statute is \u201cto effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it.\u201d <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). Where the words of a statute are not ambiguous in their meaning, we \u201c[ojrdinarily\u201d view them as \u201cconclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986). See <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985) (statutory text \u201cmust be afforded its plain meaning when it is clear and unambiguous\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Other rules of statutory construction are operative in this case. First, a statute must be construed so that \u201ceffect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u201d <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998), quoting 2A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05 (5th ed. 1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaughey, </em>9 Gray 296, 297 (1857) (this is \u201can anciently established rule\u201d). Second, the \u201cstatute must be viewed \u2018as a whole\u2019; it is \u2018not proper to confine interpretation to the one section to be construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting 2A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05, at 154 (6th ed. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">d. <em>The insolvency fund and G. L. c. 93A consumer actions. </em>As noted earlier, in <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 775, this court held that the insolvency fund was not subject to G. L. c. 93A consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>actions because it did not engage in \u201c \u2018trade\u2019 or \u2018commerce\u2019 \u201d as the court understood those terms. The insolvency fund now argues that its character has not changed since <em>Barrett, </em>that the reasoning in <em>Barrett </em>retains its full force, and thus that the insolvency fund should not now be subject to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions. We acknowledge the point, but as we now explain, we are compelled by the language of the 1996 amendment to conclude that the Legislature has dictated otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">First, all the operative provisions of G. L. c. 176D that use the term \u201c[pjerson\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 <em>l (a) </em>\u2014 which together set forth procedures for the regulation of unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance, G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2 \u2014 apply to persons who engage \u201cin the business of insurance.\u201d See G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2 (prohibiting any \u201cperson\u201d from engaging in certain acts \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (defining certain acts as unfair or deceptive \u201cin the business of insurance,\u201d and using the term \u201cperson\u201d in subsections [1] <em>[d], </em>[2], [3], [5], and [10]);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 5 (providing commissioner power to investigate into affairs of \u201cevery person engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>in the business of insurance in this commonwealth\u201d) ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6 (setting forth procedures for commissioner to follow when investigating \u201cany such person,\u201d i.e., any person described in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 5, as \u201cperson engaged in the business of insurance\u201d);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7 (setting forth penalties commissioner may enforce against \u201cperson charged\u201d under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 8 (setting forth procedures for review for \u201c[a]ny person\u201d subject to cease and desist order issued by commissioner under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6);<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 10 (setting forth sanctions for \u201c[a]ny person\u201d who violates cease and desist order issued by commissioner under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 7).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The only operative provision of the statute in which the term \u201cperson\u201d is not coupled (either within the same section or through reference to some other section) with the modifier \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d appears in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and \u00a7 4 itself includes its own definition of \u201cperson.\u201d See G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 4 (prohibiting certain practices in relation to issuance of insurance policies and lending of money or extension of credit by \u201cany individual, corporation, association, partnership, or other legal entity whatsoever\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To conclude, as the insolvency fund argues, that the 1996 amendment defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>insolvency fund as a \u201cperson,\u201d but not a person \u201cengaged in the business of insurance,\u201d see <em>supra </em>at 596, would contravene the well-established rules of statutory construction articulated in <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., All </em>Mass. 136, 140 (1998) (statute must be construed so that \u201ceffect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u201d), and <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004) (\u201cstatute must be viewed \u2018as a whole\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Moving beyond the language of the statute, the intent of the 1996 amendment, the insolvency fund posits, is to \u201cprohibit\u201d the insolvency fund \u201cfrom engaging in practices defined or determined to be unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d and to \u201csubject\u201d the insolvency fund \u201cto enforcement by\u201d the commissioner. We agree, as far as that argument goes. But we do not agree that the intent of the Legislature can be entirely so circumscribed. The provisions of G. L. c. 176D, which give the commissioner \u201cthe power to examine and investigate into the affairs of every person engaged in the business of insurance in this commonwealth,\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 5, and to pursue enforcement actions against \u201cany such person,\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6, become operative only where a person has or might have engaged in insurance practices prohibited by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2. That section prohibits a \u201cperson\u201d from engaging in any act \u201cdefined in this chapter as,<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark> or determined pursuant to section six of this chapter to be,<footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark> an unfair method of competition or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 2. Thus the insolvency fund recognizes that the 1996 amendment subjected it to the enforcement authority of the commissioner if it engaged in acts defined as occurring \u201cin the business of insurance.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. To argue, as the insolvency fund does, that the 1996 amendment defined the insolvency fund as <em>not </em>being a \u201cperson engaged in the business of insurance\u201d but simultaneously subjected it to the enforcement authority of the commissioner for acts occurring \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d strains the language of the statute beyond reason. In effect, the insolvency fund argues that, whenever it engages in any unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d prohibited by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, it <em>is </em>\u201cin the business of insurance\u201d for purposes of the regulatory provisions of G. L. c. 176D, but it is <em>not </em>\u201cin the business of insurance\u201d for other purposes of that chapter. There is no language in the statute to support that tortured interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The insolvency fund also notes that the 1996 amendment did not refer to the insolvency fund in the second sentence of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 (a): \u201cFor purposes of this chapter, operators of any such medical and hospital service plans shall be deemed to be engaged in the business of insurance.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>as amended through St. 1996, c. 313. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>That sentence was unchanged by the 1996 amendment, compare St. 1996, c. 313, with St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, but does not support the insolvency fund\u2019s argument that the insolvency fund is not \u201cengaged in the business of insurance.\u201d Rather, the sentence clarifies that the provisions of G. L. c. 176D apply to the medical and hospital service plans specified in the first sentence of the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>see note 3, <em>supra, </em>despite the exemptions from the Commonwealth\u2019s general insurance laws granted to such organizations in other statutes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 176B, \u00a7 14; G. L. c. 176C, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Beyond the language of the 1996 amendment and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>provisions of G. L. c. 176D, there is a second and independent reason why we reject the insolvency fund\u2019s interpretation. Even were we inclined to adopt the insolvency fund\u2019s construction of \u201c[pjerson\u201d in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>the insolvency fund nevertheless would not be insulated from G. L. c. 93A liability to a consumer. Central to the insolvency fund\u2019s position is its assertion that it <em>is </em>subject to enforcement actions by the commissioner <em>if </em>it violates any provision of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3. It thereby concedes that there are circumstances in which it could be, in the language of the <em>second </em>prong of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), a \u201cperson violating the provisions of [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9)].\u201d See <em>supra </em>at 599-600. There can be no doubt that the insolvency fund is a \u201cperson\u201d under the second prong of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), for G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 1 (a), defines a \u201cperson\u201d as including \u201cany\u201d legal entity. If the insolvency fund can be a \u201cperson violating the provisions of [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9)],\u201d it is subject to a consumer action brought under the second prong of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), regardless of how one reads the 1996 amendment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The insolvency fund argues that subjecting it to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions would be a \u201cradical change\u201d in the law, pointing out that it \u201cis not to be lightly supposed that radical changes in the law were intended where not plainly expressed.\u201d <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954). See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>304 Mass. 147, 150 (1939) (\u201cA matter may be within the letter of a statute and not come within its spirit, if the matter is beyond the mischief intended to be reached or if to include it would require a radical change in established public policy or in the existing law and the act does not manifest any intent that such a change should be effected\u201d). Even if subjecting the insolvency fund to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions is a \u201cradical change\u201d in the law, a point we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>resolve, in our view the Legislature \u201cplainly expressed\u201d its intent to subject the insolvency fund to consumer actions under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), when it amended G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 <em>(a), </em>in the wake of <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Poznik</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The insolvency fund points to the legislative history to support its argument that the Legislature did not intend to subject the insolvency fund to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions when it enacted the 1996 amendment. Ordinarily we would not consider the argument because in our view the statute is not ambiguous. See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977) (where language of statute is unambiguous, \u201clegislative history is not ordinarily a proper source of construction\u201d). In any event, such sparse indications of legislative intent as do exist reinforce our conclusion. As originally proposed, the title to 1995 House Doc. No. 4950, later enacted, was \u201cAn Act to equalize the application of fair competition requirements.\u201d Although the substance of the bill remained unaltered in any relevant respect, on its third reading in the House of Representatives, the title was changed to \u201cAn Act relative to fair competition requirements <em>in the business of insurance\u201d </em>(emphasis added). St. 1996, c. 313. Further, the timing of the amendment, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>and the coupling of the insolvency fund with joint underwriting associations \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 entities with little else of relevance in common with the insolvency fund \u2014 suggest that the Legislature intended the amendment to be a response to this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Poznik. </em>As <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 777, and <em>Poznik, supra </em>at 53, concluded, respectively, that the insolvency fund and a statutorily established joint underwriting association were not subject to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions, the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>straightforward inference is that the Legislature intended to abrogate both of those decisions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The indicia of legislative intent cited by the insolvency fund \u2014 a memorandum from the Governor\u2019s chief legal counsel to the Governor and two related memoranda from the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation to the Governor\u2019s legislative office \u2014 do not suggest otherwise.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The former states that the 1996 amendment \u201cprovides\u201d that the insolvency fund and joint underwriting associations \u201care subject to the same standards which apply to others operating in the insurance business\u201d and \u201cextends the authority of the [commissioner] to protect consumers.\u201d The insolvency fund points to the reference to the enforcement powers of the commissioner only. But more is reflected in that memorandum, and it is beyond dispute that the \u201cstandards\u201d that applied at the time to \u201cothers operating in the insurance business\u201d included subjection to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions. See, e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Gulf Ins. Co., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 432, 435-437 (1995) (insurer liable to insured under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, for failure to \u201ceffectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement[]\u201d of claim in which liability had \u201cbecome reasonably clear,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 [9] [f]). The latter two memoranda cited by the insolvency fund express support for the 1996 amendment because its adoption would cause the insolvency fund to \u201ccome under the [commissioner\u2019s] supervisory and enforcement authority of G. L. c. 176D,\u201d a point not in dispute. Silence in those memoranda on the broader impact of the legislation is insufficient to overcome the import of the unambiguous statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Finally, citing various provisions of G. L. c. 175D, the insolvency fund argues that the Legislature has \u201ctaken great pains\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>limit the insolvency fund\u2019s obligations in order to preserve the insolvency fund\u2019s \u201climited financial resources\u201d and \u201climit the burden on the public,\u201d which will bear the \u201cultimate financial responsibility\u201d for any G. L. c. 93A awards,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the insolvency fund notes that the Legislature made no change to G. L. c. 93A and no change to G. L. c. 175D in the 1996 amendment. The insolvency fund argues that interpreting the 1996 amendment as subjecting it to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions, as we do, would mean necessarily that there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the insolvency fund\u2019s liability, a result discordant with the Legislature\u2019s efforts to limit the insolvency fund\u2019s obligations. We conclude today only that the insolvency fund is subject to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions. We do not consider and do not decide whether any of the statutory limitations on the insolvency fund\u2019s obligations to pay claims set forth in G. L. c. 175D and elsewhere apply as well to any damages that may be awarded against the insolvency fund under G. L. c. 93A. In this case, the insolvency fund may or may not be held liable under G. L. c. 93A, and we decline now to reach any question of what the scope of any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>hypothetical liability or damages might be were it to be found liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-19\">In 1972, the Legislature amended the General Laws by striking out G.

L. c. 176D, \u00a7 4, see note 21, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text, there are three uses of the term \u201cperson\u201d in G.

L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6, states, among other things: \u201cUpon good cause shown, the commissioner shall permit <em>any person </em>to intervene, appear and be heard by counsel or in person\u201d in a hearing to determine whether the commissioner should issue a cease and desist order to a suspected violator (emphasis added). It defies credulity that the intent of the Legislature, in enacting the 1996 amendment, was solely to allow the insolvency fund and joint underwriting associations to intervene in hearings against other parties. The insolvency fund makes no such argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Second, G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 13, which grants immunity from future prosecution for \u201cany person\u201d who asks to be excused from testifying or producing documents at the direction of the commissioner under G. L. c. 176D on the grounds that such testimony or documents might be self-incriminating, uses the term \u201cperson\u201d to refer to natural persons; the section uses the term \u201c[a]ny such individual\u201d synonymously.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Third, G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3B, which sets forth certain requirements applying to a \u201ccarrier,\u201d as defined therein, \u201cthat offers insureds a restricted pharmacy network,\u201d defines the term \u201cinsured\u201d to mean \u201ca <em>person </em>whose health care services and benefits are provided by, or indemnified by or otherwise covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>by a carrier\u2019s group or individual insurance policy, or certificate, agreement or contract and shall include subscribers, enrollees or members\u201d (emphasis added). As with G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 13, the term \u201cperson\u201d in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3B, refers to natural persons. As with G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6, neither party argues that the use of the term \u201cperson\u201d in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 13, or G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3B, has any bearing on the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We also disagree with the insolvency fund\u2019s parsing of the definitional changes to the term \u201cperson\u201d in the 1996 amendment. See <em>supra </em>at 596. In our view, consistent with our obligation to read G. L. c. 176D as a whole, a proper reading of the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1 (a), encompasses any legal entity that is engaged in the business of insurance, \u201cincluding agents, brokers, and adjusters, the [insolvency fund] and any joint underwriting association established pursuant to law,\u201d bringing the insolvency fund within the definition of a legal entity engaged in the business of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[24]\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">24General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3, defines certain acts as \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance.\u201d General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 3A, 3B, and 4, define additional prohibited acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[25]\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">25General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 6, permits the commissioner to pursue enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ment actions against \u201cany such person\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cevery person engaged in the business of insurance in this commonwealth,\u201d as described in G.

L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The insolvency fund also argues that the 1996 amendment does not define the insolvency fund as a person \u201cin the business of insurance,\u201d because \u201cit is plain\u201d that the amendment does not result in the insolvency fund being a \u201ccompany\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 175, which defines \u201ccompany\u201d as \u201call . . . associations . . . engaged as principals in the business of insurance.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1. Our reasoning, which relies on the particular language and interconnection of G. L. c. 176D and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, does not require us to decide whether the insolvency fund satisfies the definition of \u201c[c]ompany\u201d in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">After the 1996 amendment, the Appeals Court has assumed that joint underwriting associations are now subject to G. L. c. 93A consumer actions. See <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Caf\u00e9 of Worcester, Inc., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 57 n.3, 59 n.8, 64-71 (2000), quoting <em>Jimmy\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass., </em>410 Mass. 61, 64 (1991) (in considering motion to intervene by Liquor Liability Joint Underwriting Association of Massachusetts [LLJUAM], \u201ca nonprofit, \u2018statutorily mandated agglomeration of every personal liability insurer operating in the Commonwealth,\u2019 \u201d court assumed that LLJUAM is subject to G. L. c. 93A claims for unfair settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 [9]). The insolvency fund effectively concedes that its interpretation of the 1996 amendment is at odds with this approach, given the amendment\u2019s \u201cparallel treatment,\u201d in the words of the insolvency fund, of joint underwriting associations and the insolvency fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The insolvency fund argues that, when it adopted the 1996 amendment, the Legislature \u201cgave no thought at all\u201d to subjecting the insolvency fond to consumer actions under G. L. c. 93A, \u201cbut rather intended only to subject the [insolvency fond] to enforcement by the [commissioner] with respect to activities prohibited by c. 176D.\u201d This argument is difficult to square with the insolvency fund\u2019s recognition at oral argument that the 1996 amendment was a response to <em>Barrett </em>and <em>Poznik.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Such documents are from government actors beyond the legislative branch, and we place no undue weight on their significance. Cf. <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 798 n.16 (2006) (citing \u201cnotation\u201d from Governor\u2019s chief legal counsel in construing legislative amendment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\">See G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2) (definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d insolvency fund is obligated to pay is limited to \u201cunpaid\u201d claims, and excludes \u201cany amount due a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool or underwriting association\u201d); G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5 (1) (a) (insolvency fund\u2019s obligation on \u201ccovered claims,\u201d other than workers\u2019 compensation claims, limited to amounts \u201cless than three hundred thousand dollars\u201d); G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 5 (1) (c) (if insolvency fund has insufficient financial resources to make all necessary payments in any one year, \u201cthe funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available\u201d); G.

L. c. 175D, \u00a7 17, which exempts the insolvency fund from any obligation to pay a first party claim by a \u201chigh net worth insured,\u201d as defined therein. That section was inserted by St. 2006, c. 342, \u00a7 2, and applies to only those insolvent insurers that are so determined on or after the effective date of that act (Feb. 3, 2007).
