Mobile of Mass. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 280 (2008) <em>(Bell Atl. Mobile I). </em>In that case, we reviewed appeals brought before the Appellate Tax Board (board) under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39 (\u00a7 39), in which Bell Atlantic Mobile of Massachusetts Corporation, Ltd. (Bell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Atlantic Mobile, or the taxpayer) and the board of assessors of Newton had each appealed from the Commissioner of Revenue\u2019s (commissioner\u2019s) central valuation of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s personal property for fiscal year (FY) 2004. We affirmed the board\u2019s determination that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a \u201ctelephone company\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 39 and therefore not entitled to central valuation. <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, supra </em>at 282-283. Before the date of our decision, however, the commissioner had continued to certify central valuations of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s property for years before and after 2004. In the present case, we must decide whether the board has jurisdiction under \u00a7 39 to hear appeals, timely filed with the board pursuant to that statute by certain municipal boards of assessors, to challenge the commissioner\u2019s certified central valuations for those additional years, even though, as <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I </em>indicates, the central valuations were made in error. We conclude that the statute confers jurisdiction on the board to hear the assessors\u2019 appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Pursuant to \u00a7 39, on or before May 15 of each year, the commissioner must value centrally \u201cmachinery, poles, wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes\u201d (\u00a7 39 property) of all telephone and telegraph companies. The valuations must be certified to the owners of the \u00a7 39 property and to the assessors of the cities and towns where the \u00a7 39 property is located and therefore subject to taxation. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. See also <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 198, 199 (2005). The assessors of the cities and towns must use the commissioner\u2019s certified valuations for tax assessment purposes. See <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>New England Tel. </em>&amp; <em>Tel. Co., </em>330 Mass. 198, 200-201 (1953). However, \u00a7 39 gives the assessors, as well as the taxpayer-owner of the \u00a7 39 property, the right to appeal from the commissioner\u2019s value determinations to the board on or before June 15 of the taxable year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>At all relevant times, Bell Atlantic Mobile<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided wireless cellular telecommunications services, or what is generally known as \u201ccell phone\u201d service. For FY 2003 through FY 2008, the commissioner determined that Bell Atlantic Mobile was a \u201ctelephone company\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 39, and accordingly certified a central valuation of its \u00a7 39 property for each of these years. In addition, for FY 2003, and for FY 2005 through FY 2007, the commissioner determined that Bell Atlantic Mobile was eligible for the property tax exemption granted to certain foreign utility corporations under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d), </em>as incorporating G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A (1) <em>(a) </em>(iii) (corporate utility exemption).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner ruled that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not eligible for the corporate utility exemption in FY 2004, or in FY 2008.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The difference in the valuations when Bell Atlantic Mobile was granted the corporate utility exemption compared to when it was not is significant. For example, for Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s personal property situated in Newton, the commissioner\u2019s certified values exceeded $6,000,000 in the years Bell Atlantic Mobile was denied the corporate utility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>exemption; comparatively, in the years the corporate utility exemption was applied, the commissioner\u2019s valuation was under $30,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Of relevance to this case is the fact that for FY 2003 and FY 2004, the board of assessors of Newton (Newton assessors) filed appeals with the board under \u00a7 39 (\u00a7 39 appeals), and for FY 2005 through FY 2008, the assessors of various cities and towns, including Newton, Boston, Springfield, and Cambridge, filed additional \u00a7 39 appeals, challenging the commissioner\u2019s valuations. Some or all of these appeals argued that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a \u201ctelephone company\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 39, and therefore not entitled to central valuation of its personal property by the commissioner; some or all argued in addition that the company was not entitled to the corporate utility exemption, and therefore its machinery (see note 8, <em>infra) </em>constituted taxable property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For FY 2004 and FY 2008, Bell Atlantic Mobile filed its own appeals \u2014 under both \u00a7 39 and G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 65 (\u00a7 65); see note 2, <em>supra </em>\u2014 from the taxes assessed by the 220 cities and towns where its property was located. These appeals claimed that the taxpayer\u2019s property had been overvalued by the local assessors, and sought as relief the abatement of the property taxes it had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The board dealt first with the various FY 2004 appeals. As we described in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, </em>451 Mass. at 281-283, the board consolidated the Newton assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeal with Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s \u00a7\u00a739 and 65 appeals but then bifurcated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>issues for trial. The board held hearings on the issue of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s eligibility for (1) central valuation \u2014 in other words, whether Bell Atlantic Mobile was in fact a \u201ctelephone company\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 39 \u2014 and (2) the corporate utility exemption<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; it deferred all questions of the correct value of the taxable property. On May 15, 2006, the board issued a decision in which it concluded that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company and therefore not entitled to central valuation under \u00a7 39 (2006 decision). On that same date, the board issued a separate order with respect to Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s appeals under \u00a7 65; it ruled that the company was not entitled to the corporate utility exemption but stayed any further action in relation to the \u00a7 65 appeals pending appellate review of its 2006 decision under \u00a7 39. Bell Atlantic Mobile duly filed an appeal from the 2006 decision. After granting direct appellate review, we affirmed the board\u2019s determination. See <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, supra </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Following the issuance of our decision in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile </em>I, the Newton assessors and the board of assessors of Boston (Boston assessors) filed motions to consolidate their \u00a7 39 appeals \u2014 appeals for FY 2003 through FY 2008 in the case of the Newton assessors, and for FY 2005 through FY 2008 in the case of the Boston assessors \u2014 with Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s \u00a7 65 appeals. At the hearing on the motions to consolidate, the board advised the parties that as a result of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, </em>the board intended to dismiss <em>all </em>the remaining \u00a7 39 appeals filed by the various boards of assessors and by Bell Atlantic Mobile for lack of jurisdiction. Thereafter, on June 19, 2008, the board sua sponte issued a decision ordering the dismissal of all \u00a7 39 appeals,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and at the request of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>commissioner and several boards of assessors, on December 3, 2008, the board issued its findings of fact and report. The board concluded that its 2006 decision and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, supra, </em>were \u201cdispositive\u201d as to the remaining \u00a7 39 appeals and, in the case of the Newton assessors, that principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and issue preclusion independently prevented them from relitigating the undervaluation claim because the Newton assessors had been a party to <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I. </em>The board further observed that the assessors had not pursued alternative avenues to challenge the commissioner\u2019s valuations of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s property, such as a declaratory judgment action or an action in the nature of mandamus. The Newton assessors, the Boston assessors, and the boards of assessors of Cambridge and Springfield (collectively, assessors) filed appeals from the board\u2019s decision dismissing their \u00a7 39 appeals (2008 decision).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We granted the assessors\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review and now reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The question presented by this appeal is one of statutory construction. It concerns the scope of the board\u2019s authority under \u00a7 39 to decide appeals that were, at the time of filing, properly before the board pursuant to that statute. The board interpreted \u00a7 39 to mean that once the board determined Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company, the board was without jurisdiction to continue to entertain the pending appeals and therefore could not consider the challenges to the commissioner\u2019s valuation determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The board is an agency charged with the administration of tax laws and has expertise in tax matters, and therefore we may give weight to the board\u2019s interpretation of a tax statute. <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, </em>451 Mass. at 283, quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>383 Mass. 397, 401 (1981). See <em>Matter of the Valuation of MCI WorldCom Network Servs., Inc., </em>454 Mass. 635, 641 (2009). Ultimately, however, a question of statutory interpretation is a question of law for the court to resolve. See <em>AA Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>454 Mass. 114, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>118-119 (2009); <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, supra. </em>For the reasons that follow, we interpret \u00a7 39 in a manner that differs from the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We begin with the statutory language itself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As previously summarized, the first paragraph of \u00a7 39 directs the commissioner annually to value all the \u00a7 39 property of a telephone or telegraph company and certify the valuation to the company as well as to every board of assessors of a municipality where any such property is located. The first paragraph further provides that the company, as well as each board of assessors, may appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>to the board from the valuation by June 15, and that \u201c[e]very such appeal shall relate to the [commissioner\u2019s] valuation\u201d for the particular company. The second paragraph of \u00a7 39 in turn requires every board of assessors to assess the company\u2019s property \u201cas certified and at the value determined by the commissioner . . . under this section,\u201d subject to later adjustment \u2014 by tax abatement or additional tax collection \u2014 based on the final result of any appeal from the commissioner\u2019s central valuation that has been filed with the board pursuant to the first paragraph. See <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>330 Mass. at 201. The language of \u00a7 39 was designed to give power to the commissioner to conduct central valuations of certain types of property for the purpose of ensuring valuation \u201cconsistency and competence.\u201d <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. at 199. It is a remedial statute, \u201cnot enacted to exempt the companies\u2019 property from taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">As a remedial measure, \u201cthe statute must be construed and applied expansively in order to achieve the Legislature\u2019s goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The board itself has previously adopted a broad interpretation of the scope of its jurisdiction under \u00a7 39. As it did in the present case, the board in RCN-BecoCom, LLC vs. Commissioner of Revenue, Docket Nos. F253495, F257397 (Aug. 19, 2003), aff\u2019d, 443 Mass. 198 (2005), asserted jurisdiction under \u00a7 39 to decide whether the commissioner had correctly determined that a particular company was a \u201ctelephone\u201d or \u201ctelegraph\u201d company.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The board did so even though \u00a7 39 does not state or imply that the board make a threshold determination concerning the accuracy of the commissioner\u2019s classification decision, and despite the fact that an independent statutory provision, G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2, provides the board with jurisdiction to hear appeals by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any classification made by the commissioner under any provision of [G. L. c. 59].\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>agree that the board may choose to review a classification decision as part of its consideration of a \u00a7 39 appeal. However, if the board chooses to do so and determines, contrary to the commissioner, that a particular company is not a telephone company, such a determination leaves unaddressed the facts that (1) a central valuation of that company\u2019s \u201cmachinery, poles, wires and underground conduits, wires and pipes\u201d (i.e., \u00a7 39 property) has been made and certified by the commissioner; and (2) the assessors are obligated to use the valuation as the basis of their tax assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In determining the scope of the board\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 39 to hear appeals, our goal is to carry out the intent of the Legislature. See, e.g., <em>Acting Supt. of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 104 (2000), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, 361 </em>Mass. 360, 364 (1975). To that end, we examine the whole statute, seeking an interpretation that is true to the legislative purpose and will make it an effective piece of legislation. See, e.g., <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006); <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004). See also <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>433 Mass. 568, 574 (2001), quoting <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>La Touraine Coffee Co., </em>361 Mass. 773, 778 (1972) (statute \u201cshould be construed as \u2018a consistent and harmonious whole, capable of producing a rational result consonant with common sense and sound judgment\u2019 \u201d). In considering that \u00a7 39 was enacted to establish and support the commissioner\u2019s authority to perform central valuations of telephone company property; the express language of the statute confers on those affected by the central valuation the right to appeal and seek review of it by the board; and the act of centrally valuing a company\u2019s \u00a7 39 property has direct and continuing consequences for both the company and the boards of assessors, we think the principles of statutory construction just cited point to an interpretation of \u00a7 39 that authorizes the board fully to consider and decide all pending appeals from the valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Accordingly, we hold that where the commissioner classifies a company as a \u201ctelephone or telegraph company\u201d and certifies a central valuation of the company\u2019s property under \u00a7 39, and timely appeals from that central valuation have been filed by the assessors, the company, or both, the board has jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>to hear and decide all the issues raised in such appeals, even if it concludes that the company did not qualify as a telephone or telegraph company.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The board\u2019s contrary interpretation, supported by Bell Atlantic Mobile, ignores \u00a7 39\u2019s express provisions establishing the rights of the affected assessors and taxpaying company to appeal from the commissioner\u2019s central valuation. See <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>330 Mass. at 201 (requirement of central assessment under \u00a7 39 mandatory; otherwise, there would be \u201cno point in granting to the assessors a right to appeal from the commissioner\u2019s valuation to the [board]\u201d). The interpretation also may lead to a result that runs counter to the statute\u2019s underlying legislative intent, see <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. at 201, by effectively freeing from taxation any portion of a company\u2019s personal property that the commissioner has erroneously misclassified as exempt.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The interpretation of \u00a7 39 that we adopt here is not precluded by our decision in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I. </em>The board interpreted our decision in that case as agreeing with its view that once it decided Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company, that determination effectively required the board to dismiss all the pending \u00a7 39 appeals. However, the footnote in our opinion relied on by the board, see <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I, </em>451 Mass. at 285 n.11, constituted a description of actions taken by the board, not a ruling on their merits. The only issue before us in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I </em>was the correctness of the board\u2019s determination that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company for purposes of \u00a7 39. The question whether the board retained jurisdiction to decide the valuation issues raised in the assessors\u2019 (and the taxpayer\u2019s) \u00a7 39 appeals once the board made this determination was not raised, and we did not decide it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Further, our resolution of the question now before us does not confer unlimited rights of appeal. Appeals to the board remain subject to the board\u2019s rules of practice and procedure, codified at 831 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00 (2007). \u201cA claim of appeal shall be filed with the clerk of the Board in accordance with the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure . . . .\u201d 831 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.35 (2007). Rule 4 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, as amended, 430 Mass. 1603 (1999), provides that, in a civil case, the notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk \u201cwithin thirty days of the date of the entry of the judgment appealed from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In the present case, only the assessors of the cities of Newton, Boston, Springfield, and Cambridge filed claims of appeal from the board\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of their \u00a7 39 appeals. As these appeals were each filed within thirty days of December 3, 2008, the date the board issued its findings of fact and report, on remand, these assessors are entitled to have the board entertain their \u00a7 39 appeals that the board dismissed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The approximately forty-six other boards of assessors whose \u00a7 39 appeals were also dismissed as of December 3, 2008, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>may not now file an appeal from the board\u2019s decision; the thirty-day filing deadline has long passed. See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665 (1993), citing <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>412 Mass. 464, 465 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Finally, Bell Atlantic Mobile argues that one-half of the assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeals are moot because of agreements reached between the relevant assessors and Bell Atlantic Mobile as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the value of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s \u00a7 39 property for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008. The question before us, however, concerns only the scope of the statutory grant of jurisdiction to the board under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. Because we find the board has jurisdiction to hear the assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeals, questions concerning mootness are best reserved for the board to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed. The case is remanded to the board for consideration of the assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeals on the merits and for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We acknowledge the two amicus briefs filed by the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Owners of \u00a7 39 property such as Bell Atlantic Mobile, but not local assessors, have additional appeal rights under G.

Other courts, in different contexts, have also recognized the need to consider jurisdictional questions with an eye toward achieving a practical and fair result. See, e.g., <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Trustees of Hamilton Southeastern Sch. Corp., </em>551 F.3d 599, 607-609 (7th Cir. 2008), quoting <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>International College of Surgeons, </em>522 U.S. 156, 173 (1997) (addressing whether Federal District Court should have declined to exercise supplemental or ancillary jurisdiction over State claims after it granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 Federal Title IX claim; holding that even if District Court could have relinquished State law claims, it did not abuse its discretion by retaining jurisdiction: District Court \u201cshould consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity\u201d). See also <em>RLTD Ry. Corp. </em>v. <em>Surface Transp. Bd., </em>166 F.3d 808, 814 (6th Cir. 1999) (stating that although surface transportation board [STB] loses jurisdiction when track is no longer part of interstate rail network and, therefore, STB may not issue trail condition, STB may exercise jurisdiction if it determines that \u201cover-riding interests of interstate commerce require\u201d it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">This case illustrates the point. In FY 2003 and FY 2005 through FY 2007, the commissioner determined that Bell Atlantic Mobile was entitled to the corporate utility exemption, which meant that the company\u2019s \u201cmachinery\u201d was exempt from local property tax. As previously discussed, however, in 2006 the board itself concluded that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not entitled to the corporate utility exemption. Nevertheless, under the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39, the board no longer has jurisdiction to entertain the claims by the assessors, made in their previously filed \u00a7 39 appeals, that all the personal property covered by the corporate utility exemption was subject to tax at the local level for the fiscal years in question. This result would create an unintended tax exemption for Bell Atlantic Mobile that is contrary to the purpose of \u00a7 39. <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. at 201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">For this reason, our decision in <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I </em>cannot be considered a final judgment on the merits of the issue currently before us. Nor should the board\u2019s 2006 decision be so considered. In that decision, the board indicated that it did not address other issues raised in the \u00a7 39 appeals because \u00a7 39 did not apply, but nowhere did the board address the scope of its jurisdiction under \u00a7 39. Insofar as the board concluded, in its 2008 decision, based on the 2006 decision, that the doctrines of res judicata, issue preclusion, and collateral estoppel required dismissal of the Newton assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeals for the fiscal years other than 2004, we disagree. For any of these doctrines to apply, a final judgment on the merits is necessary. See <em>Anusavice </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Dentistry, </em>451 Mass. 786, 798 n.16 (2008); <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>444 Mass. 837, 843 (2005); <em>Treglia </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>430 Mass. 237, 240-241 (1999). We therefore reject Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s reliance on this alternative basis for the board\u2019s dismissal of the Newton assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeals, as well as its attempt to extend the purported preclusion to the other assessors currently before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Newton assessors\u2019 December 30, 2008, notice of appeal includes the dismissal of its FY 2004 \u00a7 39 appeal as one of the matters being appealed. The board addressed the Newton assessors\u2019 \u00a7 39 appeal relating to FY 2004 in its 2006 decision, and entered judgment in Newton\u2019s favor. Bell Atlantic Mobile argues that the Newton assessors are not entitled to have their FY 2004 appeal revived for consideration by the board on remand from this case, because the Newton assessors did not file an appeal from the board\u2019s 2006 decision. The argument is not without merit, but in the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude that it should be rejected. The board\u2019s 2006 decision appeared on its face to represent a favorable disposition for the Newton assessors; it was not until its 2008 decision that the board interpreted that favorable disposition in 2006 to have adverse consequences for Newton. For several reasons, including that judgment entered in the Newton assessors\u2019 favor on their \u00a7 39 appeal for FY 2004; that the Newton assessors could not have foreseen the jurisdictional implications that the board in 2008 determined were embedded in its 2006 decision within the thirty-day timeline for filing appeals; that after <em>Bell Atl. Mobile I </em>was decided, the Newton assessors did not abandon their FY 2004 \u00a7 39 appeal but rather sought to keep it alive by moving to consolidate it with Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s still-pending \u00a7 65 appeals; and that the Newton assessors\u2019 timely filings with regard to its other \u00a7 39 appeals indicate that Newton took all available actions to seek relief, we think the circumstances surrounding the Newton assessors\u2019 FY 2004 \u00a7 39 appeal are exceptional and operate to excuse their failure to file a timely appeal from the 2006 decision. See <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 187, 190 (2007) (failure to file appeal timely typically absolute bar to plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain judicial review of final agency action, but rare exceptions exist). On remand, the board should consider Newton\u2019s \u00a7 39 petition for FY 2004 as if it had been timely appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
