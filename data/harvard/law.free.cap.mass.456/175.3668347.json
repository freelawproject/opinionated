See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm a Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling that such claims are subject to the medical malpractice tribunal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">1. <em>Facts and procedural background. </em>Because the plaintiff appeals from an interlocutory order to convene a malpractice tribunal, the Superior Court has not yet made findings of fact. Thus, we summarize the facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Beginning in March, 2003, the four defendant physicians treated Jane Berghold for dizziness and lightheadedness. She experienced these symptoms up to four times daily, including while driving. She suffered also from diabetes, stroke with lingering congestive heart failure, and hypertension. The four defendant physicians prescribed her various medications and modified the prescriptions she received from other physicians. On October 15, 2007, Berg-hold lost control of her motor vehicle and drove into the Brock-ton Hospital building, crushing to death Mark Vasa, an employee of Brockton Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Vasa\u2019s widow, acting individually and as executrix of Vasa\u2019s estate, sued Berghold in the Superior Court, eventually settling those claims. The plaintiff then amended her complaint to add Compass Medical, P.C. (Compass), and Compass\u2019s employees, the four treating physicians, as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The amended complaint alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that the medications they prescribed, alone or in conjunction with Berghold\u2019s age and existing illnesses, were likely to impair her physical and mental abilities to operate a motor vehicle safely. Additionally, the amended complaint alleges that the defendants committed a breach of their duty to Berghold and the public by failing to advise Berghold not to drive. The complaint also contains claims for wrongful death and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The defendants answered the complaint and requested that a malpractice tribunal be convened. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>After initially denying the request, a judge in the Superior Court reconsidered his earlier ruling and allowed the defendants\u2019 request for a malpractice tribunal. The plaintiff petitioned for interlocutory review, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, and a single justice of the Appeals Court allowed the petition. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiff contends that her claims are not subject to the malpractice tribunal requirement because the claims are based on \u201csimple negligence\u201d rather than \u201cmedical malpractice.\u201d The plaintiff argues further that the medical malpractice tribunal statute is inapplicable absent a doctor-patient relationship between the plaintiff and defendant. We conclude that, because the claims are related to the medical treatment the defendants provided to Berghold, they are subject to the malpractice tribunal requirement of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Although the medical malpractice tribunal statute does not define an \u201caction for malpractice, error or mistake,\u201d see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, our case law has defined the phrase broadly to encompass \u201call treatment-related claims.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 576 (1978). Under this interpretation, the statute is not limited to cases alleging that a health care provider\u2019s treatment fell below the required standard of care. See <em>Lubanes </em>v. <em>George, </em>386 Mass. 320, 325 (1982) (performing surgery without consent is treatment-related and subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B); <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>377 Mass. 514, 517-518 (1979) (action for breach of contract to produce specific medical result is subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We have held that a claim that a physician failed to warn a patient of the risks associated with a course of medical treatment falls within the medical malpractice tribunal statute. See <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 154-155 (1982). Doctors have a duty to inform patients of available options for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>medical treatment and the material risks that each option entails. See <em>id. </em>This duty ensures that patients can make informed decisions regarding their health care. See <em>id. </em>at 155. Providing such information is not related to whether the treatment itself is performed competently, but it is a treatment-related medical activity. Similarly, warning patients of symptoms that they are reasonably likely to experience as a result of medical treatment, and that will render unsafe everyday activities such as driving, is a treatment-related medical activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The claims in this case are within the competence of a malpractice tribunal because they involve medical judgment exercised by the defendant physicians. In deciding what warnings to give about the side effects of medical treatment, a physician must consider \u201cthe history and needs of [the] patients and the qualities of the [treatment].\u201d See <em>Cottam </em>v. <em>CVS Pharmacy, </em>436 Mass. 316, 321 (2002). Thus, a decision regarding what warnings, if any, to provide patients about the side effects of particular drugs involves a medical judgment by a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Subjecting the claims here to a malpractice tribunal is also consistent with the purposes of the medical malpractice tribunal statute, to \u201censure the continued availability of medical malpractice insurance at a reasonable cost.\u201d <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood Hosp., </em>373 Mass. 645, 647 (1977). The screening process \u201cdiscourage[s] frivolous claims whose defense would tend to increase [medical malpractice insurance] premium charges.\u201d <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 655 n.4 (1977). The malpractice tribunal accomplishes this goal by reviewing \u201cthe medical aspects of the claim for the purpose of distinguishing between cases of tortious malpractice and those involving \u2018merely an unfortunate medical result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 521, quoting G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. Where medical judgment or competence is at issue, the malpractice tribunal, which includes a health care provider in the defendant\u2019s field, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, possesses expertise to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for the matter to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The plaintiff contends that <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Laboratory Corp. of Am., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 816 (2006), stands for the proposition that a physician\u2019s failure to provide warnings to a patient is \u201csimple negligence\u201d ancillary to the provision of medical care. Thus, she maintains, a claim based on such a failure to warn is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>beyond the scope of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. This argument is unavailing. In <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Laboratory Corp. of Am., supra </em>at 824, the Appeals Court held that an action against a laboratory for failing to communicate to the plaintiff\u2019s physician test results indicating a life-threatening condition was not subject to the damages cap applicable to malpractice actions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60H. The court did not address the applicability of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, to such an action. Moreover, in that case the reporting responsibility \u201clay with [an] administrator . . . whose job functions required no special training or skill comparable to that of a physician or other licensed professional.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 821-822. Thus, unlike the case here, the error was not one involving medical judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The third-party nature of the plaintiffs claim does not remove it from the scope of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. The medical malpractice tribunal statute contains no language limiting its coverage to suits brought by recipients of medical treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Kim, </em>429 Mass. 130, 133 (1999), we held that a doctor-patient relationship is not a prerequisite to applying G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Kim, supra, </em>obstetricians treating a pregnant woman were unaware of blood test results revealing a dangerous level of antibodies in the mother\u2019s blood until two weeks after the test was conducted. <em>Id. </em>at 131. The child died shortly after birth and the parents sued the obstetricians, the obstetrical group, the medical center in which they operated, and the director of the laboratory that conducted the test. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs argued that because they did not have a doctor-patient relationship with the laboratory director, the medical malpractice tribunal statute did not apply and they could therefore proceed directly in Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>at 132. We explained that it is the defendant\u2019s status as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a health care provider, not the presence of a doctor-patient relationship, that triggers the statute. <em>Id. </em>Focusing on the status of the defendant as a health care provider is consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose \u201cthat there be expert screening of cases \u2018which directly implicate the professional judgment or competence of a provider.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-134, quoting <em>Lambley </em>v. <em>Kameny, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 282 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We conclude that the reasoning expressed in <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Kim, supra </em>at 132-134, applies equally to a case where a third party sues a medical provider over an injury caused by the provider\u2019s treatment of a patient. The identity of the plaintiff does not affect whether the defendant\u2019s medical judgment is at issue. It is the subject matter of the claim and the identity of the defendant that determine whether malpractice tribunal screening is required. See <em>id. </em>at 133-134. Here, the plaintiff\u2019s claims involve the medical treatment the defendants provided to Berghold. Accordingly, the claims are subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The plaintiff contends that our decision in <em>Coombes </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>450 Mass. 182 (2007) <em>(Coombes), </em>establishes that claims by a third party alleging that a health care provider failed to warn a patient about the dangers of driving a motor vehicle while taking prescription drugs are simple negligence claims that are exempt from G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. <em>Coombes </em>does not support this contention. <em>Coombes </em>stated that physicians owe a duty of care to third parties to warn patients of the effects of treatment in some circumstances. See <em>Coombes, supra </em>at 190 (Ireland, J., concurring), 200-201 (Greaney, J., concurring).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It did not address whether a claim by a third party that a physician committed a breach of the duty to warn a patient is subject to a malpractice tribunal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff relies on Justice Ireland\u2019s characteriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tian of such third-party claims as based in \u201cordinary\u201d negligence rather than medical malpractice. See <em>id. </em>at 186 (Ireland, J., concurring). Such reliance is unwarranted because, as stated, the language of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, as interpreted by our prior cases, makes clear that the medical malpractice tribunal statute applies broadly to all treatment-related claims. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s claims fall within the scope of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, because they involve medical treatment that the defendants provided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the plaintiff\u2019s claims are related to the defendants\u2019 medical treatment of Berghold, the claims are subject to the malpractice tribunal requirement of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. Accordingly, the Superior Court\u2019s order convening a malpractice tribunal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[e]very action for malpractice, error or mistake against a health care provider shall be heard by a tribunal. . . [to] determine if the evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In contrast, claims that involve health care providers\u2019 nonmedical activities are not subject to the requirements of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. See <em>Leininger </em>v. <em>Franklin Med. Ctr., </em>404 Mass. 245, 248 (1989) (claim that doctors did not follow requirements of commitment statute not subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, because it does not involve physicians\u2019 medical judgment); <em>Segal </em>v. <em>First Psychiatric Planners, Inc., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 713 (2007) (claim that hospital misled patient about terms of admission not subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 754 (1989), is misplaced. The plaintiff contends that our decision in that case limited G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, to suits brought by recipients of medical treatment. That case does not stand for so broad a proposition. It holds only that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, does not apply to suits brought by health care providers seeking indemnification from another health care provider. See <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 755-756. We did not address circumstances such as those present here, where the plaintiff alleges that a health care provider\u2019s substandard treatment of a third party violated a duty of care owed to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In <em>Coombes </em>v. <em>Florio, </em>450 Mass. 182 (2007), a majority of the court agreed that the plaintiff had stated a claim against the defendant physician for injuries that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s alleged negligent provision of medical treatment despite the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was not the defendant\u2019s patient. See <em>id. </em>at 184 (Ireland, J., concurring), 196 (Greaney, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s citation to the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hardee </em>v. <em>Bio-Medical Applications of S.C., Inc., </em>370 S.C. 511 (2006), is unavailing because that decision addresses only whether physicians owe third parties a duty to warn patients of the dangerous effects of treatment. See <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>516. Like <em>Coombes, </em>the opinion does not address whether such third-party claims are subject to a malpractice tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Midtown Community Mental Health Ctr. </em>v. <em>Estate of Gahl, </em>540 N.E.2d 1259 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989), is misplaced. The Indiana court, interpreting an Indiana statute different from the Massachusetts statute, concluded that claims by a third party alleging that a physician failed to warn the third party of a patient\u2019s dangerous propensities were not subject to a malpractice tribunal. See <em>id. </em>at 1262. That case has no applicability to the Massachusetts statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
