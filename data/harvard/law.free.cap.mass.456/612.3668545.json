Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255(1)(C) (West Supp. 2000),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not a \u201clike violation\u201d similar to any Massachusetts statute that requires such registration in the event of a conviction. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P. We reverse the ruling because we conclude that Maine\u2019s offense of unlawful sexual conduct is a \u201clike violation\u201d when compared to the Massachusetts crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Nonetheless, because of errors in the board\u2019s decision we remand the case to the board for new classification proceedings and for a determination whether Doe is entitled to funds for an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>1. <em>Factual background and procedural history. </em>We summarize the facts found by a hearing examiner after an evidentiary hearing, supplemented by undisputed facts from the record. In 2001, Doe pleaded guilty in Maine to one count of unlawful sexual conduct in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255(1)(C). He was sentenced to a term of three years in prison, of which all but six months was suspended, followed by three years of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2006, after he was released from prison, Doe moved to Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On learning of Doe\u2019s residence in the Commonwealth, the board notified him that he was required to register as a sex offender in Massachusetts. In a preliminary determination, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06 (2004), the board decided that Doe must register as a sex offender and classified him as a level three offender. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(c). </em>Following Doe\u2019s appeal and an evidentiary hearing before a hearing examiner, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a), </em>the board upheld the preliminary classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Doe sought judicial review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, arguing, inter alla, that the board lacked jurisdiction over him because the offense to which he pleaded guilty in Maine is not a \u201clike offense\u201d to any of the Massachusetts offenses that require registration as a sex offender. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P. A Superior Court judge agreed with Doe, allowed his motion for judgment on the pleadings, reversed the decision of the board, and declared that Doe need not register as a sex offender in Massachusetts. The board appealed, and we granted Doe\u2019s motion for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, an offender may seek judicial review of the board\u2019s final classification and registration requirements in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We reverse the board\u2019s decision if it was <em>\u201c(a) </em>[i]n violation of constitutional provisions\u201d; <em>\u201c(b) </em>[i]n excess of the statutory authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>or jurisdiction\u201d of the board; \u201c(c) [bjased upon an error of law\u201d; <em>\u201c(d) </em>[mjade upon unlawful procedure\u201d; <em>\u201c(e) </em>[unsupported by substantial evidence\u201d; <em>\u201c(f) </em>[u]nwarranted by facts found by the court . . . where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact\u201d; or <em>\u201c(g) </em>[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). In conducting our review, we \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the board. <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">3. <em>Whether Doe is a sex offender subject to the board\u2019s jurisdiction. A </em>sex offender is defined as a person who has been convicted of any violation of Massachusetts law enumerated as a sex offense in the sex offender registry law, as well as any \u201clike violation of the laws of another [jurisdiction].\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Any sex offender moving into the Commonwealth from another state must register with the board within two days. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(g).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">a. <em>Definition of \u201clike violation. \u201d </em>The board argues that the motion judge erred in determining that Doe\u2019s Maine conviction does not constitute a \u201clike violation\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. The sex offender registration statute does not define the term \u201clike violation,\u201d nor have we previously interpreted the \u201clike violation\u201d provision. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 82, cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 320 (2008), the Appeals Court addressed whether a conviction of the New York offense of sexual abuse in the third degree is a \u201clike violation\u201d similar to the Massachusetts offense of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen or older. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. The court defined a \u201clike violation\u201d as a crime that is \u201cthe same or nearly the same\u201d as a Massachusetts offense requiring registration. <em>Id. </em>at 87, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 166, 172 (2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 543 U.S. 462 (2005). In applying this definition, the court compared the definition of the New York offense with the definition of the Massachusetts offense and concluded that the essence of the two crimes was the same. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The Appeals Court analysis was correct. A \u201clike violation\u201d is a conviction in another jurisdiction of an offense of which the elements are the same or nearly the same as an offense requiring registration in Massachusetts. The elements of the offense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>another jurisdiction need not be precisely the same as the elements of a Massachusetts sex offense in order for it to constitute a \u201clike violation.\u201d In drafting the statute, the Legislature chose the word \u201clike\u201d rather than the word \u201cidentical\u201d to describe the required relationship between an offense from another jurisdiction and a Massachusetts sex offense. Where a statute does not define a term, we interpret it \u201cin accordance with its generally accepted plain meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Boucher, 438 Mass. 274, 276 (2002). Therefore, we consider the \u201clike violation\u201d requirement satisfied where it is shown that the proof necessary for the out-of-State conviction would also warrant a conviction of a Massachusetts offense for which registration is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">b. <em>Doe\u2019s Maine conviction of unlawful sexual contact. </em>General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 13B, prohibits \u201cindecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen.\u201d Any intentional touching that is \u201charmful or offensive\u201d and \u201ccommitted without justification or excuse\u201d constitutes battery, see Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7 2.21.1 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 1st Supp. 2003), and all battery includes assault. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983). An assault and battery is indecent if it is \u201cfundamentally offensive to contemporary standards of decency and moral values.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 757-758 (1995). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miozza, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 567, 570-571 (2006). The intentional, unjustified touching of the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, or pubic area of a female constitutes indecent assault and battery. <em>Id. </em>at 571. Accordingly, the elements of the Massachusetts crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen are an intentional touching (1) that is harmful or offensive and committed without justification or excuse; (2) that is indecent (i.e., that offends contemporary standards of decency and moral values); and (3) that is committed on a child under the age of fourteen. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 194 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Maine\u2019s unlawful sexual contact statute prohibits \u201cintentional!]] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 sexual contact\u201d with \u201c[an]other person, not the actor\u2019s spouse, [who] has not in fact attained the age of 14 years\u201d when the actor is \u201cat least 3 years older\u201d than the victim. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255(1)(C). Sexual contact is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>as \u201cany touching of the genitals or anus ... for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire or for the purpose of causing bodily injury or offensive physical contact.\u201d Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 251(1)(D) (West Supp. 2000). Thus, the elements of Maine\u2019s offense of unlawful sexual contact are an intentional touching (1) for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire or for the purpose of causing bodily injury or offensive physical contact; (2) of the genitals or anus; (3) of a person under the age of fourteen; (4) by a person at least three years older than the victim and not the victim\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The Superior Court judge decided that Doe\u2019s Maine conviction was not a \u201clike violation\u201d because the judge believed that the Massachusetts offense includes elements that are not required to prove the Maine offense. The judge concluded, in our view erroneously, that the Massachusetts statute requires that the Commonwealth prove two elements not required by the Maine statute: (1) that both an assault and a battery occurred, whereas in Maine the statute requires only the element of assault; and (2) the additional element that the crime was offensive to contemporary moral values.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We read the Maine statute as requiring proof of both an assault and a battery because it prohibits intentional touching. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255(1). The elements of the Maine offense of unlawful sexual contact and the Massachusetts offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen are essentially the same. Both crimes require that the touching be intentional and that the victim be under the age of fourteen. The two statutes differ only in the character of the prohibited touching. Massachusetts prohibits indecent touching (defined as any touching offensive to contemporary moral values) whereas Maine prohibits sexual contact (defined as the touching of the genitals or anus for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal, causing bodily injury, or causing offensive bodily contact). However, these differing statutory formulations prohibit essentially the same conduct. The intentional, unjustified touching of the genitals or anus is considered indecent under Massachusetts law, regardless of the actor\u2019s purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miozza, supra </em>at 571. Thus, any act that qualifies as sexual conduct under the Maine statute would qualify as indecent under the Massachusetts statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Admittedly, there are some differences between the two statutes. For example, it is possible that a person could engage in touching for an alternative purpose not listed in the Maine statute that would nonetheless qualify as indecent under Massachusetts law. Additionally, the Maine statute requires that the offender be at least three years older than the victim and not be married to the victim. We conclude that these slight differences in the elements of the crimes do not render the statutes dissimilar for the purposes of the \u201clike violation\u201d provision. As noted, the statutes need only be alike, not identical. Furthermore, where the elements differ, the Massachusetts statute prohibits more conduct than the Maine statute. An individual convicted under the Maine statute who committed the same act in Massachusetts could be convicted under the Massachusetts statute and thereafter would be subject to the requirement of sex offender registration in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">c. <em>Consideration of underlying conduct. </em>The board contends also that, in some circumstances, it may look beyond the elements of the out-of-State offense and consider the facts underlying the conviction to determine whether the offense constitutes a \u201clike violation.\u201d Doe argues that the board may not examine the facts underlying a conviction in order to determine whether a \u201clike violation\u201d occurred. We conclude that the board may not consider the facts underlying a conviction in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Although the registration statute is not a criminal statute, see <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 787-788 (2008), criminal penalties are authorized for sex offenders who fail to register within two days of moving to the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E <em>(g), </em>178H <em>(a). </em>Thus, it is essential to provide notice and clarity about whether registration is required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxim, </em>429 Mass. 287, 292 (1999). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 94-95 (Cohen, 1, concurring), cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 320 (2008). Because of the criminal penalties for failing to register, we apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d and resolve any ambiguities in the \u201clike violation\u201d provision against the board. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742-743 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The sex offender registry law requires registration for an enumerated set of offenses related to sexual conduct. See G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Because the registration requirement is defined in terms of offenses, the determination whether an offense from another jurisdiction is a \u201clike violation\u201d is defined also in terms of offenses and not conduct. The board cannot transform a crime that does not involve sexual conduct into a registerable offense by examining the acts underlying the conviction. It is not sufficient that the offender may have engaged in behavior that falls within one of the crimes listed in the registration statute, but was then convicted of a nonsexual crime. The offender must be convicted of a crime of which the elements are the same or nearly the same as one of the Usted Massachusetts offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Moreover, allowing the board to consider the acts underlying the conviction would be contrary to the obvious intent of the Legislature to treat sex offenses in the same manner regardless of where the offenses were committed. Furthermore, the defendant in the other State would not have notice that, by pleading guilty to a crime that does not require proof of sexual conduct, he or she would be required to register as a sex offender upon establishing residency in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Permitting an inquiry into the facts supporting a conviction in another jurisdiction could expand the registration requirement to include crimes beyond those that explicitly encompass sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The board argues that, in order to properly classify sex offenders, it must be permitted to consider the conduct forming the basis for convictions in other States. This argument is unavailing. Our holding today does not alter the evidence the board may consider when determining an offender\u2019s level of dangerousness. The board is permitted to consider the underlying facts of the prior conviction. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(b) </em>(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">4. <em>Validity of the regulations. </em>Doe claims that the board\u2019s regulations setting forth the risk factors used to classify sex offenders are invalid because they have not been updated since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>2002. Doe contends separately that the board\u2019s classification in his case is fatally flawed because the regulations contain no risk factor regarding age, notwithstanding that recent scientific research shows that the risk of sexual offense recidivism decreases as offenders grow older.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A plaintiff challenging the validity of regulations promulgated by an agency pursuant to its statutory authority faces a heavy burden to establish that those regulations are invalid. See <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 612 (1997). An agency has \u201ca wide range of discretion in establishing the parameters of its authority pursuant to the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 346 (2007), quoting <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 525 (1979). Regulations promulgated by an agency are valid unless they \u201c \u2018conflict with the statutes\u2019 . . . under which the agency operates.\u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 399, 411 (2008), quoting <em>Telles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>410 Mass. 560, 564 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The sex offender registry law requires the board to \u201cpromulgate guidelines for determining the level of risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public\u201d by sex offenders. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1). The statute sets forth, in detail, risk factors that the board must take into account in assessing an offender\u2019s dangerousness. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (a)-(l). The board has incorporated these and other risk factors in its regulations. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(l)-(24) (2002). The regulations state that they are based on the \u201cavailable literature\u201d regarding the risk factors enumerated in the statute, and in numerous instances, they cite specific scientific studies supporting the use of individual risk factors. See, e.g., 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(7) (citing Hanson, Predicting Relapse: A Meta-Analysis of Sexual Offender Recidivism Studies, 66 J. Consulting &amp; Clinical Psychol. 348 [1998]). They rely particularly on the work of several leading researchers in the field of sex offender recidivism. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>450 Mass. 229, 238 (2007) (general acceptance of theory in relevant scientific community is indicative of reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Although the board has not updated its regulations since 2002, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40, that fact by itself is of little significance. Doe has presented no specific research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>demonstrating that any particular factor currently included in the regulations is now considered unreliable within the scientific community. Doe does not suggest that any more recent research has established that any of the included risk factors are no longer relevant or reliable to a determination of the risk of re-offense. Nor, except as to the issue of age discussed below, does he point to any factor that he argues should be added.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We conclude, however, that the board erred in reaching a classification determination in this case without having considered the effect of Doe\u2019s age on his dangerousness and likelihood to reoffend. Doe was sixty-one at the time of the hearing. He presented evidence of numerous scientific and statistical studies, published during the last decade, that conclude that age is an important factor in determining the risk of recidivism and that such risk diminishes significantly as an offender ages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, Validity of Static-99 With Older Sexual Offenders, at 11-12 (2005) (finding that recidivism rate is lower for sex offenders who are older at the time of release); United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Sex Offenders Released From Prison in 1994, at 25 (2003) (sex offenders age forty-five and older rearrested for sex crimes at lower rate than younger offenders); Saari, Actuarial Risk Assessment With Elderly Sex Offenders: Should It Be Abandoned? Sex Offender L. Rep. 68, 75 (2002) (concluding that there is statistically significant support for proposition that older sex offenders recidivate at lower rates than other sex offenders). The authors of these studies, which were submitted by Doe to the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>examiner, include many of the same researchers on whom the board relied in developing the current regulations. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In addition, Doe argued before the hearing examiner and in his briefs that this research has shown that the risk of recidivism is significantly lower for offenders age sixty and over than for offenders younger than sixty. See Validity of Static-99 With Older Sexual Offenders, <em>supra </em>at 10 (\u201cThe average recidivism rates steadily declined from 14.8% in the offenders less than 40, to 8.8% for the offenders in their forties, 7.5% for offenders in their fifties, and 2.0% for offenders greater than 60\u201d). See also Wollert, Low Base Rates Limit Expert Certainty When Current Actuariais Are Used to Identify Sexually Violent Predators, 12 Psychol., Pub. Pol\u2019y, &amp; L. 56, 64, 70 (2006) (collecting and performing statistical analysis on ten other studies of 4,673 male sex offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The board does not dispute the accuracy or reliability of this research and does not cite any studies to the contrary. Rather, it justifies its decision not to consider age solely on the basis that age is not considered as a factor in its regulations. As stated, however, the publications that Doe cites are written by many of the same authorities on whom the board relies in its regulations. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40. The board\u2019s regulations state that the examiner is to be \u201cguided by the definitions, explanations, principles, and <em>authorities\u201d </em>contained in the board\u2019s regulations. See 803 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 1.22(3) (2002) (emphasis added). We note also that at least six other States have recognized the importance of age as a factor in classifying the dangerousness of sex offenders. See, e.g., Minn. Stat. \u00a7 244.052(3)(g)(6) (2008); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:7-8(b)(2) (West 2005); N.Y. Correction Law \u00a7 168-l(5)(a)(v), (5)(d) (McKinney 2003 and Supp. 2010); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9795.4(b)(3)(i) (West 2007 and Supp. 2009). See also Guidelines of the Idaho Sexual Offender Classification Board 3, 6-7 (2006); 13 130 025 Vt. Code R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.1, 4.2 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">There was substantial evidence presented at the hearing concerning the effect of age on recidivism. Because Doe was sixty-one at the time of the hearing, it was arbitrary and capricious for the board to classify Doe\u2019s \u201crisk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness,\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1), without considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>this evidence. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the board for new classification proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">5. <em>Errors in interpreting other regulations. </em>In addition to the question of his age, discussed <em>supra, </em>Doe contends that the board made several errors in interpreting and applying its existing regulations during Doe\u2019s classification proceeding. We \u201caccord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations considerable deference unless [it is] arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the regulations themselves.\u201d <em>Rasheed </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>446 Mass. 463, 476 (2006). In this case, the board committed three errors in interpreting its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">First, because Doe\u2019s classification hearing took place prior to our decision in <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764 (2008), the board concluded that Doe, an indigent, was not entitled to receive funds for an expert because the board did not intend to rely on an expert. This determination is error. In addition, the board misinterpreted its regulations concerning two additional risk factors: Doe\u2019s receipt of sex offender treatment and his acceptance of responsibility for his offense. We now consider each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">a. <em>Expert funds. </em>We agree with Doe that the board erred in denying his motion for funds for an expert solely on the ground that the board did not intend to rely on expert testimony. In classification proceedings before the board, \u201can indigent offender may . . . apply for and the board may grant payment of fees for an expert witness in any case where the board . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>intends to rely on the testimony or report of an expert witness prepared specifically for the purposes of the classification proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a). </em>Prior to our decision in <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra </em>at 770, the board interpreted this statute to permit an offender to obtain funds for an expert only if the board intended to present expert testimony. As it was the board\u2019s practice not to rely on expert testimony, indigent petitioners were unable to obtain these funds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We have now concluded that G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1), provides the board with discretion to allow funds for an expert in any classification hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 770-771. We determined that such an interpretation is consistent with the sex offender registration law\u2019s purpose of classifying offenders accurately on an individual basis based on risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness. <em>Id. </em>at 771-772. Moreover, our interpretation avoids grave doubts about the statute\u2019s constitutionality were it construed to permit funds for experts for indigent offenders only where the board intended to present expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 770-771.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The board argues that remand is unnecessary because Doe did not identify the specific reason why he was entitled to funds for an expert. It is true that a general motion for funds is insufficient and that the burden is on the offender to establish the reason why such funds are needed. <em>Id. </em>at 775. Because the hearing examiner\u2019s decision in Doe\u2019s case occurred before our decision in <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra, </em>Doe did not have the opportunity to present such reasons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As in that case, the record does not reflect an exercise of discretion by the hearing examiner. See <em>id. </em>at 775. Therefore, on remand the board must consider whether funds for an expert are necessary given the individual circumstances of Doe\u2019s case. See <em>id. </em>at 775.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">b. <em>Sex offender treatment. </em>Doe argues that the board erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>drawing a negative inference from the fact that he did not undergo sex offender treatment. We agree that the board\u2019s application of this risk factor was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Successful completion of sex offender treatment may be considered as reducing an offender\u2019s risk of reoffense. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(11). It is undisputed that Doe was not offered sex offender treatment while he was incarcerated, and that such treatment was not made a condition of his release. Although the board made no finding that treatment was required of or offered to Doe, it cited Doe\u2019s failure to benefit from sex offender treatment as \u201cconcerning\u201d and as supporting a determination that Doe was at high risk of reoffense. While the board may consider whether Doe obtained treatment as a factor that reduces his risk of reoffense, it may consider the failure to obtain treatment as an adverse factor only where evidence is presented that such treatment was \u201cavailable\u201d during incarceration, parole, or probation and the offender \u201crefused to participate\u201d in such treatment. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(17)-(18). On remand, the board may not draw a negative inference from the absence of sex offender treatment where such treatment was neither available nor required during Doe\u2019s incarceration, parole, or probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">c. <em>Failure to consider Doe\u2019s guilty plea. </em>Doe contends that the board erred in concluding that he denied responsibility for his offense. In making its classification, the board is required to consider \u201cwhether, or to what degree, the offender accepts responsibility that he committed his sex offenses.\u201d See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(13). Here, the board considered Doe\u2019s initial statement to Maine police officers denying that he committed the offense. However, the board did not consider the undisputed fact that Doe subsequently pleaded guilty to the offense. Doe\u2019s guilty plea, if credited as a genuine expression of accountability, is relevant to whether and to what extent Doe accepted responsibility for his crime. Guilty pleas may often be the product of an available lenient disposition, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 752, 758 (1994), and may not reflect a genuine acceptance of responsibility. Although it is up to the board to decide whether Doe\u2019s plea indicated an acceptance of responsibility, it was error to ignore the plea altogether. On remand, Doe\u2019s guilty plea should be weighed in determining whether he accepted responsibility for his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment that Doe is not subject to the board\u2019s jurisdiction is vacated. The case is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">At the time of Doe\u2019s conviction, the crime of unlawful sexual conduct was codified at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255(1)(C) (West Supp. 2000). After an amendment to the Maine statute, the offense is now codified at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 255-A(l)(E) (West 2006 and Supp. 2009). See Me. St. 2001, c. 383, \u00a7 23. We refer to the statute as it was codified at the time of Doe\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The hearing examiner found erroneously that Doe was sentenced to serve two years of probation following his release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In 2002, a Maine court issued a probation revocation warrant because Doe had left the State. He was arrested in 2005, and in 2006, he was ordered to serve fourteen months of the suspended portion of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">For example, pursuant to a plea agreement, a defendant charged with indecent assault and battery might plead guilty to simple assault and battery. Under Massachusetts law, this individual would not be required to register as a sex offender, even if his or her conduct would also have supported a conviction of indecent assault and battery. If the Sex Offender Registry Board (board) could consider underlying conduct, the board could require a defendant who accepted the same plea bargain in another jurisdiction to register as a sex offender because the facts underlying the crime would support a conviction of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Although the regulations were last updated in 2002, most of the research on which they rely was published in the late 1990s. The state of scientific understanding in the later part of the 1990s indicated that there was some correlation between age at release and the risk of recidivism, but that this correlation varied significantly between samples. See Thornton, Age and Sexual Recidivism: A Variable Connection, 18 Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, at 123 (2006). However, as indicated in studies submitted by Doe, \u201c[k]nowledge concerning sexual offender recidivism risk has advanced considerably during the past [ten] years.\u201d Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, Predictors of Sexual Recidivism: An Updated Meta-Analysis, at 1 (2004). By 2004, researchers had concluded that age had a substantial association with recidivism and that offenders over the age of fifty at release reoffended at half the rate of younger offenders. Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, Sex Offender Recidivism: A Simple Question, at 7 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Because this case will be before the board on remand, the board may wish to consider whether the risk factors set forth in its regulations, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40 (2002), should be modified to include an offender\u2019s age. The sex offender registry law mandates that the board promulgate guidelines to determine accurately \u201cthe level of [an offender\u2019s] risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness to the public.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1). Where, as here, scientific knowledge in a field is rapidly evolving, see An Act Relating to a Legislative Study of the Impact of Compliance with the Federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, S. 217, Vt. Leg., 2007-2008 Sess. (testimony of Jill S. Levenson on sex offense recidivism, risk assessment, and the Adam Walsh Act), the applicable standards may require more frequent modification in order to reflect accurately the current state of knowledge.
