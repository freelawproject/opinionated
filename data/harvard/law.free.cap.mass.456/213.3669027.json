A single justice in the county court, acting as a gatekeeper pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, allowed the defendant to proceed with this appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial to the extent that it presented that issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant, John Stote, was convicted in 1997 of murder in the first degree. After plenary review of the record, we affirmed the conviction and the denial of Stote\u2019s first motion for a new trial (first motion). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stote, </em>433 Mass. 19 (2000). Stote\u2019s attorney, William T. Walsh, Jr., represented him at trial, in connection with his first motion for a new trial, and on appeal. Represented by new counsel, Stote then filed a second motion for a new trial (second motion). In the second motion, Stote argued, inter alla, that Walsh engaged in intimate relationships with the trial prosecutor who represented the Commonwealth both at trial and on appeal, and with a different prosecutor in the appellate division of the same district attorney\u2019s office (ADA), that neither relationship was disclosed to Stote, and that these relationships gave rise to an actual conflict of interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. On Stote\u2019s petition filed pursuant to the gatekeeper provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, the single justice allowed Stote to raise the alleged conflict of interest arising from Walsh\u2019s relationship with the appellate division prosecutor. She otherwise denied the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Facts. </em>Ordinarily, we accord \u201c \u2018special deference to the factual findings\u2019 of a judge who ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial \u2018where, as here, the motion judge also presided at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, 185 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. 93, 103 (2004). Here, however, the judge denied the second motion based on the papers, ruling that the affidavits did not raise an issue warranting an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, in this case, the facts advanced at trial and the credibility of the witnesses who testified at trial \u2014 the key matters as to which we defer to the judge \u2014 are immaterial to the question whether Stote received the effective assistance of counsel on appeal. In these circumstances, we are in as good a position as the judge to assess the documentary record underlying his decision on the second motion. That record reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">While he was representing Stote, Walsh and the ADA attended a concert together in late March, 1999, and began dating, seeing each other on weekends, until approximately April, 2000. When this relationship began, Walsh had already prepared and filed Stote\u2019s first motion. During the course of Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA, the first motion was denied after a nonevidentiary hearing, and Walsh prepared and, possibly, filed Stote\u2019s appellate brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The relationship between Walsh and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ADA ended before the Commonwealth filed its appellate brief and before oral argument took place. In his own affidavit, Stote attests that the relationship was not disclosed to him and that if he had known of the relationship, he would not have had Walsh represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The affidavits of Walsh and the ADA reveal the following facts about the nature of their relationship. The ADA attests in her affidavit that she and Walsh did not live together at any time during their relationship. Walsh similarly attests that they lived separately. The ADA also states that she does not know whether the relationship was \u201cmonogamous.\u201d Although neither affidavit states whether the relationship was sexual, we can safely assume that it was, given that the relationship lasted more than one year, the participants were mature adults, neither of them has denied it, and the ADA\u2019s reference to a \u201cmonogamous\u201d relationship implies as much. The ADA further states that Walsh did not bring legal work to her home, did not to her knowledge receive telephone calls at her home regarding legal matters, and did not discuss Stote\u2019s case with her or disclose confidential information to her. She states that, while she and Walsh were seeing each other, they did not \u201csubstantively\u201d discuss their \u201crespective legal concerns\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that their work did not \u201coverlap in any respect.\u201d Although she was aware that Walsh was working on \u201can appellate brief,\u201d she did not know of its contents, and \u201ceven if\u201d she knew the defendant\u2019s name \u201cat that time,\u201d she did not know anything about Stote\u2019s case until she read our 2000 opinion, which was issued after the relationship ended. Walsh similarly attests that he did not discuss Stote\u2019s case or appeal with the ADA and that he did not disclose any confidential information to her. Shortly after the relationship ended, according to the ADA\u2019s affidavit, Walsh began living with another woman whom he later married.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The ADA\u2019s affidavit also indicates that she did not participate in the preparation of the Commonwealth\u2019s brief in Stote\u2019s appeal. The trial prosecutor, in her affidavit, attests that she alone wrote the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition to Stote\u2019s first motion and, later, the Commonwealth\u2019s appellate brief without the assistance of anyone in the district attorney\u2019s office, other than submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the brief to her superiors for approval. The trial prosecutor further states that she did not discuss any aspect of the Stote case with the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Although, in accordance with the single justice\u2019s decision, we do not consider whether Stote is entitled to a new trial due to any alleged conflict of interest arising from Walsh\u2019s previous relationship with the trial prosecutor, some facts concerning that relationship are relevant to our decision. In 1979 and 1980, Walsh and the trial prosecutor dated, but lived separately.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Their dating relationship ended amicably in 1980, some seventeen years before Stote\u2019s trial. Walsh and the trial prosecutor maintained a cordial and professional relationship thereafter. Both Walsh and the trial prosecutor eventually went on to marry others, in Walsh\u2019s case, as stated above, after his relationship with the ADA ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cAn element of the fundamental right to counsel under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is the defendant\u2019s right to the full and undivided loyalty of his attorney. A defendant is entitled to the untrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel free from any conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. 777, 780 (1978). Under art. 12, if a defendant establishes an actual conflict of interest, \u201che is entitled to a new trial without a further showing; he need not demonstrate that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance or resulted in actual prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>455 Mass. 811, 819 (2010), and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. 266, 272 (2000) <em>(Croken). </em>If a defendant can establish no actual conflict, but only a potential conflict of interest, \u201cthe conviction will not be reversed<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>upon a showing of material prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra </em>at 823. \u201cActual prejudice is measured against the standards in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), as in cases involving claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Croken, supra </em>at 272, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, supra </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">1. <em>Actual conflict. </em>\u201cAn \u2018actual\u2019 or \u2018genuine\u2019 conflict of interest arises where the \u2018independent professional judgment\u2019 of. . . counsel is impaired, either by his own interests, or by the interests of another client.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, supra </em>at 20. It is \u201cone in which prejudice is \u2018inherent in the situation,\u2019 such that no impartial observer could reasonably conclude that the attorney is able to serve the defendant with undivided loyalty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra </em>at 819-820, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Epsom, 399 </em>Mass. 254, 262 (1987). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove an actual conflict of interest by presenting \u201cdemonstrative proof detailing both the existence and the precise character of this alleged conflict of interest; we will not infer a conflict based on mere conjecture or speculation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Shraiar, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In pertinent part, the rules of professional conduct, which were in effect at the time of Stote\u2019s appeal and of Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA, provide: \u201cA lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client <em>or to a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, </em>unless (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and (2) the client consents after consultation\u201d (emphasis added). Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 (b), 426 Mass. 1330 (1998). Interpreting DR 5-101A, as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981), the predecessor to rule 1.7, we have said that \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s personal interests surely include his interest in maintaining amicable relations with his relatives, his spouse, and anyone with whom he is comparably intimate.\u201d <em>Croken, supra </em>at 273. Where a criminal defense lawyer \u201crepresents a client and a close relative or an intimate companion is a colleague of the prosecutor who seeks to convict the client, the requirements of the rule must be met.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Croken, </em>the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was in a long-term relationship with an attorney who was for a time an assistant district attorney and a colleague of the trial prosecutor. <em>Id. </em>at 270. The couple were in this relationship \u201c[f|or much if not all of\u201d the time that defense counsel represented the defendant and lived together for some of that time. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel\u2019s representation of the defendant lasted over three years, from the arraignment until the retention of appellate counsel. <em>Id. </em>The couple eventually married; the record before this court did not reveal exactly when the marriage took place. <em>Id. </em>at 271. While the defendant was aware that his trial counsel had a \u201cgirl friend,\u201d neither her name nor her occupation was disclosed to him. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the motion and affidavits submitted by the parties, which notably did not include affidavits from defense counsel or the assistant district attorney who later became his wife, were inadequate to establish that an actual conflict of interest existed. <em>Id. </em>The motion and affidavits <em>did, </em>however, raise \u201ca substantial question as to whether there was an actual conflict\u201d and demonstrated \u201csufficient basis for a reasonable belief that the core of the attorney-client relationship might have been impaired, and that some probing of the matter by way of an evidentiary hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. We remanded the matter to resolve the factual questions left open by the record, particularly concerning the extent to which defense counsel\u2019s then girl friend might have discussed the case with defense counsel or with the prosecutor, the extent to which she might have been exposed to confidential information, and the extent to which the relationship might have affected defense counsel\u2019s representation of the defendant. See <em>id. </em>at 275-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">If the fact of the relationship in <em>Croken, </em>which was serious enough to lead to cohabitation (during the representation), was not sufficient <em>standing alone </em>to establish an actual conflict of interest, the relationship between Walsh and the ADA <em>standing alone </em>is similarly not sufficient. Walsh and the ADA\u2019s yearlong relationship was surely more than a brief, casual affair, yet we cannot conclude that it was an intimate relationship similar to a marriage. Particularly as they did not live together, their relationship was not conducive to \u201cinadvertent breaches of confidentiality,\u201d as cohabitation or marriage is.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 274, quoting ABA Criminal Justice Section, Ethical Problems Facing the Criminal Defense Lawyer 248 (1995) (Ethical Problems) (noting potential for such breaches occasioned, e.g., by receiving telephone calls and messages at home, by working at home, or by explaining absence from home). Nor is there reason to believe that Walsh and the ADA developed a financial or personal interest in each other\u2019s careers, that is, that the ADA\u2019s professional advancement would have redounded to Walsh\u2019s benefit or vice versa. Cf. <em>Croken, supra, </em>quoting Ethical Problems, <em>supra </em>at 249 (\u201cdistrict attorney or public defender may have a special interest in the outcome of a case based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>concern for a promotion or political benefit for one\u2019s spouse\u201d). Because the ADA was <em>not </em>handling the Commonwealth\u2019s case on appeal, there is no reason to believe that the Commonwealth\u2019s success in that appeal could have resulted in any professional benefit for her. In other words, Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA gave him no incentive to provide less than fully vigorous representation of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Croken, supra </em>at 274-276, although we could not conclude on the papers that there was in fact an actual conflict, we did conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion and affidavits raised substantial questions that had not been adequately answered by the Commonwealth. Here, in contrast, the Commonwealth has provided evidence negating the existence of an actual conflict. Both Walsh and the ADA swear that no confidential information about Stote was disclosed, and there is nothing in the record to suggest otherwise. The ADA further swears that she had no involvement in the Commonwealth\u2019s side of Stote\u2019s appeal and knew nothing about the case until she read our opinion. This is corroborated by the trial prosecutor, who swears that she worked alone on the Commonwealth\u2019s brief and never discussed the case with the ADA. Walsh, the ADA, and the trial prosecutor, all officers of the court, bear a duty of candor toward the tribunal, see generally Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3, 426 Mass. 1383 (1998), and the consequences for presenting false or misleading evidence to the court are potentially very serious.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On this record, the judge properly concluded, without the need for an evidentiary hearing, that Walsh\u2019s representation of Stote was not impaired by his relationship with the ADA, that is, that there was no actual conflict of interest. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001) (\u201cjudge may rule ... on the basis of the facts alleged in the affidavits without further hearing if no substantial issue is raised by the motion or affidavits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">2. <em>Potential conflict. </em>\u201cWhere no actual or genuine conflict exists, an attorney\u2019s personal interests or obligations may still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>give rise to a \u2018potential\u2019 conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>379 Mass. 433, 437 (1979) (potential conflict of interest is one where \u2018a more tenuous conflict appears\u2019).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mosher, 455 Mass. 811, 823 (2010). The relationship between Walsh and the ADA certainly might have given rise to a potential conflict of interest, and should have been disclosed to Stote. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>An appellate lawyer in Walsh\u2019s position might well disclose confidential information or might otherwise allow his interest in the relationship to impair his professional judgment, for example, by withholding criticism of his intimate companion\u2019s colleagues or by failing to raise arguments that he would have pursued but for the relationship. Stote is not entitled to a new appeal, however, unless he establishes \u201c \u2018material prejudice\u2019 to his defense resulting from the alleged conflict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986). Because we evaluate the claim of material prejudice according to the standards for ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>Croken, supra </em>at 272, this entails a showing \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance fell \u2018measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u2019 and that this performance \u2018likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>450 Mass. 215, 221 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Stote has not made this showing. Stote argues on appeal that, because of Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA, Walsh failed to argue that he was burdened by a conflict of interest <em>at trial </em>arising from his previous intimate relationship with the trial prosecutor, depriving Stote of the effective assistance of appellate counsel. We disagree. First, the judge found that the intimate relationship between Walsh and the trial prosecutor had ended seventeen years before Stote\u2019s trial and gave rise to no actual conflict of interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, as to any potential conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>interest arising from Walsh\u2019s relationship with the trial prosecutor, the judge pointed out that Walsh \u201chad no hesitation whatsoever in lambasting [the trial prosecutor] for her alleged transgressions at trial\u201d and concluded that \u201cWalsh vigorously represented the defendant both at trial and on appeal.\u201d Much of our opinion in Stote\u2019s direct appeal is devoted to disposing of Walsh\u2019s charges concerning the trial prosecutor\u2019s conduct of the trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stote, </em>433 Mass. 19, 22-25, 27-29 (2000) (prosecutor\u2019s delay in disclosing potentially exculpatory evidence was not prejudicial; prosecutor did not mishandle evidence of victim\u2019s alleged involvement in organized crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Stote also argues that Walsh, as his trial counsel, deprived him of effective assistance due to various failures and omissions at trial, such as failing to investigate and develop certain evidence that would have supported Stote\u2019s defense. Due to the limited scope of review authorized by the gatekeeper, this claim is properly before us only to the extent that it might establish material prejudice arising from Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA. See notes 1 and 14, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, to obtain relief on this basis, Stote would have to show not only that the asserted failures at trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel (that is, that if these asserted failures had been raised in Stote\u2019s direct appeal, the conviction would have been reversed), but also that the relationship with the ADA was what prevented Walsh from raising such claims in the direct appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra </em>(defendant must show \u201c \u2018material prejudice\u2019 to his defense <em>resulting from </em>the alleged conflict\u201d [emphasis added]). Whatever the merits of the former element, Stote cannot establish the latter. Stote offers no reason to believe that, but for the relationship, Walsh would have raised these issues and thereby accused himself of ineffective assistance. Put another way, supposing that Walsh had <em>not </em>been involved in a relationship with the ADA or anyone else in the district attorney\u2019s office and that he was therefore under <em>no </em>potential conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>interest, he nonetheless would not have argued in the direct appeal that he deprived Stote of effective assistance at trial. In these circumstances, the relationship did not affect the arguments raised in Stote\u2019s direct appeal. Stote has not shown that any potential conflict of interest arising from his attorney\u2019s relationship with the ADA resulted in any material prejudice to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, there was neither an actual conflict of interest nor a potential conflict that resulted in material prejudice in Stote\u2019s appeal. We remind members of the bar of their professional obligation under rule 1.7 (b) to disclose to their clients any intimate personal relationship that might impair their ability to provide untrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel. See <em>Croken, supra </em>at 273. Even if an attorney reasonably believes that he or she can continue to represent the client vigorously, the attorney should err on the side of caution by disclosing the relevant facts, which need not include the name of the third person, and asking whether the client consents to the representation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This dispute could well have been avoided if Walsh had simply informed Stote of his relationship with a colleague of the prosecutor who sought affirmance of the conviction. Stote would then have had the opportunity either to give <em>informed </em>consent to the continued representation or to retain different appellate counsel, as Stote attests he would have done. The order denying Stote\u2019s second motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A single justice denied the defendant\u2019s request to appeal on his claim that a conflict of interest arose from defense counsel\u2019s intimate relationship with the trial prosecutor \u2014 it had ended seventeen years before the defendant\u2019s trial \u2014 and that defense counsel deprived him of effective assistance at trial in other respects. \u201c[T]he decision of the single justice, acting as a gatekeeper pursuant to G.

In any event, if true, that fact would not affect our conclusion for the reasons explained <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In this respect, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides broader protection than the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, under which, even where there is an actual conflict of interest, the defendant must establish that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[9]\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">9Walsh\u2019s relationship with the ADA could not have given rise to any conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of interest at trial because it did not begin until well after Stote was convicted. Stote\u2019s claim is one of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. If Stote established this, he would be entitled at this juncture to a new appeal, not to a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Once a defendant\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction of murder in the first degree has been reviewed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u201c[a]ny claim of ineffectiveness of counsel presented in a subsequent appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial, authorized by a single justice of this court, would not be tested under the \u00a7 33E standard but on the applicable constitutional standards, State and Federal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 n.l (1992). This is so even where, as here, trial counsel and appellate counsel were the same and the claim of ineffective assistance is therefore raised for the first time in a subsequent motion for postconviction relief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 162-163 &amp; n.10, 168 (2006) (in appeal authorized by gatekeeper, applying standard as set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 [1974], to ineffective assistance claim, where trial counsel represented defendant on direct appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Under our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, </em>432 Mass. 266, 273 (2000), Walsh was obligated to disclose to Stole his relationship with the ADA. It is undisputed that he did not do so. Stole thus did not have an opportunity to \u201cconsent\u00ed] after consultation.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 (b) (2), 426 Mass. 1330 (1998). We need not decide at what point Walsh became obligated to disclose the relationship to Stole, whom he had been representing for some time before his relationship with the ADA began.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In his brief, Stole makes much of the fact that Walsh\u2019s and the ADA\u2019s affidavits, as well as the judge\u2019s decision, do not state whether their relationship was sexual. Even assuming, as we do, that it was a sexual relationship, that fact alone would not establish that the relationship was an intimate relationship similar to a marriage. The \u201cunique problems\u201d created by such relationships, which we discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croken, supra </em>at 274-275, arise largely from the day-to-day practicalities of sharing a home, from the couple\u2019s mutual financial and personal interest in each other\u2019s success, in addition to the couple\u2019s emotional intimacy. A nonsexual cohabitation may give rise to many of the same problems as a marriage, while a brief, casual sexual relationship may give rise to few, if any, of them. The sexual nature of a relationship is, therefore, one factor to be considered in the case-by-case analysis whether a relationship gives rise to a conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The trial prosecutor\u2019s superior, the chief of the appellate division of the district attorney\u2019s office, submitted both the Commonwealth\u2019s opposition to the second motion and its current brief. Presumably, she was aware of the trial prosecutor\u2019s work on the brief in State\u2019s direct appeal and, as an officer of the court, would not have submitted the trial prosecutor\u2019s affidavit in its current form if she believed or knew the facts were other than as stated therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">As noted above, the single justice, as gatekeeper, did not allow Stote to pursue his appeal from the denial of the second motion to the extent that he argued that Walsh\u2019s relationship with the trial prosecutor gave rise to a conflict of interest. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>We therefore do not consider whether the judge erred in denying a new trial on that basis. Nevertheless, this does not prevent us from considering whether the omission of this alleged conflict from Stote\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>brief caused material prejudice to him in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">On a related point, Walsh\u2019s previous relationship with the trial prosecutor was not disclosed to Stote, and Stote attests that if it had been, he would not have had Walsh represent him. The prudent course of action would have been for Walsh to disclose that previous relationship and to give Stote the opportunity to consent or not to consent to the representation. We need not decide, however, whether Walsh was <em>obligated </em>to do so under rule 1.7 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">While the disclosure to the client need not state the name of the person with whom he or she is having or had a relationship, it should provide sufficient information to permit the client to make an <em>informed </em>decision such as the third party\u2019s employer and nature of employment (e.g., as lawyer, paralegal, administrative assistant), and the likelihood of involvement, if any, of the third party in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
