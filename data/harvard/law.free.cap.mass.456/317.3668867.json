After a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion for fees and costs under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, finding that \u201csubstantially all, if not all, of the pl\u00e1mtiffs\u2019 claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d A single justice of the Appeals Court vacated the award. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review. In addition, we granted the defendants\u2019 application for further appellate review of an order by a full panel of the Appeals Court denying the defendants\u2019 motion for appellate fees and costs under G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15, and Mass. R. A. P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979), arising out of the merits appeal of this case, <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (2008). We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous and insubstantial. Consequently, we reinstate the fees and costs awarded by the trial judge and we remand to the Appeals Court its decision so that it may exercise its discretion with respect to appellate fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>We draw the following from the findings of fact issued by the judge at the close of the trial. Those findings, having been described as \u201cfully supported in the record,\u201d and affirmed by the Appeals Court, <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, supra </em>at 503, are conclusive and \u201cunassailable\u201d in this context. <em>Danger Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>444 Mass. 1, 12 n.11 (2005) <em>(Danger Records).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">a. <em>The limited partnership. </em>In 1984, the defendants, Robert L. Wolff, Jr.; John P. Fowler; and Jeffrey A. Millman, established The Cambridge Company, Inc., for the purpose of engaging in the real estate business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Through The Cambridge Company, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>defendants identified properties to develop and created individual limited partnerships to acquire them. In 1985 they entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a commercial property located at 23 East Street in Cambridge, a former hot dog factory, which they planned to renovate and lease. Consistent with their business model, their plan was to form a limited partnership that would assume ownership and management of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Concurrent with their negotiations to purchase the 23 East Street property, the defendants entered lease negotiations with the plaintiffs, Ed Walter, Jack Saltiel, and Robert Fronk, who were the principals of Compumart Corporation. The plaintiffs were interested in leasing three floors of the building for their business operations. Over the course of the negotiations, the plaintiffs expressed interest in acquiring an ownership interest in the limited partnership. The defendants agreed, and in exchange for a fifteen-year lease and a $500,000 letter of credit to be used for project cost overruns, they entered into a limited partnership agreement with the plaintiffs creating the Maple East Associates Limited Partnership (MEALP). The defendants were the general partners of MEALP and held a sixty per cent interest in it. The plaintiffs were limited partners, possessing a forty per cent interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Throughout the negotiations, the defendants made it clear to the plaintiffs that they would continue to acquire other properties outside the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The partnership agreement included the following terms. Section 4 set out the limited purpose of MEALP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the partnership shall be (i) to acquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>approximately 32,268 square feet of land and the six story concrete building thereon located at 23 East Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts (the \u2018Property\u2019); (ii) to renovate such building in such manner as the General Partners shall determine (the \u2018Project\u2019); (in) to own, operate and manage the Project; and (iv) to lease, sell, acquire or otherwise deal with the Project and other real estate in such manner as the General Partners shall determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Section 5 authorized the defendants, as general partners, to acquire property in furtherance of MEALP\u2019s limited purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cIn furtherance of its purpose, <em>but subject to all other provisions of this </em>Agreement, the partnership is authorized to: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201c5.2 acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise any real or personal property which may be necessary, convenient or incidental to the accomplishment of the purposes of the partnership;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201c5.3 own, construct, operate, maintain, finance, improve, sell, convey, assign, mortgage or lease any real estate and any personal property necessary, convenient or incidental to the accomphshment of the purposes of the partnership\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Significantly, the defendants were not required to make such acquisitions, and the authorizations in \u00a7 5 explicitly were subject to other provisions in the partnership agreement. One of those provisions was \u00a7 13.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cIt is expressly understood that a General Partner may engage in any other business or investment, including the ownership of or investment in real estate and the operation and management of real estate, and neither the partnership nor any of the partners thereof shall have any rights in and to said businesses or investments, or the income or profits derived therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Therefore, although authorized to acquire real estate \u201cconvenient\u201d to the purpose of ME ALP, the defendants were also free to continue their separate real estate business.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Finally, \u00a7 12.5 of the partnership agreement anticipated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the defendants would use their respective skills to provide services to MEALP but required them to charge \u201cterms and conditions which [were] not materially less favorable to the partnership than the terms and conditions which would be available from unrelated parties,\u201d that is, market rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On the same day that MEALP was formed, the defendants obtained a $5.3 million mortgage on its behalf, guaranteeing the debt personally.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consistent with the partnership agreement, MEALP paid Fowler\u2019s firm for its role in securing the mortgage. The fees paid were \u201cin accordance with industry standards.\u201d MEALP also paid fees to Millman for his services as architect and project manager. Again, the fees were market rate. Pursuant to its fifteen-year lease with MEALP, the plaintiffs\u2019 company moved into 23 East Street in January, 1986. However, in December, 1986, the plaintiffs\u2019 company went bankrupt and defaulted on its lease. It vacated the building in 1987.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The default cost MEALP hundreds of thousands of dollars. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs remained limited partners in MEALP.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendants continued to manage MEALP over the next decade, saving it from failure several times and successfully refinancing the property to reduce the debt burden by approximately $1.5 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MEALP paid fees to entities related to the defendants for various necessary services over this time, all of which were at or below market rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Separately, the defendants also continued to grow their real estate portfolio. In 1994, they created a new investment partnership to acquire two warehouse-type buildings at 9 East Street in Cambridge, and in 1997 they acquired another warehouse at 1 East Street, again through the creation of a separate investment partnership. The defendants did not invite the plaintiffs to participate in either of these ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In 1998, the defendants were approached by Charles E. Smith Residential Realty LP (Smith), a publicly traded real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>investment trust that was interested in purchasing the defendants\u2019 properties at 1 and 9 East Street. Smith had no interest in MEALP\u2019s 23 East Street property, but the defendants insisted the property be included.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Smith agreed to purchase all three properties for $28 million, which included an $8 million price for 23 East Street, not accounting for the debt on the property. This was an \u201cextremely favorable\u201d price.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a consequence, the plaintiffs \u2014 who parted with nothing to acquire their partnership interests in MEALP and who contributed no time, energy, or capital toward the management of its property \u2014 collectively received $921,600 as a result of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">b. <em>Complaint and trial. </em>Notwithstanding the apparently favorable outcome, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and misrepresentation, misappropriation of business opportunity, and restitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge organized the contentions in the complaint into three categories. The first category consisted of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the defendants denied them an opportunity to participate in the 1 and 9 East Street properties (business opportunity claim). In support of this claim, the plaintiffs asserted that the defendants were required to afford them the opportunity both under the terms of the partnership agreement and in accordance with their fiduciary duties as general partners. The second category included the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the defendants had charged MEALP excessive fees during their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>management of the property (related party transactions claim). The third category consisted of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the defendants had materially undervalued 23 East Street in the sale to Smith (valuation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">After a jury-waived trial, the judge found in favor of the defendants on all three claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With respect to the business opportunity claim, the judge concluded it could stand on neither of its two legs. First, she found that the defendants did not commit a breach of the partnership agreement because it clearly permitted the defendants to pursue other real estate business opportunities without the plaintiffs. Second, she found that the defendants did not violate their fiduciary duty with respect to such opportunities because the parties had shaped that duty in the terms of the partnership agreement and, regardless, the purchase of 1 and 9 East Street properties was not a business opportunity of MEALP because it was not related to the limited purpose of the partnership. See <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc., </em>323 Mass. 187, 198 (1948) (\u201cacquisition of the property must be . . . within the corporate purpose\u201d); <em>Haseotes </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>284 F.3d 216, 228 (1st Cir. 2002), citing <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc., supra </em>(\u201cNormally, a corporate opportunity is thought of as a business or investment opportunity within the sphere of, or somehow related to, the corporation\u2019s own activities\u201d). The judge further found that because the business opportunity in question, had it existed, would have belonged to MEALP and not the limited partners, the claim could only have been brought derivatively on behalf of the partnership, not on behalf of the limited partners themselves. See <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Field, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 625, 629 (1996). With regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 related party transactions claim, the judge found that all the fees were reasonable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, the plaintiffs stipulated that they would offer no evidence that most of the fees charged by defendant Fowler were unreasonable, and as for the rest of the fees, the plaintiffs offered no evidence that they were not market rate. Finally, the judge concluded that the valuation of 23 East Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>was reasonable, both in light of the defendants\u2019 affirmative evidence and the complete failure by the plaintiffs to contradict it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">c. <em>Direct appeal. </em>The plaintiffs appealed to a full panel of the Appeals Court, which affirmed the decision of the judge. <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (2008). The Appeals Court largely adopted the judge\u2019s reasoning with regard to the valuation and related party transactions claims. <em>Id. </em>at 511-512. On the business opportunity claim, however, the Appeals Court expanded the rationale supporting the judge\u2019s decision. Specifically, the court cited a recently decided case, <em>Chokel </em>v. <em>Genzyme Corp., </em>449 Mass. 272, 278 (2007) <em>(Chokel), </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 408 (1995) <em>(Blank), </em>for the proposition that parties may shape their fiduciary duties by the terms of a partnership agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, based on different cases but affirming the same proposition, the Appeals Court held that the partnership agreement explicitly freed the defendants from any fiduciary obligation to offer the 1 and 9 East Street properties to the partnership. <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, supra </em>at 507-508. The Appeals Court otherwise agreed with the judge that the 1 and 9 East Street properties were not related to the purpose of MEALP and that the defendants had not committed a breach of the partnership agreement\u2019s terms. <em>Id. </em>at 509-511. The court did not address the question whether the plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary business opportunity claim should have been brought derivatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">d. <em>Motions for fees and costs. </em>The defendants filed a motion for fees and costs at the close of trial, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion before the plaintiffs\u2019 direct appeal was heard by the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Section 6F authorizes an award of reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigation when \u201call or substantially all\u201d of the opposing party\u2019s claims are \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>and not advanced in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If the judge finds that the claims meet that standard, \u201cthe statute mandates the award of reasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses.\u201d <em>Masterpiece Kitchen &amp; Bath, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>425 Mass. 325, 330 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Here, the judge issued separate findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of her conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 entire case was insubstantial, frivolous, and not brought in good faith. In reaching that result, the judge recapitulated the total absence of evidentiary or legal support for the plaintiffs\u2019 case and concluded that it was \u201cwithout even a colorable basis in law.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517, 526 (1984). Under the terms of \u00a7 6F, the judge was therefore bound to award fees and costs. She ordered materials and briefing from the parties concerning the proper calculation of fees and costs, and then awarded the defendants $1,161,375.10 in attorney\u2019s fees and $69,546.16 in various costs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The plaintiffs directed their appeal of the \u00a7 6F award to a single justice of the Appeals Court as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The single justice stayed the award pending a review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 direct appeal. The appeal was decided on April 4, 2008, and we denied further appellate review.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The defendants also petitioned the Appeals Court for appellate fees and double costs in accordance with G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 15, and rule 25.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Unlike awards under \u00a7 6F, the Appeals Court has considerable discretion over when to award appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>fees and costs, even if it concludes that the appeal was frivolous.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Masterpiece Kitchen &amp; Bath, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 329-330; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 455 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On December 16, 2008, both a panel of the Appeals Court and the single justice determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 business opportunity claim was not frivolous and therefore that awards under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 15, were not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We begin with our review of the decision of the single justice vacating the judge\u2019s award of fees and costs under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. We then proceed to review the decision denying appellate fees and costs by the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">2. <em>Award under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. </em>General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6G, vests the single justice with considerable leeway when reviewing the award or denial of \u00a7 6F fees and costs. The statute states that the single justice \u201cshall review the finding and award, if any, appealed from as if [he] were initially deciding the matter, and may withdraw or amend any finding or reduce or rescind any award when in [his] judgment the facts so warrant.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G. \u201c[T]he review is thus de nova in the sense that the single justice may draw his or her own ultimate conclusions as to the merits of a fee award,\u201d although the single justice is bound by \u201cthe subsidiary facts as found by the trial judge\u201d in her \u00a7 6F <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>decision unless they are without basis. <em>Danger Records, supra </em>at 9, quoting <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 881, 882 (1981). See <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>403 Mass. 332, 337-338 (1988). In order to accomplish the statute\u2019s goal of a \u201cspeedy decision,\u201d the single justice considers an abbreviated record made up of the lower court\u2019s \u00a7 6F findings and award, as well as other \u201crelevant\u201d materials. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G. See <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, supra </em>(single justice not required to review entire record). In this case, for example, the single justice reviewed the judge\u2019s \u00a7 6F findings of fact and her trial findings of fact, as well as relevant portions of the trial record and limited briefing by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Our review of a decision of the single justice made under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, is \u201cof extremely limited scope.\u201d <em>Danger Records, supra </em>at 11. In addition to the broad grant of authority to perform a de nova review, \u00a7 6G states that the decision of the single justice \u201cshall be final.\u201d While this does not divest this court or the Appeals Court from reviewing the decision further according to the rules of appellate procedure, see <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greyhound Real Estate Fin. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 289-290 (1996), it does require a reviewing court to treat the \u201cunderlying [\u00a7 6F] factual findings adopted and accepted by the single justice. . . as\u2018final\u2019and. . . not themselves subject to further review.\u201d <em>Danger Records, supra </em>at 12-13. Thus, we review the single justice\u2019s decision only for abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">b. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 business opportunity claim. </em>The single justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>reversed the award of fees in this case based on two conclusions of law. First, he determined that the language of the partnership agreement was sufficiently ambiguous as to give that aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 business opportunity claim a degree of foundation and therefore the breach of contract business opportunity claim was not frivolous. Specifically, the single justice concluded that the partnership agreement provision that authorized the defendants to make convenient acquisitions of real estate on behalf of MEALP clouded the meaning of the provisions that expressly authorized them to pursue separate real estate ventures and the provision that limited MEALP\u2019s purpose to the acquisition and management of a single property. Second, he concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary business opportunity claim, while unmeritorious, had been based on unsettled law, the uncertainty of which gave the plaintiffs a reasonable belief that their claim had a chance of success. Both conclusions were errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A claim is frivolous if there is an \u201cabsence of legal or factual basis for the claim,\u201d <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 267 (2007), and if the claim is \u201cwithout even a colorable basis in law.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517, 526 (1984). The proper vantage point for evaluating whether a claim is frivolous is from the time the claim was brought and over the course of the litigation. See <em>id. </em>In this case, both the breach of contract and fiduciary duty bases of the plaintiffs\u2019 business opportunity claim were frivolous from the inception of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We do not agree with the single justice that the plaintiffs adhered to a plausible interpretation of the partnership agreement. As the Appeals Court noted in its merits decision, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was based on a confined reading of the partnership agreement that emphasized the provisions authorizing acquisitions \u201cconvenient\u201d to the purpose of the partnership. See <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 509-510 (2008). See also <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>420 Mass. 178, 190 (1995), quoting <em>Boston Elevated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Ry. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Auth., </em>323 Mass. 562, 569 (1949) (\u201cNot only must due weight be accorded to the immediate context, but no part of the contract is to be disregarded\u201d). But the acquisition of three large warehouses (the 1 and 9 East Street properties) was not convenient to the purpose of MEALP. See <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc., </em>323 Mass. 187, 197-199 (1948); <em>Haseotes </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>284 F.3d 216, 228 (1st Cir. 2002). Nothing about the addition of three adjacent warehouses promoted the purpose of MEALP. Moreover, the defendants were not required to make convenient acquisitions; the partnership agreement merely authorized them to do so. The plaintiffs sought to transform a permissive grant of authority into a contractual requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Most important, however, was the fact that the plaintiffs were urging an interpretation that placed the utmost importance on a provision of the agreement that was explicitly <em>\u201csubject to </em>all other provisions\u201d of the agreement (emphasis added). One of those provisions was an express understanding that the defendants could engage in \u201cany other business or investment, including the ownership of or investment in real estate,\u201d and that \u201cneither the partnership <em>nor any of the partners thereof </em>shall have any rights\u201d in such businesses or investments (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Where the surrounding facts are not in dispute, the matter of contract interpretation presents a question of law. See <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 287 (2007); <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 755 (1973). Here, the language of the partnership agreement was wholly inconsistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 position that the agreement directed the defendants to pursue large, unrelated real estate purchases on behalf of the partnership. The agreement imposed no duty on the defendants to do any such thing. As the judge found, the plaintiffs\u2019 position was untenable and incredible from the start. The judge also found that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that they believed or could have believed that the defendants were required to do anything more than they did. These facts were grounded in the evidence adduced at trial or, more accurately, the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to adduce any evidence. There was no basis to withdraw or amend these findings under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, and the single justice committed an error of law in concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim had any basis in law or fact. As a matter of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>their business opportunity claim based on the language of the partnership agreement was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The same holds true for the single justice\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary claim was not frivolous because the law was not \u201cwell settled\u201d when the plaintiffs brought their claim in 2002. See <em>Pirie </em>v. <em>First Congregational Church, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 910 n.3 (1997); <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687-688 (1989). By his logic, it was not clear until 2007 that \u201c[wjhen a director\u2019s contested action falls entirely within the scope of a contract between the director and the shareholders, it is not subject to question under fiduciary duty principles\u201d but, rather, is governed by the terms of the contract. <em>Chokel, supra </em>at 278. He stated further that the application of this principle to contracts between general partners and limited partners in a limited partnership required an <em>extension </em>of <em>Chokel </em>informed by Delaware law. See <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, supra </em>at 507-508, citing <em>Sonet </em>v. <em>Timber Co. L.P., </em>722 A.2d 319, 322 (Del. Ch. 1998) (\u201cprinciples of contract preempt fiduciary principles where the parties to a limited partnership have made their intentions to do so plain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Without question, the decision of the Appeals Court in this case is the clearest statement to date in Massachusetts that the contours of fiduciary duties in a limited partnership are subject to contract. However, the proper inquiry with regard to the ftivolousness of the plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary business opportunity claim is whether the claim had a basis in law in 2002, that is, before <em>Chokel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Chokel </em>did not announce a new rule of law; rather, it affirmed a long-standing rule in Massachusetts that \u201c[wjhen a director\u2019s contested action falls entirely within the scope of a contract between the director and the shareholders, it is not subject to question under fiduciary duty principles.\u201d <em>Chokel, supra, </em>citing <em>Blank, supra </em>at 408. It relied on <em>Blank, supra, </em>which stated that fiduciary duties in a close corporation \u201cdo not arise when all the stockholders in advance enter into agreements concerning\u201d those duties. <em>Id. </em>(dealing with fiduciary duties with respect to rights on termination and stock purchase). That holding, in turn, had origins dating even earlier. In <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 578, 598 n.24 (1975) <em>(Donahue), </em>we said that stockholder duties to one another can be altered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>provisions in a close corporation\u2019s articles of organization, the corporate bylaws, or a stockholder agreement. Similarly, in <em>Evangelista </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 248-249 (1989), the Appeals Court said that \u201c[questions of good faith and loyalty do not arise when all the stockholders in advance enter into an agreement\u201d regarding those duties. It has likewise been clear for some time that the doctrine of the <em>Chokel, Blank, Evangelista, </em>and <em>Donahue </em>cases applies to limited partnerships. For example, <em>Blank </em>recalled that \u201ca close corporation resembles a partnership.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Donahue, supra </em>at 587. See <em>JRY Corp. </em>v. <em>LeRoux, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 166 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In determining that the plaintiffs\u2019 business opportunity claim was not frivolous, the single justice pointed to the rationale used by the full panel of the Appeals Court in rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the merits. Unsurprisingly, that decision made use of <em>Chokel, </em>our most recent articulation of the law on the subject in question. However, the Appeals Court also cited <em>Blank, </em>signaling its awareness of the underlying doctrine. Had we never decided <em>Chokel, </em>the Appeals Court would have had ample authority to hold against the plaintiffs. With respect to the proposition that the rule in <em>Blank </em>and <em>Chokel </em>applies to limited partnerships, the Appeals Court cited a Delaware case, <em>Sonet </em>v. <em>Timber Co. L.P., supra. </em>That proposition was also well founded in Massachusetts law. The law of corporations and the law of partnerships have evolved together. See <em>Blank, supra </em>at 408 (with regard to fiduciary duties, \u201ca close corporation resembles a partnership\u201d); <em>Partnership Equities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marten, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 48 (1982) (\u201cWe have remarked ... the affinity of purpose between the limited partnership and the business corporation. The status of a limited partner as analogous to that of a stockholder has not gone unnoted by courts and commentators. . . . It is appropriate, therefore, to look to cases involving stock subscriptions for assistance in measuring the extent of obligation of a subscriber to a limited partnership\u201d [citations omitted]). In 2002, a claim that asserted that the unambiguous terms of a partnership agreement had no bearing on the partners\u2019 fiduciary duties had no basis in the law of Massachusetts and was frivolous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>c. <em>Further consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. </em>We turn now to the question whether the remainder of the plaintiffs\u2019 case was wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not brought in good faith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6R Although the single justice limited his discussion to the language of the partnership agreement, we treat the remaining underlying facts found by the judge as final.

We conclude that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence in support of their allegations that the defendants overcharged MEALP for services or undervalued the 23 East Street property when they sold it. Indeed, they stipulated at trial that they had no evidence that many of the fees charged were unreasonable, and they joined a motion by the defendants to strike the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 only valuation expert after it was revealed that the expert knew his calculations were incorrect. Despite this paucity of support, the plaintiffs nevertheless pressed ahead with their claims.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Given the dearth of factual or legal support and the business savvy of the plaintiffs, the judge\u2019s findings that the plaintiffs brought frivolous, insubstantial claims in bad faith are supported by the record and consistent with our case law.

Section 6F marks an exception to this rule because there is no public policy against deterring frivolous suits such as these. Where, as here, parties lack the legal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>factual basis to commence or sustain an action, yet press ahead for reasons related only to obstinance or avarice, the prospect of reimbursing their harassed opponents should cause them to rethink their litigious venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Having confirmed that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were entirely insubstantial, frivolous, and brought in bad faith, an award is mandated.

Therefore we review the single justice\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion or other errors of law in light of the entire record submitted to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">There were two other independent reasons the plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary business opportunity claim was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">First, the 1 and 9 East Street properties were not related to the partnership\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>purpose; therefore, even apart from the other terms of the partnership agreement, there was no fiduciary duty to offer it to the partnership. <em>Haseotes </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>284 F.3d 216, 228 (1st Cir. 2002), citing <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc., </em>323 Mass. 187 (1948). The only relationship the warehouses on the other properties bore to 23 East Street was the potential expansion of parking. However, that end was met by the defendants\u2019 decision to lease extra parking at market rates. The acquisition of three entire warehouse properties just to obtain more parking cannot be said to be related to MEALP\u2019s purpose in a fiduciary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The second reason the plaintiffs\u2019 claim lacked merit was that it was not theirs to begin with. It should have been brought derivatively. General Laws c. 109, \u00a7 56, permits limited partners to bring a derivative action \u201cin the right of a limited partnership.\u201d See <em>Smyth </em>v. <em>Field, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 625, 629 (1996). In 1997, the Appeals Court stated that the derivative action right of a limited partnership is \u201cindistinguishable from the parallel right of a stockholder to bring a derivative action.\u201d <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>Rocky Mountain I Invs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 447 (1997), citing G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 46. Thus, \u201ca limited partnership is an entity in whose \u2018right,\u2019 and for whose benefit an action may be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was well-settled in 2002 that a derivative action was available to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Moreover, it was clear that the plaintiffs were <em>required </em>to file a derivative claim. Partners in a limited partnership owe each other a duty of utmost good faith and loyalty, and they may sue each other individually to enforce that duty. See <em>JRY Corp. </em>v. <em>LeRoux, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 166 (1984); <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 578, 580-584, 592-597 (1975) <em>(Donahue). </em>However, individual suits are not always available. When the alleged wrong committed by a partner harms the partnership rather than another partner individually, the appropriate approach is to file a derivative claim. See <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>385 Mass. 806, 806-807, 809-810 (1982) (stockholder derivative suits).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">If a business opportunity related to the purposes of a partnership belongs to anyone, it belongs to the partnership, not the individual partners. See <em>id.; Partnership Equities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marten, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 50 (1982); <em>Cain </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 473-474 (1975), citing <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608, 617 (1962). The availability of suits on behalf of individual partners (or stockholders) is premised on the difficulty of proving harm to the partnership (or corporation) as a whole because only one or a handful of partners have been harmed. See <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, supra </em>at 809, citing <em>Donahue, supra </em>at 578. That difficulty is not present when, as in this case, the general partners are alleged to have absconded with property related to the purpose of the partnership. See <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Bessette, supra </em>at 809-810; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stuhlfire, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 925 (1990), quoting J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 23.1.1, at 127 (1975) (\u201c[T]he wrong underlying a derivative action is <em>indirect, </em>at least as to the shareholders. It adversely affects them merely as they are the owners of the corporate stock; only the corporation itself suffers the direct wrong . . .\u201d [emphasis original]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In deciding the defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cThere is simply no way to look at this case to conclude that the General Partners had the obligation to the Limited Partners to offer them, as individuals, the opportunity to invest in adjacent property. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201cIn addition, the beginning of the case is not the only time that the plaintiffs should have evaluated their position. They lost their motion for a preliminary injunction requesting an order that the defendants pay the proceeds of the sale of the properties into court. (Again, [the presiding judge] found that the plaintiffs had <em>no </em>likelihood of success on the merits.) They lost their bid for a summary judgment. [The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney] put in his affidavit that the motion had been brought principally to test the viability of the claim of loss of business opportunity. By the close of discovery, I can conclude only that they had found nothing to support their claim that the defendants had deprived them of a business opportunity or breached any fiduciary duty. There was nothing offered at trial other than their individual subjective beliefs that they were entitled to be offered the opportunity to participate in the purchase of 1 and 9 East Street. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The defendants argued that, in the event we affirmed the single justice with regard to the business opportunity claim, a partial award was still required because the rest of the claims were frivolous. We need not reach that argument today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
