The defendant requests that we reverse the murder conviction and grant him a new trial or reduce the verdict. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. For the reasons set out below, we affirm the conviction of murder in the first degree and discern no basis to exercise our powers under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the evidence as the jury could have found it, reserving certain facts for later discussion. In the late afternoon of June 21, 2002, the defendant was socializing with friends in the parking lot of a liquor store on Pleasant Street in Brockton. Many people, including children, were in the immediate vicinity. Nelly Corea had set up a chair in the store\u2019s parking lot to braid hair for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>At approximately 5:30 p.m. the victim drove a gray Jeep Cherokee automobile into the liquor store parking lot. On leaving his vehicle, he and the defendant resumed a running argument about another automobile that the defendant had purchased from the victim and his girl friend the previous month for $400. The defendant had paid $200 when he took possession of the vehicle, and the parties had agreed that the defendant would pay the remaining $200 within two weeks. The defendant never made the second payment. After the vehicle broke down a second time, the defendant abandoned it at a rest stop on Route 24. The two men had had several arguments about the matter before their encounter in the liquor store parking lot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Witnesses to the events of June 21 testified that the argument between the defendant and victim became heated. Corea, the hair stylist, testified that the two men were \u201cchest butting.\u201d Jose Davila testified that the victim was a large, muscular man known to be \u201c[v]cry aggressive,\u201d and that, during the argument, the victim called the defendant a \u201ccabr\u00f3n,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and otherwise showed him \u201cno respect.\u201d Davila testified that the defendant began \u201closing control\u201d and threatened the victim that \u201che would have to go back to Puerto Rico in a box\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if he did not leave the area. The defendant also told the victim that \u201che was going to pay him, he just wasn\u2019t going to pay him that day\u201d for the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The defendant then left the scene for some amount of time, which is disputed, but no more than fifteen minutes. See part 2, <em>infra. </em>The defendant later confessed to leaving the scene of the argument, walking from the parking lot to the comer of Warren Avenue and Pleasant Street, stopping at the intersection feeling \u201cmad and in fear for his family,\u201d and then returning to the parking lot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>During the defendant\u2019s absence, the victim had seated himself in Corea\u2019s chair to have his hair braided. Several people who had witnessed his argument with the defendant urged the victim to leave the scene, but the victim responded loudly that he was waiting for the defendant to return. While Corea was braiding the victim\u2019s hair, the defendant returned to the parking lot wielding a gun. According to Davila, \u201cEveryone was screaming.\u201d The defendant came within approximately five feet of the seated victim and shot him once, fatally, in the chest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">After the shooting, the defendant fled to Medina, New York, where the police eventually located him. On July 18, 2002, aided by New York State police, two detectives from the Brock-ton police department and two Massachusetts State troopers arrested the defendant at his father\u2019s house in Medina. After receiving Miranda warnings, the defendant agreed to speak with the officers. At first he denied all involvement in the shooting, but soon confessed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He told the officers that he had feared that the victim would harm his family, and that he should have turned himself in to the police. One trooper testified that when the defendant was asked why he would shoot someone in broad daylight in front of so many witnesses, he replied that the victim \u201cgot him so mad that he didn\u2019t care that people were around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The defendant was taken to the State police barracks in Albion, New York. Several hours later, his father and stepmother arrived at the police station and, in the presence of a New York State police investigator, the defendant described to them what had happened.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant described the dispute with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>victim over the purchase of the vehicle, and stated, as the trooper testified, that \u201c[t]he guy sat down to get his hair braided and that he went to the victim\u2019s car, retrieved the gun, came back and shot him one time in the chest with his own gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The defendant did not testify. His only witness was a forensic psychologist whose expert testimony we describe <em>infra. </em>We turn now to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">2. <em>Limit on cross-examination. </em>The defendant argues that his right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to confront his accusers<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was violated when the judge impermissibly restricted his cross-examination of Corea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>455 Mass. 840, 857-860 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 71 (1995) (\u201cBoth the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 guarantee a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him through cross-examination\u201d). The judge\u2019s ruling, which we conclude was proper, occurred in the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On direct examination Corea, testifying for the Commonwealth, stated that ten to fifteen minutes passed from the time the defendant left the scene to the time he returned with the gun, a point helpful to the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of premeditation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>448 Mass. 207, 216 n.7 (2007) (although no particular length of time is required to prove deliberate premeditation, prosecution must show that plan to kill was formed after deliberation and reflection). Corea\u2019s estimate was based on her experience as a hair stylist: she testified that a single braid down the middle of a person\u2019s head \u2014 the longest braid \u2014 took between five and ten minutes to complete, and that she had completed two side braids for the victim and had begun a third braid when the defendant reappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On cross-examination defense counsel sought to undercut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Corea\u2019s testimony by establishing that, in the time between the defendant\u2019s leaving the parking lot and his return, Corea had done substantially less braiding of the victim\u2019s hair and the defendant could not have been away for as long as Corea had estimated. In pursuing this line of questions, defense counsel introduced autopsy photographs purporting to show that the only braids that Corea had completed for the victim were small ones on one side of his head. Looking at the first autopsy photograph, Corea testified that she did not see evidence of any braiding she had done for the victim. She testified that the photograph of the victim in a second autopsy photograph did not \u201clook like him.\u201d When defense counsel attempted to show Corea a third autopsy photograph, the prosecutor objected. At sidebar, the judge ruled that no further autopsy photographs were to be shown to Corea because they were immaterial, \u201cupsetting\u201d to the witness, and not a fair representation of the deceased\u2019s hairstyle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A trial judge has broad discretion to limit cross-examination of a witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>439 Mass. 47, 55 (2003). In determining whether the limitation is impermissible, \u201cwe weigh the materiality of the witness\u2019s direct testimony and the degree of the restriction on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vardinski, </em>438 Mass. 444, 451 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, supra </em>at 72. Limiting counsel\u2019s use of \u201cinflammatory\u201d photographs on cross-examination may be particularly proper when disturbing visual evidence has minimal probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSouza, </em>428 Mass. 667, 670 (1999) (\u201cThe question whether the inflammatory quality of a photograph outweighs its probative value and precludes its admission is determined in the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Whether the defendant was absent for two, five, or ten minutes is immaterial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>434 Mass. 165, 168 (2001) (sufficient evidence of premeditation where after fistfight, defendant walked to nearby automobile, retrieved gun from trunk, turned and shot victim). Two eyewitnesses testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and the defendant stated in his confession that the defendant argued heatedly with the victim in the liquor store parking lot, left the scene, obtained a gun, then returned and shot the victim. \u201c[A] plan to murder may be formed in seconds.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Nor has the defendant met his burden of demonstrating that the judge\u2019s order limiting use of the autopsy photographs hampered the defendant\u2019s over-all trial strategy or his cross-examination of Corea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avalos, </em>454 Mass. 1, 7 (2009) (party challenging limitation on cross-examination bears burden of proving abuse of discretion). By thorough cross-examination of Corea, defense counsel impeached her direct testimony of the time the defendant was away from the parking lot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Casting doubt on Corea\u2019s original estimate of the duration of the defendant\u2019s absence was precisely what defense counsel set out to do, and did effectively. See <em>id. </em>at 8, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 154 (1993) (no abuse of discretion in limiting cross-examination where matter was \u201csufficiently aired\u201d at trial by other means). Cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318 (1974) (judge\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to cross-examine witness denied defendant ability to present theory of possible bias of witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We see no merit in the defendant\u2019s further claim that the judge\u2019s limitation on the use of autopsy photographs deprived him of \u201chard evidence\u201d to disprove Corea\u2019s testimony. The autopsy photographs bore no material relationship to Corea\u2019s testimony. Corea testified that the photographs did not accurately represent the victim or the braiding that she had completed for him. The judge in turn noted, and we agree, that the autopsy photographs \u201cdo not show his head very well\u201d and were not a \u201cfair representation\u201d of the victim\u2019s hairstyle. In any event, several autopsy photographs, including the two shown to Corea, were entered in evidence, allowing the jury to assess for themselves the relevance of the photographs to the issues in the case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">3. <em>Mental impairment jury instruction. </em>The defendant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that the judge\u2019s instruction on mental impairment created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the instruction failed to provide the jury with adequate guidance on how to evaluate the testimony of his expert psychologist as it pertained to premeditation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">A key point of the defense was that the defendant suffered from a mental illness and lacked the ability to form the requisite state of mind to sustain a conviction of murder based on premeditation. We summarize the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the killing. Dr. Ronald Ebert, a forensic psychologist, testified that, in his pretrial meetings with the defendant, he learned that the defendant had been hearing voices, had attempted suicide on two prior occasions, had experienced visual hallucinations, and had abused alcohol and marijuana. Dr. Ebert also testified that the defendant had sought treatment at a mental health facility on two occasions just prior to the shooting.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In Dr. Ebert\u2019s expert opinion, at the time of the shooting the defendant was suffering from a major depression with psychotic features, substance dependence, and an antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Ebert opined that the defendant\u2019s mental illness impaired his ability to form the specific intent for murder with premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The Commonwealth rebutted Dr. Ebert\u2019s testimony with the expert testimony of Dr. Russell Vasile, a forensic psychiatrist, who testified that he did not find sufficient evidence of major depression with psychotic features. According to Dr. Vasile, at the time of the shooting the defendant was in emotional turmoil, but no major mental illness impaired the defendant\u2019s capacity to form the requisite specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">At the beginning of her charge, the judge instructed the jury generally on inferences and circumstantial evidence, instructions that the defendant does not challenge. The judge later instructed the jury on mental impairment, following verbatim the model jury instructions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 61 (1999). Nevertheless, the defendant contends that, when the judge told the jury that they \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshould consider any credible evidence of mental impairment,\u201d her words gave \u201cno guidance\u201d to the jurors on how to evaluate the evidence of mental impairment as it pertained to premeditation; that the judge at this point in her instruction should have reinstructed the jury on inferences and circumstantial evidence; and that the instructions as given were consequently inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 805 (1996) <em>(Waite), </em>this court concluded that the jury need not make a specific finding of mental impairment in order to negate premeditation. Instead, evidence of intoxication or impairment \u201care mere subsidiary facts that the jury consider in sifting the circumstantial evidence as to [the defendant\u2019s] mental state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consideration of such subsidiary facts is \u201cpart of the subtle weighing process performed by the jury alone.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, 392 </em>Mass. 393, 405 (1984). Pointing to this language in <em>Waite, </em>the defendant argues that the judge should have instructed the jury that a \u201cperson\u2019s knowledge or intent is a matter of fact, which is often not susceptible of proof by direct evidence, so resort is frequently made to proof by inference from all the facts and circumstances developed at the trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that, where \u201cconflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \u2018it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilbome, </em>382 Mass. 241, 245 (1981), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amazeen, </em>375 Mass. 73, 81 (1978).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These statements, on which the defendant relies, reiterate well-established law that is consistent with the judge\u2019s general instructions. The defendant has pointed to no precedent, and we are aware of none, where a judge was required to repeat portions of the general instructions on the weighing of evidence when instructing on mental impairment. \u201cAll that we have ever required\u201d be said to juries about the effect of mental impairment on a defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge is \u201csatisfied by a simple instruction that the jury may consider credible evidence\u201d of the mental impairment \u201cin deciding whether the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving the defendant\u2019s state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 300 (1992) (concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>consumption of drugs or alcohol, not mental impairment).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such an instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">4. <em>Self-defense. </em>Although he did not object to the judge\u2019s instructions at trial, the defendant claims on appeal that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on self-defense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In making this argument the defendant points to the following testimony of Dr. Ebert:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201c[The defendant] said that the victim drove up in his car and threatened him. And he said again the victim asked for money. He asked for his money back. The victim threatened to kill him, called him names. ... He says he was frightened. He says the victim showed him a gun that he had and then called him a curse word in Spanish, that he became frightened and angry, and was frightened for his family. And he tells me he saw the victim put the gun into the victim\u2019s car. He says he grabbed the gun, went back, and then tells me two different stories; one in which the victim and he had an argument and a fight and the gun goes off accidentally. Another one in which he tells me that he ran back and shot the victim without elaboration. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cHe says to me in the first story that they scuffled, that the victim \u2014 at one point he says that the victim grabbed him by the shirt, that he punched him, that he punched the victim, so they got in some kind of altercation, by his report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">This evidence, the defendant argues, created the inference that the defendant was defending himself during a fight with the victim. The Commonwealth counters that the evidence of fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>by the defendant was insufficient to warrant an instruction on self-defense and that, in any event, evidence that the defendant failed to avail himself of an opportunity to retreat negated any conceivable claim of self-defense. We consider both points and conclude that the defendant was not entitled to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In considering the defendant\u2019s fear, we assume that there was a physical altercation between the defendant and the victim, and that the defendant feared the victim, who previously had threatened to kill him and to harm his family. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998) (\u201cno matter how incredible [the] testimony, that testimony must be treated as true\u201d in considering entitlement to self-defense instruction). Even starting from that premise, the record does not support an inference that, on returning to the parking lot, the defendant acted in actual and reasonable fear that he was in \u201cimminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980). There was no evidence that the victim was armed or that the defendant reasonably believed at the time that he was armed; to the contrary, the defendant testified that he took the victim\u2019s gun from the victim\u2019s car, suggesting that the defendant was armed and knew that the victim was not armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Second, the privilege to use self-defense arises only in circumstances in which the defendant uses all proper means to avoid physical combat. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>452 Mass. 212, 226 (2008). Here the record lacks any suggestion that the defendant availed himself of any means to retreat from the conflict before resorting to the use of deadly force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 769 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pasteur, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 820 (2006) (where \u201cthere is no evidence that the principal was not able to walk away, there is no basis for a claim of self-defense\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 399. The defendant was not detained at the scene against his will, and he was not compelled to return to the scene, much less to return with a loaded gun. The judge properly did not instruct the jury on self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>453 Mass. 266, 280 (2009) (self-defense instruction not required where defendant \u201chad access to an automobile; indeed, he entered the car to retrieve the weapon, but did not attempt to leave the scene\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>428 Mass. 614, 616 (1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(self-defense instruction not warranted where defendant had opportunity \u201cto retreat and did so, but only to return a few minutes later armed with a loaded handgun\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">5. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>After the jury were charged, the defendant requested a curative instruction for what he claimed was the prosecutor\u2019s repetitive \u201csmirks\u201d at the defendant\u2019s family during the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument; the request was denied. As the defendant recognizes, the request was untimely, and our review is limited to whether any failure of the judge to take action resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A prosecutor\u2019s nonverbal conduct may give rise to a claim of prejudice warranting the reversal of a verdict. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. Collins, 78 F.3d 1021, 1039 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 872 (1996) (laughter, gestures, and facial expressions by prosecutor may have been improper, but fell far short of reversible error). The judge made no finding that the prosecutor smirked or otherwise belittled the defendant or his family; rather, she dismissed the defendant\u2019s accusations as baseless. The judge was in the best position to see the prosecutor\u2019s demeanor during his closing argument, and there is no reason to disturb her conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">6. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Although not raised by the defendant, we consider whether a medical examiner\u2019s testimony at trial regarding the victim\u2019s autopsy violated the defendant\u2019s rights of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 because the autopsy had been undertaken by a different examiner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 387-396 (2008) (concerning testimony by medical examiner who did not perform autopsy); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goudreau, </em>422 Mass. 731, 732 (1996) (considering issues that defendant did not argue on appeal, but which require \u201cour attention pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">At trial, Dr. Mark Flomenbaum testified as to his opinion of the cause of death of the victim based on his review of the findings of an autopsy report conducted by Dr. James Weiner, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>well as on Dr. Flomenbaum\u2019s own education and his experience as a medical examiner. As we explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 388-391, the fact that a medical examiner\u2019s opinion is based \u201cin large part\u201d on findings made during the course of an autopsy that he did not perform \u201cdoes not infringe on [the defendant\u2019s] right to confrontation\u201d because the defendant has an opportunity to cross-examine the expert about his opinion and the underlying facts or data, \u201cincluding that [the expert] did not personally conduct the relevant tests and examinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Dr. Flomenbaum, however, also testified on direct examination to many of the specific findings made by Dr. Weiner in the autopsy report, including the manner in which the bullet penetrated the victim\u2019s forearm and then penetrated his chest, causing internal bleeding in the victim\u2019s chest, heart, and liver. This constituted testimonial hearsay and violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 391-394. The testimony should not have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, supra </em>at 763 (defendant\u2019s confrontation right violated by hearsay testimony of medical examiner about findings of another doctor\u2019s autopsy report).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The improperly admitted testimony did not, however, result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>Neither the cause of death nor any other aspect of the autopsy report was a central issue at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>454 Mass. 721, 733 (2009) (medical examiner\u2019s testimony admitted in error, but \u201csuch error was harmless where the cause of death was not a contested issue at trial\u201d). The defendant confessed to a State trooper that he shot the victim in the chest, and did not suggest otherwise at trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Having reviewed all aspects of the record in accordance with our obligations under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we discern no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in the defendant\u2019s murder conviction. The verdict is amply supported by the evidence and is consonant with justice.

L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a). We do not consider the effect, if any, of <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008), on the firearm conviction.

His confession was admitted through testimony of a State trooper. Before the jury heard this testimony and in her final jury instructions, the judge instructed that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession, and that the fact that the confession had not been tape recorded permitted, but did not compel, an inference that the confession was not voluntary.
