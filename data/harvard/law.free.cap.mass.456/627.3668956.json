Mahlowitz.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The underlying dispute in this bitter litigation arose when Mahlowitz, representing Rabinovitz\u2019s wife in her divorce action against Rabinovitz, obtained an attachment on her behalf in the Probate and Family Court on Rabinovitz\u2019s interest in property owned by Millennium. The attachment was secured after the wife discovered by happenstance that Rabinovitz was concealing from her the imminent sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The defendants made no attempt to dissolve or modify the attachment in the Probate and Family Court, despite ample opportunity and specific court rules permitting them to do so. Rather, eighteen months after the attachment had issued, and approximately one year after the attachment had been dissolved, Rabinovitz, Zoppo, and Millennium brought suit against Mahlowitz for abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and interference with contractual rights for obtaining the attachment. After failing to secure dismissal of the lawsuit, Mahlowitz counterclaimed against the defendants for abuse of process and malicious prosecution in connection with their suit against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">After an eight-day, jury-waived trial in the Superior Court on the defendants\u2019 abuse of process claim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on Mahlowitz\u2019s counterclaims, the judge ruled in favor of Mahlowitz both on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the claims of Millennium, Rabinovitz, and Zoppo against him, and on his counterclaims against them, awarding damages to Mahlowitz for the latter. She denied Mahlowitz\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 11, 365 Mass. 753 (1974), against Robert S. Sinsheimer, the attorney representing Rabinovitz, and Isaac H. Peres, the attorney representing both Zoppo and Millennium at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Appeals Court reversed the judgment in favor of Mahlowitz on his counterclaims; it otherwise affirmed the trial judge in all respects. <em>Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahlowitz, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (2008). None of the defendants sought further appellate review. We granted Mahlowitz\u2019s application for further appellate review on his counterclaims against the defendants, as well as the judge\u2019s order denying his request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion that the judge\u2019s findings were replete with error, we first conclude that the record supports Mahlowitz\u2019s claim of abuse of process against Rabinovitz.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the evidence, including the reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that the only motivation Rabinovitz had in bringing his lawsuit against Mahlowitz was to cause the removal of Mahlowitz as counsel for his wife in their divorce action. The judge also acted within proper bounds as a finder of fact in concluding that Zoppo and Millennium acted in concert with Rabinovitz to that same end. We thus affirm Mahlowitz\u2019s abuse of process claim against all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Mahlowitz\u2019s malicious prosecution claim is substantially similar to his abuse of process claim, and his damages under each are identical. Because we affirm the judgment on the abuse of process claim, we need not and do not reach Mahlowitz\u2019s malicious prosecution claim against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>As to damages, we conclude that the judge made errors in her evaluation of some aspects of the damages that require remand for recalculation of two discrete issues pertaining to damages alone. Last, we agree with the judge that Mahlowitz has not met his burden of proving that Peres and Sinsheimer acted in bad faith in representing the defendants in their claims against Mahlowitz, and that he is not entitled to sanctions against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We turn now to a summary of the facts salient to Mahlowitz\u2019s counterclaims against the defendants, the only issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We draw our factual summary from the findings of the judge, sitting without a jury, and the uncontested facts of record, all of which are supported by the trial record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reserve some details for later discussion where pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">a. <em>Millennium. </em>Millennium, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed in 2000 for the purpose of purchasing and developing a commercial property on Washington Street in the Brighton section of Boston (Washington Street property). Rabinovitz held at least a seventy-seven per cent ownership interest in the company. Zoppo was one of two additional shareholders, and Edward Stevenson was the other. The judge found that Rabinovitz \u201ccompletely controlled\u201d Millennium.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">By February of 2002, Millennium was in financial difficulties. At the urging of its mortgagee, which declared Millennium\u2019s loan obligations in default, Millennium agreed to put the Washington Street property up for sale. Around September, 2002, the mortgagee directed Millennium to accept an offer by Fargo Street Associates, Inc. (Fargo), to purchase the property for $1.65 million. For tax reasons, Fargo needed to complete the sale by December 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">b. <em>Rabinovitz divorce proceedings. </em>There was evidence at trial concerning Rabinovitz\u2019s conduct in the divorce proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ings against his wife. It was admitted as relevant to Rabinovitz\u2019s state of mind at the time he filed his abuse of process and other claims against Mahlowitz.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We summarize that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In April, 2002, Rabinovitz\u2019s wife filed a divorce action against him in the Probate and Family Court. Mahlowitz represented her in that action. From its inception, and throughout its course, the divorce and postdivorce litigation was acrimonious. A major source of conflict was Rabinovitz\u2019s lack of good faith concerning the disclosure of marital assets and issues of child support. In her findings in this action, the Superior Court judge included a comprehensive but not an \u201cexhaustive list\u201d of all of Rabinovitz\u2019s misrepresentations concerning the marital estate. She found, for example, that Rabinovitz was \u201cintentionally dishonest\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d in the information he provided in his financial statements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among other things, he understated his income, failed to divulge the actual value of certain real property even when that value was known or readily ascertainable by him, concealed assets, failed to comply with court orders, and otherwise attempted to deprive his wife of her fair share of the marital assets.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a consequence, the judge found, Mahlowitz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>was forced to bring multiple contempt actions against Rabinovitz, including for his failure to pay child support. Rabinovitz, she found, \u201cdid not like that his wife had a competent, zealous advocate,\u201d and \u201cespecially did not like\u201d the contempt complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Of particular relevance to this appeal, the judge found that Rabinovitz did not inform his wife that Millennium had agreed to sell the Washington Street property to Fargo for $1.65 million. Even after Millennium signed the purchase and sale agreement in November, 2002, and the sale was set to close in early December, Rabinovitz did not do so. He concealed the impending sale and sales price of the Washington Street property on his financial statements and interrogatories in the divorce action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge found that, notwithstanding Rule 411 of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court (2010) (automatic restraining order),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rabinovitz had \u201cno intention\u201d of notifying his wife or even his own divorce attorney about the potential sale of the Washington Street property, in which he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>substantial ownership interest, nor did he have any intention of placing in escrow any profits he might gain from the sale. At his deposition on December 5, 2002, Rabinovitz refused to produce a copy of the purchase and sale agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">c. <em>Attachment. </em>In late November, or early December, 2002, as negotiations between Fargo and Millennium proceeded \u2014 negotiations about which Mahlowitz and Rabinovitz\u2019s wife knew nothing \u2014 Stevenson, the third Millennium shareholder, became embroiled in litigation with Rabinovitz and Zoppo over shareholder distribution of the expected proceeds from the sale to Fargo. On December 2, 2002, in the midst of his own litigation against Rabinovitz, Stevenson, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201cdropped a dime\u201d by informing the wife about the impending sale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She notified Mahlowitz, who, until that time, had been under the impression that Rabinovitz\u2019s financial situation was \u201cbleak.\u201d On December 3, 2002, on behalf of his client, Mahlowitz sought from the Probate and Family Court an ex parte attachment on Rabinovitz\u2019s interest in the Washington Street property. At the ex parte hearing, a transcript of which was entered in evidence, Mahlowitz represented to the probate judge that he sought to attach only Rabinovitz\u2019s interest in the Washington Street property and had no intention of interfering with Millennium\u2019s sale of the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The probate judge allowed the motion. In accordance with Mahlowitz\u2019s representations to the judge, the attachment placed a lien not on Millennium, but on the \u201cright, title and interest to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>$500,000.00 of David I. Rabinovitz standing in the name of Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC.\u201d At the time the attachment was recorded, the Millennium shareholders had yet to resolve their infighting, and there was no firm date set for the closing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On Tuesday, December 3, Mahlowitz sent facsimile copies of the attachment and supporting documents to Rabinovitz\u2019s divorce counsel and to Millennium\u2019s real estate counsel, Peter Fenn. At Rabinovitz\u2019s deposition in the divorce case on Thursday, December 5, Rabinovitz stated that he had hired a bankruptcy attorney, Herbert S. Weinberg, to file a voluntary bankruptcy for Millennium in order to expedite and complete the sale of the Washington Street property. Rabinovitz did not ask that the attachment be removed or indicate that he would challenge it in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">However, the following day, December 6, Fenn sent a facsimile letter to Mahlowitz demanding that he voluntarily dissolve the attachment. Fenn stated that, if the attachment were not removed, he would appear in Probate and Family Court on Monday, December 9, to seek a dissolution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mahlowitz appeared in the Probate and Family Court at the requested time and waited for several hours. Fenn neither appeared nor notified Mahlowitz that he would not do so. None of the defense attorneys appeared that day or any at other time to request that the attachment be modified or dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Also on Monday, December 9, Weinberg sent a facsimile to Mahlowitz demanding that he voluntarily discharge the attachment. Mahlowitz declined to do so. The judge found that had Mahlowitz voluntarily agreed to dissolve the attachment, he would have committed a breach of his obligation to his client to secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>her claim to an equitable division of the marital assets and payments of any future support obligations. She concluded that obtaining the attachment was \u201creasonable\u201d in the circumstances confronting Mahlowitz and his client. She also found that Mahlowitz properly made use of the attachment to protect his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">d. <em>Bankruptcy proceedings. </em>On Thursday, December 12, Millennium voluntarily filed for bankruptcy protection. More than one week had passed, but there had been no effort to remove the attachment. As part of its bankruptcy filings, Weinberg submitted a petition to sell the Washington Street real estate \u201cfree and clear\u201d of liens. In that pleading, Weinberg advised the Bankruptcy Court that, with respect to the attachment obtained by Mahlowitz on Rabinovitz\u2019s share of any proceeds, \u201c[t]he debtor believes this attachment is of <em>no legal consequence </em>to Millennium because it is not against Millennium\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The record shows that Fargo, the original buyer, purchased the Washington Street property from the bankruptcy trustee on June 2, 2003, for $1.45 million, $200,000 less than the earlier contract price.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">e. <em>The defendants\u2019 suit against Mahlowitz. </em>In the spring of 2004, almost one year after the Washington Street property had been sold and the attachment had been dissolved \u2014 but in the midst of contentious postdivorce proceedings \u2014 Rabinovitz threatened his wife that she would need new counsel because he would be suing her lawyer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also told her that he intended to move to disqualify Mahlowitz from representing her. In May, 2004, with Rabinovitz and his now former wife still engaged in litigation in the Probate and Family Court, the defendants commenced an action against Mahlowitz in the Superior Court. As noted earlier, a judge in the Superior Court dismissed their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>malicious prosecution and contractual interference claims,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a judgment from which the defendants did not appeal. Their remaining abuse of process claim alleged that Mahlowitz abused process only by obtaining the attachment for the ulterior purpose of gaining leverage in the divorce negotiations. Rabinovitz, representing himself, subsequently moved in the Probate and Family Court to have Mahlowitz disqualified, arguing that his abuse of process action against Mahlowitz created a conflict of interest for Mahlowitz in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We now consider the defendants\u2019 challenge to the judgment in favor of Mahlowitz on his counterclaims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">2. <em>Abuse of process, </em>a. <em>Legal standard. </em>To sustain an abuse of process claim, the fact finder must find that process was used \u201cto accomplish some ulterior purpose for which it was not designed or intended, or which was not the legitimate purpose of the particular process employed.\u201d <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>345 Mass. 423, 426 (1963), quoting <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231, 236 (1949). The three elements of the cause of action are that \u201cprocess\u201d was used, for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose, resulting in damage. <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>437 Mass. 396, 407 (2002), quoting <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 760, 775-776 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The defendants do not claim that the judge applied an improper legal standard. Rather, the defendants\u2019 challenge is in most part an attack on the judge\u2019s factual findings on the \u201culterior or illegitimate purpose\u201d element of the claim. Stripped of circumlocution, the essence of their argument is that it was clearly erroneous for the judge to find that, when they filed suit against Mahlowitz for what they alleged was <em>his </em>illegitimate motive in obtaining the attachment, they were acting only with the illegitimate motive of having Mahlowitz disqualified from the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">To prevail on appeal on the basis of an assault on a judge\u2019s factual findings is no easy matter, for we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620 (1992). She had the opportunity to view the witnesses\u2019 demeanor, as well as to listen to their testimony. In this fact-intensive case, she was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to determine the facts. See <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977). We will uphold her findings unless we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, supra </em>at 620-621. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 510 (1997), quoting <em>T.L. Edwards, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>371 Mass. 895, 896 (1976) (\u201cwe do not \u2018review questions of fact found by the judge, where such findings are supported\u2019 on <em>any reasonable view of the evidence, </em>including all rational inferences of which it was susceptible\u201d [emphasis added]). \u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden to show that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., supra </em>at 509. It is not sufficient to challenge the judge\u2019s findings by reciting other evidence in the record that she may not have credited. Applying those settled standards, we consider in turn the judge\u2019s rulings as to each of the defendants on Mahlowitz\u2019s abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">b. <em>Rabinovitz. </em>The judge concluded that the \u201conly\u201d motivation Rabinovitz had for bringing the abuse of process action against Mahlowitz was his dislike of Mahlowitz\u2019s zealous representation of the wife and his desire to remove Mahlowitz as her divorce counsel. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Whether a person has grounds to bring a claim may of course be relevant in assessing whether he had an ulterior purpose. See <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 652 (1986) (\u201cThat the person commencing the litigation knew or had reason to know his claim was groundless is relevant, however, as tending to show that the process was used for an ulterior purpose\u201d). Here, Rabinovitz\u2019s abuse of process claim rests on, at best, thin ground. Rabinovitz argues that he had reason to believe at the time he filed suit against Mahlowitz that the attachment had prevented the sale of the Washington Street property to Fargo for $1.65 million in December, 2002.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This argument avails him nothing. First, his claim of monetary damages is most pertinent to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>dismissed claim for tortious interference with business relations, from which Rabinovitz did not appeal. It is also pertinent to the element of damages for abuse of process. On its own, however, it does not provide a sound basis for any contention that Mahlowitz had an ulterior or illegitimate motive in seeking and then not discharging the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">To the contrary, with respect to that essential element of his abuse of process claim, Rabinovitz claimed one, <em>and only one, </em>allegation of impermissible motive for obtaining and maintaining the attachment: that Mahlowitz was seeking leverage against Rabinovitz in the divorce action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Yet seven days of testimony and eighty-eight trial exhibits uncovered not one single instance in which Mahlowitz leveraged or attempted to leverage the attachment in the divorce action. Rabinovitz\u2019s appellate brief makes the leverage argument in terse, conclusory, and speculative fashion, without citing any support from the record. The judge found that no such evidence existed, and our own review of the record identifies none.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Rabinovitz is equally unpersuasive in his attempt to demonstrate that he had good reason to believe that the attachment, even if it was not actually used as \u201cextortion\u201d in the divorce proceeding, was obtained and maintained for that purpose. The unambiguous language of the attachment is narrow: it places a lien on Rabinovitz\u2019s interest only, and does not run against any other entity. Rabinovitz understood as much because, as noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>earlier, on December 12, 2002, Millennium\u2019s bankruptcy attorney represented to the Bankruptcy Court that the attachment was \u201cof no legal consequence\u201d to Millennium because it was not against Millennium.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rabinovitz is judicially estopped from now claiming that he believed in May, 2004, long after the property had been sold and the attachment dissolved, that Mahlowitz had placed an unlawful attachment on Millennium\u2019s property to obtain leverage in the divorce action. See <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>443 Mass. 634, 642 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">To be sure, the evidence indicates that Mahlowitz knew from communications with Rabinovitz\u2019s attorneys that the lien might cause Millennium problems with the sale, even if it had no \u201clegal consequence,\u201d as Weinberg had represented. But knowledge of this potential effect of the attachment does not prove that Mahlowitz obtained and maintained the attachment for the ulterior purpose of \u201ccoercing and extorting\u201d Rabinovitz to pay money to his wife. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>Encumbrances on property may make it difficult for property to be sold. That circumstance, without more, does not amount to an abuse of the attachment process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Rabinovitz and Millennium had separate experienced real estate, divorce, and bankruptcy counsel, presumably all protecting his and Millennium\u2019s interests. We may not ignore, as the trial judge did not ignore, that, had Rabinovitz in fact been concerned that the attachment was impeding the sale of the Washington Street property or that its purpose was to \u201cextort\u201d him to pay money to his wife, he had ample opportunity to remove the alleged roadblock by seeking a clarification, modification, or dissolution of the attachment in the Probate and Family Court. He did not do so. On the other hand, Rabinovitz\u2019s assets could have disappeared overnight, and Mahlowitz needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to ensure that his client\u2019s interests were protected, as he testified at trial. Rabinovitz did not offer to put any proceeds he received in escrow. Rabinovitz\u2019s suggestion that Mahlowitz should have dissolved the attachment without such assurances, and that his failure to do so is evidence of improper motives, essentially shifts the burden to Mahlowitz to accommodate Millennium\u2019s interest, rather than that of his client.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In addition to Rabinovitz\u2019s failure to produce any evidence of Mahlowitz\u2019s misuse of the attachment process in the divorce action, the judge found and the record demonstrates affirmatively that Rabinovitz brought his claim against Mahlowitz in order to disqualify him from representing his wife. Tellingly, Rabinovitz did not file the suit when the property was sold; almost one year elapsed during which Rabinovitz was subject to contempt actions as Mahlowitz vigorously represented the wife in the Probate and Family Court. Then, after filing the action in the Superior Court, Rabinovitz promptly filed a motion in the Probate and Family Court to disqualify Mahlowitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Rabinovitz takes the position that his continued pursuit of the Superior Court action for years after the disqualification motion had been denied demonstrates that he believed his suit had merit, and was not for an improper purpose. To the contrary, Rabinovitz\u2019s inattention to the abuse of process suit belies his claim of legitimate motive. The docket sheet reflects that after Rabinovitz was unsuccessful in his effort to disqualify Mahlo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>witz, the abuse of process suit lay dormant; Rabinovitz and the other defendants conducted no formal discovery, nor did they engage in any other substantive action to advance or develop their claims, except to defend against Mahlowitz\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Moreover, it is reasonable to infer that Rabinovitz maintained the suit because he thought it would appear suspicious if he voluntarily dismissed it soon after his disqualification motion had been denied, nor could he reasonably have done so once Mahlowitz filed his counterclaim in October, 2004. It is also reasonable to infer that Rabinovitz knew that, so long as his claim against Mahlowitz was pending, it would cause Mahlowitz expense and distress, as the judge found, thereby potentially interfering with Mahlowitz\u2019s ability to represent the wife vigorously, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Rabinovitz contends that the judge\u2019s finding that he wanted Mahlowitz out of his way was predicated on her erroneous belief that the sale of the Washington Street property, owned by Millennium and not himself individually, violated the automatic restraining order of the Probate and Family Court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s error concerning the reach of the automatic restraining order, he maintains, laid the groundwork for a raft of unsupportable inferences she drew: that Rabinovitz \u201cintentionally did not authorize any lawyer to go into court\u201d to seek to vacate the attachment because \u201che was concerned that he would then be found in contempt of the Probate and Family Court\u2019s Automatic Restraining Order, as he had not provided any notice to the Court or to his wife of the sale\u201d of the Washington Street property; that Rabinovitz \u201cespecially\u201d disliked Mahlowitz\u2019s practice of filing contempt petitions and that Rabinovitz therefore wanted to disqualify Mahlowitz from representing the wife in the divorce action. Even assuming Rabinovitz is correct that the impending and ultimate sale did not violate the automatic restraining order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>an issue we need not decide, the judge\u2019s findings are not undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Rabinovitz does not dispute, nor could he, that his interest in the Washington Street property was a marital asset. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 400 (1977) (\u201cA party\u2019s \u2018estate\u2019 by definition includes all property to which he holds title, however acquired. [General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34,] gives the judge discretion to assign to one spouse property of the other spouse whenever and however acquired\u201d). Automatic restraining order or not, Rabinovitz\u2019s concealment of marital assets in the divorce action was unlawful. Rabinovitz had every reason to be concerned that Mahlowitz would bring to the Probate and Family Court\u2019s attention any instance of financial deception Rabinovitz might have engaged in, including his failure to inform his wife or the judge of the sale of a property in which he had a significant ownership share, which would have been revealed had Rabinovitz moved to have the attachment lifted. Accordingly, we affirm the judge\u2019s finding that Rabinovitz abused process.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">c. <em>Zoppo and Millennium</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The judge attributed Rabinovitz\u2019s illegitimate motives to Zoppo, holding him jointly liable for abuse of process. Although a closer question, on review of the entire trial record we cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts. Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 510 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Zoppo\u2019s primary argument is that the evidence at trial demonstrated that he had a legitimate reason at the time he filed the abuse of process claim against Mahlowitz for believing that the attachment was wrong, and that it had injured him, as an owner of Millennium. In particular, he argues that he understood that the attachment had scuttled the imminent sale of the Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Street property, propelled Millennium into bankruptcy, and resulted in Fargo\u2019s buying the property at a reduced rate. This contention is essentially an argument that Zoppo believed that he was damaged by the attachment. Damages, however, are only one element of an abuse of process claim; even if damages are shown, Zoppo still needed to show that Mahlowitz acted with an illegitimate motive, the crux of an abuse of process claim. As we explained above with respect to Rabinovitz, there was nothing about Mahlowitz\u2019s obtaining an attachment on Rabinovitz\u2019s assets that could have given Zoppo sound reason to believe that Mahlowitz was acting to gain leverage in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The question remains, then, why Zoppo joined Rabinovitz in suing Mahlowitz for abuse of process. See <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 652 (1986). It could have been that Zoppo innocently, albeit mistakenly, believed that his abuse of process claim had merit. But given the weakness of the claim, the judge was not wrong to look to other evidence in the record suggesting that Zoppo had an ulterior motive. The judge determined, and the record supports, that Zoppo was \u201cbasically Mr. Rabinovitz\u2019s puppet for purposes of this case,\u201d and was motivated by \u201cthe financial dealings and relationship he has had with Mr. Rabinovitz over the years\u201d to assist Rabinovitz with gaining advantage in his divorce case by eliminating Mahlowitz.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Zoppo vigorously disputes these findings on appeal. However, when he had the opportunity to present his case to the judge, under oath, he declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Specifically, Zoppo did not testify at trial, and from this refusal the judge drew an adverse inference against him regarding his motives for bringing suit against Mahlowitz.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Zoppo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>argues that because there was no evidence against him presented by Mahlowitz\u2019s witnesses, he had no reason to testify, and the judge had no basis for drawing adverse inferences. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Silverstein, </em>323 Mass. 239, 240 (1948), quoting <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Pastorelli, </em>240 Mass. 104, 107 (1921) (no inference may be drawn from failure to testify until \u201ca case adversely affecting [the witness\u2019s] interests [has] been shown\u201d). He fails to recognize that evidence of his financial improprieties and his complicit relationship with Rabinovitz <em>was </em>admitted at trial and <em>was </em>evidence against him. Rabinovitz himself implicated Zoppo in his lawsuit by furnishing evidence of the partners\u2019 long-standing friendship and history of financial dealings and Zoppo\u2019s own misuse of Millennium\u2019s funds. Zoppo was present during the trial, and he heard the evidence against him. He was available to testify. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Indeed, Zoppo failed to take the stand even after the judge, in denying his counsel\u2019s motion for a directed verdict before closing arguments, explained that when taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Mahlowitz, she could find that Rabinovitz and Zoppo were in \u201ccahoots\u201d as to their lawsuit and otherwise brought the case without a reasonable basis. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 316 (1922) (\u201cIn the face of such accusations [of fraud], men commonly do not remain mute but voice their denial with earnestness, if they can do so with honesty. Culpability alone seals their lips\u201d). This strong message to Zoppo went unheeded. In such circumstances, the judge did not err in drawing a negative inference as to whether Zoppo abused process. Combining the evidence of Zoppo\u2019s close relationship with Rabinovitz, as well as his financial misdealings, with the negative inference drawn from Zoppo\u2019s failure to testify in the face of evidence against him, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">3. <em>Malicious prosecution. </em>The defendants also appeal from the judge\u2019s ruling against them on Mahlowitz\u2019s malicious prosecution claim. We need not reach this issue because in the circumstances of this case the judgment as to abuse of process standing alone sustains the award of damages, which we describe below. In actions for both abuse of process and for malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>prosecution, the law is \u201cmaliciously used for a purpose for which it is not intended,\u201d and the party injured is \u201callowed to recover all such damages as are the natural and probable consequences of the action complained of.\u201d <em>Malone </em>v. Belcher, 216 Mass. 209, 212 (1913) (discussing damages for abuse of process based on malicious attachment). See 2 D.B. Dobbs, Torts \u00a7 440, at 1241 (2001) (damages essentially same for malicious prosecution and abuse of process). Here, the judge\u2019s decision indicates that Mahlowitz suffered the same consequences from the suit regardless of whether it constituted an abuse or process or malicious prosecution. Either way, the wrongful action attacked Mahlowitz\u2019s integrity as an attorney and caused him personal and professional damages.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need only and do affirm on the abuse of process claim. We now address the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">4. <em>Damages. </em>The defendants challenge as factually and legally deficient the judge\u2019s damages award to Mahlowitz for (1) the costs of defending against the improper action; (2) the emotional harm he suffered; and (3) the harm to his reputation. Each of these items is a compensable category of damages for an abuse of process claim so long as the specific damages are affirmatively proved. See <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>Brockton Sav. Bank, </em>318 Mass. 66, 69 (1945) (denying claim for abuse of process because plaintiff failed to prove \u201cessential fact of damage\u201d); <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Belcher, supra </em>(compensation for \u201cinjury to business, reputation and feelings\u201d and \u201call such damages as are the natural and probable consequences of the action complained of\u201d available for abuse of process); R.W. Bishop, Prima Facie Case \u00a7 41.1 (5th ed. 2005). We review each category in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">a. <em>Costs incurred in defending suit. </em>The \u201cnatural and probable\u201d consequences of an abuse of process lawsuit include the costs incurred in successfully defending the charge. As such, fees for defending such a lawsuit are considered compensatory damages, not attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>American Velodur Metal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schinabeck, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 470 (1985) (in addition to emotional distress, plaintiff in abuse of process action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>could recover for \u201cthe necessity of incurring counsel fees to defend against the claim\u201d and the expenditure of plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctime in many consultations with counsel about the defense\u201d); 2 D.B. Dobbs, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 440, at 1242 (damages for misuse of civil process include \u201creasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred in defending the wrongful criminal or civil litigation\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Here, the judge found that, as a result of the \u201cwrongfully filed complaint,\u201d Mahlowitz spent his own time doing work on the case and incurred the cost of hiring Attorney John L. Mason to represent him. The defendants\u2019 arguments notwithstanding, the judge\u2019s theory of abuse of process damages was correct. We conclude that she erred, however, in not distinguishing between Mahlowitz\u2019s damages for defending the lawsuit, which are compensable, and the costs expended in prosecuting his own counterclaims, which are not. See <em>Technical Computer Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>844 P.2d 1249, 1256 (Colo. Ct. App. 1992), citing McCormick, Damages \u00a7 66 (1935) (\u201ca claimant in a malicious prosecution or abuse of process action can recover attorney fees incurred in defending against the prior wrongful litigation; however, under the general rule, he or she cannot recover attorney fees incurred in bringing the malicious prosecution or abuse of process action itself\u201d), 2 D.B. Dobbs, Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 440, at 1242 (recovery does not include counsel fees resulting from \u201cplaintiff\u2019s own counterclaims in the original suit\u201d). The judge should have based her award only on the costs necessary for Mahlowitz to defend against the claims of the defendants. Accordingly, we vacate the award of $151,653.30 in damages and remand for a rehearing and the possible recalculation of these damages. We order that the case be remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>to the same trial judge, given her familiarity with the case and the narrow issue for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">To avoid any misunderstanding, we add these comments. The judge found that Attorney Mason\u2019s fees in representing Mahlowitz were $55,859.55 and $5,793.75 in costs, for a total of $61,653.30. She expressly found his billable hours, charges, and rates to be \u201creasonable.\u201d We affirm the judge\u2019s finding that the billable rates and hours for Mason\u2019s legal work were reasonable. Therefore, on remand the judge need only determine the amount of time that Mason spent defending the defendants\u2019 suit against Mahlowitz, and adjust the award for this category of damages accordingly. As to Mahlowitz\u2019s own billable hourly rate and the hours he spent on the Millennium litigation, the judge credited his testimony that his billable hourly rate was $300, and that he had spent 300 hours on the Millennium matter. That finding is sound. The judge did not find explicitly that Mahlowitz\u2019s hourly rate was reasonable or that the number of hours spent was reasonable, as she had done with Mason. However, that is implicit in her award to Mahlowitz of damages of $90,000 for the time he spent on the litigation. Here too on remand the judge need only determine the amount of time that Mahlowitz spent <em>defending </em>the defendants\u2019 lawsuit against him, and adjust the award of damages accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">b. <em>Emotional distress. </em>The record fully supports that Mahlowitz suffered emotional distress as a result of the improper lawsuit. In particular, Mahlowitz offered potent testimony, constituting several dozen pages in the transcript, as to the effect of this lawsuit on his emotional state and on his personal and professional relationships. Mahlowitz testified that his distress began when his wife became distraught after discovering the court summons in their mailbox. From this point on, he became \u201c[ejxtremely\u201d upset each time an event was scheduled in the case. More disturbing to him was having to discuss the case with members of his family, several of whom are lawyers. The emotional pain of the case made it \u201cdifficult to communicate with clients\u201d and to \u201cmaintain focus and to adequately represent those who ask\u201d for help. He had difficulty sleeping. The fact that he had obtained a routine attachment in a divorce proceeding in order to protect his client and yet was subject to suit for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and interference with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>contractual relations only added to his already significant emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The defendants do not refute the evidence of Mahlowitz\u2019s emotional distress. Rather, they argue that the damages for emotional distress must be vacated because Mahlowitz made no showing of medical or psychiatric treatment. We disagree. A claim for abuse of process is distinguishable from an action for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, where physical manifestation of emotional distress is generally required as an element of the tort. See <em>American Velodur Metal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schinabeck, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 470 (1985); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 905 comment c (1979).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We have not required a showing of physical harm for damages resulting from abuse of process, and we decline to do so here. See, e.g., <em>American Velodur Metal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schinabeck, supra </em>(parties may recover for mental suffering, distress, and harassment if caused by abuse of process); <em>Titcomb </em>v. <em>Bay State Grocery Co., </em>254 Mass. 599, 601 (1926), citing <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>216 Mass. 209 (1913) (damages may be awarded for injury to \u201cfeelings\u201d in abuse of process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We do, however, conclude that there was there was error in the judge\u2019s calculation in the awarding of damages for emotional distress. The judge awarded Mahlowitz $150,000 in damages ($250 per day for 600 days) for emotional distress.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> She did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>not provide an explanation for why she determined that Mahlowitz should be awarded $250 dollars per day, or why 600 days was the appropriate measure of duration. We can identify nothing in the record that provides any certain explanation for her calculations. On remand, the judge shall explain her calculation of damages for emotional distress. By remanding this aspect of the case, we do not suggest that the basis of the judge\u2019s calculations is erroneous, but only that her findings do not explain the basis for her calculations. It may well be that her explanation will support both the $250 per day and the 600 days\u2019 duration, or the judge may adjust that award to reflect her written explanation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">c. <em>Reputation. </em>The defendants further argue that the judge erred in awarding Mahlowitz $250,000 for harm to his reputation based on the publicity about the suit in Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. We again discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We are in full accord with the judge\u2019s observation that \u201can attorney is not much more than his reputation and that once sullied it is very difficult ... to undo the tarnish.\u201d The judge found that several pieces published about the lawsuit in Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly \u201cdamaged Mr. Mahlowitz, both in the esteem with which he is held in the community of divorce lawyers and judges in the Probate Court.\u201d In particular, Mahlowitz testified that since the appearance of the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly items, he had not received any appointments from Probate and Family Court judges in Middlesex County, who had often appointed him in the past. This evidence alone is compelling: we cannot imagine a more damaging result for an attorney than the loss of his credibility on the part of judges before whom he routinely must appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The judge additionally found, and we agree, that the publications in Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly were a foreseeable consequence of the lawsuit, and that the adverse publicity against Mahlowitz was \u201corchestrated,\u201d at least in part, by Rabinovitz. Among the four items published in that newspaper, one was a letter to the editor from Rabinovitz that sharply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>criticized Mahlowitz\u2019s conduct as dishonest and suggested that he had lied to a judge in the Probate and Family Court. Although one article was arguably in favor of Mahlowitz \u2014 remarking that it was \u201cscary\u201d that lawyers could be sued for abuse of process when placing ordinary liens in the course of divorce proceedings \u2014 the judge\u2019s finding that the widespread publicity about the case in the legal community damaged Mahlowitz\u2019s reputation is well supported.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The defendants nevertheless assert that Mahlowitz cannot recover for harm to reputation because he did not prove \u201creal business loss\u201d or other pecuniary harm resulting from damage to his reputation. We do not discern authority for such a requirement in this context, nor have the defendants directed us to any relevant source. In the context of defamation, we have explained that actual injury is \u201cnot limited to out-of-pocket loss\u201d but instead includes \u201cimpairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 861 (1975). Here, Mahlowitz can recover for intangible harm to his reputation separate from and in addition to any loss of business or other pecuniary harm he may have suffered.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See <em>Titcomb </em>v. <em>Bay State Grocery Co., </em>supra; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Belcher, supra </em>at 212. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 681(b), (d) (1977) (stating that damages for unjustifiable civil proceedings include compensation for both specific pecuniary harm and harm to reputation); 2 D.B. Dobbs, Torts \u00a7 440, at 1242 (2001) (\u201cIntangible damages recoverable [for abuse of process] include damages for harm to reputation . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">5. <em>Sanctions pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 11. </em>There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>merit to Mahlowitz\u2019s contention that Attorney Peres, who represented Zoppo and Millennium, and Attorney Sinsheimer, who represented Rabinovitz, deliberately ignored the law and facts concerning their respective clients\u2019 abuse of process claims against Mahlowitz, in violation of rule 11 (a).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to find that either attorney had violated rule 11 (a). <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 417 (1998) (standard of review for rule 11 [a] determinations is abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A \u201cwilful violation\u201d of rule 11 (a) may subject an attorney to sanctions if an attorney has failed to show a \u201csubjective good faith belief\u201d that the pleading was supported in both fact and law. <em>Id. </em>at 415-416 (distinguishing subjective standard used in Massachusetts from objective standard embodied in amended Federal rule). A court, however, \u201cis expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the signer\u2019s conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading, motion, or other paper was submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418-419, quoting Advisory Committee Note to 1983 Revision to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, 97 F.R.D. 198 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In large part, Mahlowitz\u2019s appeal from the denial of sanctions rests on the wisdom of hindsight, in this case the eventual findings of the judge that the defendants\u2019 action was without merit. We are careful to differentiate between the attorneys\u2019 sworn statements and the defendants\u2019 improper motivations, recognizing that unless there is evidence to the contrary, a Ghent\u2019s improper motivation should not be imputed to his attorney. See <em>id. </em>at 418. We agree with the judge that such evidence is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Mahlowitz maintains that a more thorough investigation by the attorneys would have uncovered their clients\u2019 illegitimate motive in wanting to sue Mahlowitz. But the fact that the judge ultimately disbelieved Peres\u2019s and Sinsheimer\u2019s clients\u2019 testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>does not prove that Peres and Sinsheimer had reason to know that the testimony was less than accurate when it was proffered. The link between the clients\u2019 wrongful actions and their attorneys\u2019 knowledge of it is speculative. We also agree with the judge that the fact that Sinsheimer was retained after Mahlowitz\u2019s summary judgment motion on the defendants\u2019 claim had been denied supports a finding of subjective good faith on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgment in favor of Mahlowitz on his counterclaim for abuse of process against each of the defendants and hold that this judgment alone independently supports the judge\u2019s award of damages such that we need not reach the issue of malicious prosecution. We affirm the judge\u2019s award of damages, but limited to those damages related to the costs incurred by Mahlowitz in defending his claims against the defendants\u2019 lawsuit against him, and we remand for an explanation and, if necessary, a recalculation of damages related to emotional distress as described above. Lastly, we affirm the judge\u2019s denial of sanctions pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (a). The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings before the judge who presided at the trial, consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC (Millennium), and Joseph P.

We have reviewed the testimony in full and conclude that it was relevant to his state of mind at the time he filed the Superior Court action against Mahlowitz in May, 2004. In other words, the testimony was material to demonstrate that Rabinovitz used process \u201cfor an ulterior or illegitimate purpose,\u201d a necessary element of abuse of process. <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>437 Mass. 396, 407 (2002), quoting <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 760, 775-776 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Rule 401 (a) of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court (2010) requires the parties in a divorce action to file with the court and deliver to the other party \u201ca complete and accurate financial statement showing, insofar as possible, the assets, liabilities and current income and expenses of both parties and children involved in the case.\u201d The initial and any subsequent financial statement must \u201cbe signed by the party filing the same and shall be subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.\u201d Rule 401 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Among the judge\u2019s specific findings concerning Rabinovitz\u2019s conduct during the pendency of the divorce was that Rabinovitz misrepresented his assets in the financial statement he filed with the Probate and Family Court on March 5, 2003, which failed to report significant assets that he listed in a mortgage application he filed the following day with a bank. Rabinovitz also represented that a collection matter was of \u201cundetermined\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d value, when in fact he was being paid $3,000 each month for it. He also omitted other sources of income. Similarly, he wrote that the fair market value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>several of his properties was \u201cundetermined\u201d even when he had already entered agreements for the sale of such properties so that their value was readily ascertainable and known by him. Notwithstanding Rabinovitz\u2019s objections to these findings, they are well supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Because Rabinovitz and his wife had signed a stipulation allowing her to obtain her own appraisals of the properties and because he had disclosed the <em>existence </em>of such properties, Rabinovitz argues here that it fell to his wife to gather any evidence she needed as to the value of those assets. The rules of the Probate and Family Court, see, e.g., note 7, <em>supra, </em>require that Rabinovitz make full and honest disclosures. He was also required to respond to interrogatories about the value of his assets and income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">On September 12, 2002, Rabinovitz answered interrogatories in the divorce action indicating that the Washington Street property was valued at $1,485 million and that it was then in foreclosure. At the time, the property had been appraised for $1.52 million, and there had been an offer and agreement to sell the building for $1.65 million. The lender, while maintaining foreclosure as an option, was allowing the defendants time to sell the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The judge did not fault Rabinovitz\u2019s own divorce attorney for any of these failures to disclose. She found, rather, that Rabinovitz intentionally withheld information from his attorney about the sale of the Washington Street property, and that, when Rabinovitz filed his misleading answers to interrogatories in September, 2002, his divorce attorney knew \u201conly what Mr. Rabinovitz, in his deceitful way, told him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Rule 411 (a) (1) of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court (2010) provides, in relevant part: \u201cNeither party shall sell, transfer, encumber, conceal, assign, remove or in any way dispose of any property, real or personal, belonging to or acquired by, either party,\u201d with exceptions not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">It may be inferred that Stevenson would not have telephoned the wife but for the fact that he either knew or suspected that Rabinovitz was trying to conceal the sale of the Washington Street property from her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">One relevant portion of the ex parte hearing is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">The judge: \u201cSo what you are asking the court to do is attach just [Rabinovitz\u2019s] interest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">Mr. Mahlowitz: \u201cThat is correct, Your Honor.

Rabinovitz claimed at trial that neither he nor his attorneys (he did not specify who) had time to seek to have the attachment dissolved. The judge did not credit this testimony. In any event, an attachment can be challenged on short notice, sometimes within hours. See Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 4.1 (g) (2010) (providing opportunity for dissolution or modification of ex parte attachments on short notice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The judge found that the $200,000 price reduction \u201cwas caused by Millennium\u2019s loss of a tenant, that Fargo was able to buy the property on the date of the scheduled foreclosure auction, and because Fargo was not willing to pay what it had in 2002 as it had not been able to close for IRS 1031 tax benefits by December 31, 2002.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The record shows that there was a divorce settlement on March 5, 2003, but that Rabinovitz and his wife remained for some years engaged in contentious postdivorce litigation around monetary issues through, inter alla, contempt motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Rabinovitz argues that, because he had a reasonable belief that the sale was still pending on December 4, 2002, when the attachment was recorded, he had grounds for claiming that the attachment \u201ckilled the sale\u201d and that Mahlowitz was responsible for its demise. The judge found that the sale had \u201cfallen apart\u201d by Thanksgiving, 2002, and that the attachment did not derail the sale. She did not, however, make an explicit finding whether Rabinovitz <em>knew </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>sale had fallen through by Thanksgiving. He claims that certain testimony of Ada Wong, Fargo\u2019s principal, and testimony of Attorney Fenn that the judge excluded supported or would have supported his assertion that, when he filed suit against Mahlowitz, he believed in good faith that Millennium\u2019s interests had been harmed by the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Even if Rabinovitz is correct in his interpretation of Wong\u2019s testimony and in his claim of error in the exclusion of certain portions of Fenn\u2019s testimony, these circumstances would not have changed, and need not have changed, the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions that Rabinovitz filed a baseless abuse of process claim against Mahlowitz. As we explain <em>infra, </em>even if Rabinovitz suffered <em>damages </em>because of the attachment, that is not a sufficient basis for an abuse of process claim against Mahlowitz, which requires evidence of an ulterior motive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\">On the element of ulterior motive, the defendants\u2019 complaint alleged that \u201cMahlowitz caused the ex parte attachment against Millennium\u2019s property and refused to remove it <em>for the ulterior purpose of threatening, coercing and extorting Rabinovitz to pay Mrs. Rabinovitz money rather than to obtain security\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">At trial, bankruptcy counsel Herbert Weinberg testified, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201cProbate Court restraining orders are, in his experience, ignored/ disregarded by counsel in Bankruptcy Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The fact that the attachment was obtained, as Rabinovitz argues, at the \u201celeventh hour\u201d and was for an \u201cexcessive\u201d amount does not make out a case that the attachment was brought to coerce Rabinovitz to pay money to his wife. Such a motive is lacking when Mahlowitz reasonably believed the undisclosed sale was imminent and Rabinovitz refused to divulge details of the transaction, including the amount that Rabinovitz would receive as a seventy-seven per cent shareholder of the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The Appeals Court determined that Rabinovitz had \u201cample reason\u201d to believe that Mahlowitz obtained and maintained the attachment \u201cnot to secure assets for his client, but to gain negotiating leverage in the divorce case,\u201d a factual finding by the Appeals Court not consistent with the findings of the trial judge, and one with which we do not agree after carefully reviewing the record. <em>Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahlowitz, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 43 (2008). In support, the Appeals Court stated that Mahlowitz \u201crefused to limit the attachment to Rabinovitz\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. But the actual language of the attachment, Millennium\u2019s own admission to the Bankruptcy Court, and Mahlowitz\u2019s testimony at trial all demonstrate that the attachment was limited to Rabinovitz\u2019s interest. The Appeals Court noted that it did not \u201cintend to chill careful and appropriate use of attachment requests\u201d in domestic relations cases. <em>Id. </em>at 34 n.11. The holding that an attorney who places a routine attachment in the course of a divorce proceeding may properly be subject to an abuse of process action would in fact chill the practice, leaving a party in a divorce proceeding vulnerable to the tactics of spouses who seek improperly to conceal their marital assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">There is, of course, a legal distinction between the individual and the corporate entity. Here, Millennium was a closely held corporation that Rabinovitz \u201ccompletely\u201d controlled. In such circumstances, the distinction between the individual and the corporation may be narrower. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., 432 </em>Mass. 546, 555 (2000), citing <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 620 (1968) (\u201cThe doctrine of corporate disregard is an equitable tool that authorizes courts, in rare situations, to ignore corporate formalities, where such disregard is necessary to provide a meaningful remedy for injuries and to avoid injustice\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Millennium and Zoppo, in their joint brief on appeal, state that because Millennium has been liquidated in a bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, \u201cthere is little purpose in arguing here separately on its behalf, other than to say that the arguments put forward for Zoppo apply equally to it.\u201d We reject the arguments advanced on behalf of Zoppo, as we discuss <em>infra. </em>To the extent that they apply to Millennium, they are also unsuccessful. As to Millennium, the judge found that Rabinovitz exercised nearly total control and used the company for his own personal ends. Millennium does not contest these findings, which support the judge\u2019s conclusion that Millennium abused process against Mahlowitz. We discern no error as to Millennium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The judge found that Rabinovitz knew that Zoppo had been misusing Millennium\u2019s funds by treating them, without authorization, \u201cas his own personal piggy bank\u201d to pay for expenses of another business, to pay his personal income taxes, and to pay his personal attorney. Because Rabinovitz was aware of this misdealing, she concluded that Rabinovitz had Zoppo \u201cover a barrel,\u201d and Zoppo needed to maintain his relationship with Rabinovitz as a matter of * \u2018 self-preservation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In her decision issued on May 16, 2006, the judge noted that Zoppo did not testify at trial, but did not explicitly state that she was drawing a negative inference against him for his failure to do so. On Zoppo\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge clarified that she had drawn an adverse inference from Zoppo\u2019s failure to take the stand when in fact he was available to testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In other circumstances, of course, damages may be different depending on whether they stem from abuse of process, a malicious prosecution, or both. Nothing in our decision should be read to suggest otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Although the judge refers to a \u201cfee award,\u201d she awarded the \u201cfees\u201d as compensatory damages on the judgment. Even assuming the judge erred in awarding the legal costs of defending the judgment as \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d the award could be properly considered as damages, and there is no error in her so compensating Mahlowitz. See <em>American Velodur Metal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schinabeck, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 470 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Because the costs spent on defending against the wrongful action are compensable as damages in an abuse of process action, we need not address the judge\u2019s determination that in the alternative attorney\u2019s fees were available pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, or pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.

In that case, this court considered an award of damages to a prevailing plaintiff in a libel action. The court recognized that \u201charm to reputation and mental suffering ... are compensable where the awards are supported by competent evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. In that case, however, the evidence establishing such damages was \u201csparse\u201d and consisted mainly of testimony by the plaintiff\u2019s wife that the plaintiff had been \u201cshook up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498-499. The court noted that there was \u201cno suggestion that the plaintiff received any medical or psychiatric treatment as a result of the libel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499. But the fact that the plaintiff had not received such treatment was not a bar to his relief; it suggested only that the amount of damages awarded by the jury was excessive. Accordingly, the court remanded the case solely on the issue of excessive damages. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The judge\u2019s decision mistakenly stated that Mahlowitz brought a counterclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the judge found that he satisfied this claim. Because this erroneous finding did not affect the judge\u2019s calculation of damages, and because there are other claims that support the award of damages, this error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Our remand is not an invitation to the parties to pursue further arguments about the extent of Mahlowitz\u2019s emotional distress or the appropriateness of the judge\u2019s award of damages for that harm. We remand solely so that the judge may clarify the basis in calculating the amount of her award on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly ranked the case as seventh out of the ten most important decisions for 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wnuk, 9 </em>Mass.

That case did not concern harm to reputation, but concerned whether damages were demonstrated in an action for wrongful interference with contractual relationships where there was no evidence that a golf club had lost members due to the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>at 510-511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The defendants argue that the judge awarded Mahlowitz damages for what he \u201cperceived\u201d to be loss of reputation, without finding that his reputation was in fact tarnished by the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly publications. Their argument misreads the judge\u2019s decision, which acknowledged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>publicity \u201cdisparaged\u201d Mahlowitz professionally and \u201cdamaged\u201d the esteem to which he was held in the legal community. Although the judge also acknowledged that Mahlowitz perceived that his reputation had been harmed, this negative perception is compensable as emotional distress, and therefore was properly considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Attomeys Isaac H. Peres and Robert S. Sinsheimer do not represent the defendants on appeal. They have each submitted a brief, pro se, in support of the judge\u2019s decision to deny sanctions pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 11 (a), 365 Mass. 753 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Mahlowitz asserts that he is entitled to an award of appellate fees and costs against Rabinovitz and Zoppo under Mass. R. A. P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979), because their appeal is frivolous and intended solely for delay. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 455 (1993) (\u201cAppellate courts are authorized by statute to award double costs to an appellee in a civil case when the appeal is frivolous, immaterial, or intended for delay\u201d). Although the defendants have not prevailed here, there is no indication that their appeal from a substantial judgment against them is wholly without merit or intended for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Similarly, Mahlowitz\u2019s contends he should be awarded appellate attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the so-called \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute), because Zoppo and Rabinovitz are challenging an award of legal fees under that statute. Although the judge\u2019s rulings on the anti-SLAPP claim were brief, she apparently awarded attorney\u2019s fees under that statute in the alternative. Because we have affirmed the award of attorney\u2019s fees as damages under Mahlowitz\u2019s abuse of process claim, the anti-SLAPP ruling is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
