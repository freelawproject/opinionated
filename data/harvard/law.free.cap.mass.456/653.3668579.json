Thereafter, a judge in the Superior Court granted the school committee\u2019s application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12, concluding that the arbitrator\u2019s decision exceeded his authority and violated public policy. Robishaw appealed, and we transferred the case on our own motion. Applying the well-settled limitations on judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision, we conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award in this case should be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Background, </em>a. <em>English fluency requirement. </em>In November of 2002, Massachusetts voters passed \u201cQuestion 2\u201d by initiative petition, rewriting G. L. c. 71 A, entitled \u201cEnglish Language Education in Public Schools.\u201d G. L. c. 71A, as appearing in St. 2002, c. 386, \u00a7 1. Section 4 of G. L. c. 71A requires that \u201call children in Massachusetts public schools shall be taught English by being taught in English and all children shall be placed in English language classrooms.\u201d Section 2 <em>(b) </em>defines an \u201cEnglish language classroom\u201d as \u201ca classroom in which the language of instruction used by the teaching personnel is overwhelmingly the English language, and in which such teaching personnel are fluent and literate in English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On March 27, 2003, the Commissioner of Education (commissioner) issued a memorandum (March 27 memorandum, or memorandum) to school superintendents and charter school leaders, explaining the new law. The memorandum required that, beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, every superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tendent and charter school head sign an assurance verifying the English fluency and literacy of all teachers in English language classrooms in his or her district or school. It defined \u201c[fluency\u201d as \u201coral proficiency in English that consists of comprehension and production,\u201d and further defined \u201c[production\u201d as \u201caccurate and efficient oral communication using appropriate pronunciation, intonation, grammar, and vocabulary in an interactive professional context.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The March 27 memorandum outlined four fluency assessment methods: (1) classroom observation and assessment by a teacher\u2019s supervisor, principal, or superintendent; (2) interview and assessment by a supervisor, principal, or superintendent; (3) a teacher\u2019s demonstration of fluency by achieving an acceptable score on a test accepted by the commissioner; and (4) an alternative method developed by the superintendent and accepted by the commissioner. The memorandum then stated that, after researching testing options, the Department of Education (department) recommended the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) oral proficiency interview (OPI) test and deemed any score above the \u201cadvanced-mid\u201d level \u201cacceptable ... for teachers in Massachusetts English language classrooms.\u201d The memorandum stated in bold print that a \u201ctest is needed only in cases where the teacher\u2019s English fluency is not apparent through classroom observation and assessment or interview and assessment,\u201d and reiterated that \u201c[o]nly those teachers for whom it is not possible to decide that they reach, at a minimum, the Advanced-Mid level should be referred for the OPI assessment.\u201d An attachment to the March 27 memorandum incorporated the ACTFL proficiency guidelines that contained \u201cdescriptors\u201d of ten speaking levels \u2014 of which the \u201cadvanced-mid\u201d level was the third \u2014 for use \u201cas guides for district officials to use when deciding if a teacher meets or does not meet the oral proficiency requirement of Question 2.\u201d The commissioner also recommended in the memorandum that \u201cschool officials who will be making the fluency determinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>review and discuss the descriptors together to ensure consistent application.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">To comply with the commissioner\u2019s instructions set out in the March 27 memorandum \u2022\u2014 instructions that were subsequently codified in part as 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 (2003) (see note 3, supra) \u2014 the school committee developed a policy for the 2003-2004 school year requiring fluency testing for all teachers who spoke a first language other than English. The policy exempted from the fluency testing requirement any such teacher who provided documentation that he or she had attended United States mainland schools in which the teaching was in English for at least six years during his or her kindergarten through grade twelve education<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and any teacher who passed the locally administered \u201cSPEAK\u201d test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The policy required teachers who did not qualify for the exemption to take the \u201cSPEAK\u201d test and, if they did not receive a score of fifty-five points or higher, to take the department-approved OPI test.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">b. <em>Robishaw\u2019s dismissal. </em>Robishaw, a first-grade teacher at the Greenhalge School in Lowell, began teaching in the Lowell public schools in 1992. Robishaw was born in Cambodia in 1955 and came to the United States as a refugee after she escaped the Khmer Rouge regime. She was one of five teachers of Cambodian birth at Greenhalge, where, as of 2002, the Cambodian student enrollment was close to fifty per cent. Robishaw held several separate teaching licenses issued by the department, and these licenses collectively qualified her to teach an elementary school curriculum in mainstream, bilingual, and special education settings, as well as to teach Cambodian. Before 2002, Robishaw\u2019s annual teaching evaluations by her school\u2019s principals had been uniformly positive, rating her teaching as \u201csatisfactory,\u201d the highest rating available.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In October, 2002, a new principal at the Greenhalge School expressed concern to the superintendent of the Lowell public schools (superintendent) about several teachers\u2019 English proficiency, including Robishaw\u2019s. At the superintendent\u2019s suggestion, the principal evaluated those teachers based on their \u201cinstructional abilities in the classroom.\u201d The principal\u2019s evaluation of Robishaw began in October, 2002, and continued through January, 2003, when she gave Robishaw an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d over-all performance rating. While the principal cited Robishaw\u2019s \u201cinability to orally communicate effectively,\u201d she did not explicitly use the evaluation to assess Robishaw\u2019s English fluency. Because the principal began the evaluation before the passage of Question 2 and concluded the evaluation before the issuance of the commissioner\u2019s March 27 memorandum, she did not use or have knowledge of the ACTFL speaking levels (including the advanced-mid level) referenced in and attached to the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On February 3, 2003, following a January meeting with her principal about the evaluation, Robishaw experienced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and took a medical leave of absence from her teaching position. In March, 2003, Robishaw wrote the assistant superintendent of the Lowell public schools, seeking to postpone taking the SPEAK test because of her medical condition and the medications she was taking. The assistant superintendent declined Robishaw\u2019s request, and in the spring of 2003, Robishaw took and failed both the SPEAK and OPI tests while still on medical leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In June, 2003, the superintendent informed Robishaw by letter that if she failed to provide evidence of a passing score on the OPI assessment on or before August 14, 2003, the superintendent would dismiss her. Robishaw did not do so. In August, the superintendent sent Robishaw another letter stating her intent to dismiss her \u201cfor cause pursuant to [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42,] for inefficiency and incompetency based upon fluency in the English language.\u201d In September, 2003, the superintendent held a hearing at Robishaw\u2019s request and, after reviewing medical documents and other evidence, decided not to dismiss Robishaw at that time and to extend her medical leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Robishaw continued on medical leave through the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years. In June, 2005, Robishaw wrote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>superintendent to state that she was ready to return to her teaching position and intended to do so that August. In July, however, the superintendent sent Robishaw another letter of intent to dismiss her effective September, 2005. The superintendent stated that, using the advanced-mid level described in the commissioner\u2019s March 27 memorandum, she found Robishaw insufficiently fluent in English to meet State requirements. The superintendent based this conclusion on the principal\u2019s evaluation report, signed in January, 2003, and Robishaw\u2019s SPEAK and OPI test scores.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In September, 2005, Robishaw requested and received a review hearing with the superintendent. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the review hearing, Robishaw was represented by an attorney and testified on her own behalf. Robishaw\u2019s husband and her treating psychologist also testified on her behalf. Following the review hearing, the superintendent dismissed Robishaw based on the latter\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated level of English fluency and the best interests of students.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The superintendent cited as grounds Robishaw\u2019s failing SPEAK and OPI assessment scores and the principal\u2019s October, 2002, to January, 2003, observations, as well as the superintendent\u2019s own observation of Robishaw\u2019s fluency level at the review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In June, 2006, Robishaw invoked her right \u2014 provided by statute, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and under the Lowell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>teachers\u2019 collective bargaining agreement \u2014 as a professional status teacher to seek arbitration to review the dismissal. After twelve days of hearings, the arbitrator issued his decision in January, 2007. The arbitrator framed the issue as whether there was just cause to terminate Robishaw, and found the matter arbitrable. While the arbitrator admitted in evidence Robishaw\u2019s SPEAK and OPI test results, he ultimately declined to consider them substantively. He concluded that to do so would violate Robishaw\u2019s due process rights because the test graders had not been available for cross-examination. The arbitrator also deemed the results unreliable because Robishaw had taken the tests while on leave for a medical condition that \u201cnegatively affected her ability to demonstrate her English language proficiency/ fluency.\u201d Turning to the principal\u2019s evaluation of Robishaw in 2002 and early 2003, the arbitrator found that it constituted an improper basis for dismissal, as it was \u201cnot informed by an awareness of the standard or benchmark which defines sufficient fluency\u201d and neither the \u201cevaluation instmment nor [the principal] informed Ms. Robishaw that her \u2018fluency\u2019 was being observed and/or evaluated.\u201d Additionally, the arbitrator deemed the superintendent\u2019s conclusions about Robishaw\u2019s fluency based on Robishaw\u2019s speech at the 2005 review hearing an \u201cinvalid basis to support her dismissal.\u201d He found that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, does not allow a superintendent to expand the grounds of dismissal during the review hearing itself and, in any case, the superintendent did not notify Robishaw that she intended to use that hearing to assess fluency. Finally, the arbitrator found Robishaw\u2019s retention in the students\u2019 best interest due to her life history as a survivor of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia and her ability to serve as a role model for young people. The arbitrator concluded that the school committee did not establish just cause for Robishaw\u2019s dismissal and ordered her reinstated with back pay and benefits to August 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The school committee filed an action in the Superior Court, seeking to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12, claiming, among other grounds, that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. After hearing, the motion judge vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award. The judge determined that under <em>School Comm, of Lowell </em>v. <em>Vong </em>Oung, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 698 (2008) <em>(Vang Oung), </em>the school committee\u2019s claim that the arbitrator wrongly excluded Robishaw\u2019s test results lay beyond the scope of judicial review as an alleged error of fact or law. However, based in part on his own opinion of Robishaw\u2019s fluency in English, formed from listening to a tape recording of her 2003 SPEAK test, the judge concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing an award that contravened both State law and public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Scope of judicial review. </em>General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42, authorizes a teacher with professional status to seek review of a decision to dismiss her by arbitration, and places the burden on the school committee to prove the \u201cjust cause\u201d that served as grounds for dismissal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, the superintendent cited lack of English fluency as the \u201cjust cause\u201d for terminating Robishaw\u2019s employment. Section 42 also dictates that the \u201carbitral decision shall be subject to judicial review as provided in [G. L. c. 150C].\u201d See <em>School Dist. of Beverly </em>v. <em>Getter, </em>435 Mass. 223, 228 (2001) <em>(Getter) </em>(Cordy, J., concurring). Under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, a judge in the Superior Court \u201cshall vacate\u201d an arbitrator\u2019s award on a party\u2019s application if, among other enumerated grounds, \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d Absent proof of one of the grounds specified in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, a reviewing court is \u201cstrictly bound by the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law, even if they are in error.\u201d <em>School Comm, of Pitts-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>field, </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 758 (2003). See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61 (2001), cert, denied, 534 U.S. 1131 (2002) (\u201cwe are strictly bound by an arbitrator\u2019s findings and legal conclusions, even if they appear erroneous, inconsistent, or unsupported by the record\u201d). The court may ask only whether the arbitrator \u201cexceeded his scope of reference, acted against clearly defined public policy, or ordered conduct prohibited by State or Federal law.\u201d <em>School Comm, of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, supra </em>at 759, quoting <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Duxbury Permanent Firefighters Ass\u2019n, Local 2167, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 464 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">b. <em>Analysis. </em>As stated, the judge vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award on two independent grounds: the award was contrary to law and in violation of public policy. We consider each separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">(i) <em>Contrary to law. </em>The judge ruled that the arbitrator\u2019s award required the superintendent to act contrary to law because it precluded her from determining Robishaw\u2019s fluency (or lack thereof) based on the assessment of Robishaw\u2019s principal. The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201c[T]he Arbitrator\u2019s decision prevents the Superintendent from relying on the Principal\u2019s observations of teachers\u2019 fluency. This result is not merely inconsistent with the law; it is contradictory. Under the [department\u2019s] regulations, the Superintendent \u2018shall\u2019 rely on the Principal\u2019s observations of fluency, but the Arbitrator concluded that the Principal\u2019s opinion as to the defendant\u2019s lack of fluency was invalid because the Principal was unfamiliar with linguistics testing. . . . The arbitration award directs a result contrary to the express terms of the law. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(a). . . .<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> Therefore, the arbitration award exceeds the Arbitrator\u2019s authority and must be vacated under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The judge\u2019s conclusion was in error. Contrary to his apparent view, neither 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(a) nor anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in the governing statute, G. L. c. 71 A, requires the superintendent to rely on a principal\u2019s assessment of a teacher\u2019s English fluency regardless of the substantive or procedural validity of that assessment. The judge failed to take into account the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings that the principal\u2019s evaluations of Robishaw were \u201cnot informed by an awareness of the standard or benchmark [prescribed in the commissioner\u2019s March 27 memorandum] which defines sufficient fluency\u201d and, moreover, that neither the \u201cevaluation instrument nor [the principal] informed Ms. Robishaw that her \u2018fluency\u2019 was being observed and/or evaluated in the 2002-2003 evaluation process.\u201d Assuming, as we must, the correctness of these findings, the arbitrator\u2019s decision did not require the superintendent to violate 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(a). Rather, the decision instructed in substance that if the superintendent chooses to base her determination of a teacher\u2019s English fluency for purposes of 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(1) (see note 10, supra) on \u201cclassroom observation and assessment,\u201d \u00a7 14.05(3)(a), the underlying classroom assessment must have been conducted in a procedurally appropriate manner and must be based on the use of substantively valid standards. If it was not, the superintendent\u2019s fluency determination need not be accepted. The judge was not free to reject the arbitrator\u2019s findings or his legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We turn next to Robishaw\u2019s SPEAK and OPI test scores. As previously indicated, the judge did not rest his decision to vacate the award on the arbitrator\u2019s failure to consider those scores, concluding that the school committee\u2019s \u201ccontention that the Arbitrator wrongly excluded [Robishaw\u2019s] test scores \u2018lie[s] beyond the scope of judicial review.\u2019 \u201d This determination was also incorrect. Although the scope of review under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, is \u201crestrictive in not permitting reversal based on an arbitrator\u2019s legal errors,\u201d <em>Goncalo </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 10 (2002), a reviewing court may reverse an arbitrator\u2019s decision where the arbitrator exceeds his authority by disregarding the governing law. See <em>Getter, </em>435 Mass. at 231 (Cordy, J., concurring) (\u201cHaving found that Geller engaged in serious misconduct that [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42,] specifically identifies as proper grounds for dismissal, the arbitrator proceeded to apply an additional \u2018just cause\u2019 analysis .... In doing so he ignored the plain words and import of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In essence, he substituted his own judgment . . . and thereby acted beyond his authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Pursuant to the express authority granted it by G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 IB, the department promulgated 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.00 (2003) to implement G. L. c. 71 A, the English Language Education in Public Schools Act. Thus, 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(1), implementing G. L. c. 71 A, \u00a7 2 (b), requires all school district superintendents to provide annually a written assurance that teachers in English language classrooms are literate and fluent in English.'And in further implementation of the same statute, 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(c) provides: \u201cFor purposes of the assurance required by 603 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 14.05(1), a teacher\u2019s fluency in English shall be determined through one or more of the following methods: ... the teacher\u2019s demonstration of fluency in English through a test accepted by the [commissioner] . . . .\u201d As stated in the commissioner\u2019s March 27 memorandum, the commissioner \u201caccepted\u201d the OPI test, designated it as the approved test by which a teacher could demonstrate her English fluency pursuant to 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(c), and further provided that with respect to test results, \u201cthe [department] has determined that levels 1 (Superior), 2 (Advanced High), and 3 (Advanced Mid) [on the OPI test] are acceptable levels for teachers in Massachusetts English language classrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The regulation at issue, 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(3)(c), promulgated pursuant to an express grant of authority by the Legislature, see G. L. c. 69, \u00a7 IB, has the force of law. See, e.g., <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 393 Mass. 28, 33 (1984); <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 768 (1980). The arbitrator was obligated to accept the OPI test as the department\u2019s approved test under \u00a7 14.05(3)(c), and further to accept the department\u2019s designation of the \u201cadvanced-mid\u201d level on this test as the applicable standard for acceptable fluency. The undisputed evidence admitted at the arbitration hearing was that Robishaw had taken the OPI test and had received a score of \u201cintermediate high,\u201d which is below the threshold advanced-mid level. In concluding that he would not accept the OPI test results because none of the test graders or raters was available for cross-examination, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by declining to accept that test or, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>particularly, the results of that test, without additional indicia of reliability. In effect, the arbitrator \u201cignored the plain words and import of the [regulation]\u201d and thereby acted beyond his authority. Getter, 435 Mass. at 231 (Cordy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Nevertheless, the error does not alter the result in this case. The arbitrator rested his decision on the independent ground that both the SPEAK and the OPI test results must be viewed as an unreliable indicator of Robishaw\u2019s English fluency in the particular circumstances here. He found on the medical evidence presented \u2014\u2022 which included the testimony of Robishaw\u2019s treating psychologist \u2014 that \u201cfrom January through at least August 2003 and beyond, . . . Robishaw\u2019s medical condition negatively affected her ability to demonstrate her English language proficiency/fluency, and hence any tests taken during that time cannot be viewed as a valid indicator of that ability.\u201d This factual determination is not open for our review and, in any event, is supported by the evidence in the record. Robishaw\u2019s treating psychologist testified at the arbitration hearing that, in January, 2003, Robishaw experienced depression and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, the latter of which likely stemmed from the trauma she experienced in Cambodia and was reactivated by the stressful school situation. The psychologist opined that Robishaw\u2019s depression and anxiety would likely inhibit her test-taking ability. In addition to this testimony, the arbitrator considered an August 8, 2003, letter from the same psychologist indicating that Robishaw\u2019s condition had worsened and did not allow a retest at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">(ii) <em>Violation of public policy. </em>This court has recognized a narrow public policy exception to the usual deference we accord an arbitrator\u2019s award. That exception applies only where an employee\u2019s conduct implicates a well-defined, dominant, public policy ascertained by reference to specific law or legal precedent; the conduct is integral to the employee\u2019s duties; and such conduct would require an employee\u2019s dismissal. <em>Getter, </em>435 Mass. at 237-238 (Ireland, J., concurring).

Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 604-605 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Here, the judge determined that \u201c(1) the proper instruction of students is a clearly defined public policy; (2) English fluency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>is integral to the teaching profession; (3) reinstatement of [Robishaw] would offend the goals of Massachusetts education law; and (4) the Superintendent\u2019s inability to assure [Robishaw\u2019s] fluency required [her] dismissal from teaching in an English-speaking classroom.\u201d The arbitrator, however, made a factual finding that the school committee failed to meet its burden of establishing that Robishaw could not speak English fluently. We are bound by this determination and, therefore, \u201cneed not parse the application of the public policy exception to such a scenario, because it is a factual scenario that the arbitrator expressly determined had not been proved.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 65 (2001) (where city terminated police officer for alleged use of excessive force and arbitrator found that allegation unproved, court upheld award ordering reinstatement, as it was bound by arbitrator\u2019s finding).
