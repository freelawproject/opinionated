L. c. 272, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appealed to the Appeals Court and we granted his application for direct appellate review. The harmful matter consisted of three digital images of the fifty year old defendant, posing naked, which he sent by electronic mail to a police officer posing online as a fifteen year old girl living in Wenham (in Essex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>County). The Commonwealth agrees that the defendant resides in South Hadley (in Hampshire County), where the images were stored on his computer, and concedes, on appeal, that the offense of which the defendant was convicted was committed there. The trial, however, took place in Essex County, not Hampshire County,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a matter of significance as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The principal issue at trial was whether the naked images of the defendant constituted matter \u201charmful to minors.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 31, provides that matter is harmful to minors if it is either \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201cif taken as a whole, it (1) describes or represents nudity, sexual conduct or sexual excitement, so as to appeal predominantly to the prurient interest of minors; (2) is patently contrary to prevailing standards of adults in the county where the offense was committed as to suitable material for such minors; and (3) lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">During the trial, the judge ruled that the images were not \u201cobscene\u201d as a matter of law; consequently, the case was submitted to the jury on the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the images were harmful matter under the alternate definition. In order to make that determination, the jury were required to decide whether the images were \u201cpatently contrary to prevailing standards of adults <em>in the county where the offense was committed </em>as to suitable material for such minors\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">There was no testimony offered at the trial as to what the prevailing standards of adults in Hampshire County might be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and the jurors were drawn from Essex County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, in their closing arguments, both the prosecutor and defense counsel argued that the jury should apply the prevailing standards of adults in Essex County. Defense counsel essentially argued that the Commonwealth had not established what the prevailing standards in Essex County were and therefore the jury should acquit. The prosecutor told the jury that they were members of the Essex county community and therefore should apply their own standards to determine whether the images were harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cSo that is the way in this case the Commonwealth has to prove that the matter is harmful to minors. That is \u2014 if it is taken as a whole, it describes or represents nudity, sexual conduct or sexual excitement. ... It describes or represents nudity so as to appeal predominantly to the prurient interest of minors and two \u2014 is patently contrary to prevailing standards of adults <em>in the county where the offense was committed </em>as to suitable material for such minors. And three \u2014 it lacks serious artistic, political or scientific value for minors. The Commonwealth must offer proof sufficient to sustain its burden on all three standards, not just one or two. That means each of those three things I described would be followed by an \u2018and.\u2019 They have to prove one and two and three.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">There was no mention of either Hampshire or Essex County in the judge\u2019s instruction or any instruction on how the jury were to determine the \u201ccounty where the offense was committed.\u201d G.L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In these circumstances, it is apparent that the jury had no alternative but to decide whether the images were \u201cpatently contrary\u201d to the prevailing standards of adults in Essex County, and the Commonwealth does not contend otherwise. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The Commonwealth argues, however, that the error did not give rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because the images fell below a \u201cbaseline\u201d standard of materials suitable for minors, applicable in all counties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 775, 781 (2002) (\u201cno reasonable and disinterested observer anywhere in the Commonwealth would think [that explicit photographs of men and women engaging in assorted forms of sexual intercourse were] suitable for display to children\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant contends that his conviction should be reversed and the complaint dismissed because the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence of the prevailing standards in Hampshire County.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">While we agree with the Commonwealth that the evidence was sufficient to support a jury determination that the images were \u201cpatently contrary\u201d to the prevailing standards of adults in any county, including Hampshire County, for material suitable for minors (and therefore the case may be retried),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a properly instructed jury, applying the prevailing standards of adults in Hampshire County, may have concluded otherwise. Consequently, we are not persuaded that the error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The conviction therefore must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In light of this conclusion, we need not address claims made by the defendant regarding other alleged errors at trial. However, because it may arise again at retrial, it is appropriate for us to address the defendant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to an instruction that, in determining whether the matter is \u201cpatently contrary to prevailing standards of adults in the county where the offense was committed as to suitable material for . . . minors,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the jurors must acquit if they cannot determine the views of the \u201caverage citizen\u201d of the county \u201cas a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In support of the argument that he was entitled to this instruction, the defendant points out that such an instruction has been required in obscenity cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trainor, </em>374 Mass. 796, 800 (1978). We decline to require that the instruction be given in cases not requiring proof of the elements of obscenity as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ao4\">With respect to matters \u201charmful to minors\u201d \u2014 the only issue here \u2014 the question for the jury is whether the matter is \u201cpatently contrary to prevailing standards of adults in the county where the offense was committed.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. While this requires the jury to consider the prevailing standards of the adults of the county, rather than their own normative views, unanimity is necessary only on whether the suitability of the materials (for minors) is \u201cpatently contrary\u201d to such standards. Although the jurors may disagree as to precisely what those standards are, that is not a bar to their determining that the material in question is, in any event, \u201cpatently contrary\u201d to any of their formulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-16\">Kereakoglow was also charged with child enticement, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C. He was acquitted of that charge by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">It appears that the criminal complaints were brought in Essex County because the defendant was charged both with child enticement in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C, and the dissemination of matter harmful to minors. Each of these crimes would have occurred in Essex County. With respect to the latter charge, the Commonwealth opted to proceed only on so much of the complaint as charged possession of matter harmful to minors with the intent to distribute it, a crime occurring, if at all, in Hampshire County. The defendant does not contend that the case against him was improperly brought in Essex County, and has, in any event, waived such a claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 336 (1999), citing <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 883, 896-897 (1977) (venue may be waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The defendant admitted to the police that he had sent the three images to the person he thought was fifteen years old, and that he knew that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to do so. A tape recording of his interview with police was played for the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The Commonwealth was not required to offer expert testimony on what the prevailing standards in Hampshire County might be. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trainor, </em>374 Mass. 796, 799-800 (1978). Indeed, the \u201ctrier of fact may draw on his own knowledge of normative views in his own community in applying statutorily prescribed community standards.\u201d <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>Three Way Theatres Corp., </em>371 Mass. 391, 394 (1976). Here, however, the jury were drawn not from the Hampshire County \u201ccommunity,\u201d but from Essex County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Commonwealth also contends that any error here was \u201cinvited\u201d by the defendant. While it was plainly error for the case to have been prosecuted and defended on the theory that the material at issue was to be judged on the prevailing standards of adults in Essex County rather than Hampshire County, it can hardly be said that the defendant \u201cinvited\u201d the error rather than joined in it. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 92, 99-100 (1994) (where judge gave erroneous manslaughter instructions requested by defendant, \u201cdefendant on appeal bears a heavy burden in attempting to have his conviction overturned\u201d based on error in instruction). In any event, the standard we apply is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The photographs, while not obscene, prominently displayed the defendant\u2019s genitals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Matter is \u201c[o]bscene\u201d if, \u201ctaken as a whole,\u201d it satisfies all three prongs of the following test: the matter must \u201c(1) appeal[] to the prurient interest of the average person applying the contemporary standards of the county where the offense was committed; (2) depict[] or describe!] sexual conduct in a patently offensive way; and (3) lack[] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b245-14\">Matter that meets the statutory definition of obscene is also a category of matter \u201charmful to minors\u201d barred by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. As noted above, the Commonwealth does not contend that the nude images here were obscene, and the judge concluded that they were not. Consequently, the jury were not required to consider whether they met the definition of obscenity, a definition that applies to materials distributed both to adults and minors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
