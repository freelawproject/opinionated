He appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed all but his conviction of drugging a person for unlawful sexual intercourse, which was vacated on the ground that an error in the jury instruction was prejudicial to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 624, 630, 633 (2009). We granted both the Commonwealth\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s applications for further appellate review, limited to the convictions of drugging a person for unlawful sexual intercourse, rape, and indecent assault and battery. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions of rape and indecent assault and battery. Because, as we interpret the statute on drugging a person for unlawful sexual intercourse, there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction, we reverse his conviction, set aside the verdict, and enter judgment for the defendant on that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em>Facts and background. </em>We present the essential facts the jury could have found, the details of which are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In 2004, the victim was an eighteen year old woman and a senior in high school. Through friends and family, she had known the defendant, an approximately fifty year old attorney, since she was twelve years old. In the months before the incident, the victim, who weighed approximately 119 pounds, was drinking frequently and had used cocaine five or six times, including an incident in December, 2003, where the defendant provided the cocaine. Beginning in December, 2003, the defendant also had made sexual overtures to the victim, which she rebuffed, sometimes laughingly. Several times she explained to the defendant that she had a boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The events at the center of this case took place on February 1 and 2, 2004. The victim attended two \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d parties on February 1, and consumed alcoholic drinks at both. The defendant was present at the second party. There, he and the victim ingested cocaine twice. The defendant expressed interest in dating the victim, but she declined. He invited the victim to his house for a party that same evening. Although the victim declined the invitation, she could not sleep because of her ingestion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>cocaine, and at approximately 1 a.m. on February 2, she went to the defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">When she arrived, only the defendant was there. She consumed more alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, all provided by the defendant. The victim testified that the pair stayed up all night talking. In the morning, the victim went to school, but she left twice, each time returning to the defendant\u2019s house. During the first time she returned, she drank a beer and used cocaine. The second time she returned, she was \u201cstill . . . drunk and high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">During this second visit, she drank more beer and ingested more cocaine. The defendant again made advances toward the victim that she rebuffed. The defendant served her wine, and the victim had three to four glasses. Because of the cocaine, the victim was not hungry and had almost nothing to eat that day; the last food she had eaten was when she was at the first \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d party the night before. Moreover, she consumed approximately twelve beers at the defendant\u2019s house on February 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">After the victim consumed the wine, the pair retreated to the defendant\u2019s bedroom, where the defendant kept cocaine. The victim testified that while in the bedroom she did not remember what happened, but she realized her \u201cclothes came off\u201d because the defendant was kissing her vagina. When she tried to move away, he told her to \u201cdo another fine\u201d of cocaine, which she did. She stated that she sat back down on the bed and \u201cremember[ed] being in [the defendant\u2019s] bed [and] putting my clothes back on a few times, and then them coming off again.\u201d She did not recall how they came off, but remembered putting them back on. The defendant also sucked on her breasts, and licked and touched her vagina and penetrated it with his finger. She testified that she told him, \u201cNo. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">At approximately 9 p.m., three of the victim\u2019s friends arrived at the defendant\u2019s house, went up to the bedroom, knocked on the door, and told the victim she had to leave with them. Although the victim answered that she was coming, when she did not, one friend opened the door. The friends testified that the victim was dirty and her hair was in \u201cknots\u201d and messier than if she had just been sleeping. She smelled of alcohol, seemed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, was slurring her words, and \u201cseemed like she didn\u2019t know what was going on or why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>they were there.\u201d The friends had to help her put her shirt on. They saw her jaw moving in a peculiar manner, although there were no words coming out. The victim was wobbly and unsteady on her feet, and her friends helped her get down the stairs from the defendant\u2019s bedroom and had to help her into their vehicle. Her friends drove her to her father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The victim\u2019s father testified that, when she arrived, she looked like a \u201czombie\u201d; she was screaming and crying and unable to focus. He also noticed her \u201cinvoluntary jaw movement\u201d and that she could not speak. Indeed, the victim testified that for a day or so after she left the defendant\u2019s house she could not eat because her mouth was sore from her chewing on her mouth and lips, something she did when she ingested cocaine. Her father brought her to a police station. The officer who interviewed her the evening of February 2 testified that she was intoxicated, crying, and upset. The victim had no clear memory of what she told this officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Rape and indecent assault and battery. </em>The defendant acknowledged that he and the victim engaged in sexual activity, and there was no allegation that the defendant used force. At trial on the rape and indecent assault and battery charges, the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim\u2019s consumption of drugs and alcohol rendered her incapable of consenting to sexual contact with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 490 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simcock, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 188 (1991) (Commonwealth\u2019s proof of lack of consent same in both rape and indecent assault and battery cases). \u201c[A]n instruction concerning the capacity to consent should be given in any case where the evidence would support a finding that because of the consumption of drugs or alcohol or for some other reason ... [a person is] so impaired as to be incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>450 Mass. 583, 591-592 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant filed a motion for required findings of not guilty, which he renewed at the close of all the evidence, arguing that there was no evidence that the complainant could not consent to the sexual contact. The defendant argues on appeal that because of a lack of evidence, the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on incapacity to consent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim was so impaired as to be incapable of consenting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 762 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). On February 2 alone, the victim, who had not eaten, consumed a dozen beers, three to four glasses of wine, and ingested a quantity of cocaine, some of it at the defendant\u2019s urging during the assaults. The jury were warranted in believing the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not know how her clothes came off, and that she put them back on several times. They reasonably could have inferred that the victim faded in and out of consciousness and achieved some level of awareness that her clothes were off only when she was roused by the defendant\u2019s performing sexual acts on her. Her testimony of her general state was corroborated by the testimony of the friends who found her, her father, and the first police officer who interviewed her. These facts are consistent with facts in other cases where the court has held that the instruction was warranted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>439 Mass. 482, 490-491 (2003) (instruction on capacity to consent warranted where complainant had been drinking, had glassy and bloodshot eyes, and was swaying; ingested Percocet; and testified that she felt drugged and that she was sleeping but awoke each time the defendant committed sexual acts on her); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 221-222 (1986) (victim injected with Valium and awoke from her unconscious stupor only when jarred by telephone ringing or motion of defendant\u2019s body on top of hers).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On cross-examination, the victim agreed that in the \u201cearly evening\u201d she performed \u201csome degree of oral sex\u201d on the defendant and that he did not \u201cforce\u201d her. The defendant interprets her statement that there was no force to mean that she voluntarily performed oral sex and argues that it shows that she was capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of consenting to all the sexual acts that occurred. We disagree. The jury reasonably could have inferred from this testimony that the incident occurred earlier in the evening than the incidents for which the defendant was charged, and that the victim became incapable of consenting as the evening progressed. The jury also reasonably could have concluded that, despite her testimony, the victim was already incapable of consenting to the oral sex. In any event, the specific incidents for which the defendant was charged did not include this incident of oral sex. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, supra </em>at 597, this court held that \u201cin order to sustain a conviction on a theory of incapacity to consent, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant\u2019s condition rendered her incapable of consenting.\u201d Although the defendant acknowledges that our decision in <em>Blache </em>in 2008 explicitly stated that the new rule was not given retroactive effect, <em>id.., </em>and thus does not apply to him, he nevertheless argues that it would be unjust to hold the defendant accountable without such proof. We do not accept the defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit our decision to apply the rule prospectively only.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant next argues that the judge erred when he instructed the jury on incapacity to consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201c[I]f by reason of sleep or intoxication due to alcohol, cocaine, or a combination of these factors, a person is unconscious, helpless, or so minimally conscious that she is incapable of consenting, an act of sexual intercourse occurring with that person while she is in that state is without her valid consent and rape. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cHowever, the mere fact that someone consumes some alcohol and/or cocaine or exhibited some of the symptoms commonly associated with intoxication <em>does not necessarily </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>mean </em>[she is] incapable of giving consent\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defendant takes issue only with the phrase \u201cdoes not necessarily mean,\u201d arguing that the adverb \u201cnecessarily\u201d should have been \"omitted. He argues that there is a substantial risk that the jury understood the instruction to mean that the \u201cmere consumption of alcohol and/or cocaine or her exhibition of some symptoms of intoxication <em>might </em>mean that she is incapable of giving consent.\u201d This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In his instruction, the judge added an appropriate adverb, \u201cnecessarily,\u201d which means \u201cinevitably\u201d or \u201cunavoidably,\u201d to modify \u201cdoes not . . . mean.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1510 (1993). The defendant\u2019s construction, on the other hand, removes the auxiliary verb \u201cdoes not\u201d altogether, and substitutes the auxiliary verb \u201cmight,\u201d which, as the past tense of the verb \u201cmay,\u201d expresses possibility. <em>Id. </em>at 1396, 1432. We are not persuaded that the jury would have disregarded the phrase \u201cdoes not\u201d in the judge\u2019s instruction and engaged in the strained interpretation the defendant proposes, which makes superfluous the critical words \u201cdoes not.\u201d See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auclair, </em>444 Mass. 348, 360 (2005) (jury presumed to follow judge\u2019s instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Furthermore, the judge\u2019s instruction conforms to the requirements set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urban, </em>450 Mass. 608 (2008), that to prove incapacity to consent, \u201cthe Commonwealth must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018because of the consumption of drugs or alcohol or for some other reason (for example, sleep, unconsciousness, mental retardation, or helplessness), the complainant was so impaired as to be incapable of consenting to intercourse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blache, supra </em>at 591-592. Here, the judge properly informed the jury that the fact that the victim consumed alcohol or drugs or exhibited symptoms of intoxication did not inevitably mean that she was incapable of consenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em>Drugging for unlawful sexual intercourse. </em>The defendant was convicted of drugging a person for the purpose of unlawful sexual intercourse, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">\u201cWhoever applies, administers to or causes to be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>by a person any drug, matter or thing with intent to stupefy or overpower such person so as to thereby enable any person to have sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The word \u201cadminister\u201d is not defined in the statute, nor does there appear to be any appellate decision addressing the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge recited the language of the statute to the jury, but concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove that the defendant \u201cadminister[ed] to or cause[d] to be taken,\u201d he instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201c[The Commonwealth has] to prove that the defendant <em>gave or provided </em>a drug or substance to [the victim] <em>either directly or by offering it to her and requesting her to take it. </em>It\u2019s not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant directly put the drug or substance into her by injection, nor into her food or drink. Also, it is not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant forced her to consume it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instruction, over his objection, that the Commonwealth had to prove only that the defendant \u201cgave or provided\u201d drugs to the victim was erroneous. Where a defendant objects to an instruction, the court must determine whether the instruction was error and review the instruction as a whole to determine whether it prejudiced the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591, 597 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In its analysis whether the instruction was erroneous, the Appeals Court first noted the familiar rule that where a word is undefined in the statute, we use its \u201cusual and accepted meanings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBIanc, supra </em>at 629, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 105 (2005). The court stated that two dictionaries did not define \u201cadminister\u201d as \u201c[to] provide\u201d but rather as \u201cto direct or superintend the execution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>use or conduct of ... to mete out . . . dispense ... to give ritually [or] remedially\u201d and \u201c[t]o have charge of; manage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629 &amp; n.3, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 27 (2002), and the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 22 (4th ed. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The court also concluded that, had the Legislature intended for the word \u201cadminister\u201d to mean \u201cprovide,\u201d it could have used those words, as it did in G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, which prohibits the sale or delivery of alcohol to a minor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 629. Finally, the court concluded that, reading the word \u201cadminister\u201d in context, i.e., placed between the words \u201capplies\u201d and \u201ccauses to be taken,\u201d the statute requires \u201csome forceful action, deceit or trickery on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Commonwealth sets forth several arguments that there was no error in the instruction, including that the gravamen of the statute is not the method by which the victim is drugged but rather the use of such drugs by the defendant to facilitate unlawful intercourse; that the word \u201cadminister\u201d can mean \u201cprovide\u201d where, in common usage, the words \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cprovide\u201d are synonymous, and the word \u201cgive\u201d is defined as \u201cto administer\u201d; that other jurisdictions have defined \u201cadminister\u201d as to \u201cgive\u201d; and that the statutory words \u201ccause to be taken\u201d are the equivalent of \u201cgive or provide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We are not persuaded and instead, for the reasons set forth by the Appeals Court, conclude that to violate the statute, a defendant must do something more than what occurred here, i.e., simply making alcohol and drugs available to the eighteen year old victim, who testified that she returned to the defendant\u2019s house to consume more drugs and alcohol. The Commonwealth, in support of its argument that the gravamen of the statute is the defendant\u2019s intent, points to the fact that the crime of drugging for unlawful sexual intercourse carries a (potentially) harsher sentence than does the crime of forcible rape.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that the disparate sentences support our conclusion that merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>making alcohol or drugs available is not enough to convict under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, even assuming that the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments regarding other jurisdictions and the possibility that \u201cadminister\u201d or \u201ccause to be taken\u201d could mean \u201cprovide\u201d or \u201cgive\u201d are valid, its interpretation demonstrates that the language of the statute is ambiguous. \u201c[Cjriminal statutes are strictly construed against the Commonwealth, and . . . any plausible ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Youngworth </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 608, 611 (2002), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 284 n.19 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>431 Mass. 44, 45-46 (2000) (rule of lenity requires that defendant receive benefit of ambiguous statutory language). We conclude that the judge erred in his instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We agree with the Appeals Court that the error was prejudicial because the instruction misinterpreted key words that \u201care the basis of criminal liability under the statute. In these circumstances, we cannot say with confidence that the error was unlikely to have affected the jury\u2019s deliberations\u201d on whether the defendant was guilty of drugging a person' for unlawful sexual intercourse. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, supra </em>at 630. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994) (error prejudicial if court cannot fairly say that judgment not substantially swayed by error).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The defendant also argues that evidence was insufficient to prove he was guilty of drugging the victim for unlawful sexual intercourse. Given our interpretation of the statute, we agree that evidence that the defendant simply made alcohol and cocaine available for use by a willing eighteen year old is not sufficient to prove that the defendant drugged her for unlawful sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>intercourse. The defendant\u2019s conviction of violating G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 3, must be reversed and judgment entered for the defendant on that indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Concerning the limited portion of the appeal on which we granted further appellate review, the judgments of conviction on the indictments charging rape and the indictment charging indecent assault and battery are affirmed. The judgment of conviction on the indictment charging drugging a person for unlawful sexual intercourse is reversed, the verdict set aside, and judgment entered for the defendant. Because the sentences on the defendant\u2019s other convictions were to run concurrently with his sentence for drugging a person for unlawful sexual intercourse, the case is remanded for resentencing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>444 Mass. 586, 597-598 (2005) (remanding for resentencing where erroneously applied sentence of lifetime community parole \u201cmay have played a part in the judge\u2019s over-all concept in sentencing the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">One police officer testified that he tried to interview the victim on the afternoon of February 3, but had to stop because the victim was tired, had a very hard time understanding what he was saying, and had difficulty speaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The two indictments charging rape were based on the defendant\u2019s inserting his finger in the victim\u2019s vagina and kissing and licking her vaginal area. The indictment charging indecent assault and battery was based on the defendant\u2019s placing his mouth on her breasts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">There was sufficient evidence that the defendant knew or should have known that the victim was not capable of consenting. He provided a dozen beers, wine, and cocaine that the victim consumed. The testimony of the victim\u2019s friends, father, and the first police officer who interviewed her was evidence of her impaired condition. Moreover, the fact that each time the victim rebuffed the defendant\u2019s sexual advances he told her to ingest more cocaine, after which she could not recall how her clothes \u201ccame off,\u201d allows an inference that the defendant was aware of the effect of the drugs and alcohol on the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBIanc, </em>73 Mass.

In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatro, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 921 (1997), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 104 (1993), the defendants were convicted of violating G.
