L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H (competitive bidding statute), where the developer agreed to assume the risks of construction and maintain ownership of the land and buildings, but the university provided detailed specifications for the facility and retained significant control over the construction process. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the competitive bidding statute did not apply because the agreement was for the lease of a completed student dormitory and not a contract for construction of a dormitory by the university. She therefore allowed the developer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">1. <em>Background and procedural history. </em>We set forth the undisputed material facts gleaned from the summary judgment record, reserving for later discussion certain terms in the request for proposals (RFP) and the agreement subsequently entered into between the plaintiff and the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">In February and March of 2008, the university, a division of the publicly-funded University of Massachusetts system, see G. L. c. 75, \u00a7 1, issued an RFP for the lease of a student dormitory in the city of Lowell (city) to provide housing for 120 to 400 students.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The RFP sought a five-year lease with the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>to extend the agreement for two additional five-year terms. The RFP did not provide that the resident housing complex be newly constructed but did provide detailed requirements for the proposed dormitory, particularly in the area of building security.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The RFP set forth an occupancy schedule under which, if construction were required, the project was to be completed within fifteen months, and stated that the occupancy date was a critical factor in any proposal; the facility had to be available for occupancy by August, 2009, in time for the university\u2019s fall, 2009, term.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The university was not required to make any payments until the dormitory was available for occupancy, and there were substantial penalties, including costs of replacement housing and storage of goods, if the selected bidder did not meet the work schedule. The university was responsible only for the lease payment amounts, and not for any increases in construction costs or other costs during the lease period.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Under the terms of the RFP, the selected bidder would maintain the building and grounds in good repair for the period of the lease; provide day-to-day upkeep such as snow removal, landscape maintenance, trash removal, and daily cleaning of the facility; and assume all costs of operation and maintenance. The bidder was responsible for all utility payments, including telephone, Internet access, and cable television. The bidder was required to maintain liability insurance on the property, with the university as an additional named insured. The RFP included a sample form lease;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> among other provisions, the sample lease stated that it could not be assigned, nor could any easement be granted on the property, without the university\u2019s written approval. The bidding process was open and public, but the RFP did not conform to the competitive bidding statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the contrary, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>RFP stated that selection would not necessarily be based on the lowest price among \u201cresponsible\u201d bidders. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D, and note 15, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The plaintiff, Brasi Development Corp. (Brasi), was one of seven companies to respond with bid proposals. Three of the bidders, including Brasi, proposed to construct new buildings; two proposed renovation of existing structures; and two proposed using existing structures \u201cas is.\u201d Brasi had never built student housing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and had not been certified by the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) as a \u201cresponsible\u201d public bidder under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Brasi was eventually chosen as the developer, subject to additional conditions not included in the terms of the original RFP. The university and Brasi entered into negotiations for a \u201cLease Agreement\u201d based on the terms of the sample lease agreement that had been attached to the RFP. The \u201cLease Agreement\u201d was for an initial five-year term, renewable in five-year terms, at the university\u2019s option, for up to a total of thirty years; this term was different from that in the RFP. See part 3.d, <em>infra. </em>The property would at all times be owned by Brasi.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Before the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d was executed, an unsuccessful bidder, Academic Village Foundation, Inc. (Academic), filed a bid protest notice with the Attorney General,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> asserting that there had been unfair collusion between the university and Brasi, and that, since Brasi had previously obtained zoning changes permitting it to build a dormitory for the university, Brasi had an unfair advantage in bidding on the current project. The Foundation for Fair Contracting of Massachusetts filed a separate bid protest on the ground that the proposed dormitory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>was not a lease, but rather a project to construct a public building, and that the bidding process had failed to comply with the competitive bidding statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Brasi and the university signed the \u201cLease Agreement\u201d while a decision on the bid protests was pending. Following an investigation and a bid protest hearing, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, the Attorney General issued a combined decision on both protests, concluding that the university\u2019s RFP was a proposal to construct a public building, subject to the competitive bidding statute, and that the agreement between Brasi and the university was entered into in violation of those laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In reliance on the Attorney General\u2019s bid protest decision, the university attempted to terminate its contract with Brasi.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Brasi filed an action against the university and the Attorney General in the Superior Court, seeking a judgment declaring that the bid protest decision was incorrect and that the provisions of the competitive bidding statute were not applicable to the lease agreement. The Attorney General counterclaimed, asserting that the bid protest decision should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The university moved successfully to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff sought no relief from the university. Brasi and the Attorney General filed cross motions for summary judgment. Concluding that the agreement between Brasi and the university was a lease for a newly-constructed building rather than an agreement to construct a building, and therefore was not subject to the competitive bidding statute, a judge in the Superior Court allowed Brasi\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered entry of judgment accordingly. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s request for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>2. <em>Statutory requirements. </em>Because the issue here is whether the university\u2019s resident housing project was subject to the competitive bidding statute, and because the university\u2019s acquisition or lease of real property is subject to the requirements of other statutes, we discuss the relevant portions of these statutes in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The competitive bidding statute sets forth detailed procedures governing the process that State agencies must follow in soliciting and accepting proposals for public construction projects. Pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D), \u201c[ejvery contract for the construction, reconstmction, installation, demolition, maintenance or repair of any building by a public agency estimated to cost more than $100,000, except for a pumping station . . . , shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible general bidder on the basis of competitive bids in accordance with the procedure set forth in sections 44A to 44H, inclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The competitive bidding statute was substantially modified in 1980 in response to the findings of the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings (Ward Commission) that public construction projects in the Commonwealth were plagued by rampant favoritism in awarding bids and \u201cshoddy\u201d construction practices. See St. 1980, c. 579; St. 2004, c. 193; <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Norwell, </em>430 Mass. 328, 332 (1999); Final Report to the General Court of the Special Commission Concerning State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>and County Buildings, Vol. 1, 21-39 (Dec. 31, 1980) (Ward Commission Report). The purposes of the competitive bidding statute are to eliminate favoritism and corruption; to ensure an open and honest bidding process and an equal playing field for all bidders; and to ensure that qualified contractors build public buildings that are suitable for the uses for which they are intended. See <em>John T. Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>430 Mass. 124, 128 (1999), quoting <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984), and <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982). See also St. 1980, c. 579, preamble; Ward Commission Report at 29-30. The statute is designed to safeguard public funds by preventing unqualified contractors from working on public buildings; providing the awarding authority the most favorable price consistent with satisfactory construction; and reducing the risk that construction projects will not be completed. See St. 1980, c. 579, preamble; <em>Annese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>431 Mass. 763, 767 (2000). See also <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The competitive bidding statute sets forth stringent requirements for precertification of contractors to assure that bidders will be able to complete the proposed project in terms both of their professional experience and their financial circumstances. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (2), (3); 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.03 (2005). Where a construction project is estimated to exceed $10 million, additional precertification requirements apply. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D\u00bd. Only contractors who are precertified for the amount of a given project are considered \u201cresponsible\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> public bidders \u201celigible\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to submit bids for construction projects. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A, 44D. DCAM has supervisory authority over State construction contracts, see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 39A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>39B, 39D, 40A, 40G, and certifies contractors as eligible public bidders. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Attorney General is charged with investigating allegations of violations of the competitive bidding statute and enforcing its provisions. Investigations of alleged violations are initiated when a \u201cbid protest,\u201d alleging a violation of the competitive bidding statute, is filed with the fair labor and business practices unit of the Attorney General\u2019s office. After investigation and an evidentiary hearing, the Attorney General issues a \u201cbid protest decision\u201d allowing or denying the protest. If the Attorney General determines that a violation has occurred, she may bring an action in the Superior Court seeking to enjoin an agreement or otherwise to enforce a bid protest decision. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 27C (a), 44H. See also <em>Annese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 771. Where an agreement is subject to the competitive bidding statute and the statutory requirements are hot met, the agreement is invalid and unenforceable. See <em>Majestic Radiator Enclosure Co. </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Middlesex, </em>397 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">A State agency\u2019s acquisition of interests in real property, whether by lease or purchase, is regulated by the provisions of several other statutes. State entities are subject to stringent public notice and oversight requirements when entering into lease agreements. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 40G, 40H; G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 16. DCAM has supervisory authority over all State rental agreements. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 39A, 39B, 40G. The office of the Inspector General is responsible for preventing \u201cfraud, waste and abuse in the expenditure of public funds\u201d on State \u201cconstruction\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> contracts either for lease or purchase. See G. L. c. 12A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The university is independently authorized to lease, purchase, and manage property. See G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. Although the university is generally free from oversight by other State agencies, see St. 1960, c. 773, \u00a7 18, it is subject to the statutory provisions governing capital facility projects under DCAM, see G. L. c. 75, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as well as to the competitive bidding laws. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>See St. 1998, c. 319, \u00a7 15; G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 7E.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See also <em>Associated Subcontrs. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Bldg. Auth., </em>442 Mass. 159, 160 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The Attorney General contends that the agreement between Brasi and the university was a contract for construction of a public building. She argues that the university sought to construct, rather than lease, a building because the RFP sets forth \u201cextraordinarily detailed\u201d and \u201cvery specialized\u201d design requirements that required a new, special-purpose building. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 680-681, 683-684 (2009) (city\u2019s hiring of architect to produce detailed design documents that were part of RFP for animal shelter was factor in decision that RFP was subject to competitive bidding statute). The Attorney General relies most extensively on the degree of supervision and control that the university maintained over the construction process as indicating that Brasi was acting as the university\u2019s agent. She cites also the potential thirty-year length of the agreement and the specific conditions governing the university\u2019s occupancy of the property. The Attorney General argues that Brasi\u2019s building permit, obtained prior to the issuance of the RFP, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>indicates that the university intended indefinite use of the proposed dormitory, and that the highly \u201cspecialized\u201d nature of the dormitory, in conjunction with the provisions of the building permit, meant that any change in use of the property would require substantial, time-consuming, and costly modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In addition, although the bid protest decision declined to address these issues, and the judge did not consider them in ruling on Brasi\u2019s action for a declaratory judgment, the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>argues that, based on the short time frame (fifteen months) between the date of acceptance of the bid and the required occupancy date, Brasi had an unfair advantage because it had previously obtained zoning approval to build a dormitory; she maintains that, for all practical purposes, there may have been no other bidder able to compete with Brasi since other bidders would be unable to obtain zoning approval to construct a dormitory in the required time frame. Lastly, the Attorney General argues that, pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, she is responsible for enforcing the competitive bidding statute, and we should therefore accord substantial deference to her decisions interpreting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Brasi asserts that the judge determined correctly that the university sought a true lease and not a disguised construction contract. Brasi contends that it owned the land, assumed all risks and costs of construction, and would have owned and maintained the newly-built facility. While the university was responsible for fixed lease payments, Brasi was required to pay taxes, utilities and other costs, and assumed as well the risk of damage or destruction of the building; any damage to the building not repaired within 150 days would allow the university to cancel the lease. Brasi was required to maintain liability insurance on the property, to assume all liability for injuries incurred by residents and visitors to the premises, and to indemnify the university for any such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In addition, Brasi argues that the developer was responsible for the costs of maintenance and repair of the property, as well as the day-to-day operation and cleaning of the building and grounds. Brasi states there was no unfair competition, and there is no basis in the record for the Attorney General\u2019s finding that the university will most likely seek to acquire the facility at the end of the lease. Finally, Brasi contends that the Attorney General does not have the type of discretionary rule-making authority under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, that would entitle her interpretation of the public bidding statute to deference. See <em>Annese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>431 Mass. 763, 771 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Ordinarily, we review a question of statutory interpretation de nova. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>453 Mass. 614, 620 (2009), citing <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). The Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>General has no rule-making authority with respect to the competitive bidding statute and no broad discretion in issuing enforcement decisions. Contrast <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 239-240 (2001), and <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 471, 474-475, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983). The competitive bidding statute sets forth detailed criteria concerning virtually every aspect of the bidding process and the manner in which it is to be conducted, and the Attorney General has authority only to \u201crequire compliance\u201d with its terms if, \u201cafter investigation of the facts, [s]he has made a finding that [a bid] award or performance has resulted in violation\u201d of the statutory provisions. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H. Because the decision involves neither an adjudicatory proceeding nor rule making, we conclude, as we did in similar circumstances in <em>Amese Elec. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra, </em>that the Attorney General\u2019s decision interpreting the competitive bidding statute should be accorded no deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">b. <em>Whether the competitive bidding statute is applicable to requests for long-term lease agreements. </em>\u201cWe construe [the competitive bidding statute], as we must, in light of the legislative objectives which were served by its enactment so as to effectuate the purpose of the framers.\u201d <em>John T. Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>430 Mass. 124, 128 (1999), quoting <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757 (1975). Consistent with its broad remedial purpose, the competitive bidding statute is to be strictly construed. See <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The judge decided that the lease agreement between Brasi and the university was not \u201cthe functional equivalent of a construction contract\u201d because Brasi retained ownership of the land and the building, assumed the risks and costs of construction, and assumed also the costs of ownership of the finished dormitory. The judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cAlthough the student housing project at issue clearly contemplated construction activities, [the university\u2019s] primary objective has always been to lease a student housing facility. All costs associated with the construction of the facility are to be paid by Brasi. [The university\u2019s] obligation to pay rent, on the other hand, is unrelated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the costs of construction, and does not commence until the date of occupancy. Brasi has retained ownership of the property and bears all risks associated therewith, including the risk of casualty loss and the obligation to maintain the property in good repair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Thus, the judge determined that the agreement was not subject to the competitive bidding statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The Legislature has provided no guidance for distinguishing a lease by a public agency from a construction contract subject to the competitive bidding statute, and we have had little opportunity to construe the competitive bidding statute in this respect. Therefore, we look more generally to our decisions regarding other statutes requiring public bidding. See <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 836 n.9, citing <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 690 (1980); <em>Modem Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 840. See also <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 684 (2009), citing <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, supra </em>at 695-696.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We have concluded previously that other statutes requiring competitive public bidding may be broad enough to encompass long-term leases. See <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, supra </em>at 688 n.7, 695 (agreement to lease computer system for State lottery, where agency retained option to purchase equipment at end of lease period, was actually agreement to purchase equipment and was therefore subject to general procurement statute, G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22). In that case, we determined that, because the general procurement statute applies to both purchases and to agreements \u201ccontracting for . . . equipment,\u201d it is broad enough to include a lease. See <em>id. </em>Otherwise, the parties could easily employ long-term leases to evade the \u201ccompetitive bidding requirement\u201d of the procurement statute. <em>Id. </em>at 695-696. In addition, the Appeals Court has recently decided that an agreement described as a long-term lease of an animal control center was in essence a contract for construction of a public building, and therefore that public bidding on the project was required pursuant to the provisions of the competitive bidding statute. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra </em>at 683-685.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">We agree with the Appeals Court that a contract for a long-term lease may, in some circumstances, be subject to the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ments of the competitive bidding statute. The statute, which is to be strictly construed, applies to construction \u201cof any building by a public agency,\u201d without limitation to buildings that will be owned by the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D). Exempting agreements labeled \u201cleases\u201d that are intended clearly to create buildings for long-term use by public agencies defeats the purposes of the competitive bidding statute. The issue before us, then, is to define those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">c. <em>Test to determine when a lease agreement is subject to the competitive bidding statute. A </em>determination whether a project is construction \u201cof any building by a public agency\u201d is fact specific and cannot be based on any single factor. In the context of other public bidding statutes in the Commonwealth, the use of public funds, the length of the agreement, the use of private contractors or construction on private land, and whether relatively minor renovations are required that nonetheless exceed a statutory limit for construction projects have not been determinative. See <em>Norfolk Elec., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>417 Mass. 207, 208-209, 213-214, 216 n.8 (1994) (renovation of low income housing project with Federal funds was subject to State public bidding law where State agency had \u201cday-to-day control\u201d of operation); <em>Helmes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 873, 874, 876-877 (1990) (public procurement statute did not apply because charity was not acting as agent of Commonwealth); <em>Salem Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 361-362 (1980) (private development of apartment complex for low income residents not construction of public building subject to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, because housing agency only provided financing and developer retained control of project).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Without explicitly setting forth a new test, the Appeals Court relied on a multifactor analysis in reaching its determination that the city of Springfield\u2019s (Springfield\u2019s) long-term lease agreement for construction of an animal shelter was actually construction of a building by a State agency that was subject to the competitive bidding statute. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra </em>at 683-684. In that case, Springfield entered into a twenty-five year lease with a private firm to build the animal shelter according to Springfield\u2019s specifications. <em>Id. </em>at 681. The Appeals Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>examined the character of the RFP that Springfield issued to determine if the competitive bidding statute applied. <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As significant factors supporting its decision that the lease agreement was subject to the competitive bidding statute, the Appeals Court emphasized the length of the lease; the detailed design and construction requirements that Springfield set forth; the degree of Springfield\u2019s control over the construction process; and the fact that the lease payments were more than the costs of constructing the building. See <em>id. </em>at 682-684. Primary factors in the analysis were that, as stated in the RFP, Springfield intended to acquire an animal shelter for long-term use, and retained an option to purchase the facility for one dollar at the end of the lease, thereby obtaining the facility through lease payments using public funds. <em>Id. </em>at 683. Additionally, the Appeals Court observed that its holding was consistent with the statutory language applying to \u201c[ejvery contract for the construction ... of any building by a public agency,\u201d and that to allow Springfield to evade the competitive bidding laws by styling a construction contract as a lease agreement was contrary to the statutory purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 684-685.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We agree with the analysis of the Appeals Court in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra </em>at 683-685, and with the factors it considered. We conclude that no specific set of factors will be sufficient for every situation, and that a totality of the circumstances test, which examines the circumstances in each case in detail, is the best approach for determining whether \u201cbuild to lease\u201d agreements are subject to the competitive bidding statute. Factors that may be helpful, but not dispositive, in determining whether a project is subject to the competitive bidding statute include the extent of control retained by the agency during development and construction; the length of the proposed lease, including any proposed extensions; whether the source of money is public funds; whether payments made under the agreement essentially cover the costs of construction; whether the State agency retains an option to purchase for a nominal sum at the end of the lease period or whether the building automatically transfers to the public agency on expiration of the lease; whether the agency initially owned the land and then sold or leased it to the private party, or whether the agency had the building constructed and then leased the newly constructed building; and whether the facility is of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>specialized nature that would render it unsuitable for another commercial purpose without significant renovations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">d. <em>Nature of the university\u2019s agreement with Brasi. </em>In granting summary judgment on Brasi\u2019s declaratory judgment action, the judge declared, in our view erroneously, that the contract between Brasi and the university was \u201cfor the lease of a completed student dormitory, rather than the construction of a building by a public agency.\u201d Although the factors the judge considered in reaching her decision were appropriate, her conclusion that the project was not construction of a building by a public agency was error. Applying the multifactor analysis discussed in part 3.c, <em>supra, </em>and considering all the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the lease agreement was subject to the competitive bidding statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The competitive bidding statute governs all construction \u201cof a building by a public agency.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D). It is to be strictly construed to effect its remedial purposes. See <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984). The statute does not distinguish between buildings that a public agency will own and buildings that a public agency will lease. Rather, it focuses on the creation of a project by the agency for the agency\u2019s use in carrying out its public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Were we to consider only the character of the RFP, as has been done in other contexts, see <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 695 (1980); <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 683 (2009),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we would agree with Brasi that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the dormitory project was not subject to the competitive bidding statute. However, limiting the inquiry to the RFP ignores relevant circumstances that have a direct bearing on the transaction that the parties contemplated. In the context of this case, where the lease agreement was signed only three months after the bidder was selected, and significant terms were included in that agreement that were not included in the university\u2019s RFP, we must consider the provisions of both documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We recognize that contracts acceptable to a private bidder will necessarily differ in some respects from the terms of an RFP. We acknowledge also that, in certain circumstances, it will not be practical to review the terms of a contract that the parties may have executed long after the selection of a particular bidder. Here, however, the RFP was issued in February, 2008; the bidder was selected in May, 2008; and Brasi and the university executed the lease agreement on August 1, 2008, well before any construction had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The agreement the university ultimately entered into with the selected bidder differs substantially in provisions that are critical to a determination whether the agreement was a contract for construction by a public agency. In situations such as the one here, considering only the RFP would defeat entirely the purposes of the competitive bidding statute. If agencies are permitted to issue an RFP that is not subject to the competitive bidding statute, yet then place in a subsequent agreement key terms that indicate that the agreement is in fact a construction contract, the objectives of the competitive bidding statute would easily be frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Ultimately, the residential housing project here involved creation of a new building, adjacent to the university\u2019s campus and dependent on the use of the university\u2019s parking lot, which the university had the right to occupy for thirty years. These facts persuade us that the dormitory project was indeed construction of a building by the university in the sense contemplated by the competitive bidding statute. Certain modified provisions are critical to our conclusion that the final agreement is one for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>construction of a residential housing facility, including the material change in the length of the agreement (doubling its length), and the increased degree of the university\u2019s supervision of the construction process from that in the RFP. We also deem critical several provisions that were added to the lease agreement that were not part of the RFP, particularly the facts that the new facility depends on other property already owned by the university, and that the university is granting Brasi an easement, apparently unlimited in duration, for use of university land.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We begin by examining the significant number of factors in the RFP establishing that the project proposed in the RFP itself was not subject to the competitive bidding statute. Then we consider deviations from the RFP that were made in the final agreement between Brasi and the university which rendered it a contract for construction by the university subject to the competitive bidding statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Standing alone, the RFP sought the use of land and buildings owned and maintained by proposed bidders and did not involve university property. Although the RFP initially required an option to purchase if the proposed bidder chose to sell the property during the lease term, that requirement was eliminated at a prebid conference where an amended RFP was issued. The sample lease attached to the RFP, as well as the agreement eventually executed with Brasi, required that the university relinquish possession on termination of the agreement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The length of the lease term set forth in the RFP was consistent with the university\u2019s assertion that it intended a short-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>occupancy. Not only was the lease period in the RFP of relatively short duration (five years, with options for two five-year extensions), the RFP placed all risk of nonrenewal on the lessor. If a bidder responded with a proposal to construct a building, that bidder would have no assurance of recouping its construction costs during the initial five-year term of the lease, and would be certain of the university\u2019s occupancy for no more than five years. Indeed, Brasi\u2019s proposal indicated that it would have incurred at least $25 million in construction costs (in addition to the cost of acquisition of the property) before the university was required to make any lease payments, and that the university would have guaranteed to pay only $8 million towards those costs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Furthermore, we note that DCAM\u2019s standard lease agreement is for a five-year term with options to renew at the discretion of the lessee. See Town of Hadley, Trial Court Leasing Project, Bid Protest Decision (January 31, 2003), at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We turn next to the type of building required by the university. The RFP sought a residential facility containing a mixture of one- and two-bedroom apartments to house 120 to 400 students. It required a minimum of ninety to one hundred square feet per student in each bedroom and one two-bedroom apartment for a resident director for each 250 students. It stated also that the facility should not \u201cconflict with\u201d the university\u2019s or the city\u2019s architecture, and should be \u201cattractive to college students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">As is evident from the responses received by the university, a new building clearly was not required under the terms of the RFP. After reviewing the RFP at the university\u2019s request to determine the zoning approvals that would be needed, a city manager concluded that existing multifamily residential buildings could be used to satisfy the RFP without any change in zoning or additional permits. The city manager\u2019s letter of opinion was distributed to all potential bidders. In fact, four of the seven proposals submitted in response to the RFP were for the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>existing structures, and two of those proposed structures were to be used without any modifications. The judge observed correctly: \u201cIt bears noting that if Brasi had already completed construction of the facility, the substance of the parties\u2019 agreement would remain the same. A fully constructed facility would equally qualify for consideration under the RFP, as would a proposal to modify an existing structure. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The record indicates also that the building described in Brasi\u2019s proposal, to which Brasi\u2019s earlier permit would apply according to the city manager\u2019s letter, could readily have been used as an ordinary apartment building at the end of the lease term. The permit issued to Brasi allowed a \u201cdormitory\u201d use of the property.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Under the city\u2019s zoning code, a \u201cdormitory\u201d use of a multifamily building differs only in that the city-wide restriction of no more than three unrelated individuals living in any one apartment unit does not apply (i.e., a two-bedroom apartment in a \u201cdormitory\u201d can house four students, whereas the same apartment can house only three students in a \u201cmulti-family\u201d unit).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, Brasi would have had an economically viable use of the building after the expiration of the lease term contemplated in the RFP. This factor weighs in favor of a conclusion that the agreement was not subject to the competitive bidding laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Next, we consider the degree of the university\u2019s control over the design requirements. We conclude that the university did not retain significant control of the design specifications in the RFP. Bidders responded to a set of basic requirements for a student residential housing facility consisting of one- and two-bedroom apartments. See <em>J.F. White Contr. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 816 (2001). The RFP required bidders to submit documents and specifications showing the design and floor plans of the building or buildings, and stated that the university would evaluate all proposals for attractiveness of design, quality of materials, durability, and cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Unlike the very specialized requirements for construction of an animal shelter discussed in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 683 (2009), nothing in the university\u2019s RFP indicates the \u201cextraordinary\u201d level of specialized design suggested by the Attorney General. To the contrary, many of the requirements are basic and standard for any multifamily residential housing. For instance, the requirements of a window and a closet in each bedroom, peepholes in apartment doors, mail boxes meeting United States Post Office standards in the entry area, and compliance with Federal accessibility requirements for disabled individuals are common and would generally be mandated by provisions of the city zoning code and Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Certain provisions for electrical systems and security features were peculiar to the university. In separate schedules, the RFP contained requirements for Internet, telephone, and cable television access in each room, and security features, including video cameras at outside entrances, capable of connecting to the university\u2019s computer network. However, as the bid protest decision observed, the fact that an agreement contemplates some level of customization or \u201cbuild out\u201d of leased space is \u201ccommon\u201d in commercial leases, and tenants\u2019 involvement in this process does not convert a lease into a construction agreement. See, for example, the following bid protest decisions: Four Rivers Charter School, School Construction Project, Bid Protest Decision (September 24, 2004); Pioneer Valley Performing Arts School, Bid Protest Decision (April 20, 2004); Town of Hadley, Trial Court Leasing Project, Bid Protest Decision (January 31, 2003). Contrast <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra </em>at 680-681, 683-684 (city controlled design specifications where city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>hired architect to develop detailed design and construction documents, attached them to RFP, and required all bidders to comply with those specifications; specifications included location of over eighty-five rooms in building, required finishes for all surfaces, descriptions of tiles, flooring, and paint, and specific manufacturers and model numbers for fixtures and fittings).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Thus, the terms of the RFP, viewed in isolation, indicate that the university\u2019s dormitory project contemplated the leasing of a building that might or might not already exist; was not a construction project; and therefore was not subject to the competitive bidding statute. However, that is not the end of the inquiry. As stated, several significant provisions in the RFP were materially altered in the lease agreement. The modified provisions in the final agreement contrast markedly with important terms of the RFP and change the character of the project. In addition, the lease agreement contained several provisions that formed no part of the RFP and which indicate an intention by the university to exercise long-term control of the dormitory.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">First, while the RFP sought an initial five-year lease period, with an option to extend by the university for two additional five-year terms, the agreement ultimately executed between Brasi and the university provided for a maximum of a thirty-year lease; it included an initial five-year lease period, with automatic renewal of the lease for two additional five-year periods (rent to be negotiated), and then an option on the part of the university to renew for up to three additional five-year terms. The contractual provision allowing the university to use the dormitory for thirty years supports a conclusion that the university intended to acquire the facility or at least to retain effective permanent control thereof. In any event, the guaranteed fifteen-year period of the lease, with extensions totaling another fifteen years, is substantially different from that described in the RFP; thus, the provision suggests that the requirements set forth in the RFP did not reflect the university\u2019s true purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In addition, the agreement eventually negotiated by the parties provided for the construction by Brasi of an entirely new building. While creation of a new structure is not determinative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>see, e.g., Town of Hadley, Trial Court Leasing Project, Bid Protest Decision (January 31, 2003), it is a factor that is entitled to weight in this case, in conjunction with other factors such as the length of the lease, in deciding whether there is construction \u201cof a building by a public agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The degree of supervision and control that the university maintained over the construction process is also a meaningful factor here. This factor was relied on extensively by the Attorney General as evidence that Brasi was acting as the university\u2019s agent. The RFP stated that the successful bidder would be responsible for managing the project and maintaining liability insurance. It provided only that the university would have approval of the architectural design and the construction materials, and does not tend to indicate university control over the day-to-day construction. The lease agreement, however, provided the university significantly greater control and approval over the construction process. Most particularly, the university had the right to attend weekly construction meetings and to approve various phases of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The judge considered the terms of the lease agreement, and determined that the university\u2019s right to attend weekly meetings and approve various phases of construction represented only \u201climited participation in the construction process\u201d and that \u201cmonitoring the building\u2019s development is the only practical means of safeguarding the [ujniversity\u2019s interests.\u201d However, in our view, the agreement\u2019s provisions allowed more than \u201climited\u201d participation in the construction process. The lease agreement allowed the university to exercise supervisory authority and approval at least over major phases of the construction, and to have an ongoing role in monitoring the building process. Thus, the university retained substantially greater supervision over construction than was described in the RFR The level of supervision afforded the university is similar in kind to the city of Springfield\u2019s right to hire a \u201cconstruction-manager to inspect and approve each phase of the construction,\u201d see <em>Andrews </em>v. Springfield, <em>supra </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Thus, it is apparent that the parties\u2019 ultimate agreement departed in material respects from what appeared in the RFP. What started as a relatively short-term occupancy of a building that might already exist ended as a potentially long-term com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>mitment to a new structure over which the university would exercise considerable influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Other terms in the agreement that were not part of the RFP provide additional indications that the agreement contemplated construction of a dormitory by the university in the sense embraced by the competitive bidding statute. Importantly, the lease agreement would have resulted in creation of a building that was dependent on the continuing use of university land. As stated, Brasi had obtained previously a zoning permit for the never-undertaken dormitory project that Brasi had proposed to the university. That permit had a provision stating that parking for the proposed dormitory would be in one of the parking lots on the university\u2019s campus, because Brasi\u2019s property was not large enough to contain a parking lot of the size necessary to meet city zoning requirements for the ratio of parking spaces to student beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The RFP required that bidders proposing development describe their plans for obtaining approval from the city. In response, Brasi submitted the permit it had obtained previously and a letter from the city stating that the earlier permit could be used for the dormitory sought in the RFP. Both the permit and the university\u2019s acceptance of the permit requirements were incorporated in the terms of the lease agreement. The lease provided that the university agreed to the use of its parking lot for dormitory parking. Thus, the lease agreement would have resulted in Brasi owning a building that was dependent on the indefinite use of university land in order to comply with the requirements of Brasi\u2019s building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Furthermore, to alleviate its concerns over the proximity of Brasi\u2019s property to a commuter rail line, in its conditional acceptance letter the university required Brasi to build, at no additional cost to the university, a climate controlled and handicapped accessible pedestrian bridge over the tracks as well as a twelve-foot fence along Brasi\u2019s property line abutting the railroad property. The university agreed also that, to facilitate placement of the pedestrian bridge, it would grant Brasi an easement over a portion of the university parking lot. These conditions, including the university\u2019s commitment to grant Brasi such an easement, were incorporated in the lease agreement. Thus, the lease agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>transferred to Brasi an interest in a portion of the university campus and permitted Brasi an indefinite use of another portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The additional provisions in the lease concerning construction of the pedestrian bridge on a portion of the university\u2019s parking lot, and use of the university\u2019s existing parking lot to meet zoning requirements for dormitory parking, suggest that the university intends indefinite use of the proposed dormitory and eventually to incorporate the dormitory into the university campus. Given the university\u2019s acknowledged urgent need for student housing, such a conclusion is not inconsistent with the university\u2019s stated intention of doubling the capacity of the dormitory facilities on its existing property.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Attorney General makes several arguments regarding financial factors that have been significant to determinations made in other cases. However, because the record does not contain adequate information to support these arguments, we are unable to evaluate these factors in this case. Therefore, although such financial factors could have an impact on a determination whether the agreement was a lease or a contract for construction, we reach no conclusion on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Considering all the provisions of the RFP and the lease agreement in this case, including the relevant changes that we have identified, we conclude that the university\u2019s agreement with Brasi was subject to the competitive bidding statute. Therefore, we conclude that the lease agreement was for construction of a dormitory by the university, and was entered into in violation of the competitive bidding statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The competitive bidding statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, is applicable to the university\u2019s agreement with Brasi to develop and maintain a student dormitory near its campus.

The finding is disputed by both Brasi and the university; both contend that the proposal- of Academic Village Foundation, Inc., which the Attorney General found to be the lowest bid, was nonresponsive because it failed to meet the scheduling requirements in the RFP, and also that it would have resulted in annual costs to students that would have been almost twice as much per student as Brasi\u2019s proposal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Brasi disagreed, claiming that the university had no grounds on which to cancel the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Although the university canceled its contract with Brasi after the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>General issued her bid protest decision, the parties agree that the case is not moot.

L. c. 7, \u00a7 41C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Courts in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue have also applied a fact-specific, multifactor test. See, e.g., <em>Division of Labor Standards </em>v. <em>Friends of the Zao of Springfield, </em>38 S.W.3d 421, 422-424 (Mo. 2001); <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Camdenton, </em>779 S.W.2d 312, 313-314, 316-317 (Mo. Ct. App. 1989); <em>United States Corrections Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Indus.

Va. 456, 469-472 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The Attorney General has cited the detailed multifactor test set forth by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, see <em>Affiliated Constr. Trades Found, </em>v. <em>University of W. Va. Bd. of Trustees, supra, </em>in some of her bid protest decisions. See, e.g., Enlace de Familias de Holyoke/Holyoke Community Charter School, Bid Protest Decision (July 15, 2002), at 10-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\"><em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 695 (1980), concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the general procurement statute (G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22), not the competitive bidding statute. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Springfield </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 683 (2009), although evaluating the statute at issue here, relied on cases interpreting other public bidding statutes, notably <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purch. Agent, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In seeking reconsideration of the bid protest decision, the university submitted documents asserting that the RFP contemplated a short-term lease to meet immediate needs while the university developed long-term plans to double its student housing by new construction on its existing campus that would include other facilities as well. The university stated that it was working with its building authority, see G. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, to develop an over-all site plan encompassing the three separate parcels of land that constitute the university\u2019s campus and to generate adequate funds; that this was a well-documented public project; and that the current chancellor was selected in part because of his commitment to this development. The Attorney General does not dispute these assertions. Moreover, in another bid protest decision, the Attorney General has relied on an agency\u2019s plans for separate long-term development as indicating that a shorter-term lease was not construction subject to the competitive bidding laws. See Town of Hadley, Trial Court Leasing Project, Bid Protest Decision (January 31, 2003), at 7, 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Based on documents in Brasi\u2019s proposal, in addition to the purchase costs of the property, it would have entered into a $22.5 million bank loan to construct the building, and would have paid over $1 million annually in taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, while the university was obligated to pay only $2.6 million annually (including costs for utilities, telephone service, cable television, snow removal, and daily cleaning) for no more than a five-year period and only after the building was useable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The permit required Brasi to enter into a thirty-year lease with the university and to seek zoning board approval before converting the building to any other use. In its motion to reconsider, the university stated both its belief that this condition was invalid and unenforceable and its understanding that the condition had subsequently been removed from the permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The city manager\u2019s zoning opinion letter; attached to the RFP, explained also that in the \u201cinstitutional\u201d zone, where dormitory use is allowed as of right, no zoning approvals would be required. Obtaining a special permit (new or existing building) or site plan approval (new building) for a \u201cdormitory\u201d use in the numerous zones where such uses were permissible would take three to four months. Obtaining a zoning change for a dormitory use in a zone where a dormitory use was not permitted would generally take from four to six months. Thus, the city manager\u2019s zoning opinion letter does not support the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that no other bidders would be able to compete effectively with Brasi, given the eighteen-month period from issuance of the RFP to the occupancy date, because Brasi had an existing special permit. In addition, as long as all bidders are responding to the same set of requirements, and evaluated by the same set of criteria, the process is fair. That some bidders have advantages in experience, financial strength, or available resources does not infringe on the purpose of the competitive bidding law to allow all to compete on an equal footing. See <em>Department of Labor &amp; Indus, </em>v. <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 621, 626 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">These provisions support an inference that the university will eventually seek to acquire the facility, although our conclusion does not depend on this assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
