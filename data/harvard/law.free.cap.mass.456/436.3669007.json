He experienced \u201csudden cardiac death\u201d (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, MEA Workers\u2019 Compensation SIG (insurer), appeals from a decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (board) affirming a decision of an administrative judge awarding burial expenses under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 33, and survivor benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, to the employee\u2019s widow. The insurer argues that the board incorrectly applied G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A (\u00a7 7A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the facts of this case; the board erroneously declined to consider the insurer\u2019s defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pursuant to G.

We transferred the case from the Appeals Court, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), on our own motion. We reject these arguments and affirm the board\u2019s decision, as modified herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts found by the administrative judge and adopted by the board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On Monday, January 24, 2005, the employee was working with a coworker clearing a large amount of heavy snow from school grounds. It had snowed over the course of the weekend, leaving an accumulation of two feet of snow, and as a result, the school was closed. After arriving at work at about 7:00 a.m., the employee spent the morning operating a large, commercial-model snow blower, shoveling a tall snow drift with his coworker, and replacing a broken cotter pin on the snow blower. Although the snow blower was self-propelling, it weighed about 200 pounds and had to be manually maneuvered from side to side and around sharp corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">At 12:15 p.m., the employee went to lunch with his wife. During lunch, he did not voice any complaints or indicate that he was not feeling well. He returned to work at approximately 1:30 p.m.. At the time, it was cold outside, with temperatures ranging between nineteen and thirty-three degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The employee resumed operating the snow blower to improve the paths he had completed before lunch. His coworker heard the motor of the snow blower running continuously and, at approximately 1:50 p.m., went to check on the employee. He found the employee motionless, leaning against a snow drift \u201chigher than a man\u201d beside the snow blower. Emergency medical person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>nel were summonsed and determined on arrival that the employee had no pulse. By ambulance, the employee was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The employee had experienced SCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of a decision of the board concerning workers\u2019 compensation benefits. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). As specified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), we review the board\u2019s decision in accordance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (a)-(d), (f), and (g). <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1994). Pursuant to these statutory standards, we may reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision when it is \u201c[i]n violation of constitutional provisions,\u201d \u201c[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency,\u201d \u201c[bjased upon an error of law,\u201d \u201c[mjade upon unlawful procedure,\u201d \u201c[ujnwarranted by facts found . . . where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact,\u201d or is \u201c[ajrbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(a)-(d), (f), </em>and (g). Under these standards, in determining whether the board properly affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s findings, we consider \u201cwhether the decision is factually warranted and not \u2018[ajrbitrary or capricious,\u2019 in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making.\u201d <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 258. See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 457 (1993) (standards identified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 [2], \u201cmay overlap with the substantial evidence standard\u201d). Where a statute is involved, \u201c[ajlthough \u2018[tjhe interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference,\u2019 <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), ultimately the \u2018duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u2019 <em>Slater\u2019s Case, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330 (2002).\u201d <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Application of \u00a7 7A. </em>The insurer asserts that the employee\u2019s SCD was inevitable and its occurrence at work was coincidental. Consequently, the insurer states that the board erred in affirming the administrative judge\u2019s decision, arguing that he improperly applied \u00a7 <em>7A </em>on the issue of the causal link between employment and death. In support of this argument, the insurer contends that the administrative judge\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>reflects a misunderstanding of the medical evidence. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Moss\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 707-708, we provided a comprehensive overview of \u00a7 7A, see note 2, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cSection 7A is designed to \u2018[t]o aid the victimf] of an unwitnessed accident\u2019 who is unable to testify and therefore has difficulty meeting the burden of proving entitlement to compensation under G. L. c. 152. L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 17.4 (3d ed. 2003). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 10.11. The section by its terms establishes prima facie evidence of four separate aspects of a workers\u2019 compensation claim: (1) \u2018that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or death\u2019; (2) \u2018that the claim comes within the provisions of [c. 152]\u2019; (3) \u2018that sufficient notice of the injury has been given\u2019; and (4) \u2018that the injury or death was not occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u2019 G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A. In <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>[373 Mass. 813 (1977)], this court held that particularly the second of these, \u2018the claim comes within the provisions of [c. 152],\u2019 reflected a legislative intent that where an employee was found dead at his job, this fact should establish prima facie evidence that the employee\u2019s death was causally related to his employment. The court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u2018For a claim to be compensable it must arise out of and in the course of employment. Clearly a causal relationship is required between the employment duties and the injury or death. In a case such as this one, where the employee was found dead at his place of employment, we construe the statute, \u00a7 7A, as establishing, inter alla, prima facie evidence of causal relationship between the employment and the injury or fatality. We believe that was the meaning intended by the Legislature, particularly in its use of the words, \u201cand that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, [supra] </em>at 816-817.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">An insurer may overcome the prima facie evidentiary effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of \u00a7 7A by assuming the burden of production. In <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 817, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cPrima facie evidence, in the absence of contradictory evidence, requires a finding that the evidence is true; the prima facie evidence may be met and overcome by evidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion; even in the presence of contradictory evidence, however, the prima facie evidence is sufficient to sustain the proposition to which it is applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">If an insurer produces \u201cevidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion,\u201d <em>id., </em>on a fact set out in \u00a7 7A, a question of fact arises for an administrative judge to decide, and the judge must weigh the evidence and make credibility determinations in reaching a conclusion. Such credibility determinations are within the sole province of an administrative judge and are to be considered final by both the reviewing board and an appellate court. <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 394 (1988). See <em>Pilon\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 169 (2007) (\u201cFindings of fact, assessments of credibility, and determinations of the weight to be given the evidence are the exclusive function of the administrative judge\u201d). Where, as here, \u201ccausal relation is a matter beyond the common knowledge and experience of the ordinary layman, the proof must rest upon expert medical testimony.\u201d <em>Buck\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 766, 769 (1961). \u201cThe probative value of this testimony is to be weighed by the fact-finding tribunal.\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 635 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Before addressing the insurer\u2019s arguments, we summarize the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge, as well as the conclusions drawn by the board. The administrative judge first determined that the employee was in the course of his employment when he suffered SCO and that, consequently, the prima facie evidentiary effect of \u00a7 7A applied. He credited the findings of the limited autopsy conducted of the employee\u2019s heart. The autopsy indicated that the employee was suffering from an occlusion (narrowing) of over ninety per cent of the left anterior descending coronary artery. It also revealed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>employee had \u201cpatchy subendocardial fibrosis [scarring of the heart] but no evidence of substantial old myocardial infarction [heart attack] and no evidence of acute injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The administrative judge adopted the conclusion, reached both by one of the employee\u2019s medical experts, Dr. Richard D. Patten, and by the insurer\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Milo F. Pulde, that the employee\u2019s SCD resulted from ventricular arrhythmia, see note 1, <em>supra. </em>As to the insurer\u2019s defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) concerning the effect of the employee\u2019s preexisting coronary artery disease, the administrative judge adopted Dr. Pulde\u2019s (insurer\u2019s expert) opinion that the employee did, in fact, suffer from a preexisting condition. Specifically, Dr. Pulde gave the opinion that, prior to his death, the employee suffered \u201cwith severe multivessel coronary disease with critical ninety-five per cent obstruction of the major left anterior descending artery . . . and less critical disease of the remaining arteries.\u201d Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion was based on the records of the employee\u2019s primary care physician (PCP), Dr. Arthur S. Kress, which indicated that the employee suffered, on January 4, 2005, from unstable angina<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and the autopsy finding of fibrosis, which, to Dr. Pulde, indicated that the employee had a severely diseased \u201ccoronary anatomy prior to [the date of death] that was causing damage to the heart muscle and that damage was identified at pathology as fibrosis or scarring.\u201d The administrative judge credited Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion that the employee\u2019s preexisting conditions \u201cwere medically consistent with severe non-work related multivessel coronary disease and unstable angina \u2018that culminated in either ischemia-related [loss of sufficient blood flow to the heart] polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or substrate (subendeocardial fibrosis) [diseased, scarred heart muscle] related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>. . . that degenerated [on January 24, 2005,] into ventricular fibrillation and resulted in his biological death.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The administrative judge expressly credited the following testimony of Dr. Pulde, elicited during cross-examination, concerning the effect of physical exertion on the employee\u2019s biological death: <em>\u201c[A]ny type of exertion, </em>whether one postulates that [the employee\u2019s death was] ischemia related or substrate related . . . would have precipitated [the employee\u2019s] sudden death and ... his sudden death was likely to occur in any context [in] any type of physical activity and would have occurred independent of that work activity on January 24, 2005\u201d (emphasis added). The administrative judge, however, expressly rejected Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion that the employee\u2019s work activities on January 24, 2005, did <em>not </em>trigger the medical events that culminated in his SCD.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the administrative judge credited and adopted the opinion of Dr. Kress, stating: \u201c[Dr. Kress], while recognizing that his patient suffered from several cardiac risk factors along with pre-existing cardiac conditions, offered his \u2018medical opinion that the work that [the employee] was doing on the day in question was a major contributing factor in his death.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The administrative judge concluded that \u201cthe insurer has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>brought forward convincing evidence sufficient to overcome the prima facie presumptions afforded by \u00a7 7A.\u201d He found that the employee suffered SCD arising out of and while in the course of his employment, and that the employee\u2019s work activities on January 24, 2005, were \u201ca major contributing cause of his sudden cardiac arrest and resulting death.\u201d The administrative judge further concluded that the insurer\u2019s defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The board concluded that the administrative judge \u201cproperly determined that \u00a7 7A applied to this case.\u201d Concerning the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion did not overcome the prima facie evidentiary effect of \u00a7 7A, the board determined that this conclusion was supported by the record and was \u201cconsistent with \u00a7 7A\u2019s application.\u201d Additionally, the board decided that the administrative judge\u2019s findings provided the necessary factual predicate to support his adoption of Dr. Kress\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Here, the insurer essentially asserts that once the administrative judge adopted some of Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinions, it was inconsistent and erroneous not to apply them all, specifically, Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion that the employee\u2019s work on January 24, 2005, had no causal relation to his death. Although the insurer did produce evidence, through Dr. Pulde\u2019s testimony, in an attempt to overcome the prima facie evidentiary effect of \u00a7 7A (and offered Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion in support of its defense under \u00a7 1 [7A]), the administrative judge was not required to credit <em>all </em>of Dr. Pulde\u2019s testimony, particularly when, as relevant to the issue whether the employee\u2019s death was work-related, there existed contrary evidence, namely Dr. Kress\u2019s opinion, which the administrative judge was entitled to credit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 215 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The insurer contends that the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion cannot stand because Dr. Kress\u2019s opinion was predicated on two facts that were not specifically found by the judge, namely, heavy exertion and an extremely cold environment. We point out, however, that as to the latter subject, the judge found that the temperature at the time of the employee\u2019s death was cold and ranged between nineteen and thirty-three degrees Fahrenheit. Further, there was no need for the administrative judge to make specific findings concerning the exact level of physical exertion undertaken by the employee before his death in view of the judge\u2019s acceptance of Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion that any level of exertion (and not necessarily heavy or significant physical exertion as opined by Drs. Kress and Patten, see note 10, supra) could have precipitated SCD in the employee on account of the severity of his preexisting CAD (in the absence of identifying and treating the disease). It was enough that this employee, in his condition, had engaged in any degree of physical exertion at work, and this conclusion was supported by the administrative judge\u2019s finding that, after lunch and within the hour preceding his death, the employee had cleared \u201can additional two to four feet of pathway\u201d with the snow blower. The result reached by the administrative judge is consistent with, and supported by, the medical evidence in the record, and reflects a correct application of \u00a7 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">b. <em>Application of defense under \u00a7 1 (7A). </em>Although the administrative judge considered (and rejected) the insurer\u2019s defense under \u00a7 1 (7A), the board concluded that, in cases where an employee is found dead at the workplace, only \u00a7 7A applies and the \u201ccombination injury\u201d defense, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00a7 1 (7A) has no application. The board reasoned that \u00a7 7A and the defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) are mutually exclusive. The board based its conclusion on the absence of language in \u00a7 1 (7A) regarding workplace deaths. In addition, the board found the combination injury defense inapplicable because, in the case of a death, \u201cno period of disability or a need for medical treatment occurs,\u201d as contemplated by the language of \u00a7 1 (7A). Both the employee and the insurer maintain that the defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) applies in cases of death occurring at the workplace. The issue is one of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). \u201c[T]he statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). We \u201cmust ascertain the intent of a statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which it relates, and must interpret the statute so as to render the legislation effective, consonant with sound reason and common sense.\u201d <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The board\u2019s analysis overlooks the workers\u2019 compensation statute (Act) as a whole, as well as the circumstances pursuant to which the defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) was enacted. Significantly, the Act contemplates compensation for both work-related deaths and personal injuries; it is not solely concerned with the latter. That a death is not specifically included in the definition of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is inconsequential. An examination of the definition reveals that the term does not state what a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d actually is; rather, it includes and excludes only certain categories of personal injuries, and notably neither includes nor excludes a death.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cThe various sentences of \u00a7 1 (7A) were adopted piecemeal over time ... as a series of legislative responses to specific court decisions and perceived needs for targeted reform.\u201d <em>Cornetta\u2019s Case, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 114 (2007). In 1991, the Legislature inserted the third and fourth sentences of the definition of personal injury, setting forth the combination injury defense into the fourth sentence of the definition. See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 14. The 1991 amendments to the Act \u201ccame in response to declining economic conditions and rising costs of workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201d <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 500-501 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Application of the combination injury defense pursuant to \u00a7 1 (7A) effectuates the Legislature\u2019s targeted reform by limiting compensation in certain cases where a noncompensable preexisting condition exists. The obvious concern was to withhold compensation in circumstances where a noncompensable, preexisting condition merely happens to manifest itself at the employee\u2019s workplace and has no relation to the employee\u2019s actual work. See <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61 (1917). This concern exists not only in circumstances where the noncompensable preexisting condition combines with a compensable injury or disease to result in personal injury, but also in cases where the combination injury results in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The insurer asserts that death cannot constitute an injury under the combination injury defense of \u00a7 1 (7A) and that, therefore, the employee\u2019s SCD can never be a compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>injury. This interpretation would render \u00a7 7A superfluous. Further, the compensable injury is not the employee\u2019s death but rather, in this case, the ventricular arrhythmia or fibrillation (that resulted from either the polymorphic or monomorphic ventricular tachycardia). The employee\u2019s death was the ensuing disability. The expert medical evidence underscores this distinction. Dr. Patten explained (and his testimony in this regard was not contradicted) that a person experiencing ventricular fibrillation may, within a certain amount of time (measured in minutes), be \u201crevived\u201d or be \u201cconvert[ed] . . . back to a normal rhythm.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, with these particular types of injuries, death may occur, but is by no means always certain, and as such, the occasion of death cannot be considered the injury under \u00a7 1 (7A).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Consideration of the effect of a preexisting condition in situations involving a work-related death is not inconsistent with \u00a7 7A. If a noncompensable preexisting condition does not exist, only \u00a7 7A will apply (if the employee\u2019s death occurred at the workplace), and the defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) will not be implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">When there is a noncompensable preexisting condition that combines with a compensable injury and results in a workplace death, application of the defense somewhat alters the insurer\u2019s burden of production in rebutting the prima facie evidentiary effect of \u00a7 7A. First, the insurer must present evidence that a noncompensable preexisting condition existed at the time of the employee\u2019s death. The production of this evidence, together with appropriate medical expert evidence on the issue of causation, would allow the insurer to argue that the employee\u2019s death was caused solely by the preexisting condition. Second, where an employee\u2019s workplace death does follow a combination injury (and the insurer does not argue that the death resulted solely from the noncompensable preexisting condition), the insurer will need to submit appropriate medical expert evidence that the compensable part of the combination injury (here, the ventricular arrhythmia or fibrillation) was not a major cause of the death, which includes a causal showing that the compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>part of the combination injury was not brought on by the employee\u2019s work activities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The employee, with whom the ultimate burden of production and persuasion lies, may respond by proffering appropriate expert medical evidence to contradict the evidence of the insurer.

The judge\u2019s extensive factual findings, supplemented with uncontested evidence from the record, provide the necessary factual predicate to support his conclusions, including his rejection of the insurer\u2019s defense under \u00a7 1 (7A).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The board incorrectly concluded that the defense under \u00a7 1 (7A) and the prima facie evidentiary effect of \u00a7 7A are mutually exclusive. Apart from making this erroneous conclusion, the board properly affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. We therefore affirm the decision of the reviewing board, as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">There was expert medical evidence defining sudden cardiac death (SCD) as \u201cthe natural death from cardiac causes that is heralded by the abrupt loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of symptoms in individuals with or without known pre-existing heart disease, but in who the time and mode of death are unexpected.\u201d Although the risk of SCD is highest in individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD), more than eighty per cent of the incidence of SCD occurs in asymptomatic individuals who have no prior history of CAD and who do not experience a myocardial infarction (heart attack). About eighty per cent of SCDs occur in \u201cnonexertional circumstances.\u201d A person with ventricular arrhythmia has an irregular heart rhythm caused by abnormal electrical impulses in the ventricles of the heart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 7A (\u00a7 7A), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cIn any claim for compensation where the employee has been killed or found dead at his place of employment or, in the absence of death, is physically or mentally unable to testify, and such testimonial incapacity is causally related to the injury, it shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of the injury or death and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter, that sufficient notice of the injury has been given and that the injury or death was not occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The fourth sentence of G.

He exercised regularly and was considered to be in good physical condition. The judge found that the employee went to Dr. Kress on January 4, 2005, complaining of upper back and shoulder pain. Dr. Kress conducted an electrocardiogram that was within normal limits. Dr. Kress noted that the employee had several cardiac risk factors, including an elevated cholesterol level that was being treated successfully with medication; a family history of CAD; and a past history of smoking. Dr. Kress scheduled an exercise treadmill test after seeing the employee (it had been scheduled sometime prior to January 24, 2005), but the employee canceled the appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Polymorphic and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia refer to fast heart rhythms arising in the ventricles of the heart.

These rhythms may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation, which is defined as \u201cfine, rapid, fibrillary movements of the ventricular muscle that replace the normal contraction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 580-581, and which, if not corrected with emergency treatment, results in death within a few minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Dr. Pulde explained that \u201cthe activity [the employee] performed [on] January 24, 2005, certainly can induce ischemia, but ... it was not an inordinate or excessive amount of physical activity that was disproportionate to any other type of activity done in the work environment, and therefore it should not be considered a trigger based on our definitions of what represents triggers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Dr. Patten reached the same conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion on the issue of work-related exertion was contrary to that of Dr. Kress and Dr. Patten. Dr. Kress\u2019s opinion took into account that the employee had been engaged in \u201cheavy exertion\u201d just before his death. While Dr. Patten opined that the employee\u2019s physical activity on January 24, 2005, was a major contributing factor in his death, his opinion was based on the fact that the employee had engaged in \u201ca significant level\u201d of \u201cstrenuous physical activity.\u201d While the record certainly would have supported a finding that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>January 24, 2005, the employee had engaged in heavy or strenuous physical exertion at work, on account of several factors including the weight of the snow blower and its occasional maneuvering from side to side, the weight of the snow, the amount of the snow, and the length of time devoted to snow removal, the judge did not make any specific finding characterizing the degree of exertion expended by the employee, instead finding that he had engaged in some exertion that, according to Dr. Pulde\u2019s testimony, was enough to trigger the medical events that resulted in his SCD (and enough, in the administrative judge\u2019s view, to be a major cause of the employee\u2019s death).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The administrative judge implicitly rejected critical components of the basis of Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion that the employee\u2019s death was not precipitated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>work-related physical exertion. Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion, in part, was based on the absence of thrombus (the abrupt fracturing of coronary plaque, otherwise known as a clot) in the employee, which is expected with physical exertion. Dr. Patten, however, did not consider the description of the plaque in the autopsy report to be adequate to say whether a thrombus had occurred. He added that, depending on how an autopsy is conducted, a pathologist may not even discover a clot. Moreover, Dr. Pulde\u2019s opinion was based also on the employee\u2019s use of an \u201cautomated\u201d snow blower, which in his view (based on some scientific literature) could not generate a sufficient level of physical exertion to trigger SCD. Dr. Patten questioned this opinion, explaining that certain factors, such as the weight of the snow blower, and the amount and weight of the snow subject to removal, were not taken into account.

Personal injuries shall include mental or emotional disabilities only where the predominant contributing cause of such disability is an event or series of events occurring within any employment. If a compensable injury or disease combines with a pre-existing [non-compensable condition] to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the resultant condition shall be compensable only to the extent such compensable injury or disease remains a major but not necessarily predominant cause of disability or need for treatment. No mental or emotional disability arising principally out of a bona fide, personnel action including a transfer, promotion, demotion, or termination except such action which is the intentional infliction of emotional harm shall be deemed to be a personal injury within the meaning of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">During cross-examination, Dr. Pulde agreed that when a person goes into arrhythmia and progresses toward what would be SCD, the SCD may be aborted, and the person may survive, if there is an opportunity to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to defibrillate the person within four minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">This showing does amount to a heightened standard of causation, see <em>Castillo </em>v. <em>Cavicchio Greenhouses, Inc., </em>66 Mass.
