Zubiel was convicted on four indictments alleging an attempt to disseminate matter harmful to a minor, under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, and as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He moved for required findings of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and again at the close of the evidence. The motions were denied. Zubiel appealed from his convictions, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">We are asked to decide whether Zubiel was entitled to required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>findings of not guilty on the ground that the definition of \u201cmatter,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, does not encompass electronically transmitted text, or \u201conline conversations,\u201d for the purposes of a prosecution for attempted dissemination of matter harmful to a minor under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. We hold that it does not, and reverse Zubiel\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The judge could have found the following facts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). Deputy Sheriff Melissa Marino, a member of the \u201chigh-tech evidence analysis team\u201d in the Plymouth County sheriff\u2019s department, conducted undercover online investigations of crimes in the Commonwealth, including child pornography and child enticement.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">As part of her standard procedure in investigations, Marino created an undercover screen name, \u201cMelissa QT 1995,\u201d and set up a profile on Yahoo, a Web site that provides public Internet discussion and private online conversations, describing herself as \u201cMeliss Smith\u201d from the South Shore, age thirteen, and in the eighth grade. In her profile, she invited others in the general discussion to \u201cPM\u201d her if they would like to send her a \u201cprivate message.\u201d These online conversations are also known as \u201cinstant messaging.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On February 8, 2006, Marino entered the public discussion and waited for someone to approach her and engage in conversation. She was eventually approached by someone with a screen name of \u201cIlikesports04,\u201d who said, \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d This was later determined to be Zubiel. Marino informed Zubiel that she was thirteen years old, and he told her he was twenty-five years old. The online conversation between Zubiel and Marino was a private instant message, only seen by the two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">During the first online conversation, which lasted forty-two minutes, Zubiel asked Marino for a photograph, so she sent, via electronic mail message (e-mail), photographs of herself when she was thirteen years old. They discussed where each other lived and gave physical descriptions of themselves. Zubiel asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Marino, \u201c[You] ever fool around with boys?\u201d and other questions regarding what she had done with boys, how old the boys were, and additional details about those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Their second online conversation occurred on February 13, 2006, during which Zubiel brought up several intimate topics. He asked questions about her physical appearance and her sexual experience. He asked her to send a photograph of herself nude, but she declined. Zubiel also asked Marino if she was a police officer and acknowledged that they could get in trouble for what they talk about. The following day, February 14, 2006, Zubiel sent Marino a photograph of himself via e-mail. They again discussed, in an online conversation, sexual topics, and Marino informed Zubiel that her mother would be working that weekend and she would be home alone. Zubiel again questioned Marino on her sexual history, and told her that he would like to visit and that he \u201cwould teach [her] everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">On February 15, 2006, they had another online conversation regarding Zubiel\u2019s potential visit to Marino. They also spoke on the telephone that day, as Zubiel wanted to make sure Marino was not a police officer. They again discussed sexual topics, and Zubiel said to Marino, \u201cI will show you the right way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On February 17, 2006, they had a final online conversation. Subsequently, Marino telephoned Zubiel at his request, and he told her he would visit her the next day. Marino told him that she lived in an apartment complex in Marshfield. The next day, February 18, 2006, he telephoned her as he was entering Marsh-field to ask for directions. When Zubiel arrived at the apartment complex, the police arrested him as he was walking toward the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Following his arrest, Zubiel admitted that his \u201cscreen name\u201d was \u201cIlikesports04,\u201d and that he had conducted all of the online conversation with Marino. He also admitted to the police that \u201cit was a possibility that he would have sex with this girl if \u2014 if, indeed, she was a real girl, and that the thought was there for him to have sex with this minor.\u201d Zubiel gave the police permission to seize his computer. A forensic examination of the computer revealed searches for Marshfield High School, directions to the apartment complex, the profile page of \u201cMelissa QT 1995,\u201d the photographs that Marino and Zubiel sent to each other, as well as portions of the online conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>2. <em>Standard of review. </em>When reviewing a judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, we assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">3. <em>Online conversations as \u201cmatter\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 28, provides: \u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter harmful to minors, as defined in section thirty-one, knowing it to be harmful to minors, or has in his possession any such matter with the intent to disseminate the same to minors, shall be punished . . . .\u201d \u201cMatter\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, for purposes of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30D,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as \u201cany handwritten or printed material, visual representation, live performance or sound recording including but not limited to, books, magazines, motion picture films, pamphlets, phonographic records, pictures, photographs, figures, statues, plays, dances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Online electronically transmitted conversations are not explicitly included in the definition of \u201cmatter\u201d under \u00a7 31. Penal statutes must \u201cdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123 (1993), quoting <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). Therefore, criminal statutes are strictly construed against the government. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>426 Mass. 689, 690 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">a. <em>Visual representations. </em>There are four broad categories of \u201c[mjatter:\u201d (1) any handwritten or printed material; (2) any visual representation; (3) any live performance; and (4) any sound recording. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. The Commonwealth argues that the computer text was a visual representation. Zubiel contends that the online conversations between himself and Marino were not \u201cvisual representation[s],\u201d as the term \u201cvisual representation\u201d in \u00a7 31 refers to photographs and other images, but not text. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 31, does not define \u201cvisual representation.\u201d However, it does define \u201c[vjisual material,\u201d listing numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>pus specific media that are considered \u201cvisual material\u201d under the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When elements are listed in a series, the rules of statutory construction require the general phrase to be construed as restricted to elements similar to the specific elements listed. <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 92 (1996). This principle, ejusdem generis, \u201callow[s] the specific words to identify the class and [restricts] the meaning of general words to things within the class.\u201d 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.17, at 379 (7th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Here, the specific elements listed as \u201c[vjisual material\u201d are limited to the class of <em>pictures </em>\u2014 moving or still, whether on paper, film, or computer. The statute indicates nowhere an intent by the Legislature to include words, such as those used in online conversations, in this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In addition, the use of the phrase \u201cvisual representations\u201d in the definition of \u201c[vjisual material\u201d provides insight into the definition of \u201cvisual representation.\u201d The definition of \u201c[vjisual material\u201d includes \u201cpictures, photographs or similar visual representations.\u201d The inclusion of \u201csimilar visual representations\u201d following the words \u201cpictures\u201d and \u201cphotographs\u201d indicates that it refers to images, not purely written words.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Because the statute provides no definition of \u201cvisual representation,\u201d this court must interpret the words of the statute according to their usual and accepted meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 567 (2000). No Massachusetts court has defined \u201cvisual representation\u201d to include pure text, such as the online conversations in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinary meaning of \u201cvisual representation\u201d does not include purely textual material. Accordingly, we hold that the Legislature did not intend online conversation to be considered as \u201cvisual representation\u201d under \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>b. <em>Handwritten or printed material. </em>Zubiel next argues that the instant messages do not fall under the statute\u2019s prohibition of dissemination of \u201chandwritten or printed material\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The online conversations in this case were not handwritten. While there is no statutory definition of \u201chandwritten\u201d materials, in the absence of such definition, \u201cwe give [the words] their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose. . . . We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The relevant definition of the word \u201cwrite\u201d is \u201cto form or trace (a character or series of characters) on paper or other suitable material <em>with a pen or </em>pencil\u201d (emphasis added). Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2640 (1993). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, supra </em>at 568, the Appeals Court, in distinguishing printed from handwritten material, defined \u201chandwritten material.\u201d The Appeals Court determined that handwriting is what it is commonly understood to be: writing performed by hand with a pen or pencil, as distinguished from print, which is \u201cmechanically produced.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 568 &amp; n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In light of the <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>decision and the Legislature\u2019s subsequent amendment of the statute to include \u201chandwritten\u201d materials in the definition of \u201c[mjatter\u201d in \u00a7 31, we conclude that the online conversations in this case, as they were not written with pen or pencil, cannot be considered \u201chandwritten\u201d materials under \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The remaining issue is whether the instant messages in this case are \u201cprinted material\u201d under \u00a7 31. Again, because there is no definition of \u201cprinted materials\u201d in \u00a7 31, we look to the usual and accepted meaning of the words, from sources presum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ably known to the Legislature at the time the statute was enacted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1803, defines the verb \u201cprint\u201d as \u201cto make a copy of <em>by impressing paper against an inked printing surface </em>or by an analogous method\u201d (emphasis added). Here, Zubiel electronically transmitted text, which did not involve the impression of paper against an inked printing surface, and did not cause any mechanically produced text to be printed on paper. Because criminal statutes must \u201cdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123 (1993), and any ambiguity in such statutes must be strictly construed against the government, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>426 Mass. 689, 690 (1998), we cannot hold that electronically transmitted text falls within the definition of \u201cprinted material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In addition, we consider the underlying legislative intent. The earlier intent of the statute was to focus on commercial distributors of obscene material. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, supra </em>at 571. However, recent additions to the obscenity statutes have criminalized noncommercial behavior, indicating a legislative intent to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C, inserted by St. 1997, c. 181, \u00a7 2 (criminalizing possession of obscene visual depictions of children). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 64 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2003) (\u201cOur reading comports with the Legislature\u2019s expressed design to eliminate permanent records of sexually exploitive material harmful to children\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While proscribing the activity in this case would be consistent with a legislative intent to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation, the definitions in \u00a7 31 do not do so. If the Legislature wishes to include instant messaging or other electronically transmitted text in the definition of \u201c[m]otter\u201d under \u00a7 31, it is for the Legislature, not the court, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\n<em>Judgments for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-16\">Each indictment was based on Internet conversations between Zubiel and an undercover police officer on a specific day, February 8, 13, 14, and 15, 2006, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The \u201cinstant messages\u201d in this case were electronically transmitted text, between two individuals, utilizing Yahoo, a Web site that provides instant messaging services.

App. Ct. 566 (2000), was decided, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, did not define \u201c[m]otter\u201d to include \u201chandwritten\u201d materials, as it does now. In 2002, the Legislature amended \u00a7 31 to include \u201chandwritten\u201d materials. St. 2002, c. 161, \u00a7 1. This fact does not affect the applicability of the <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>decision to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The Legislature considered amending G.
