Cohen, an attorney and former Stoughton police sergeant, guilty of attempted extortion, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25; filing a false police report, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A; and two charges of witness intimidation, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He brings this appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The defendant claims that his constitutional right to a public trial was violated during jury empanelment proceedings by the exclusion from the court room of members of the public, including his friends and supporters. Additionally, he claims that there was insufficient evidence to warrant his convictions of witness intimidation and filing a false police report, and that an error in the jury instruction on the charge of attempted extortion requires a new trial on that charge. We conclude that the jury empanelment in this case contravened the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>tian, and that accordingly, he is entitled to a new trial. We further conclude that the evidence presented on the charges of witness intimidation and of filing a false police report was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts, and therefore that the defendant may be retried on all charges of which he was convicted. Finally, we find no error in the challenged jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Background, </em>a. <em>The trial. </em>The evidence at trial would have permitted the jury to find the following.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At all relevant times the defendant worked as a lawyer by day and as a Stoughton police sergeant on the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. On April 22, 2002, Peter Marinilli, the younger brother of the defendant\u2019s close friend, contacted the defendant and told him that a man named Timothy Hills had \u201cscammed\u201d him. In particular, Marinilli told the defendant that Hills had solicited $10,000 from him, supposedly as an investment in a restaurant called \u201cPizzapalooza\u201d that would generate a thirty per cent return by April 1, 2002. When Marinilli asked Hills for his money, Hills gave him only excuses. When Hills finally gave Marinilli a check, it did not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">On April 22 or 23, the defendant left Hills a telephone message stating that Hills could pay Marinilli back or face criminal charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That same afternoon, Hills drove with Brian Sexton, an employee of Hills\u2019s company, to the defendant\u2019s law office to meet with him. Hills told the defendant that he was aware he owed Marinilli money, but that he needed to \u201cmake arrangements to try and get him his money back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">During the next few days, Hills and the defendant exchanged more telephone calls. On April 26, Hills delivered to the defendant, as \u201ca deposit,\u201d a $1,000 money order made out to Marinilli. Hills agreed to meet with the defendant at his law office on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>April 30 to discuss the remaining $9,000 debt. The defendant was in a meeting when Hills arrived on that date, and Hills told the receptionist that he would return. The defendant, however, did not receive Hills\u2019s message about returning, and left the following voice mail message on Hills\u2019s telephone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cTim Hills, this is David Cohen at 12:30. As you can imagine, I\u2019m not too happy with you right now. I told you \u2014 you told me you were going to be here by noon. And, Tim, I\u2019m pretty much at the end of my rope as far as your story goes. ... I guess I\u2019m going to do what I have to do and it might not be pretty. So, get in touch with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Hills and the defendant met later that day at a local restaurant. After the defendant threatened arrest if Hills did not pay Marinilli, Hills produced a $9,000 check. The defendant took the check to the bank to determine whether it would clear. When the bank teller, Jamie Kelly, informed him that it would not, the defendant drove in his police cruiser to Hills\u2019s office. When the defendant arrived, he ran a registration check on Hills\u2019s truck, found that the registration had expired, and called a private company for a tow. The defendant, who was armed and in his police uniform, then walked into Hills\u2019s office and confronted him. He placed Hills in handcuffs and threatened to lock him up and keep his truck impounded if he did not bring the $9,000 to the police station by 4 p.m. the next day. The defendant removed the handcuffs before leaving Hills\u2019s office, returned to the station, and wrote a police report about the incident. He also prepared applications for a criminal complaint against Hills, as well as an arrest warrant. The following day, the defendant submitted his police report and applications for complaints when Hills failed to bring the $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On May 3, 2002, an arrest warrant for Hills issued from the Stoughton Division of the District Court Department, along with a complaint charging larceny by false pretenses and two counts of uttering. Also on May 3, Hills went to the police station to complain about the defendant. The police lieutenant with whom Hills spoke left for a few minutes. When he returned, he told Hills that he had good news and bad news: Hills could get his truck back, but the defendant had obtained a warrant for his arrest. Hills was processed, fingerprinted, and put in a cell. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>was released shortly thereafter on twenty-five dollars\u2019 bail. The charges against him were later dismissed because he cooperated with an internal police department investigation of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">b. <em>Jury empanelment. </em>A Norfolk County grand jury indicted the defendant in March of 2005, and also indicted Stoughton police Officer Robert Emmet Letendre.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The two men were tried together. Jury selection began the afternoon of June 18, 2007, and continued through June 25.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before empanelment began on June 18, the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cWhat I intend to do, once the defendants are placed at the bar, [is] to introduce myself, to give a description of the case, to have the attorneys introduce themselves and their clients [as] they desire. Read the list of prospective witnesses, give them the estimate of the length of the trial, and then proceed into the questioning. And once the questioning is completed, begin to fill the jury box, entertaining your objections or challenges for cause when they arise, calling to the sidebar those jurors who\u2019ve raised their hand[s] for any reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Jury selection began in the afternoon of June 18. Seventy-eight prospective jurors were brought to the court room, and the empanelment process went forward as the judge had described. Only a few jurors were seated before the end of the day on June 18. Empanelment continued over the next two days in the same manner as on June 18. At the beginning of the morning session on June 21, the fourth day, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated to the judge at sidebar, \u201cWhen I came in this morning I saw a sign on the door that says: \u2018Jury empanelment Do not enter.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">\u201cI have found out that the sign has been on the door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>from the beginning of the trial apparently. Then, I did some more checking and I found out that people have been denied entry into the courtroom and told that the courtroom is closed by the court officers downstairs and have been denied entry into the courtroom. At least two people have told my client that, and I haven\u2019t checked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Counsel moved for a mistrial, stating that the judge \u201cnever made findings on the record or had a hearing as to whether or not the courtroom ought to be closed.\u201d The judge denied the motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">A short while later, the defendant\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof in which he stated that several of the defendant\u2019s friends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and supporters would testify that they were denied entry. The judge responded that the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial had already been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Later that same morning, the defendant\u2019s counsel raised the issue a third time, stating, \u201cYour Honor, I want the record to reflect that someone just entered the courtroom and the court officers ushered him out. They told him to leave.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cI will inquire.\u201d This exchange followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">The judge: \u201c[W]ho was that coming into the courtroom?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">Court officer: \u201cIt was one of the Stoughton police officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">The judge: \u201cAll right. That was a Stoughton police officer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd why is he not allowed in the courtroom?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">The judge: \u201cWell, you registered your objection, so I will deal with it later. I just wanted to know who it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-15\">Defense counsel: \u201cI would like to move for a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-16\">The judge: \u201cDenied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">After a recess, defense counsel informed the judge that the man the court officers had removed from the court room was the defendant\u2019s civilian friend, Peter Rappoli, not a uniformed Stoughton police officer, and that at the time Rappoli was removed, there was ample room for the public to sit in the court room, separated from the prospective jurors. Counsel again moved for a mistrial. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">At the conclusion of jury empanelment on June 25, 2007, the case proceeded to trial. On July 30, the jury returned guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>verdicts on four of the seven charges against the defendant. On August 10, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on his claim that the jury empanelment process had contravened his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. The judge held an evidentiary hearing on the motion, at which several of the defendant\u2019s friends and supporters testified that either the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign or court officers kept them out of the empanelment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, Alan Stein, a freelance reporter who had been hired by the Patriot Ledger and the Brockton Enterprise to cover the defendant\u2019s trial, testified that on the first day of empanelment, a court officer had informed him while he was outside the court room that he would not be permitted in the court room during empanelment; Stein further testified that he went to the court house on the other days of empanelment, but understood the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign on the door to mean that he could not enter, and therefore he sat on a bench outside the court room and did not attempt to enter. Jeff Mucciarone, a reporter for the Stoughton Journal and Canton Journal, also testified. He stated that on June 18, as he and a photographer for his newspapers were leaving the press section of the court room after a motion hearing that preceded the commencement of empanelment, a court officer told him that he would have to leave during jury selection. He was present in the court house during all the days of empanelment, but never went into the court room, concluding that the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign was conveying the same message the court officer had: that he would not be allowed in.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on June 27, 2008. In her decision, the judge found that the largest court room in the Norfolk County Superior Court court house was used for this trial because the judge expected it to be lengthy, to be followed closely by the press and public, and to require an unusually large jury pool.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She made findings about the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>policy for jury empanelments, and found that it had been applied in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cAccording to [the acting chief court officer], it is the practice at Norfolk Superior Court to exclude the public (other than the media) from jury empanelment if there is no room for spectators. However, where there is room, spectators are placed in the seating areas on the sides of the courtroom. The media are routinely seated in the enclosure to the left of the judge\u2019s bench. The intent of the policy is to insure that jurors are not intermingled with the public. <em>All the court officers were instructed by [the acting chief court officer] that the courtroom would be \u2018closed\u2019 for this </em>empanelment\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The judge further found that the court officer and the defendant\u2019s counsel made special seating arrangements for the defendant\u2019s family beforehand, as counsel \u201cwas aware that the public could not be accommodated in the spectators\u2019 gallery because of the large number of jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge stated the court officer had informed her that the defendant\u2019s family would sit in the right enclosure and that they did sit there throughout jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The judge next found that there had been large numbers of potential jurors called for the first three days of empanelment: jurors appeared in panels of seventy-eight on June 18, eighty-eight on June 19, and seventy-nine on June 20. Because the empanelment process on some or all of these days did not reach every juror present, jurors who had not been reached returned the next morning, and the panels of new jurors came into the court room in the afternoon. She found that \u201calthough the crowd lessened at times during the morning, the courtroom would again fill in the afternoon on those dates.\u201d She stated that the \u201cvenire was cautioned not to speak aloud in the courtroom\u201d and \u201cevery exchange occurring between the court and individual prospective jurors was conducted at sidebar outside of public hearing and out of earshot of the defendant\u201d because he had agreed to closed individual voir dire. However, the judge noted that she called jurors to the sidebar based on their responses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>questions she had posed publicly to the potential jurors as a group, which they gave by raising their hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The judge found that \u201cthe court was first advised of the [\u2018Do Not Enter\u2019] sign and the access issue on June 21; there were no repeated objections to the exclusion of the public; and the court did take corrective action, including ordering the sign removed.\u201d She found that while court officers removed Peter Rappoli later that day, they did so mistakenly and Rappoli \u201cdid not seek to determine the reason he was required to leave the courtroom\u201d and \u201c[b]y the time the court determined that he was not in police uniform, he had left the courthouse.\u201d She added that at the time, \u201cthere were other members of the public present and undisturbed.\u201d With respect to the reporters, she found that \u201ca court officer asked Mr. Mucciarone to leave the courtroom for jury selection and separately asked Mr. Stein not to come in during jury selection.\u201d However, she found that the two men did not identify themselves as press and that they had \u201ccomplied [with the no entry order] without complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s friends and supporters, the judge found that \u201cMichael Cubell, Peter Rappoli, Roy Minnehan, Paul Williams, James O\u2019Connor, and Richard S. Levine testified that they were deterred from entering the courtroom during [ejmpanelment by the sign on the courtroom door, or were asked by a court officer to leave the courtroom during the [ejmpanelment.\u201d She did not discredit their testimony, stating only that \u201cthey failed to make themselves known to the court until late in the [ejmpanelment process when they were unavailable to come back to court.\u201d She noted that John White, a spectator who was not among the defendant\u2019s supporters, testified that he sat in the court room during empanelment on June 18 and June 20, seeing the sign but ignoring it. On June 18, he sat with a Stoughton couple (also members of the public) and on June 20, he sat \u201cin the back where there were a couple of empty rows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Finally, the judge found that while she could not monitor the court room closely during empanelment, she \u201cexpected that members of the public who wished to observe . . . would be allowed entry\u201d and that because \u201cthe issue was not raised until the fourth day of [ejmpanelment ... the court was unable to investigate and address the matter before that time.\u201d She further stated that, \u201c[ojn June 21, Officer Sullivan was directed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>court to allow anyone who wanted to enter the courtroom to enter. The court credits his testimony that he obeyed that directive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Based on her findings, the judge ruled that the court room was never closed, as the defendant\u2019s family and some other members of the public were present and the \u201cpress was not excluded.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> She also concluded that the defendant in effect consented to closure by giving up his right to be present at closed individual sidebar voir dire examinations of prospective jurors and otherwise waived his right to claim a violation of his right to a public trial by waiting until the fourth day to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge failed to satisfy procedural requirements for court room closure, making only retrospective findings to support it; did not satisfy substantive requirements for closure because the record shows that the public was excluded by court policy, regardless of and despite available space; erred in giving constitutional significance to the excluded spectators\u2019 failure to protest; and erred in her findings of fact. The defendant also claims that he did not waive his public trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>As the defendant\u2019s \u201cnew trial claim is constitutionally based, this court will exercise its own judgment on the ultimate factual as well as legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 409 (1992). We review to determine whether the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated, cognizant that such a violation \u201cis a structural error and not susceptible to harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 296 (2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. 432, 435 (1969).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we do look to whether the defendant raised this issue in a timely manner because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>right to a public trial, like other structural rights, can be waived.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 173 (2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 874, 876 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>360 Mass. 846 (1971). See generally <em>Mains </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>433 Mass. 30, 33 n.3 (2000) (\u201cOur cases have held that even structural error is subject to the doctrine of waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">b. <em>Public trial right. </em>The closing of a criminal proceeding to the public may implicate rights guaranteed by both the First and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 192 (1994). The First Amendment implicitly grants the public, including the press, a right of access to court trials.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 604-606 (1982). The Sixth Amendment expressly grants criminal defendants the right to a public trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46 (1984) <em>(Waller). </em>See <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 270 (1948) (\u201cThe knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power\u201d). The same constitutional analysis applies to a public trial claim brought under the First Amendment as one brought, as here, under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. at 193 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The public trial right applies to jury selection proceedings, <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. 721, 723-724 (2010), which are \u201ca crucial part of any criminal case.\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 63 (1st Cir. 2007) <em>(Owens). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 823 (1996). At that stage, \u201cthe primacy of the accused\u2019s right [to a public trial] is difficult to separate from the right of everyone in the community to attend the voir dire which promotes fairness.\u201d <em>Press-Enterprise </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984) <em>(Press-Enterprise). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The \u201csure knowledge that <em>anyone </em>is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations will become known\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>Throughout a trial, an open court room \u201cenhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, courts recognize a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of a public trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 294, \u201covercome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Press-Enterprise, supra </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Still, the public trial right is not absolute, and in limited circumstances a court may bar spectators from certain portions of a criminal trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. at 193. To do so, a judge must make a case-specific determination that closure is necessary. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. at 608. That \u201cdetermination must satisfy four requirements articulated by the Supreme Court: \u2018[1] the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [2] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, [3] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [4] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 194, quoting <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. <em>Waller </em>and the four factors it sets out apply to the exclusion of the public from jury selection proceedings, at least when this occurs over the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Watters </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. 38, 45 (1992), cert, denied, 507 U.S. 1024 (1993) (\u201cwhether objection to closure is made by the defendant or the press, the public may only be constitutionally excluded from a trial, including voir dire, pursuant to a narrowly tailored order necessary to protect an overriding state interest\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>844 A.2d 155, 159 (R.I. 2004) (\u201cThe <em>Waller </em>analysis applies as well to the closure of jury-selection proceedings over an accused\u2019s objections\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated, \u201c[t]he burden is clearly on the defendant to demonstrate that the public was excluded from his trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. at 875. The judge concluded, and the Commonwealth argues to us, that the defendant failed to satisfy this burden. The judge reasoned that because (1) she did not order a closure, (2) some members of the public attended despite the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign, and (3) the judge \u2014 through court officers \u2014\u2022 made arrangements for family and the press to be present, the court room was never \u201cclosed.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It has been stated that a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial is not denied absent \u201csome affirmative act by the trial court meant to exclude persons from the courtroom.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>AlSmadi, </em>15 F.3d 153, 154 (10th Cir. 1994). Nevertheless, a court room may be closed in the constitutional sense without an express judicial order. See, e.g., Owens, 483 F.3d at 63; <em>Watters </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. at 44, 49 (defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to public trial was violated where deputy sheriff closed court room to public, including members of defendant\u2019s family and press, for entire morning of jury voir dire and selection; court rejected State\u2019s claim that no violation occurred because error was committed by deputy sheriff without knowledge of judge; new trial ordered).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Martineau </em>v. <em>Perrin, </em>601 F.2d 1196, 1198-1200 (1st Cir. 1979) (court room doors locked for at least three days of six-day trial, unbeknownst to judge, who ordered doors open on learning of misunderstanding; Sixth Amendment public trial right was violated, but defendant was found to have knowingly and intentionally waived right on facts of particular case).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Some courts have determined that a court room closure may be so limited in scope or duration that it must be deemed \u201cde minimis\u201d or trivial, and not in contravention of the Sixth or First Amendment public trial guarantees; whether the closure was \u201cinadvertent\u201d on the part of the judge is sometimes mentioned as one factor relevant to the analysis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We agree with the principles discussed in the cases cited in note 20, <em>supra, </em>but those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>principles do not govern here. While the judge indicated that she herself was not aware of the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign until the fourth day of empanelment, there is no dispute that the sign was affixed to the court room door for three days, and that, pursuant to an established policy, court officers told a number of individuals that they would not be permitted in the court room during the jury selection process. The exclusion of members of the public and the press for at least three days of jury selection through the intentional application of a court house policy cannot qualify as inadvertent. Nor can it be characterized as so trivial or de minimis as to fall entirely outside the range of \u201cclosure\u201d in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We discuss briefly the additional reasons mentioned by the judge for her conclusion that no constitutionally implicated closure occurred: the defendant\u2019s family members were present throughout; other members of the public were also present when there was room to accommodate them without the risk of tainting prospective jurors; and members of the press were not excluded from the court room. It is commendable that the judge and court officers made specific arrangements to ensure that the defendant\u2019s family members could be seated in the court room throughout jury empanelment. Cf. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 F. Supp. 2d 570, 573 (D. Mass. 2007) (two of defendant\u2019s family members sought entry but were excluded from court room for entire empanelment). It is also true that the judge found that three members of the public (John White and a couple from Stoughton) came into the court room during empanelment despite the sign. However, the presence of spectators who \u201csaw the sign, but ignored it,\u201d has little or no bearing on whether the court room was closed. See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>85 F.3d 39, 44 n.7 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 878 (1996) (\u201cpossible existence of some spectators brave or arrogant enough to seek admission does not convert the court room into an open one\u201d). Furthermore, the judge\u2019s findings also reveal that six individuals \u2014 who were, significantly, friends and supporters of the defendant \u2014 were denied entry by virtue of the sign or by the explicit statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>a court officer. See <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. at 271-272 (\u201cAnd without exception all courts have held that an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. 432, 435 (1969) (same).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">We conclude the defendant has established that, for at least three days of the jury selection proceedings in his case, the court room was closed in the constitutional sense, at least to some degree. As just discussed, however, the record makes clear that there were family members and some other individuals beyond the parties and counsel present in the court room during empanelment. For that reason, there was a partial rather than a full or complete closure of the court room. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 44, 48-49 (1995) (exclusion of defendant\u2019s mother during testimony of witness due to intimidation concern, but allowing press to remain, constituted limited closure).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is therefore necessary to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>whether a partial court room closure is governed by the same constitutional standards as a complete closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u201cAlthough <em>Waller </em>addressed the <em>complete </em>closure of a trial to the public, federal and state courts have subsequently extended the <em>Waller </em>analysis to <em>partial </em>closures of trials ...\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>91 Haw. 181, 191 (1999). See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeLuca, </em>137 F.3d 24, 33-34 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 525 U.S. 874 (1998); <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Kuhlmann, </em>977 F.2d 74, 76 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mahkuk, </em>736 N.W.2d 675, 684-685 (Minn. 2007); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>96 N.Y.2d 213, 219 (2001). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 48-49 (applying <em>Waller </em>factors to partial closure). We follow this lead, and therefore examine the four <em>Waller </em>factors in the context of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The first <em>Waller </em>factor \u2014 the proponent of closing the court room \u201cmust advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48 \u2014 has been somewhat modified when applied to a partial closure. A majority of the Circuit Courts of the United States Court of Appeals and several State courts \u2014 including the Massachusetts Appeals Court<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 have taken the approach that where a closure is partial, it is necessary to show a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d rather than an \u201coverriding interest\u201d to justify the closing.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The judge here advanced two connected reasons for the court room\u2019s partial closure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>spectators: (1) lack of space to accommodate the general public due to the number of prospective jurors in the court room<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>; and (2) preventing the intermingling of prospective jurors with spectators who might have some connection to or express opinions about the case, and the potential taint of the jurors that could result.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The first of these does qualify as substantial, and the second may in particular circumstances.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>However, even in a partial closure context, the remaining <em>Waller </em>factors must be satisfied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 48-49. The second <em>Waller </em>factor instructs that a closure may be \u201cno broader than necessary to protect [the] interest [likely to be prejudiced].\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. In the present case, to the extent that there were insufficient seats in the court room for all the spectators, excluding those who could not be appropriately seated was permissible.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 588-589 (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring) (\u201cObviously, the public-trial guarantee is not violated if an individual member of the public cannot gain admittance to a courtroom because there are no available seats\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 974-975 (9th Cir. 2003), cert, denied, 541 U.S. 965 (2004) (no violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment public trial right where on two occasions during trial, insufficient seating space prevented some of defendant\u2019s family from being in court room). However, the record indicates that the judge did not make a particularized determination about available space for members of the public at the beginning of empanelment proceedings on any of the five days devoted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>whole or in part to jury selection. Nor did she address the question of space becoming available as the empanelment process progressed on any of those days. Rather, the judge\u2019s findings and the testimony of the court officers, which the judge appeared generally to credit, indicate that the public consistently was excluded from the court room based on established court policy that, for at least three days, was graphically and unequivocally communicated by the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign. Closure by policy runs counter to the requirement that a court make a case-specific determination before a closure of any part of a criminal proceeding constitutionally may occur. Cf. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. at 607-608 (\u201cWe agree with appellee that the first interest \u2014 safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor \u2014 is a compelling one. But as compelling as that interest is, it does not justify a <em>mandatory </em>closure rule, for it is clear that the circumstances of the particular case may affect the significance of the interest\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We recognize that in court houses across the Commonwealth, insufficient space may well provide a valid reason for the exclusion of the public during at least some part of jury empanelment proceedings, because the number of prospective jurors in the venire are likely to fill all or almost all of the available seats.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is not required that <em>every </em>seat not occupied by a prospective juror must be made available to the public; as noted, the possibility that jurors may be influenced or tainted by intermingling with spectators is a valid concern that may justify excluding members of the public until space permits them to sit apart from the prospective jurors. Moreover, the judge or court officers need not undertake an affirmative effort to seek out spectators when the departure of prospective jurors frees up seats. But the public trial right applies with full force during empanelment, <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. 721, 723-724 (2010), and if space in the court room is or becomes available, the judge must make sure that members of the public who wish to observe the proceedings are not prevented from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Here, the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign had a preemptive and preventive effect. The judge acknowledged that space became available as the empanelment progressed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Still, for at least the first three days, the sign and the court officers turned spectators away, even during periods of time when the record indicates it would have been entirely possible to accommodate them. Because the sign continued to keep the court room closed even when circumstances changed, this partial closure was too broad. See <em>Owens, </em>483 F.3d at 62 (\u201cOnce there was sufficient space in the court room, we see no state interest \u2014 compelling or otherwise \u2014 in not permitting . . . family, friends, or other members of the public to observe the proceedings\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>844 A.2d at 161-162 (where judge excluded defendant\u2019s sisters from jury selection based on space concern and where \u201crecord reveals that the courtroom was not completely filled,\u201d closure order was \u201cbroader than necessary\u201d; new trial ordered).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The third <em>Waller </em>requirement is closely connected to the second; it focuses on consideration of \u201creasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherlock, </em>962 F.2d 1349, 1359 (9th Cir. 1989), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Charley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 958 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 49. As discussed, the judge took meaningful steps in this direction, holding the empanelment proceedings in the largest available court room and reserving space for the defendant\u2019s family and the press. However, additional alternatives should have been examined. There are ways to communicate to members of the public that the court room currently cannot accommodate them other than by placing a \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign on the door. The difficulty with such a sign is that it is too easy to forget to remove it when space does become available.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Finally, <em>Waller </em>requires \u201cfindings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48. In a partial closure context such as this one, a reviewing court may examine the record itself to see if it contains sufficient support for the closure, even in the absence of formal or express findings by the judge. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 48 (\u201cWhile we think that the judge should have expressly rather than implicitly determined whether the witness would have had difficulty testifying with the defendant\u2019s mother present, it was not constitutional error requiring a new trial not to do so in the particular circumstances of recent intimidation by other family members\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although the record in this case offers evidence of a number of reasons to effect a partial closure during parts of the empanelment, ultimately, it does not allow us to glean sufficient support for the extensive closure that occurred. See <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Keane, </em>237 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201cquality and extent of the evidence that will support a closure . . . will vary from case to case, depending on the scope of the closure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In sum, the empanelment process in the present case effected a partial closure of the court room in a manner that failed to satisfy the second, third, and fourth <em>Waller </em>requirements, violating the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. This conclusion does not end our inquiry, however, because, as noted, a defendant may waive this Sixth Amendment right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>360 Mass. 846 (1971). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 874, 876 (1980). The judge found that the defendant did so here in two ways. The first relates to the defendant\u2019s decision not to be present with his counsel at the private voir dire examinations of individual jurors by the judge at sidebar. The judge stated that the defendant \u201ccan hardly complain that his supporters were not present for the empanelment, when he was present, but elected not to hear [the individual voir dire examinations].\u201d She explained that while the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to object to the private sidebar voir dire may not strictly equate to a consensual closing of the courtroom for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, the practical ramifications ... are that the public will not hear the jurors\u2019 responses and will not be able to observe their demeanor.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>interpret the judge\u2019s statements as a determination of waiver, but disagree that a waiver occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Individual juror voir dire examinations in this case were conducted out of hearing of the defendant and the public, but the voir dire examination process itself took place, as it should have, in open court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 831-832 (2001). Conducting such voir dire examinations in open court permits members of the public to observe the judge, as well as the prospective jurors. Even though the public cannot hear what is being said, the ability to observe itself furthers the values that the public trial right is designed to protect. See <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 46, quoting <em>Gannett Co. </em>v. <em>De Pasquale, 443 U.S. 368, </em>380 (1979) (\u201c \u2018The requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned, and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions.\u2019 ... In addition to ensuring that judge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly, a public trial encourages witnesses to come forward and discourages perjury\u201d); <em>Owens, </em>483 F.3d at 61 (\u201ca trial is far more likely to be fair when the watchful eye of the public is present\u201d). The defendant had a right to have the public present during these individual juror examinations, just as he had a right during the trial to have spectators present in the court room while sidebar conferences took place out of their earshot. Moreover, the jury selection proceedings also included voir dire questions publicly posed to the venire as a group, to which potential jurors gave substantive responses by raising their hands. The defendant had, and did not waive, the right to have the public hear the judge\u2019s questions and witness the prospective jurors\u2019 responses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, 434 </em>Mass. at 832, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. at 823 (\u201cThe guarantees of open public proceedings in criminal trials cover proceedings for the voir dire examination of potential jurors concerning their qualifications to serve\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The second type of waiver identified by the judge was knowing inaction or delay. Specifically, she determined that the defendant waived his public trial right by waiting until June 21, 2007, the fourth day of jury empanelment, to object. The judge sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>gested that this was a tactic undertaken by the defendant\u2019s counsel to create an appellate issue. The record does not support this view. Rather, it shows that on the day counsel testified that he first saw the \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d sign, he objected forcefully to the court room\u2019s closure three separate times, asking in substance for a new empanelment before jeopardy had even attached.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Nothing in the record suggests that counsel, or the defendant, was dissatisfied with the jurors who had been selected by that point in the proceedings, or that there was any dissatisfaction with the jury as ultimately constituted; as the Commonwealth points out, the defendant did not exercise all his peremptory challenges during the empanelment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The judge found that the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cwas aware that the public could not be accommodated in the spectators\u2019 gallery because of the large number of jurors to be called and he wanted to make special arrangements for the defendant\u2019s family.\u201d Counsel\u2019s awareness that the court room would be closed some of the time to accommodate large numbers of jurors \u2014 leading to his request to reserve seating for the family \u2014 would not itself support a finding that he was also aware that even when the court room did have available space, the public would be denied entry because of the policy that the court room would be closed throughout the empanelment process.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The defendant has thus established that the jury selection procedures used in this case violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial; he has also shown that he did not waive this right.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Given the structural nature of this error, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>inquire as to whether it prejudiced the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>356 Mass. at 435. We turn, instead, to remedy. The relief for a breach of the public trial right \u201cshould be appropriate to the violation.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 50. In <em>Waller, </em>where a judge improperly closed a suppression hearing, the Supreme Court ordered a new suppression hearing, reasoning that if that hearing led to the suppression of the same evidence, a new trial would not be necessary; it would be, rather, \u201ca windfall for the defendant, and not in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, however, we cannot separately order a new jury selection apart from a new trial, and releasing the transcripts of empanelment, as has been suggested, will not appropriately remedy the violation. Cf. <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>464 U.S. at 513 (where judge closed court room for six weeks of juror voir dire in violation of First Amendment right of plaintiff newspaper, plaintiff entitled to transcript of voir dire proceedings as remedy). The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">c. <em>Sufficiency of evidence claims. </em>The defendant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the judge erred in denying his motions for a required finding of not guilty on the two charges of witness intimidation and the charge of filing a false police report, which he made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In his view, the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction of any of these crimes. In reviewing the defendant\u2019s claims, we ask whether, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">(i) <em>Witness interference. </em>At all times relevant to this case, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, the statute defining the crime of interference with a witness, required proof that \u201c(1) the target of the alleged intimidation was a witness against the defendant in some stage of a criminal proceeding; (2) the defendant wilfully tried to influence or interfere with the witness; (3) the defendant did so by means of \u2018misrepresentation, intimidation, force or express or implied threats of force\u2019; and (4) the defendant did so with the purpose of influencing the . . . witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casiano, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 708 (2007), citing G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as amended through St. 1996, c. 393, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The witness interference charges concerned two individuals, Jamie Kelly and Brian Sexton. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence relating to Jamie Kelly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>included the following. Kelly was working as a bank teller on April 30, 2002, when the defendant entered the bank in police uniform and asked her to verify that Hills\u2019s account contained sufficient funds to cover the $9,000 check that Hills wrote to Marinilli. She told the defendant that it did not. Kelly did not hear from the defendant again until September, 2004, a few weeks before the grand jury investigation into his conduct began, when he called to tell her that \u201chim and Mr. Hills were going to court.\u201d Kelly testified that the defendant \u201cwanted me to sign a statement that he wrote up for the court\u201d about his actions at the bank.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> During the call, he went over the events of April 30, 2002, with Kelly, but she \u201cdid not think it was the way it happened.\u201d She testified, \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly what was said, but I just didn\u2019t agree with it.\u201d Kelly \u201cdidn\u2019t feel right\u201d signing the statement the defendant asked her to adopt as her own. Kelly told the defendant this, and he asked her to meet with him about the statement. Not wanting to do so, she \u201cjust never talked to him again after that.\u201d He then called her \u201cclose to ten times.\u201d Kelly reported this to her manager. She testified, \u201cI felt intimidated. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the whole situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">With respect to Brian Sexton, the evidence showed that in April, 2002, Sexton, a salesman for Hills\u2019s company, drove Hills to several meetings with the defendant and was at Hills\u2019s office when the defendant went there to confront Hills. A few weeks later, Hills asked Sexton to prepare a statement for the court about what transpired in the office between Hills and the defendant.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Sexton told Hills that if Hills wrote an accurate statement, Sexton would sign it. In August, 2004, approximately one month before the grand jury proceedings in the defendant\u2019s case began, Sexton was having dinner in a restaurant owned by a man named James Marathas. Marathas approached Sexton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and told Mm that he had in Ms possession a document on which Hills had forged Sexton\u2019s signature. When Sexton went to Marathas\u2019s office the next day to see that document, Marathas could not find it. Marathas changed the subject, stating, \u201cYou know, the thing that\u2019s going on with Dave Cohen? . . . You wrote a statement for that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Sexton acknowledged that he had, referring to the statement Hills had helped Mm to prepare, and said that he wished he was not involved, as he was \u201creluctant to be involved with Hills or [the defendant].\u201d Marathas asked, \u201cWell, have you thought about writing out another statement?\u201d Marathas offered to telephone the defendant. Sexton asked him not to, but Marathas persisted, and placed a call to the defendant. Within the hour, the defendant contacted Sexton and asked Sexton to meet him at another restaurant owned by Marathas. Sexton agreed and went to that restaurant. Despite the purportedly impromptu nature of the meeting, the defendant arrived at Marathas\u2019s restaurant with a copy of Sexton\u2019s 2002 statement in hand. Sexton testified, \u201c[The defendant] wanted me to \u2014 well, we discussed writing another statement.\u201d He said, \u201cNow, I can see, looking back, that the reason to write that statement was to \u2014 I\u2019m looking for the right word \u2014 discredit Hills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Apg\">Sexton went with the defendant to Marathas\u2019s office in the basement of the restaurant, where the defendant sat down at a computer and began to type.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Sexton stated that what the defendant typed \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense to me, so I asked him to remove what he was typing.\u201d According to Sexton, the defendant told him \u201chow the paragraphs in the statement made sense.\u201d When the defendant and Sexton finally agreed on a statement, the defendant asked Sexton to sign it under pams and penalties of perjury. Sexton did not want to do so because \u201ceverytMng was happening too fast\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel completely good about it.\u201d Sexton asked for time to speak with Ms lawyer. At that point, the defendant, who had told Sexton at the begimring of the meeting that he knew Ms lawyer well, sent Sexton\u2019s lawyer a copy of the second Sexton statement by electromc mail. Sexton then had a conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tian with the lawyer, in which the lawyer advised him that his second statement did not take away from his first, and that it was up to him whether to sign it. When Sexton went to his lawyer\u2019s office a day or two later to sign the statement drafted by the defendant, the lawyer was not there because his wife was in labor. However, the defendant <em>was </em>at the lawyer\u2019s office to meet Sexton. Sexton signed the statement and gave it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Sexton testified that when he signed the second statement, he was upset with Hills, who owed him money and had lied to him about a potential business partnership. Nonetheless, when the defendant\u2019s counsel asked him, \u201cWere you intimidated by David Cohen?\u201d Sexton replied, \u201cA little bit, yes.\u201d Sexton said of the basement meeting, \u201cI asked: Should we be doing this? Because I did not feel \u2014 I felt kind of a little intimidated.\u201d Sexton later testified, \u201cI felt a bit coerced, but he did not threaten me.\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cOkay. Did you feel duress?\u201d Sexton replied, \u201cYes.\u201d He later added, \u201cI did not have plenty of time to talk to an attorney because [the defendant] wanted it done the next day. He was pushing me to get it done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In order to prove the crime of interference with a witness, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, there must be sufficient evidence that the defendant wilfully endeavored to influence the witness by one of the means specified in the statute.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 53 (1993) (where Commonwealth alleges witness interference by intimidation, it must prove that defendant wilfully endeavored to influence or interfere with witness, and that he did so by intimidation, force, or threats of force). In this case, the means advanced by the Commonwealth were misrepresentation and intimidation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Although the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence clearly was not overwhelming, a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>juror could have concluded that the defendant sought to interfere with and influence Kelly and Sexton by both means at issue. With respect to misrepresentation, a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant intended to influence Kelly and Sexton to execute written statements containing factual inaccuracies about the 2002 events they had witnessed by making to each of them misrepresentations about those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Turning to intimidation, the defendant\u2019s \u201csubjective intent is not relevant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 233, 236 (1998). \u201cIt is sufficient that a reasonable fact finder could have inferred from the circumstances that he did, indeed, intimidate [the witnesses].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, an \u201caction does not need to be overtly threatening to fall within the meaning of \u2018intimidation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casiano, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 708, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 235-236. Calling Kelly ten times qualifies as intimidation. Kelly testified that she did not feel comfortable, and reported this to her manager. As for Sexton, a jury could reasonably conclude the defendant intended to intimidate him so that he would sign a new statement. The defendant\u2019s application of time pressure and his show of authority, both formal (for example, while in uniform) and informal, warrants this inference. Moreover, \u201cthe timing of the defendant\u2019s actions makes it more, rather than less, likely that he was trying to intimidate the witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 109 (2005). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casiano, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 709. Although Sexton\u2019s testimony suggests mixed motives for his decision to sign the second statement, he testified that he was, in fact, intimidated. \u201cJurors, of course, are free to believe or disbelieve the testimony of each witness in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 457 (2009). In sum, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty on both counts of witness intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(ii) <em>Filing a false police </em>report.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To support a false police report conviction, the evidence must establish that the defendant, acting as a police officer in the course of his official duties, filed a false written report \u201cknowing the same to be false in a material matter.\u201d G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A. The defendant concedes that \u201ca jury could find that some aspects of [his] police report were inaccurate.\u201d Indeed, testimony from Sexton<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and Hills<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> contradicted the statement the defendant made in his report that Hills had \u201ca large black folding knife in the pen organizer of his desk\u201d and that he handcuffed Hills for \u201cmy own safety.\u201d Still, he claims this inaccuracy was not \u201cmaterial\u201d because it did not affect whether his report properly led to a complaint against Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The defendant points to the court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cmaterial\u201d in the perjury statute, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1. In that context, a statement is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it tends \u201cin reasonable degree to affect some aspect or result of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2018Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 744 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353, 360 (1979). The defendant claims the \u201cinquiry\u201d here is whether his police report provided probable cause to support a criminal complaint against Hills. We disagree. A police report has purposes beyond simply establishing the basis for a complaint application. While the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cFor my own safety, I walked around the desk, secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Hills with handcuffs and pat-frisked him for weapons,\u201d was not required for a complaint of larceny or uttering to issue against Hills, it certainly affected any inquiry into whether the defendant acted permissibly and reasonably in handcuffing Hills. Because the basis for the defendant\u2019s decision to handcuff Hills could become relevant if, for example, Hills filed a complaint against the defendant in court or with the police department, the defendant\u2019s statements about handcuffing qualify as a material part of the police report regarding the incident. Therefore, the judge did not err in denying the motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">d. <em>Attempted extortion instruction. </em>General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 25, defines the crime of attempted extortion by a police officer, and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\"><em>\u201c[A]ny police officer . . . </em>who verbally or by written or printed communication <em>maliciously and unlawfully </em>uses or threatens to use against another the power or authority vested in him, with intent thereby to extort money or any pecuniary advantage, or with intent to compel any person to do any act against his will, shall be punished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">When the judge instructed the jury on this case, she explained the element of \u201cmalicious and unlawful\u201d intent as follows: \u201cThird, the Commonwealth must prove that the threatening communication was undertaken maliciously .... Maliciously means that the defendant intended to inflict injury without legal excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The defendant argues that the judge understated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden on this element by failing to explain how the jury should evaluate the lawfulness of a police officer\u2019s conduct. He contends that without such special guidance, the instruction criminalized a police officer\u2019s lawful and discretionary act of giving a thief a choice between return of stolen goods and criminal prosecution. As the defendant objected to the instruction, we review for prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>452 Mass. 295, 319 (2008), cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 1329 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The judge\u2019s instructions included a statement that maliciously \u201cmeans that the defendant intended to inflict injury or otherwise do wrong <em>without legal </em>excuse\u201d (emphasis added). She added, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201cThe emphasis in the crime of extortion is on the <em>wrongful </em>use of fear to compel the alleged victim to surrender something of value to the extortionist\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The instruction adequately conveyed to the jury the difference between permissible discretionary actions by a police officer and wrongful conduct that would fall within the statute\u2019s scope <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">e. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>As a final matter, the defendant lists several allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. The \u201csampling of low blows\u201d that the defendant cites does not rise to the level of appellate argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 577 n.3 (2001), citing Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">f. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is vacated.

L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19 <em>(a); </em>and assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (a).

Mr. Hill[s], we can either handle this through this office or my other job.\u201d The defendant testified that he never represented Marinilli and that he left Hills the initial message in his capacity as a police officer. The jury appears to have believed the defendant, as it acquitted him of municipal employee conflict of interest, G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 19 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Letendre was charged with being an accessory after the fact to a false arrest made by the defendant and with filing a false police report, both based on the 2000 incident that was the basis of separate charges against the defendant.

The Court cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201cThe generic risk of jurors over-hearing prejudicial remarks, unsubstantiated by any specific threat or incident, is inherent whenever members of the public are present during the selection of jurors. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>broad concerns of this sort were sufficient to override a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, a court could exclude the public from jury selection almost as a matter of course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\"><em>Id. </em>Still, the Court recognized that \u201c[t]here are no doubt circumstances where a judge could conclude that threats of improper communications with jurors or safety concerns are concrete enough to warrant closing voir dire,\u201d emphasizing that in such cases \u201cthe particular interest, and threat to that interest, must \u2018be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>464 U.S. at 510. <em>Presley </em>addressed a full closure of the court room. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s concern about the intermingling rationale appears to apply in the partial closure context as well; the record must still reflect a case-specific determination that the risk to the venire in the particular case from intermingling is a real one, and that the trial court satisfied its \u201cobligation] to take every <em>reasonable </em>measure to accommodate public attendance.\u201d <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">This is not to say that there is an obligation to accommodate every spectator who can find a seat anywhere in the court room; it would be permissible to exclude some spectators if the only available seats for them were located right next to the seats occupied by prospective jurors, and the judge determines, on the record, that this close proximity creates a risk of juror contamination or taint in the particular case.

There may well be tactical reasons \u2014 a favorable jury composition, for example \u2014 why a defendant and his counsel do not object to the exclusion of the public from his trial.

He felt that the case was proceeding well and saw no harm suffered by the petitioner due to the closed court room. In fact, he felt that the effect was probably to petitioner\u2019s benefit. If a motion for mistrial were made and granted, then what was perceived at the time as a good chance for acquittal would go down the drain. Counsel fully explained the situation to petitioner, told him what his decision was and then informed his client that \u2018at any time he wanted to\u2019 he could get up and object himself, which petitioner did not do\u201d).
