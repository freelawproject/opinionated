Brown, a physician, was indicted on multiple charges of illegally distributing or dispensing controlled substances in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A <em>(a) </em>(class B substance) and 32B <em>(a) </em>(class C substance); submitting false medical claims in violation of G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 40 (2); larceny of an amount in excess of $250 in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (1); and possession of a controlled substance in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. The indictments charging the defendant with submitting false medical claims and larceny, along with the indictments charging violations of \u00a7 32A <em>(a), </em>were tried to a jury; at trial, the Commonwealth elected to proceed on the theory that the defendant had unlawfully \u201cdispensed\u201d rather than \u201cdistributed\u201d a class B controlled substance under \u00a7 32A <em>(a). </em>The indictment charging a violation of \u00a7 32B <em>(a) </em>was the subject of a jury-waived trial, at which no such election was made. The defendant was convicted at both trials. The cases were consolidated on appeal, and were affirmed by a divided panel of the Appeals Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 85 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review of his convictions of unlawfully distributing or dispensing controlled substances<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> principally to consider two questions. The first is whether an audio-video tape recording of the defendant\u2019s conversation in the home of a cooperating witness was properly admitted in evidence at the jury-waived trial, where it was the product of a Federal investigation in which Massachusetts law enforcement personnel participated. We conclude that it was. The second question is whether a physician \u201cdispenses\u201d rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cdistributes\u201d a controlled substance within the meaning of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32A (a) or 32B <em>(a) </em>(drug statutes), when it is delivered pursuant to what purports to be a prescription to a person who does not \u201clawfully\u201d possess it. For the reasons outlined below, we conclude that a physician who issues an invalid prescription to a person seeking a controlled substance for illicit purposes has unlawfully distributed rather than dispensed the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">a. <em>Jury trial. </em>The jury trial centered on prescriptions for pain-relieving opiates, all class B controlled substances, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31, written by the defendant for seven patients. Admitted in evidence at the trial was a statement the defendant had made to members of the Attorney General\u2019s Medicaid fraud control unit during the investigation, to the effect that he followed a responsible standard of care with regard to patients receiving such prescriptions. He explained that his practice was to test his patients for indications of illegal substance abuse, and that he would intervene or cease prescribing pain-relieving opiates when those tests returned positive for illegal drugs. However, in the cases of the seven patients at issue, the evidence was that the defendant did not heed his own standards and continued to prescribe opiates to the patients \u2014 sometimes in increasing dosages \u2014 despite laboratory results revealing them to be illegal drug users. Those same laboratory results also revealed that the patients were not taking the opiates prescribed to them by the defendant. Yet, the defendant continued to issue new prescriptions to them. Based on this evidence, the Commonwealth produced an expert who testified that the prescriptions written by the defendant for these patients were not issued in good faith and served no legitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">As noted, the indictments against the defendant that were at issue in the jury trial charged him with \u201cdistribut[ing] or dispensing]\u201d controlled substances in violation of the drug statutes. The terms \u201c[distribute\u201d and \u201c[dispense\u201d have distinct meanings defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, and the defendant argued at trial that his conduct could only qualify, if at all, as one or the other, but not both.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth agreed and proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on the theory that the defendant had \u201cdispensed\u201d controlled substances within the meaning of the drug statutes. As a result, the judge instructed the jury that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cdispensed\u201d each of the controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In turn, the defendant contended that he could not be guilty of dispensing controlled substances unless the persons to whom they were delivered were lawfully in possession of them, pointing to the statutory definition of \u201cdispense\u201d and \u201cultimate user.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the evidence was notably to the contrary, the defendant made a motion for directed verdicts, which was denied, and a motion for a jury instruction to the same effect, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">b. <em>Jury-waived trial. </em>At the jury-waived trial on the indictment charging distributing or dispensing a class C controlled substance in violation of \u00a7 32B (a), the defendant stipulated to evidence sufficient to find him guilty of the charge,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> admitting that he prescribed opiates to a patient pursuant to an agreement under which the patient would fill the prescription and give some of the medication back to the defendant, and that the prescription was not written for a legitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The only contested issue at the trial was the admissibility of an audio-video tape recording of a conversation between the defendant and a patient. The patient had given her consent to law enforcement officials to place the recording equipment in her home in anticipation of the defendant arriving there to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>retrieve his share of the prescription pursuant to his agreement with the patient. The officials then recorded the defendant taking possession of eighty-seven tablets of a class C controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant sought to suppress the recording as unlawfully obtained under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (\u00a7 99), which generally prohibits the warrantless \u201csecret transmission or recording of oral communications without the consent of <em>all </em>parties,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 66 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and provides for the suppression of the contents of communications recorded in violation of its terms. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P. The statute exempts from its prohibition recordings made by Federal law enforcement officers acting pursuant to their Federal authority. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 1 c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The motion judge found that the exemption applied because the investigation was \u201cfederally run from start to finish,\u201d citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>426 Mass. 313, 315-318 (1997) <em>(Gonzalez), </em>even though local law enforcement played a role in it. Consequently, the recording was admitted in evidence at the jury-waived trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Neither the parties nor the judge addressed the fact that the indictment charged the defendant with \u201cdistribut[ing] or dis-pens[ing].\u201d In finding the defendant guilty, the judge stated simply that the defendant had violated G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32B <em>(a), </em>without reference to which of the two forms of conduct the defendant had engaged in, and the defendant made no claim as to the adequacy of the evidence to support a conviction under either alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>2. <em>The recording. </em>The audio-video tape recording of the defendant was only offered, and admitted, in evidence at the jury-waived trial, and therefore, only the defendant\u2019s conviction of violating G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32B <em>(a), </em>is examined in our review of the recording\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">There are two components to the defendant\u2019s argument that his motion to suppress the recording should have been granted. First, he asserts that the recording was made in violation of \u00a7 99, because it was made pursuant to a \u201cState-oriented investigation and a combined enterprise between State and Federal officials.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 316, discussing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarabek, </em>384 Mass. 293, 297 (1981). As indicated earlier, the motion judge concluded otherwise, finding that the investigation was federally ran and therefore the recording was exempted from suppression by \u00a7 99 D 1 c. The second component of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the recording violated art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and thus should be suppressed. The latter argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 317-318, which held that art. 14 does not constrain Federal authorities unless they operate as part of an \u201cessentially\u201d State investigation. Thus, the defendant asks us to overturn <em>Gonzalez </em>in favor of expanding our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, supra </em>at 77 (evidence gathered by State law enforcement through warrant-less wiretap in private home violated art. 14, requiring suppression), to include Federal authorities within the scope of art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The motion judge made extensive findings regarding the history and nature of the investigation. In 2004, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began investigating the defendant\u2019s prescribing practices. A DEA special agent, Edward Harrington, conducted the investigation through a DEA-sponsored Cape Cod task force, a joint Federal and local law enforcement operation headed by Harrington. The task force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>included members of local law enforcement who were deputized as special DEA agents. One local law enforcement officer, Dan Turner, was not deputized by the DEA, but he assisted in the investigation as well. Through Officer Turner, the task force convinced one of the defendant\u2019s patients to participate in a \u201csting\u201d operation designed to catch the defendant taking possession of controlled substances he prescribed to the patient. An assistant United States attorney approved a request by the task force to record the encounter using DEA-supplied equipment. The resulting recording showed the defendant taking illegal possession of a controlled substance. The defendant had been \u201cslated for federal prosecution\u201d at the time the recording was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">These findings amply support the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the investigation was Federal. The participation of local law enforcement was not sufficient, \u201ceither in quantity or quality, to alter the essentially Federal nature of the investigation.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>317. Accordingly, under \u00a7 99 D 1 c, it was of no consequence that the defendant did not consent to being recorded. The recording was admissible under the wiretap statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The findings also preclude suppression under art. 14. <em>Gonzalez, supra. </em>Although the exclusion of evidence in State court is a remedy available when State officials violate art. 14, the participation of State officials in a Federal investigation does not automatically trigger that result. As in <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>\u201cthis case involves warrantless recordings by <em>Federal </em>officials in a private home\u201d (emphasis in original), and under art. 14, \u201c[tjhat fact makes the difference.\u201d That is, the Federal nature of the investigation insulates the resulting evidence not only from suppression under \u00a7 99, but also from automatic suppression under art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The defendant calls our attention to <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>130 N.M. 386, 394 (2001), in which the Supreme Court of New Mexico held that the suppression rule mandated by its \u201cstate constitution applies to evidence seized by federal agents when the State seeks to admit that evidence in state court.\u201d Adherence to State constitutional rules during prosecutions in State courts, the court reasoned, protects State Constitutions and does not unconstitutionally constrain Federal law enforcement. The evidence suppressed in State court would be admissible in Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>court; thus, prosecution would be viable in the latter. <em>Id. </em>at 393-394. The defendant would have us adopt the same position, overruling <em>Gonzalez. </em>We are not inclined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The remedy of exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of art. 14 is one of recent rather than ancient origin. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 364 (1985). One of the purposes justifying its application is the deterrence of police conduct that unlawfully intrudes on the rights of privacy and security guaranteed our citizens under art. 14, through the preclusion of the fruits of that conduct. Another is the protection of judicial integrity through the dissociation of the courts from unlawful conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>394 Mass. 421, 433 (1985) (Lynch, J., dissenting); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>393 Mass. 141, 145 (1984) (discussing purposes of exclusionary rule under Fourth Amendment to United States Constitution). Where those purposes are not furthered, rigid adherence to a rule of exclusion can only frustrate the public interest in the admission of evidence of criminal activity. In the present case, there is no unlawful conduct to deter. The recordings were made in a federally run investigation in accordance with Federal law, and fell properly within the exemption for the conduct of Federal investigations under State law. To the extent that the conduct of State officials is the object of deterrence, our rulings excluding similar evidence obtained through investigations that are essentially State investigations operating under a Federal moniker are sufficient. See <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 316-317; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarabek, </em>384 Mass. 293, 296-297 (1981). Judicial integrity, in turn, is hardly threatened when evidence properly obtained under Federal law, in a federally run investigation, is admitted as evidence in State courts. To apply the exclusionary rule in these circumstances as the defendant urges would plainly frustrate the public interest disproportionately to any incremental protection it might afford. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fini, </em>403 Mass. 567, 573 (1988) (expansions of art. 14\u2019s protections beyond those in Fourth Amendment can \u201cdiscourage the gathering of . . . evidence\u201d). We decline to overrule <em>Gonzalez. </em>The motion to suppress was correctly denied and the evidence properly admitted at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">3. <em>\u201cDispensing\u201d and \u201cdistributing\u201d controlled substances. </em>The other question in this case \u2014 when does a physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cdispense\u201d a controlled substance in violation of G. L. c. 94C, the drug statutes \u2014\u25a0 is easily stated, but as the Appeals Court recognized, its resolution is far from simple. It is, therefore, helpful to set out the general structure of G. L. c. 94C.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">a. <em>Framework. </em>Both Federal and Massachusetts law make it a crime to dispense or distribute controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (2006); G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32-32G. The Massachusetts law, G. L. c. 94C, known as the Massachusetts Controlled Substances Act (Act), is modeled on the Federal statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq. (2006), known as the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (Federal Act), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 595 &amp; n.6 (2008), although it differs in some respects, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 227-228 (1976), cert, denied, 430 U.S. 946 (1977) <em>(Comins). </em>In particular, the Act contains a peculiar omission that has necessitated a generous interpretation by Massachusetts courts. The wording of the drug statutes on their face seems broadly to prohibit the dispensing or distribution of a controlled substance even in the case of a medically necessary prescription by a physician to a patient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 812 n.3 (1984) <em>(Perry). </em>Under the Federal Act, however, the prohibition against dispensing and distributing is prefaced with a logical caveat: it is unlawful to do so \u201c[e]xcept as authorized by this chapter . . . .\u201d21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Prior to its amendment in 1980, the Act included the same prefatory language. Compare St. 1971, c. 1071, \u00a7 1, with St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Because it is apparent that the Legislature did not intend to criminalize all medical care, we have continued to read the drug statutes as though the prefatory caveat remained. See <em>Perry, supra. </em>Thus, under the Act, it is a crime to dispense or distribute controlled substances unless one is authorized to do so. One can become authorized by registering with the State, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 7 (a)-(c). Physicians who register may transfer controlled substances by prescription. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Just as the drug statutes do not operate as a blanket prohibition against prescribing controlled substances, neither does the registration scheme immunize registered physicians from prosecution for unlawful dispensing or distribution. If a physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>clan writes a prescription that does not conform to the requirements of the Act, he may be penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Most relevant here is G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, which we have concluded serves two important functions relating to the criminal liability of physicians arising out of prescribing controlled substances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, it acts as an exemption from criminal liability under the drug statutes. So long as a physician (who is duly registered) issues a prescription for a \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d and \u201cin the usual course of his professional practice,\u201d the act of conveying a controlled substance to a patient is not prohibited. However, the issuance of an invalid prescription is an unauthorized act, and thus a \u201cphysician who issues a prescription not intending to treat a patient\u2019s condition in the usual course of his practice of medicine . . . violates \u00a7 32.\u201d <em>Comins, supra </em>at 232. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, supra </em>at 597 (\u201cPhysicians who issue invalid prescriptions under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19 [a], then, are those who, in essence, act not as physicians when they write such prescriptions but act instead as \u2018pushers\u2019 \u201d). In short, the failure to issue a prescription that is \u201cvalid\u201d under \u00a7 19 opens the door to prosecution under the drug statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In addition to its service as the gateway to liability under the drug statutes for physicians, \u00a7 19 contains its own sanction: A physician who issues an invalid prescription \u201cshall be subject to the penalties provided by [G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32H].\u201d The term \u201cpenalties\u201d is properly understood as a reference to the punishments available under \u00a7\u00a7 32-32H,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than the enumerated acts of distributing or dispensing prohibited in those sections.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the availability of the \u00a7 19 prohibition makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>possible to prosecute physicians who write invalid prescriptions under that section alone, without relying on the distributing or dispensing language of the drug statutes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 87 n.4 (2009) (Mills, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 318 (1999) (psychiatrist indicted and convicted under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, as well as drug statutes). That is, a physician writing an \u201corder purporting to be a prescription\u201d but not issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional treatment, violates \u00a7 19 and is subject to the penalties in the drug statutes that correspond to the class of the drug purportedly prescribed. This point bears emphasizing: without question, the Act prohibits the conduct of the defendant in this case. The Commonwealth\u2019s decision to seek indictments under the drug statutes for dispensing or distributing was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We turn now to the issue at hand: having decided to pursue convictions of distributing or dispensing under the drug statutes, and subsequently having chosen (at the jury trial) to proceed only on the theory that the defendant \u201cdispensed\u201d controlled substances, what was the Commonwealth required to prove?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">b. <em>Prosecution under the drug statutes. </em>As a preliminary matter, we think that the decision to proceed under the drug statutes, rather than G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, requires the Commonwealth to prove that a physician engaged in at least one of the prohibited acts enumerated in that section: that is, either distributing or dispensing a controlled substance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The language of the statute requires it. The act of \u201cdispensing\u201d is different from the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\u201cdistributing\u201d \u2014 indeed, to \u201cdistribute\u201d is defined negatively as \u201cto deliver other than by administering or dispensing.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. In addition, as we have already discussed, \u00a7 19 already prohibits the issuance of an invalid prescription by a registered physician, which suggests that the distributing or dispensing language in the drug statutes targets different categories of conduct. Finally, despite several statements suggestive of the contrary, we have never held that the Commonwealth may rest its case under the drug statutes solely on the elements of \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>c. <em>\u201cDispensing. </em>\u201d We turn now to what constitutes unlawful \u201cdispensing\u201d by a physician under the drug statutes. The Commonwealth contends that proof that a physician violated \u00a7 19 by issuing an invalid prescription is sufficient to sustain a conviction of unlawfully dispensing a controlled substance. After carefully studying the language and structure of the Act, as well as decisions interpreting its Federal counterpart, the Appeals Court agreed, holding that the elements of unlawful dispensing by a physician under the drug statutes are set out in \u00a7 19. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 83-84. The defendant disagrees. See <em>id. </em>at 85-86 (Mills, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Having already established that the threshold element of unlawful dispensing is the issuance of an invalid prescription under \u00a7 19, i.e., one issued without a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of the physician\u2019s professional practice, <em>Comins, supra </em>at 232, the dispute now turns on the definition of \u201cdispense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">To \u201c[dispense\u201d is defined as \u201cto deliver . . . to an <em>ultimate user </em>... by a practitioner or pursuant to the order of a practitioner, including the prescribing ... of a controlled substance\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. An \u201c[ultimate user\u201d is one who \u201clawfully possesses a controlled substance for his own use or for the use of a member of his household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, fidelity to the definition of \u201cdispensing\u201d requires proof that delivery was made to an \u201cultimate user,\u201d i.e., one who \u201clawfully possesses\u201d the prescribed substance for his own use or the use of a member of his household. See <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812; <em>Comins, supra </em>at 231-232. It is here that we confront a near void of precedent and must interpret the language and structure of the Act with fresh eyes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The primary trait of an \u201cultimate user\u201d is that he has lawful possession of a controlled substance. An analysis of the Act as a whole suggests that lawful possession is possession that is not illegal or, more specifically, possession that is not prohibited by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. Under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, a person\u2019s possession of a controlled substance is lawful only if the \u201csubstance was obtained directly, or pursuant to a <em>valid prescription </em>or order, from a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice\u201d (emphasis added). This is a clear reference to \u00a7 19, and accordingly a \u201cvalid prescription\u201d is one issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the course of usual professional practice. Using \u00a7 34 to define lawful possession, then, would mean that a patient who intentionally receives a prescription <em>without </em>a legitimate medical purpose receives an \u201cinvalid\u201d prescription and, consequently, does not lawfully possess the substance. As such, once it is determined that a physician issued an invalid prescription, the recipient cannot be in lawful possession. In turn, the recipient cannot be an \u201cultimate user,\u201d and the physician cannot have \u201cdispensed\u201d the substance; rather, he has \u201cdistributed\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">This approach is not without its contradictions. Relying on \u00a7 34 to evaluate the lawfulness of an ultimate user\u2019s possession creates a scheme under which a physician cannot be guilty of unlawfully \u201cdispensing\u201d under the drug statutes even though the definition of \u201cdispense\u201d expressly includes \u201cprescribing.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Thus, to \u201cdistribute,\u201d which is defined as the negative of to \u201cdispense,\u201d would include an act (prescribing) that is expressly included in the definition of \u201cdispense.\u201d Moreover, this approach would contradict our prior statements, noted in note 12, <em>supra, </em>to the effect that the act of issuing an invalid prescription satisfies the \u201cessential elements of the crime of unlawful <em>dispensing </em>of a controlled substance\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, 399 </em>Mass. 1, 4 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 318 (1999) (upholding dispensing convictions where evidence showed prescription written in violation of \u00a7 19); <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812 &amp; n.3 (physician criminal liability requires unauthorized prescribing); <em>Comins, supra </em>at 226 (physician dispenses when issuing unlawful prescription). Despite these problems, this approach presents the least awkward interpretive alternative, especially in light of the Act\u2019s over-all structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Scrutiny of the structure of the Act confirms that a physician who violates \u00a7 19 by issuing an invalid prescription to a person seeking a controlled substance for illicit purposes has unlawfully \u201cdistributed\u201d a controlled substance. In other words, a physician \u201cdispenses\u201d when appropriately acting <em>as a physician, </em>and \u201cdistributes\u201d when acting <em>as a drug dealer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As we have already discussed, a literal reading of the Act suggests that it is always unlawful to deliver or possess controlled substances. Physicians (and other authorized \u201c [practitioners, \u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1) are not expressly exempted from prosecution under the drug statutes where they make use of controlled substances in the course of legitimate medical treatment. However, we have consistently interpreted the Act in a manner that does not outlaw medical treatment. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812 n.3. Thus, it is illegal to deliver or possess controlled substances unless one is acting in an authorized manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The very structure of the Act reflects this exemption for medical treatment. The first part of the Act, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 2-30, establishes the statutory framework that undergirds an administrative scheme, overseen by the Commissioner of Public Health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>that regulates the authorized delivery of controlled substances. The second part of the Act, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 31-47, concerns criminal liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On closer inspection, the definition of \u201c[dispense,\u201d which is highly problematic in the criminal liability portion of the Act, fits comfortably within the administrative portion of the Act. This suggests that its terms may have been selected to function within one part of the Act with little thought to how they might apply in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\u201cDispense\u201d is used throughout the administrative part of the Act, almost always in the context of doctor-patient prescriptions or doctor-subject research projects. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 17, 19-22, 24, 25. In the context of a visit with a physician for medical treatment, the highly technical definition of \u201cdispense,\u201d along with the incorporated definition of \u201cultimate user,\u201d makes perfect sense: the physician is \u201cprescribing\u201d because the prescription is valid, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, and the patient is lawfully possessing the substance because receipt is made by a valid prescription, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. That is, the individuals involved in the transaction are acting in their authorized roles: physician and patient. A survey of the conduct authorized in the administrative portion of the Act indicates that the limited definition of \u201cdispense\u201d is filled to the brim by that conduct; there is no space in the definition of \u201cdispense\u201d for a physician acting outside his or her role as a physician, or for a patient acting outside his or her role as a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In contrast, the administrative part of the Act hardly begins to enumerate a list of acts that would exhaust the broad definition of \u201cdistribute.\u201d Only four sections of the administrative part mention the act of \u201cdistribution.\u201d General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 7, requires an individual who \u201cdistributes\u201d controlled substances to register with the State, and G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 16, states that such individual may not distribute controlled substances \u201cto another registrant [under \u00a7 7]\u201d unless certain order forms are used. General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a725 and 26, prohibit distribution except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>in conformance with \u00a7 16. As \u201cdistribute\u201d has an expansive definition \u2014 it is delivery that is not \u201cdispensing or administering\u201d \u2014 it is not problematic to include within its ambit conduct that is not authorized in the administrative portion of the Act, i.e., conduct that is not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">With these points in mind, several conclusions result. First, \u201cdispensing\u201d is overwhelmingly the act of a physician acting in an authorized manner. Pursuant to our long-standing interpretation of the structure of the Act, see <em>Perry, supra, </em>a physician who \u201cdispenses\u201d is generally exempted from prosecution under the drug statutes because the conduct is authorized. Indeed, the definition of \u201cdispense\u201d makes it difficult, although not impossible, to find space for illegality in the conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In contrast, a physician who ceases to act as a physician by transforming his office into the equivalent of a street comer or darkened alley is not exempted. The conduct involved bears no resemblance to the practice of medicine. Rather, the physician has devolved into a \u201cpusher.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 143 (1975) (\u201cIn practical effect, [a physician issuing invalid prescriptions] acted as a large-scale \u2018pusher\u2019 \u2014 not as a physician\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 597 (2008). Pushers commit the crime of \u201cdistribution.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluellen, ante </em>517, 518, 524 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 605 (1992). Indeed, it is impossible to conceive how a dmg dealer could ever \u201cdispense\u201d a controlled substance. Moreover, but for a medical degree, there is nothing to distinguish the person who deals drugs from a medical office from one who does so from the street. Therefore, the physician who forfeits his exemption from prosecution by becoming a drug dealer should be prosecuted for what he is, an unlawful distributer.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In summary, our conclusions are as follows. When a physician, for no legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>course of his professional practice, delivers a controlled substance by issuing a prescription to a patient seeking the substance for illicit ends, the Commonwealth may prosecute the physician for issuing an invalid prescription, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19, or for unlawfully distributing the substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32H. The sentence for a conviction under either approach will be set out in the appropriate provision of \u00a7\u00a7 32-32H, depending on the identity of the substance delivered. In addition, the Commonwealth may prosecute the patient for unlawful possession provided the patient possessed the requisite mental state. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. If the physician issued the prescription for a legitimate medical purpose, or believed that he did so because his patient deceived him, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 33 <em>(b), </em>the physician has not \u201cdistributed\u201d under the drug statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">d. <em>Defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful \u201cdispensing. \u201d </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 56-57 (1982), the Appeals Court upheld the conviction of a physician under the drug statutes of distribution rather than dispensation. The defendant in that case relied on the definitions of the terms set out in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1, and our holding in <em>Comins, supra </em>at 225-228, to argue that a physician issuing an invalid prescription-only can dispense a controlled substance. The Appeals Court did not address this argument directly, holding instead that there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice arising from the fact that the defendant, who had failed to object at trial, was indicted and convicted of distribution instead of dispensing. The defendant\u2019s conduct was unquestionably illegal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, supra. </em>The only difference in this case (aside from the inversion of the conduct for which the defendant was convicted) is that the defendant did object, at least at the jury trial. This shifts our inquiry to whether the defendant was prejudiced by the decision to instruct the jury on unlawful dispensing, but does not alter the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cAn error is nonprejudicial only \u2018[i]f ... the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect. . . . But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>rights were not affected. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In this case, the evidence at the jury trial overwhelmingly established that the defendant, a registered physician, issued prescriptions to patients without a legitimate medical purpose. Although it was essential for the Commonwealth to establish that the defendant also engaged in conduct prohibited by the drug statutes, namely dispensing or distributing, we have concluded that, as it occurred in this case, the act of issuing an unlawful prescription is the act of unlawful distribution. Here, although phrased as unlawfully dispensing a controlled substance, the judge\u2019s instructions on the elements of the crime matched the elements of unlawful distribution. No mention was made of the fact that \u201cdispensing\u201d requires delivery to an \u201cultimate user.\u201d Indeed, the evidence established that the defendant\u2019s patients were not ultimate users at all, their possession being unlawful under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. To the jury, then, it made no difference to which verb in the indictment their attention was drawn. Considering only the elements necessary for the crime of unlawful distribution, they convicted the defendant. Therefore, we can say with confidence that \u201cthe judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s convictions stand, albeit on the theory that he unlawfully distributed controlled substances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 442, 445-446 (1988) (correcting conviction where evidence established defendant was guilty of crime containing fewer elements than crime of which he was convicted).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction of violating G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32B (a), which was rendered at the jury-waived trial, where no objection was raised to the indictment charging \u201cdistribute or dispense\u201d in the alternative, we look to whether there was error and, if so, whether the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Because the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of illegal distribution, as charged, there was no error, and that conviction is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">4. <em>Other convictions. </em>As the defendant concedes, his other convictions \u2014 those of submitting false medical claims, G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 40, and larceny in excess of $250, G. L. c. 266, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u00a7 30 (1) \u2014 are derivative of his convictions under the drug statutes. That is, provided that he unlawfully distributed or dispensed controlled substances, the act of submitting claims for reimbursement under Medicaid and the act of accepting such reimbursement are illegal. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s remaining convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of controlled substances in violation of G.

Although the record does not reveal whether the defendant consented to the filing of the conviction, as required, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975), he did not raise the conviction before the Appeals Court or this court.

L. c. 94C, \u00a7 18, establishes which controlled substances may be prescribed orally and which must be prescribed in writing. That is, under Federal law, the definition of an invalid prescription is found in regulation, whereas Massachusetts has codified the same in statute. The difference between the Federal regulation and the Massachusetts statute is significant.

In past cases, we have used language that suggested that a violation of \u00a7 19 is sufficient to constitute a violation of the drug statutes by means of \u201cdispensing.\u201d For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 232 (1976), cert, denied, 430 U.S. 946 (1977) <em>(Comins), </em>we upheld an unlawful dispensing conviction, and said a \u201cphysician who issues a prescription not intending to treat a patient\u2019s condition in the usual course of his practice of medicine does not issue a valid prescription, and he thus violates \u00a7 32.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, </em>399 Mass. 1, 4 (1987), we wrote that the \u201cessential elements of the crime of unlawful dispensing [under the drug statutes] are set out in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19\u201d (footnote omitted). Likewise, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 322 (1999), we upheld convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 19, 32A, and 32B, where the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that the defendant \u201cacted in bad faith and for no legitimate medical purpose.\u201d Under the view espoused by the Appeals Court, as well as by the Commonwealth in this case, these cases stand for the proposition that a violation of \u00a7 19 is sufficient to support a conviction of unlawful dispensing under the drug statutes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 75, 84 (2009). However, close inspection of these cases reveals that we have never so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Comins </em>concerned whether a physician could <em>ever </em>be prosecuted under the drug statutes. We answered affirmatively, provided that the physician prescribed controlled substances in violation of \u00a7 19. <em>Id. </em>at 226 (\u201cphysician who unlawfully issues a prescription for a controlled substance <em>may </em>\u2018dispense\u2019 a controlled substance [under \u00a7 32]\u201d [emphasis added]). Similarly, our pronouncement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, supra, </em>came in the context of discussing whether the Commonwealth had proved that the defendant was a \u201cpractitioner,\u201d not whether he had \u201cdispensed.\u201d Likewise, our statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>addressed the defendant\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he issued an invalid prescription under \u00a7 19. In no case have we said that the inquiry under the drug statutes is limited to establishing a violation of \u00a7 19. At most, we have said that an invalid prescription is a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, condition of convicting a physician under the drug statutes; essential though they may be, the elements of \u00a7 19 do not include proof that a physician \u201cdispensed\u201d the substance prescribed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatfield-Taylor, supra. </em>Indeed, in both <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 812 (1984) <em>(Perry), </em>and <em>Comins, supra </em>at 231-232, it was necessary to determine whether the conduct of the defendants in those cases satisfied the statutory definition of \u201c[dispense,\u201d and specifically whether delivery was made to an \u201c[ultimate user.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Just two of our cases, <em>Comins, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra, </em>treat the definition of \u201c [ultimate user\u201d at any length. Those cases addressed limited questions and, as a result, offered limited answers. We have held that undercover police officers posing as patients qualify as \u201cultimate users,\u201d <em>Comins, supra </em>at 231, and that a physician who prescribes to himself does not, <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812. In <em>Comins, supra, </em>the undercover police officers had lawful possession because they \u201creceived the prescriptions in pursuit of their work.\u201d Moreover, the possession was for their \u201cown use\u201d as required by the statute because they were \u201cacting in the role of a consumer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Perry, supra, </em>we held that possession was not lawful because the physician prescribed controlled substances to himself \u201cwithout medical justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Although the <em>Perry </em>case appears to equate an invalid prescription \u25a0\u2014 one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>issued without a legitimate medical purpose in violation of \u00a7 19 \u25a0\u2014 with unlawful possession by the recipient of that prescription, that determination likely was driven by the unique nature of the conduct involved, i.e., self-prescribing. We noted that the acts for which the defendant was indicted, dispensing or distributing, required \u201cdelivery.\u201d See <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812-813. Because to \u201cdeliver\u201d a substance required a transfer <em>\u201cfrom one person to </em>another\u201d (emphasis in original), the defendant could not be guilty under the drug statutes of acts that amounted to self-prescribing controlled substances. <em>Id., </em>quoting G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. Instead, we held that unlawful possession was the appropriate charge. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 813-814.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">There is a potential answer to this concern. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Badia, </em>490 F.2d 296, 298 n.4 (1st Cir. 1973), the court stated that \u201cthe reason Congress included the term \u2018dispense\u2019 in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 841(a)(1) was to compel physicians to become properly licensed.\u201d Relying on that statement, we indicated that the Massachusetts Legislature intended the same when it included \u201cdispense\u201d in the drug statutes. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 812 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The logic of this view is that \u201clawful possession\u201d by a patient suggests that a physician has prescribed a substance to the patient for a legitimate medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>purpose, and that the only crime that could conceivably result from such a transaction would be based on the physician\u2019s failure to register properly with the State.

L. c. 94C, \u00a7 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Again, we are not presented with the circumstances discussed at note 14, <em>supra, </em>in which a physician issues a prescription to a patient for a legitimate medical purpose but without complying with the registration requirements of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 7. Nor are we presented with a case that involves a physician issuing an invalid prescription (one not issued for a legitimate medical purpose) to a patient who believes that the physician is engaging in legitimate treatment. Thus, we do not address what act a physician commits by intentionally overmedicating or intentionally misprescribing substances to patients who seek honest medical services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
