Our recent decision in <em>State v. Flores, </em>259 Or App 141, 313 P3d 378 (2013), is dispositive of those assignments of error in favor of defendant. Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions to merge the guilty verdicts on Counts 3 and 4 into a single conviction for felon in possession of a firearm with a firearm and for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to merge guilty verdicts for unlawful use of a deadly weapon with a firearm (Count 3) and felon in possession of a firearm with a firearm (Count 4) into a single conviction for felon in possession of a firearm with a firearm and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\"> The jury found defendant not guilty on Count 1 (kidnapping in the second degree).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\"> We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error. <em>State v.
