Prior to <em>voir dire, </em>defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that defendant had indicated that he would like to act as his own lawyer. The court summarily denied defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\u201cWhen a defendant asks to represent himself, the court must determine, on the record, whether his decision is an intelligent and understanding one.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>110 Or App 358, 360, 822 P2d 736 (1991). \u201cThe court must also determine whether granting the defendant\u2019s request would disrupt the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The state concedes that the court failed to make a record as to whether defendant\u2019s decision was an \u201cintelligent and understanding one,\u201d and whether \u201cgranting * * * defendant\u2019s request would disrupt the judicial process.\u201d <em>See State v. Miller, </em>254 Or App 514, 523-24, 295 P3d 158 (2013) (holding that the trial court committed error when it denied the defendant\u2019s self-representation request without referring to, or purporting to base its decision on, any anticipated disruption of the judicial process). The state further concedes that the trial court\u2019s failure to do so in this case requires us to reverse and remand for a new trial. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
