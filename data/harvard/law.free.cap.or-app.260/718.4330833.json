After stopping defendant for failure to wear a seat belt, a deputy sheriff sergeant questioned defendant while he was handcuffed in the sergeant\u2019s patrol car. During questioning and before he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, defendant said that the deputies could search his vehicle. Another deputy sheriff conducted the search, found a fanny pack under the passenger seat, and opened it, thereby discovering the methamphetamine. Defendant contends that the trial court should have suppressed his statements and the physical evidence due to the violation of his rights under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. We agree and reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We present the facts from the trial court\u2019s findings and the suppression hearing, viewed in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Guggenmos, </em>350 Or 243, 245, 253 P3d 1042 (2011); <em>State v. Pickle, </em>253 Or App 235, 237, 288 P3d 1039 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 428 (2013). Defendant and his passenger, Keith, were driving in Douglas County when Sergeant Robeson observed that defendant was not wearing a seatbelt. Robeson stopped defendant and asked him for his driver\u2019s license, but defendant did not produce a license or any other form of picture identification. Robeson then asked defendant to step out of the car and detained him to verify his identity. Robeson handcuffed defendant, searched him, and placed him in the back of his patrol car. Deputy Poe arrived to assist around the time Robeson was taking defendant into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Robeson and Poe both attempted to identify defendant. Robeson asked defendant questions about his identity and filled out a form based on defendant\u2019s responses. Defendant told Robeson that he was from Utah and gave him other identifying information, which Robeson then gave to dispatch to search for an Oregon or Utah driver\u2019s license. Meanwhile, Poe used his in-car computer to search for more information about defendant, including looking for mug shots from the local jail and \u201cwants and warrants.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Before dispatch responded, Robeson further asked defendant whether there was \u201canything in the vehicle that we should be concerned about.\u201d Defendant answered \u201cno\u201d to that. Robeson did not ask for consent to search; however, defendant then volunteered that, if the deputies wanted to \u201csearch the vehicle,\u201d they could.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Poe found that there was a restraining order entered against defendant and informed Robeson, who then told Poe about defendant\u2019s consent to search the car. Poe conducted the search while Robeson interviewed Keith. Among other things, Poe found a fanny pack under the passenger seat. He showed it to Keith and asked whether it was hers. She said that it did not belong to her. Poe then opened the fanny pack and found several small zip-lock plastic bags, a pill bottle, and plastic straws, all containing a white powder residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Poe and Robeson then returned to defendant after a third deputy, Thornton, arrived to assist. Poe gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked questions about what Poe had found in the car. Defendant then made incriminating statements, including admitting that the fanny pack was his and that there was drug paraphernalia in it. Thornton\u2019s field test on one of the plastic bags indicated that the white residue it contained was methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In seeking to suppress all evidence resulting from the search, including his incriminating statements, defendant argued, among other things, that the evidence should be suppressed because of a <em>Miranda </em>violation. Defendant contended that he was in custody and under compelling circumstances while he was handcuffed in the police vehicle and that Robeson was asking defendant questions without giving required <em>Miranda </em>warnings for the purpose of furthering a criminal investigation, beyond issuing a traffic citation. His consent to search the vehicle, he argued, was invalid because it was obtained during that period of questioning. Defendant also contended that, even if he had validly consented to a search of the vehicle, the state did not meet its burden to establish that his consent extended to a search of all of the vehicle\u2019s contents and closed containers. Thus, the search of the fanny pack was \u201cnot within the scope of the consent search\u201d and, without a warrant, was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>To counter those arguments, the state asserted that defendant was not being interrogated when Robeson asked him about \u201canything of concern\u201d in the vehicle. The state characterized that as part of routine questioning in connection with an attempt to positively identify defendant and asserted that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. The state further argued that defendant had volunteered his consent to a search of the vehicle and, because no one else claimed to own the fanny pack, the officers had consent to search the fanny pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The trial court agreed with the state. It concluded that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required until Poe returned to defendant after having discovered the fanny pack and that defendant volunteered his consent to a search of the car, upon which Poe was entitled to rely when he opened the fanny pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On appeal, the state\u2019s position and the locus of the disputed issues have shifted. The state now concedes that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required because defendant was in custody while handcuffed and being questioned in the police vehicle. Nevertheless, the state contends that the trial court correctly denied suppression of the evidence given defendant\u2019s spontaneous offer of consent to search his car while he was in custody. Defendant generally reprises the arguments he made in the trial court, asserting that, under <em>State v. Vondehn, </em>348 Or 462, 236 P3d 691 (2010), his consent to a search of the vehicle, other statements he made, and the discovery of the physical evidence all derived from a violation of Article I, section 12, and should be suppressed. To address the trial court\u2019s determination that he spontaneously volunteered consent to search his car, defendant asserts that the questioning without a <em>Miranda </em>warning directly affected his responses and that he offered the search in an attempt to extricate himself from the situation by appearing to have nothing to hide; thus, the fact that he volunteered, rather than was asked to give, consent is of no consequence in the causal chain of events that led from a violation of his rights to the state\u2019s acquisition of evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">As noted at the outset, we conclude that the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>This case is largely governed by the principles and reasoning that the Supreme Court set forth in <em>Vondehn, </em>and so we discuss that case in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In <em>Vondehn, </em>the Supreme Court closely examined the basis for the requirement that police inform people in custody of their right against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. The court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201c[b]ecause a custodial interrogation is inherently compelling, and to ensure the validity of a waiver of the right against self-incrimination, Article I, section 12, requires that the police inform a person subjected to custodial interrogation that he or she has a right to remain silent and to consult with counsel and that any statements that the person makes may be used against the person in a criminal prosecution. Article I, section 12, requires those <em>Miranda </em>warnings to ensure that a person\u2019s waiver is knowing as well as voluntary. If the police conduct a custodial interrogation without first obtaining a knowing and voluntary waiver of the suspect\u2019s rights, then they violate the suspect\u2019s Article I, section 12, rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">348 Or at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The Supreme Court also examined the remedies for a violation of an individual\u2019s Article I, section 12, rights. The court explained that, since <em>State v. Magee, </em>304 Or 261, 744 P2d 250 (1987), it consistently had held \u201cthat the Oregon Constitution requires suppression of statements made without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Vondehn, </em>348 Or at 472. It further held that, when the police violate Article I, section 12, such as by failing to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings, \u201cthe state is precluded from using evidence derived from that violation to obtain a criminal conviction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 475-76, including \u201cphysical evidence that is derived from that constitutional violation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">On facts similar to those in this case, the court applied those principles to suppress evidence of the defendant\u2019s statements and the marijuana found in his backpack during a brief custodial interrogation before he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The defendant in <em>Vondehn </em>was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a patrol car. An officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>then asked the defendant two questions about the backpack that the police had found in the car in which the defendant had been a passenger. In response to the first question, the defendant admitted that he owned the backpack and that it contained marijuana. The officer next asked whether the police could search it, and the defendant consented. Relying on his consent, the officer searched the backpack, discovered marijuana, gave the defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and questioned him further. <em>Id. </em>at 464. The Supreme Court held that the police violated the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 12, and that the defendant\u2019s two responses and the marijuana derived from that violation should be suppressed. <em>Id. </em>at 476. In so holding, the court noted that the state had not argued that the request for consent to search or the seizure of the marijuana \u201cderived from some source other than\u201d the defendant\u2019s answers to questions posed before he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Like the defendant in <em>Vondehn, </em>defendant in this case was in custody while handcuffed in the sheriffs patrol car, and Robeson should have provided defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as the state now acknowledges. Defendant correctly asserts on appeal, and the state concedes, that, when Robeson asked defendant whether he had \u201canything we should be concerned about\u201d in the car, Robeson was interrogating defendant without having informed defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See State v. Schwerbel, </em>233 Or App 391, 399, 226 P3d 100, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 172 (2010) (\u201creadily\u201d concluding that the officer\u2019s question to the defendant \u201cabout possessing \u2018anything\u2019 that [the officer] \u2018needed to be aware of was a question that was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Because of that violation of his rights under Article I, section 12, defendant argues that we must reverse given the causal connection between the unwarned interrogation and the initial statements he made and the discovery of the drugs and drug paraphernalia in the fanny pack, which were then followed by his admissions concerning those items. Citing <em>State v. Ayles, </em>348 Or 622, 237 P3d 805 (2010), defendant asserts that the incriminating statements he made when confronted with the drugs and drug paraphernalia should have been suppressed, despite the fact that he made those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>statements after being given belated <em>Miranda </em>warnings, because his statements were the product of the discovery of the physical evidence in the fanny pack. Defendant further argues that the state failed to meet its burden to prove that the causal connection between the constitutional violation and the evidence to be suppressed should be disregarded, for example, because the deputies inevitably would have discovered the evidence through lawful procedures or because the deputies obtained the evidence from an independent source.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">For its part, the state agrees that there is a causal connection between Robeson\u2019s interrogation of defendant without <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the discovery of the evidence in the car. And, the state makes no argument that defendant\u2019s subsequent incriminating statements lack any causal connection to the constitutional violation. However, the state contends that, because \u201cdefendant voluntarily offered his consent to a search of his vehicle\u201d (even while subjected to the custodial interrogation without <em>Miranda </em>warnings), that consent \u201csevered any unlawful taint\u201d of the Article I, section 12, violation. The state argues that the causal connection between the constitutional violation and the evidence in this case is \u201ctoo tenuous\u201d to allow defendant a remedy, relying primarily on two cases involving the protections in Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution against unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>290 Or 493, 624 P2d 99 (1981), and <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 854 P2d 399 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We reject the state\u2019s argument that those cases are persuasive in our analysis of the causal connection between the violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 12, and the evidence to be suppressed in this case. Although <em>Kennedy </em>involved a motion to suppress after the defendant spontaneously consented to a search of his luggage, 290 Or at 496, that case concerned the voluntariness of consent to a warrantless search, <em>id. </em>at 499-501. As we recently observed in <em>State v. Marshall, </em>254 Or App 419, 428 n 10, 295 P3d 128 (2013), although a case involving a waiver of constitutional rights in the search and seizure context under Article I, section 9, can have some commonality with a case involving a waiver of rights against self-incrimination in the Article I, section 12, context, it is important to remember a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>difference between the two: \u201cvalid waiver of an accused\u2019s right against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution must be both <em>knowing </em>and voluntary, whereas valid consent to search under Article I, section 9, need only be voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Kennedy </em>did not address the knowing waiver of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><em>Rodriguez </em>also involved a warrantless search, 317 Or at 29, but one conducted when the defendant spontaneously volunteered consent to a search of his apartment after he was arrested, had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and was asked whether he had any guns or drugs in his apartment, <em>id. </em>at 30. The Supreme Court noted that the defendant was free not to answer the question in light of his understanding of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 41 n 15. The court held that there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, because the police had not done anything during the encounter to \u201cexploit any unlawful conduct to obtain\u201d the defendant\u2019s consent to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 41. This case, though, involves the failure to provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thus, neither <em>Kennedy </em>nor <em>Rodriguez </em>addresses whether an individual\u2019s rights against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, should be vindicated through suppression of evidence when the individual under interrogation spontaneously consents to a search without having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Vondehn </em>suggests the answer to that question, because in both that case and this one, the causal connection is direct, with the police obtaining evidence through their failure to ensure that the persons in custody knowingly waived their right against self-incrimination. In <em>Vondehn, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that both the defendant\u2019s unwarned affirmative response to the question whether the police could search his backpack, as well as the physical evidence discovered during the resulting search, should be suppressed because his response and the physical evidence were \u201cderived from\u201d the Article I, section 12, violation. In this case, although Robeson did not specifically ask defendant to provide consent to a search, we agree with defendant that his unwarned statement giving consent to search was prompted by Robeson\u2019s question during a custodial interrogation, which is \u201cinherently compelling.\u201d <em>Vondehn, </em>348 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>at 474. Although the trial court determined that defendant gave consent voluntarily, we also agree with defendant that the deputies exploited, or took advantage of, the Article I, section 12, violation to obtain his consent; he offered consent during a custodial interrogation while denying any wrongdoing. Thus, the police proceeded and obtained consent without securing from defendant both \u201ca knowing and voluntary waiver\u201d of rights under Article I, section 12. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the state does not offer a separate response to defendant\u2019s contention that the deputies exploited the Article I, section 12, violation by confronting him with the unlawfully discovered physical evidence and using that evidence to obtain his admissions. <em>See Ayles, </em>348 Or at 638-39 (affirming suppression of incriminating statements and physical evidence, because they were derived from illegal police conduct and the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings did not \u201cbreak the causal chain\u201d of events, which went from illegal seizure, to illegal search, to discovery of some physical evidence, to arrest and the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and to the defendant\u2019s admissions and the discovery of additional physical evidence). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
