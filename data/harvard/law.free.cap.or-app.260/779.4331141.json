ORS 426.130. She contends that the trial court erred in concluding that, as a result of a mental disorder, she is (1) a danger to herself and (2) unable to provide for her basic personal needs and is not receiving the care necessary for her health or safety. <em>See </em>ORS 426.005(l)(e). The state concedes that the record does not contain legally sufficient evidence to support the involuntary commitment and that the trial court\u2019s order should be reversed. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
