First, he contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of a videotaped interview of the child victim violated OEC 403 because the interview was \u201coverly prejudicial in comparison to its probative value.\u201d Second, he argues that the court erred by allowing the jury to access the videotaped interview during its deliberations. And third, he asserts that the court erred when it refused to merge his guilty verdicts for first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error without further discussion. As to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, the state concedes that defendant\u2019s two convictions for first-degree sexual abuse should have merged into a single conviction because the convictions were based on a single act of sexual contact that was charged under different theories of the single offense of first-degree sexual abuse. ORS 161.067(3); see <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 355, 211 P3d 262 (2009) (legislature intended to create a single crime of first-degree sexual abuse for single incident of sexual touching). We agree, and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to merge defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 2 into his conviction on Count 3 and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
