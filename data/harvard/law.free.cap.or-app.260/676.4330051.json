We address only petitioners\u2019 first argument \u2014 that the challenged rule authorizes a technique that is not encompassed within the practice of \u201cchiropractic,\u201d as defined by ORS 684.010(2)\u2014 which is dispositive. Because we conclude that dry needling does not fall within the practice of chiropractic, we declare OAR 811-015-0036 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Under ORS 183.400(1), \u201cany person\u201d may petition this court to determine the validity of a rule. In reviewing a rule challenge under that statute, we may declare the rule invalid only if we conclude that it violates constitutional provisions, exceeds the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the rule, or was adopted without complying with rulemaking procedures. ORS 183.400(4). Here, petitioners do not argue that OAR 811-015-0036 is unconstitutional or that its adoption was procedurally flawed; they assert only that the rule exceeds the board\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">To determine whether a challenged rule exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority, we may consider only \u201cthe wording of the rule itself (read in context) and the statutory provisions authorizing the rule.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Oregon Lottery Commission, </em>344 Or 345, 355, 182 P3d 180 (2008) (citing ORS 183.400(3)(a), (b)). Based on those sources, we consider whether the agency\u2019s adoption of the rule exceeded the authority granted by statute and, further, whether the agency \u201cdeparted from a legal standard expressed or implied in the particular law being administered, or contravened some other applicable statute.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 565, 687 P2d 785 (1984). In making that determination, we seek to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the relevant statutes and, if useful to the analysis, pertinent legislative history. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (describing statutory analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>We begin with the statutory provisions authorizing the board to adopt rules related to the practice of chiropractic in Oregon. The board has the authority \u201c[t]o enforce the provisions of [ORS chapter 684] and to exercise general supervision over the practice of chiropractic within this state,\u201d ORS 684.155(l)(b) and \u201cshall from time to time adopt such rules as it deems proper and necessary for the administration of this chapter and the performance of its work,\u201d ORS 684.150(1). Thus, for the board to adopt a valid rule under ORS chapter 684, the rule must relate to the practice of \u201cchiropractic.\u201d ORS 684.010(2) defines \u201cchiropractic\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">\u201c(a) That system of adjusting with the hands the articulations of the bony framework of the human body, and the employment and practice of physiotherapy, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy and minor surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201c(b) The chiropractic diagnosis, treatment and prevention of body dysfunction; correction, maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects thereof or interferences therewith by the utilization of all recognized and accepted chiropractic diagnostic procedures and the employment of all rational therapeutic measures as taught in approved chiropractic colleges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Here, the challenged rule defines dry needling and explicitly states that the technique falls within the statutory definition of \u201cchiropractic.\u201d The rule provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201cDry needling is within the chiropractic physicians [sic] scope of practice for the treatment of myofascial trigger-point [sic] pursuant to ORS 684.010(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201c(1) Dry Needling is a technique used to evaluate and treat myofascial trigger points that uses a dry needle, without medication, that is inserted into a trigger point that has been identified by examination in accordance with OAR 811-015-0010 with the goal of releasing/inactivating the trigger points, relieving pain and/or improving function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">OAR 811-015-0036. Petitioners argue that dry needling does not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d under ORS 684.010 (2)(a) because it does not fall within any of the enumerated categories of treatment. Further, petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>argue that, because dry needling does not fit within the definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d in subsection (a), it cannot fall within the definition of <em>\u201cchiropractic </em>diagnosis, treatment and prevention of body dysfunction\u201d under subsection (b). (Emphasis added.) Respondents argue that dry needling fits within the statutory definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d because it is a form of \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d under ORS 684.010(2)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it is performed for the \u201ctreatment and prevention of body dysfunction\u201d under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\">As noted, when interpreting a statute, we seek to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the statute and, if useful to the analysis, pertinent legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-72. The question here is whether dry needling falls within the definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d under ORS 684.010(2)(a) as a form of \u201cphysiotherapy.\u201d We begin by observing that the term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d was added to the law as an amendment in 1927, and there is no available legislative history relating to that amendment. However, based on the statute\u2019s text and context, we conclude that the dry needling technique does not fall within the intended meaning of \u201cphysiotherapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d is not defined in ORS chapter 684 or other related statutes; thus, dictionary definitions can help us discern the term\u2019s plain, natural and ordinary meaning. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175. When \u201cinterpreting the words of a statute enacted many years ago, we may seek guidance from dictionaries that were in use at the time.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>336 Or 49, 53, 77 P3d 313 (2003); see <em>also Hopkins v. SAIF, </em>349 Or 348, 360-64, 245 P3d 90 (2010) (interpreting the statutory term \u201carthritis\u201d using <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>and medical dictionaries that were in use when the statutory provision was enacted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>respondents assert that the term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d is synonymous with \u201cphysical therapy.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1707 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d as \u201c: PHYSICAL THERAPY\u201d). Respondents point out that the term \u201cphysical therapy\u201d is defined by <em>Webster\u2019s </em>as \u201cthe treatment of disease by physical and mechanical means (as massage, regulated exercise, water, light, heat, electricity).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on that definition, respondents assert, without further explanation, that \u201c[d]ry needling falls within the category of treatment by physical or mechanical means, <em>i.e., </em>of physiotherapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">As noted, the term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d was added to the law in 1927. At that time, <em>The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>defined \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d as \u201c[t]he use of natural forces, such as light, heat, air, water, and exercise, in the treatment of disease.\u201d W. A. Newman Dorland, <em>The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>801 (11th ed 1922). Similarly, A <em>Practical Medical Dictionary </em>defined \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d as \u201cphysiatrics,\u201d which in turn was defined as \u201c[t]he use of natural forces in the treatment of disease.\u201d Thomas Lathrop Stedman, A <em>Practical Medical Dictionary </em>775, 774 (7th rev ed 1922). Those definitions would suggest that physiotherapy uses \u201cnatural forces\u201d similar to \u201clight, heat, air, water, and exercise.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We now turn to the context of the statute. Petitioners contend that dry needling cannot lawfully be considered physiotherapy in Oregon because physical therapists in this state are not authorized to practice that technique. The essence of petitioners\u2019 argument is that, because the term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d is synonymous with \u201cphysical therapy,\u201d the statutes regulating the practice of physical therapy in Oregon, set forth in ORS chapter 688, provide helpful context for interpreting the term \u201cphysiotherapy\u201d in ORS 684.010(2)(a). In this instance, we decline to consider the definitions and rules relating to the practice of physical therapy, because the term we seek to define in this case is \u201cphysiotherapy,\u201d not \u201cphysical therapy.\u201d Even if we were to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>legal definition of \u201cphysical therapy\u201d excludes dry needling (which we do not decide here), we would not be compelled to conclude that the legislature intended for the two different terms to have the same legal meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\">We do find other provisions of the same statute helpful to our analysis. <em>Perry, </em>336 Or at 55-56. When the legislature added the category of physiotherapy to the definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d in 1927, it also added the categories of \u201celectrotherapy\u201d and \u201chydrotherapy.\u201d <em>See </em>Or Laws 1927, ch 450, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Electrotherapy was defined at the time as \u201c[t]he employment of electricity in the treatment of disease!,]\u201d and hydrotherapy was defined as \u201c [treatment of disease by means of water applied in various ways!.]\u201d Stedman, <em>A Practical Medical Dictionary </em>at 308, 468. The addition of physiotherapy, electrotherapy, and hydrotherapy to the definition of \u201cchiropractic\u201d indicates an expansion of the practice to include not just \u201cthat system of adjusting with the hands the articulations of the bony framework of the human body,\u201d but also treatment methods that include other tools and sources of energy \u2014 those involved in physiotherapy (light, heat, air, water, and exercise), electrotherapy (electricity), and hydrotherapy (water).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">With that understanding of the text and context of the statute, we turn to the question whether dry needling is a form of \u201cphysiotherapy,\u201d as that term is used in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>684.010(2)(a), and is therefore \u201cchiropractic.\u201d The challenged rule defines dry needling as \u201ca technique used to evaluate and treat myofascial trigger points that uses a dry needle, without medication, that is inserted into a trigger point that has been identified by examination * * * with the goal of releasing/inactivating the trigger points, relieving pain and/or improving function.\u201d OAR 811-015-0036(1). A \u201ctrigger point\u201d is a small, sensitive area that, when stimulated, gives rise to a reaction elsewhere in the body. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2444 (defining \u201ctrigger point\u201d as \u201ca small trigger area[,]\u201d where a \u201ctrigger area\u201d is defined as \u201ca sensitive area of the body stimulation of which gives rise to reaction elsewhere in the body ***\u201d). The term \u201cmyofascial\u201d refers to a sheet of fibrous tissue surrounding and separating muscle tissue. <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1173, 647 (27th ed 2000) (defining \u201cmyofascial\u201d as \u201c[o]f or relating to the fascia surrounding and separating muscle tissue [,]\u201d where \u201cfascia\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] sheet of fibrous tissue that envelops the body beneath the skin; it also encloses muscles and groups of muscles, and separates their several layers or groups\u201d). Thus, plainly stated, dry needling is the insertion of a needle, without medication, into the tissue surrounding or separating the muscles within an identified, sensitive area, to relieve pain or improve function.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Based on that definition of dry needling, the question reduces to whether the insertion of a needle into the tissue surrounding a muscle uses a \u201cnatural force\u201d similar to \u201clight, heat, air, water, and exercise\u201d \u2014 that is, whether a needle is a natural force. We conclude that it is not. A needle used in dry needling is neither \u201cnatural\u201d nor is it a \u201cforce.\u201d In contrast to light, heat, air, water, and exercise \u2014 as well as the electricity and water used in electrotherapy and hydrotherapy \u2014 a needle is a man-made <em>object. </em>Moreover, although the use of natural forces may involve man-made objects and devices, we find nothing in the definition of physiotherapy suggesting that the practice of physiotherapy would include the application of a man-made object directly to the internal tissues of a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Because dry needling is not a form of physiotherapy, and respondents do not contend that it falls within any other category of treatment listed in ORS 684.010 (2)(a), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>conclude that dry needling is not within the practice of chiropractic. Thus, the challenged rule exceeds the scope of the board\u2019s statutory authority and is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\">OAR 811-015-0036 held invalid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\"> Respondents do not contend that dry needling involves \u201cadjusting with the hands the articulations of the bony framework of the human body\u201d or that it is a form of electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, or minor surgery. ORS 684.010(2)(a). The term \u201c[mjinor surgery\u201d is defined as \u201cthe use of electrical or other methods for the surgical repair and care incident thereto of superficial lacerations and abrasions, benign superficial lesions, and the removal of foreign bodies located in the superficial structures; and the use of antiseptics and local anesthetics in connection therewith.\u201d ORS 684.010(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> The versions of <em>Webster\u2019s </em>dictionary available in 1927 did not include a definition of \u201cphysiotherapy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-5\"> In 1927, the law was amended to provide, in relevant part (with deletions in bracketed italics and additions in bold):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201c(b) Chiropractic is defined as that system of adjusting with the hand or hands the articulations of the bony framework of the human body, <em>[especially asymmetries of the vertebrae, for the purpose of removing the cause of diseases by the correction of subluxations, thereby removing the pressure, impingement, or tension from the nerves having their passage between, through, or around the structures subluxated.
