The trial court entered an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to return his hashish, and defendant appeals the court\u2019s order. Defendant contends that hashish constitutes \u201cusable marijuana\u201d and, therefore, that it must be returned upon a determination that defendant lawfully possessed it under the OMMA. <em>See </em>ORS 475.323(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that hashish is usable marijuana under the OMMA and, therefore, that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The OMMA adopts the definition of marijuana contained in the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (CSA). ORS 475.302(6). In turn, the CSA defines marijuana to include \u201cevery compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, <em>or preparation </em>of the plant or its resin.\u201d ORS 475.005(16)(a) (emphasis added). We have held that hashish is marijuana under that definition. <em>State v. Ness, </em>54 Or App 530, 538, 635 P2d 1025 (1981), <em>aff'd, </em>294 Or 8, 653 P2d 548 (1982). Similarly, \u201cusable marijuana\u201d under the OMMA is defined to include \u201cany mixture <em>or preparation\u201d </em>of the plant that is appropriate for medical use. ORS 475.302(11) (emphasis added). The state concedes that hashish falls within that definition, and the record supports the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we conclude that the court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for the return of the seized hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> OKS 475.323(2) provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cUsable marijuana * * * that was seized by any law enforcement office shall be returned immediately upon a determination by the district attorney in whose county the property was seized, or the district attorney\u2019s designee, that the person from whom the marijuana * * * was seized is entitled to the protections contained in [the OMMA]. The determination may be evidenced, for example, by a decision not to prosecute, the dismissal of charges or acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
