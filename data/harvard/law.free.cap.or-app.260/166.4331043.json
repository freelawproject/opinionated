Father argues that the juvenile court erred in taking jurisdiction over A, contending that the evidence presented by the Department of Human Services (DHS) \u2014 that father used marijuana and alcohol and was unable to protect A because father was subjected to domestic violence by mother and lacked sole legal custody \u2014 was insufficient to prove that those conditions and circumstances exposed A to a current risk of serious loss or injury that was likely to be realized. We agree with father and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The parties do not request that we exercise our discretion to review this case <em>de novo, </em>ORS 19.415 (3) (b), and we decline to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (we exercise <em>de novo </em>review \u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d). Accordingly, \u201cwe view the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s [determination] and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d De<em>pt. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We recite the facts consistently with the juvenile court\u2019s expressed and implied findings. When A was 23 months old, mother physically assaulted father in A\u2019s presence. Mother was arrested following the assault, and father informed police that he had consumed several alcoholic beverages that evening. Due to mother\u2019s arrest and father\u2019s apparent intoxication, DHS immediately placed A in nonrelative foster care. DHS petitioned the juvenile court to assert jurisdiction over A, pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c), on the following bases relating to father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cE. The father was subjected to domestic violence by the mother and the father is unable to protect the child from exposure to mother\u2019s violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cF. The father of the child does not have sole legal custody of the child and is unable to protect the child from the mother\u2019s abusive and neglectful behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">\u201cG. The father\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201cH. The father leaves the child with unsafe caregivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201cI. [The father] is said child\u2019s legal father as he is listed on said child\u2019s birth certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In the month before the jurisdictional hearing, father ended his relationship with mother and obtained a restraining order against her. After obtaining the restraining order, father called police to enforce it during a face-to-face confrontation with mother. Additionally, father initiated proceedings to obtain sole legal custody of A, but his petition had not yet been granted at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. Father also moved from mother\u2019s residence to a friend\u2019s house. When DHS determined that that residence was unsuitable, due to the presence of marijuana discovered during a housing evaluation, father then arranged to move to a family-friendly, sober housing facility, where he and A could live together. Father participated in drug and alcohol assessments, weekly outpatient treatment meetings, and random urinalysis. Father was expected to complete the treatment program approximately two months after the jurisdictional hearing, but only if he continued participation in the outpatient treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">At the jurisdictional hearing, the evidence presented focused on father\u2019s marijuana and alcohol use, father\u2019s lack of safe housing, and A\u2019s behavioral issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Relating to the jurisdictional basis that father was unable to protect A because he was subjected to domestic violence by mother, DHS presented evidence of father\u2019s past relationship with mother, prior instances of domestic violence, A\u2019s presence and exposure to domestic violence, the status of father\u2019s restraining order against mother, and whether father had acted to enforce the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Relating to the jurisdictional basis that father was unable to protect A from mother\u2019s domestic violence because he lacked sole legal custody of A, DHS presented evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of mother\u2019s prior history of domestic violence toward father stemming from mother\u2019s mental health issues. As noted, by the time of the jurisdictional hearing, father had ended his relationship with mother and had filed for sole legal custody. Father detailed the terms of the petition for sole legal custody that he had filed before the jurisdictional hearing, mentioning that the terms of that petition would require mother to have supervised parenting time with A, at her expense, if she could demonstrate that she was accessing and receiving treatment for her mental health conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Regarding the jurisdictional basis that \u201cfather\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent\u201d A, DHS presented the following evidence: Father used alcohol two to three times per week and used marijuana a few times a week prior to A\u2019s removal, and had had a prior methamphetamine addiction. There was no evidence that he was currently engaging in methamphetamine use. Father was intoxicated on the night of the domestic violence incident, as demonstrated by his flushed face, watery and bloodshot eyes, and slow and slurred speech. One of the police officers who responded to father\u2019s domestic violence call testified that he had not felt comfortable leaving A in father\u2019s care, based on his assessment of father\u2019s high level of intoxication, angry outbursts, and prior criminal history. Father had begun drug and alcohol treatment and random urinalysis, and had had no positive urinalyses relating to alcohol, but with regard to father\u2019s marijuana use, the evidence showed only that father\u2019s \u201cTHC levels have been dropping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">DHS also presented evidence that A was exhibiting \u201cconcerning\u201d behaviors. DHS caseworker, McLachlan, testified that A\u2019s foster parents were concerned about A\u2019s behavior, specifically that he would hit and bite others, would scream for hours, and was difficult to soothe. However, A had not exhibited those behaviors during visits with father. The foster parents also noted that A\u2019s legs were bowed and he was unable to walk well, and A had primarily been bottle fed prior to entering foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">DHS asserted that father lacked safe housing at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. Father\u2019s first attempt to have A returned to his care failed due to a caseworker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>discovery of marijuana during a housing inspection. Father had procured a housing unit at a sober-housing facility, but the unit was not available at the time of the hearing. Father\u2019s interim plan for safe housing, if A were to be returned to his care, was to check into a hotel until the sober-housing unit was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">At the close of the evidence, the juvenile court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cOkay. So I believe that the State has proven the petition as to many of the allegations but not all. I think the State proved *** E, F, G and I, * * * not H. The child is within the jurisdiction of [the] Court * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In response to father\u2019s argument that the court should not assert jurisdiction over A because DHS had not proved that A was exposed to a <em>current </em>risk of harm, the juvenile court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cOkay. Thank you. I disagree. In any event, the child is a ward of the Court. We\u2019re going to set disposition out for a relatively brief period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. I would like to see \u2014 I hope that [father] is correct that he\u2019ll get a place in this clean and sober living house in the near future. I don\u2019t want to see the child go and stay with him a week for [sic] a hotel. And you know, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s willing to spend the money, but frankly, he ought to be saving that money. As long as he can remain clean and sober and keep himself and the child away from the mother, you know, my intention is to force the government to give the kid back to him as soon as he finds a reasonable place to live.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">On appeal, father argues that the trial court erred when it asserted jurisdiction over A because DHS failed to prove that, as of the time of the jurisdictional hearing, A was exposed to a current threat of serious loss or injury due to father\u2019s conditions or circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Juvenile dependency jurisdiction is appropriate when a child\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare\u201d of the child. ORS 419B.100(l)(c). To determine if the child is \u201cendangered,\u201d we look to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the child is exposed to conditions or circumstances that \u201cpresent a <em>current </em>threat of serious loss or injury.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. J. T., </em>258 Or App 57, 61, 308 P3d 307 (2013) (emphasis added). DHS must prove that there is a nexus between the allegedly risk-causing conduct and the harm to the child. <em>Id. </em>at 62 (citing <em>Dept. of Human Services v. D. S. F., </em>246 Or App 302, 314, 266 P3d 116 (2011) (DHS has the burden to prove that the threat of harm is current and not speculative)); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. F., </em>243 Or App 379, 386, 259 P3d 957 (2011). Moreover, when evaluating whether a parent\u2019s alleged behavior may cause harm to the child sufficient to support dependency jurisdiction, we must consider that \u201c[t]he fact that a parent engages in behavior that could negatively affect his or her parenting does not necessarily mean that the behavior can serve as a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction over a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. We examine the totality of the circumstances to determine if there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the child\u2019s welfare. <em>C. J. T, </em>258 Or App at 61-62 (citing <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 440, 236 P3d 791 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Even assuming that father\u2019s status as a domestic violence victim, lack of sole legal custody of A, and substance abuse could create a threat of harm to A, we conclude that, on this record, the state failed to establish that there was a current, nonspeculative threat of serious loss or injury to A as of the time of the jurisdictional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">DHS presented no evidence that father could not protect A from mother\u2019s violence because he had been subjected to domestic violence by mother and lacked sole legal custody. Without evidence that father is unable to protect A, or that A will suffer some actual harm because father lacks sole legal custody, lack of a custody order alone is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction. <em>C. J. T., </em>258 Or App at 62; <em>see also State v. A. L. M., </em>232 Or App 13, 16, 220 P3d 449 (2009) (absent evidence that a parent \u201cis a present danger to [the child]\u2019s welfare, the lack of a custody order alone is not sufficient for jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 419B.100\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Furthermore, although we acknowledge that father\u2019s alcohol and marijuana use has the potential to constitute \u201cconditions or circumstances\u201d that could expose A to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>a threat of harm, DHS presented no evidence to show how father\u2019s alcohol or marijuana use had harmed \u2014 or created a risk of harm to \u2014 A or the extent to which father\u2019s alcohol or marijuana use affected father\u2019s daily functioning or his ability to parent. <em>A.F., </em>243 Or App at 387. DHS also presented no evidence that, as of the time of the hearing, father was currently using alcohol, nor was there any evidence of the \u201ceffects of that use on the parent\u2019s conduct [which is] necessary to determine whether the parent\u2019s alcohol use creates a \u2018reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare\u2019 of his * * * child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, although DHS presented evidence regarding A\u2019s \u201cconcerning\u201d behavioral problems, there was nothing to suggest that those behavioral problems were in any way related to father\u2019s alcohol and marijuana use or inability to protect A from mother\u2019s violence. <em>C. J. T., </em>258 Or App at 62 (requiring DHS to prove a nexus between the allegedly risk-causing behavior and the harm to the child).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Because DHS failed to establish a current risk of serious loss or injury to A, the requirements of ORS 419B.100(l)(c) have not been met. Thus, we conclude that the record is legally insufficient to support jurisdiction over A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> ORS 419B.100(1) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and *...... (c) [wjhose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\"> We note that DHS presented no evidence directly connecting father\u2019s housing situation at the time of the jurisdictional hearing to a <em>current </em>risk of harm to A based on father\u2019s inability to protect A from mother\u2019s domestic violence or father\u2019s substance abuse. To the extent that the trial court based its jurisdictional decision on father\u2019s housing situation, and because there was no evidence of a nexus between father\u2019s housing situation and a current risk of harm or father\u2019s inability to protect A or substance abuse, the court erred by basing its jurisdictional decision on facts that were not alleged in the petition. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. R. L., </em>256 Or App 437, 447, 300 P3d 291 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
