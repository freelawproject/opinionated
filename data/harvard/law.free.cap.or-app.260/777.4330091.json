The court sentenced defendant to 40 months in prison and 36 months of post-prison supervision on Count 1 and, on Count 4, sentenced him to 20 months in prison, consecutive to the sentence on Count 1, along with 24 months of post-prison supervision. Defendant raises two assignments of error on appeal. In his first assignment, defendant asserts that a consecutive sentence in this case is not authorized under ORS 137.123(5) and, therefore, the trial court was required to impose concurrent sentences. We reject that assignment of error without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Defendant also contends on appeal that the trial court \u201cerred in imposing a sentence of 20 months incarceration\u201d on Count 4. In particular, he asserts that that sentence exceeds the maximum allowable under OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B). Although he did not preserve the issue before the trial court, defendant argues that we should consider it as plain error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (court has discretion to review unpreserved error apparent on the face of the record). The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred in imposing a 20-month sentence on Count 4 in violation of OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B). We agree with the concession, exercise our discretion to review the error, and conclude that the case must be remanded for resentencing on that basis. <em>See State v. Monro, </em>256 Or App 493, 496-97, 301 P3d 435, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 148 (2013) (treating error in failing to apply OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B) as plain error and exercising discretion to correct it); <em>State v. Davidson, </em>208 Or App 672, 673, 145 P3d 276 (2006) (same); <em>see also </em>ORS 138.222(5)(a) (\u201cIf the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
