J.</author>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The state appeals a judgment dismissing a charge against defendant for unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The trial court dismissed the charge pursuant to a conditional-discharge agreement under which defendant had been placed on probation. <em>See generally </em>ORS 475.245.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state sought a court determination that defendant had violated the terms of her probation and to have the court enter a conviction on the drug-possession charge, but the court rejected the state\u2019s request on the ground that the state had not sought that relief before defendant\u2019s probation had expired. The state assigns error to the dismissal of the charge, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We summarize the facts, which are undisputed. The state charged defendant with a single count of unlawful possession of marijuana, ORS 475.864. Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2007 pursuant to a conditional-discharge agreement. In accordance with the agreement, the court deferred the proceedings and placed defendant on probation with Josephine County Community Corrections for two years. The terms of defendant\u2019s probation required her to pay all of her court-ordered financial obligations, refrain from using or possessing controlled substances without a prescription, and obey all laws. In conformity with ORS 475.245, the court ordered that, on \u201cfulfillment of the terms and conditions of [defendant\u2019s] probation, the court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings without an adjudication of guilt.\u201d (Capitalization altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Defendant\u2019s term of probation ended on February 6, 2009, but neither the state nor defendant took action at that time. On March 19, 2009, in an apparent attempt to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the proceedings, the trial court forwarded defendant\u2019s case register to the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following day, the state filed a motion for an order to show cause why the court should not enter a conviction on the unlawful possession charge that was the subject of the conditional-discharge agreement. The state\u2019s motion, and an accompanying affidavit, alleged that defendant had failed to comply with the terms of her probation. Specifically, it alleged that she had failed to pay her court-ordered financial obligations and had been convicted in October 2008 of theft and of unlawful possession or use of a prescription drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The court conducted a hearing on the show-cause order in August 2010. There, defendant conceded that she had failed to comply with the terms of her probation, but she contended that the court lacked authority to enter a judgment of conviction based on her failure to comply. Defendant argued that, under Oregon\u2019s probationary scheme, the state was required to file its show-cause motion \u2014 or take other action to establish a violation \u2014 before the probationary term expired. Because the state had failed to do that, defendant argued that the court was required to treat defendant as having fulfilled the terms of her probation and, thus, to dismiss the drug-possession charge pursuant to ORS 475.245 and the conditional-discharge agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The state disagreed. It acknowledged that, when a defendant is <em>sentenced </em>to a term of probation, the state cannot initiate probation-violation proceedings after the conclusion of the probationary period. However, it distinguished a sentence of probation, which is imposed in a judgment of conviction, from probation imposed under a conditional-discharge agreement, which defers the proceedings without the entry of a judgment. The state contended that, because there is no judgment in the conditional-discharge context, the trial court retained jurisdiction over defendant \u2014 and, consequently, the authority to find defendant in violation of the terms of her probation \u2014 until the court entered a judgment of conviction or dismissal. And the state contended that, because defendant had not, in fact, complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>terms of her probation, she was ineligible for discharge and dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The trial court agreed with defendant. In a letter opinion, the court explained that ORS 475.245 contemplates \u201ctwo things that can happen\u201d to a defendant who enters into a conditional-discharge agreement: The defendant can either complete the probationary term successfully, obligating the court to dismiss the charge, or the defendant can violate the terms of probation, allowing the court to \u201center an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.\u201d ORS 475.245. The court reasoned that \u201cthe [s]tate must proceed \u2018as otherwise provided\u2019 for a probation violation,\u201d which includes initiating violation proceedings during the probationary term. Because the state had failed to do that, the court concluded that it \u201cretain [ed] jurisdiction\u201d after the completion of defendant\u2019s probationary term \u201conly to dismiss the charge against defendant!] and not to initiate probation violation proceedings.\u201d The court then entered a judgment dismissing the charge against defendant, and the state appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal emphasize different parts of ORS 475.245 and, therefore, must be understood in the context of the entire statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conceptually, ORS 475.245 can be divided into two parts. The first half\u2014 contained in the statute\u2019s first sentence \u2014 addresses the availability and creation of a conditional-discharge agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cWhenever any person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of possession of a controlled substance * * *, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the district attorney and the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the person on probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">ORS 475.245. The second \u2014 contained in the statute\u2019s second and third sentences \u2014 addresses the termination of a conditional-discharge agreement, due to either violation or fulfillment of the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cUpon violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">ORS 475.245.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On appeal, both parties direct their arguments toward the second half of ORS 475.245. The state focuses on the final sentence of the statute, contending that the court\u2019s authority to dismiss the charges against defendant was conditioned on a showing that defendant had \u201cfulfill [ed] the terms and conditions\u201d of her probation. Under the state\u2019s reading, the onus of making that showing, and thereby demonstrating that she is entitled to discharge, rests squarely on defendant. Furthermore, the state contends that the temporal limitation that applies to a court\u2019s authority to enter a probation violation for a defendant serving a <em>sentence </em>of <em>probation </em>\u2014 viz., the trial court\u2019s loss of authority to do that if probation-violation proceedings have not been initiated before the expiration of the defendant\u2019s sentence \u2014 does not apply in the conditional-discharge context. Thus, it contends, ORS 475.245 did not require the state to take action to terminate the conditional-discharge agreement before the end of defendant\u2019s term of probation. Consequently, the state contends that it may seek to establish a probation violation and, if established, the entry of a conviction on the charge that is the subject of a conditional-discharge agreement, at any time until a defendant meets her burden to establish that she is entitled to discharge\u2014 whether during, after, or years after a defendant\u2019s probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Defendant, in turn, focuses on the second sentence of ORS 475.245, noting that, although that sentence grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the court authority to enter a judgment of conviction \u201c [u]pon violation of a term or condition of probation,\u201d ORS 475.245 does not specify how the court is to determine whether a violation has occurred. Emphasizing the use of the term \u201cprobation\u201d throughout ORS 475.245, defendant contends that, because the legislature provided no other definition of probation in the context of a conditional-discharge agreement, the standard rules and procedures for probation must apply. Defendant contends, consequently, that a proceeding to establish a probation violation must be commenced before the expiration of the probationary term. <em>See, e.g., State v. Miller, </em>224 Or App 642, 645, 199 P3d 329 (2008) (court lacks authority to revoke probation if probation-violation proceeding is not initiated before expiration of probationary term). Because the state did not initiate such a proceeding against defendant before the expiration of defendant\u2019s probationary term, defendant argues that the trial court lacked authority to determine that she had violated her probation and correctly dismissed the charge against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As a starting point, we agree with defendant that \u201cprobation,\u201d as used in ORS 475.245, is best understood in the context of the statutes and case law governing probation that existed when the legislature enacted ORS 475.245 in 1977 as part of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Or Laws 1977, ch 745, \u00a7 21. <em>Cf. Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 693, 159 P3d 1151 (2007) (\u201c[W]e generally presume that the legislature enacts statutes in light of existing judicial decisions that have a direct bearing on those statutes.\u201d). Three aspects of ORS 475.245 lead us to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">First, and primarily, is the legislature\u2019s use of the term probation. That term, undefined in ORS 475.245 or the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, evokes the court\u2019s well-delineated statutory authority to impose a term of supervised release in lieu of or in addition to incarceration. <em>See generally </em>ORS 137.520 - 137.630; <em>see also State v. Ludwig, </em>218 Or 483, 492, 344 P2d 764 (1959) (\u201cProbation is a statutory process * * *.\u201d). Thus, we assume that the legislature understood the term to have that well-understood legal meaning. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. County of Jackson County, </em>340 Or 146, 154-55, 129 P3d 694 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Second, the structure of ORS 475.245 supports our conclusion. As noted, conceptually, the statute can be divided in half. The first half sets out, in detail, the creation of a term of probation pursuant to a conditional-discharge agreement; the second half sets out, in detail, the termination of such an agreement. <em>See </em>260 Or App at 19. However, notably absent are any provisions to guide the court or the parties <em>during </em>the term of probation \u2014 that is, aside from the legislature\u2019s decision to employ the term probation. Thus, if the legislature did not intend to import the full features of probation through its use of that term, ORS 475.245 contains a glaring <em>omission </em>\u2014 viz., the lack of direction on administering probation that is imposed under the statute. We do not believe that the legislature intended to do that, especially assuming, as we do, that the legislature enacted ORS 475.245 with full awareness of the probation statutes and case law in effect at the time. <em>See, e.g., DeNucci v. Henningsen, </em>248 Or App 59, 74, 273 P3d 148 (2012) (court assumes that legislature enacts statutes in light of existing judicial decisions relevant to the statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Third, the way in which ORS 475.245 provides for the termination of a conditional-discharge agreement supports the idea that the full procedures and structure of probation apply in the conditional-discharge context. That is because the statute does not contemplate competing, strictly binary outcomes. When a defendant satisfactorily completes a term of probation, the court is obligated to \u201cdischarge the person and dismiss the proceedings.\u201d However, the converse is not true: \u201cUpon violation of a term or condition of probation,\u201d the court <em>\u201cmay </em>enter an adjudication of guilt.\u201d ORS 475.245 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Implicit in that formulation is that the court may also <em>not </em>enter an adjudication of guilt based on a probation violation. The court\u2019s discretion in that respect makes sense only if other, alternative features of probation are available to the court. For example, applying the procedures attendant to probation, the court could instead opt to modify the conditions of probation. <em>See </em>ORS 137.540(6) (\u201cFailure to abide by all general and special conditions [of probation] may result in arrest, modification of conditions, revocation of probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>or imposition of structured, intermediate sanctions ***.\u201d). Likewise, the term of probation could, \u201cin the discretion of the court, be continued or extended.\u201d ORS 137.545(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">For those reasons, we conclude that the legislature intended probation pursuant to ORS 475.245 to mirror probation under ORS chapter 137.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The thrust of the state\u2019s argument on appeal is aimed, not at that broad conclusion, but specifically at the requirement that proceedings to establish a probation violation must commence before the probationary term has expired. That requirement is rooted in <em>Ludwig, </em>218 Or 483. There, the defendant had been sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment, which was suspended while the defendant was placed on a two-year term of probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Just before the end of the defendant\u2019s probationary term, the trial court issued a bench warrant and an order to show cause why the defendant\u2019s probation should not be revoked. The court ultimately revoked the defendant\u2019s probation, but the revocation hearing was held after the termination of the defendant\u2019s probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">On review, the Supreme Court concluded that the statutes governing probation in Oregon at that time authorized each of the trial court\u2019s actions. As relevant here, the court relied on <em>former </em>ORS 137.550 (1957), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 137.545 (1999), which provided, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cAt any time during the probation period, the court may issue a warrant and cause a defendant to be arrested for violating any of the conditions of probation. * * * Thereupon the court, after summary hearing, may revoke the probation and suspension of sentence and cause the sentence imposed to be executed * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The court concluded that, because the court had issued the order to show cause and the bench warrant within the defendant\u2019s probationary period, the court \u201chad jurisdiction\u201d to conduct the revocation proceedings. <em>Ludwig, </em>218 Or at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Much like the parties before us, it appears that the court in <em>Ludwig </em>used the terms \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cauthority\u201d loosely. <em>See id. </em>at 488 <em>(former </em>\u201cORS 137.510 [, <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1971, c. 743, \u00a7 43,] is the source of the authority and jurisdiction for the court to grant probation\u201d). As we have noted above, 260 Or App at 18 n 3, the proper inquiry in this case, as it was in <em>Ludwig, </em>is whether the trial court had statutory authority to impose or revoke probation. <em>See State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>24 Or App 423, 427, 545 P2d 910 (1976) (noting that Oregon has adopted \u201cthe general rule that the sentencing authority of a court exists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power and therefore cannot be exercised in any manner not specifically authorized\u201d). That statutory inquiry is not a jurisdictional one.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Thus, notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s occasional use of the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d the issue in <em>Ludwig </em>reduced to whether the probation statutes in effect at the time gave the trial court the statutory authority <em>to conduct </em>a probation-violation proceeding <em>after </em>the defendant\u2019s term of probation had expired. Building on <em>Ludwig, </em>we addressed in <em>O\u2019Neal </em>whether a trial court has the authority <em>to initiate </em>a probation-violation proceeding <em>after </em>a defendant\u2019s term of probation has expired \u2014 a question that the court in <em>Ludwig </em>expressly declined to address. Relying on the same set of statutes, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">\u201ca court is without authority to revoke probation for a crime committed during the probationary period when revocation proceedings have not been initiated before the probationary period has expired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">24 Or App at 427. Stated another way, taken together, <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>O\u2019Neal </em>stand for the proposition that, <em>\u201cunless [a] defendant\u2019s probation was extended either by the court or by operation of law beyond [its original term], </em>the court commit [s] error by initiating revocation proceedings * * * and revoking probation at a later time.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>224 Or App at 645-46 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Returning to the state\u2019s argument on appeal, we see no basis for the distinction that the state advances between finding a probation violation for a probation imposed as a sentence and doing that for a probation imposed under ORS 475.245. As <em>Ludwig, O\u2019Neal, </em>and <em>Miller </em>demonstrate, a court\u2019s authority to initiate probation-violation proceedings is expressly limited to \u201cany time during the probation period.\u201d ORS 137.545(2). The salutary effect of that rule is that, where, as here, the state fails to initiate proceedings during the probationary period, it cannot establish a probation violation on which the court can act in the case in which the violation determination is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">That brings us, finally, to the state\u2019s characterization of the respective obligations of the state, the court, and defendant on the termination of probation under ORS 475.245, which, again, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">\u201cUpon violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">As noted, the state contends that the court\u2019s authority to dismiss a charge against a defendant is conditioned on a showing that the terms of probation have been satisfied and that, unless and until the defendant makes that showing, the court cannot take action. The state does not point to, and we cannot find, that requirement in the text of ORS 475.245. Nor are we inclined to believe that the legislature intended a system in which the trial court is without authority \u2014 and the state without obligation \u2014 to take any action with respect to a defendant\u2019s charge. To the contrary, by its terms, ORS 475.245 requires the court to dismiss the charges against a defendant on the successful completion of the probationary term, which, for these purposes, is the completion of the term without the state having initiated a probation-violation proceeding against the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Here, defendant\u2019s probationary term expired without the state having initiated a probation-violation proceeding against her. Hence, the trial court lacked authority to find defendant in violation of the terms of her probation and, accordingly, the trial court correctly dismissed the drug-possession charge against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> ORS 475.245 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">\u201cWhenever any person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of possession of a controlled substance * * *, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the district attorney and the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the person on probation. Upon violation of a term or condition of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> That action was accompanied by a note in the register: \u201ccase register sent to DA for dismissal or s/c.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> We note that, although the parties tend to frame their arguments in terms of jurisdictional rules and limitations, this dispute is not jurisdictional in nature. No one disputes that the trial court had jurisdiction over defendant and the case at all times pertinent to this appeal. Instead, the parties\u2019 arguments center on the scope of the trial court\u2019s authority, under ORS 475.245, to enter an adjudication of guilt based on a violation of probation conditions under a conditional-discharge agreement. <em>See State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>24 Or App 423, 427, 545 P2d 910 (1976) (noting that Oregon has adopted \u201cthe general rule that the sentencing authority of a court exists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power and therefore cannot be exercised in any manner not specifically authorized\u201d (citing <em>State v. Cotton, </em>240 Or 252, 400 P2d 1022 (1965)). Likewise, despite the use of the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in its letter opinion, the court\u2019s analysis and its ultimate conclusion rested, not on jurisdictional limitations, but on the scope of the court\u2019s statutory authority under ORS 475.245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\"> We acknowledge that some provisions in ORS chapter 137 refer expressly to a sentence of probation. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 137.523(1) (\u201cjudge sentences the defendant to confinement in a county jail as a condition of probation\u201d); ORS 137.520(2) (\u201chaving sentenced a defendant to probation and having confined the defendant as a condition of that probation\u201d). We need not and do not decide whether those provisions apply in the context of probations imposed under ORS 475.245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> At the time that the court decided <em>Ludwig, </em>probation was not a sentence, but \u201ca release by the court before sentence has commenced.\u201d 218 Or at 486-87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\"> Additionally, <em>Miller </em>was predicated on a trial court\u2019s authority under ORS 137.545, which remains in effect. In contrast, both <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>O\u2019Neal </em>were decided under <em>former </em>ORS 137.550. In any event, the operative language has remained unchanged since <em>Ludwig.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> As we noted earlier, 260 Or App at 21, a court has authority to continue or extend probation imposed under ORS 475.245 notwithstanding a finding that the defendant has violated the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation. In that <em>circumstance </em>\u2014 viz., when the court continues or extends probation notwithstanding a probation violation \u2014 the defendant will not, strictly speaking, have fulfilled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation, but the defendant will nonetheless be entitled to discharge under the conditional-discharge agreement if the defendant otherwise successfully completes the probationary term. The same principle will apply to a defendant who violates the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation but who, because the state did not initiate a probation-violation proceeding before the expiration of the probationary term, will be entitled to discharge and dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
