On appeal, defendant argues that, under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, the court plainly erred in proceeding with the stipulated facts trial without a written waiver of the right to a jury trial. <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 530, 173 P3d 827 (2007) (\u201cThere is no waiver of a jury trial unless that waiver is in writing and, without a waiver, defendant should have been tried by a jury. The judge\u2019s error thus lay in going to trial <em>at all!\u2019 </em>(Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The state, for its part, acknowledges that there is no writing in the record that includes \u201can express statement that defendant intends to \u2018waive\u2019 a right to a trial by a \u2018jury.\u2019\u201d Nonetheless, the state argues that the record includes a document \u2014 namely, a \u201cStipulation of Fact\u201d signed by defendant \u2014 that sufficiently establishes defendant\u2019s intent to proceed without a jury trial. According to the state, that signed stipulation, which recites what the state would be able to prove \u201cif this matter were taken to trial,\u201d should be treated as a written waiver of a jury trial for purposes of Article I, section 11; at the very least, the state argues, there is a reasonable dispute on that point that precludes plain-error review. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (error is not plain if the matter is reasonably in dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We are not persuaded that the \u201cStipulation of Fact\u201d even arguably qualifies as a written election to waive the constitutional right to a jury trial under Article I, section 11. Nothing in the \u201cStipulation of Fact\u201d mentions the right to a jury trial or indicates that defendant even knew that he had such a right, let alone that he knowingly and voluntarily relinquished that constitutional right by stipulating to certain facts. As we stated in <em>State v. Bailey, </em>240 Or App 801, 806, 248 P3d 442 (2011), \u201c[A] written waiver of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to trial by jury must be made of sterner stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Because the record does not contain a written waiver of defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial, the court erred in proceeding with a trial on stipulated facts. <em>Barber, </em>343 Or at 530. Furthermore, for the reasons expressed in <em>Barber, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Bailey, </em>240 Or App at 806 n 4 (explaining that, under <em>Barber, </em>\u201cthis particular species of error is one that is apparent on the face of the record and, because of the unique specificity of Article I, section 11, this court has no discretion to ignore the error, once it is called to our attention\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-5\"> Defendant also challenges other trial court rulings, including the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and its denial of his motion to controvert a search-warrant affidavit. We reject defendant\u2019s other assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
