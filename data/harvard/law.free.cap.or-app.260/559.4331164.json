The state concedes the error. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ledford, </em>252 Or App 572, 287 P3d 1278 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 209 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in imposing a 100-month Measure 11 sentence on his conviction for first-degree rape, arguing that the sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Given that the case must be remanded for resentencing as a result of our disposition of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, <em>see </em>ORS 138.222(5)(b), we do not reach that assignment of error. Finally, we reject without discussion defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental assignment of error, in which he contends that the trial court plainly erred in admitting a physician\u2019s testimony regarding the treatment administered to the victim, which, according to defendant, implied that a diagnosis of sexual abuse had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Reversed and remanded with instruction to merge guilty verdicts for first-degree rape and second-degree sexual abuse into a single conviction for first-degree rape; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> The court found defendant not guilty on Count 2 (coercion); Counts 4 and 5 (fourth-degree assault) were dismissed on the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
