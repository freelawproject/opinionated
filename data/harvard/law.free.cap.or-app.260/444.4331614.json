As a result of a periodic-review process, the City of Woodburn amended its urban growth boundary (UGB) to include additional land \u2014 409 gross acres or about 362 net buildable acres \u2014 for industrial use. The city submitted that amendment to the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) for review. ORS 197.626(l)(b). LCDC approved the city\u2019s amendment of its UGB. Petitioners sought judicial review of LCDC\u2019s order of approval. We concluded that LCDC\u2019s order was inadequate for judicial review and, accordingly, reversed the order and remanded the case to LCDC for reconsideration. <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC, </em>237 Or App 213, 239 P3d 272 (2010) <em>CWoodburn I). </em>LCDC has now completed that reconsideration and issued a new order approving the city\u2019s UGB expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Petitioners again seek judicial review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners challenge two aspects of LCDC\u2019s order: its approval of the amount of industrial land in the UGB amendment and its approval of the inclusion of particular high-value farmland within the UGB as industrial land. Petitioners contend that the city included more industrial land within its UGB than will be developed within the 20-year planning period and that LCDC did not adequately explain why that inclusion is consistent with Statewide Land Use Planning Goals 9 and 14 and other rules. Alternatively, petitioners challenge the city\u2019s inclusion within the UGB of high-value farm land, which by law has the lowest priority for urbanization. Petitioners assert that, by approving the inclusion of that land, LCDC made a decision that erroneously interpreted the law and is not supported by substantial evidence. Because we conclude that LCDC again did not adequately explain why the city\u2019s expansion of its UGB to include an additional 409 acres for industrial use is consistent with pertinent law, we reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the order and remand for reconsideration. Accordingly, we do not reach the second <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., the inclusion of high-value farmland within the city\u2019s UGB.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In the late 1990s, the city began the periodic-review process to update its comprehensive plan and other planning documents. As part of that periodic-review process, the city completed various work tasks and, as relevant here, decided in 2005 to expand its UGB to include 409 gross acres for industrial uses. To support the need for that expansion, the city relied on work performed at its direction by consultant ECONorthwest. That work included an economic-opportunities analysis <em>(EOA) </em>\u2014 see OAR 660-009-0015 (requiring cities with areas within the UGB to perform an economic-opportunities analysis comparing the demand for land for industrial and other employment uses to the existing supply of such land); an economic development <em>strategy </em>\u2014 see OAR 660-009-0020 (requiring cities with areas within the UGB to adopt policy stating the economic-development objectives for the planning area, based on the economic-opportunities analysis required by OAR 660-009-0015); and a site-requirements analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The city justified the number of acres of industrial land that it added to its UGB using a \u201ctarget-industries\u201d approach developed through the work of ECONorthwest. Put simply, the target-industries approach considers a local government\u2019s employment-growth projections and goals for employment, and establishes a framework for attracting the kind of employers that could reasonably be expected to support the kind and amount of employment growth to which the local government aspires. Given the site needs of those particular employers, the local government identifies potentially available land both within and outside its UGB and selects a group of sites and an amount of land that it believes will accommodate the employers that it seeks to attract. The target-industries approach differs from an \u201cemployees-per-acre\u201d approach, under which a local government simply projects employment growth and divides that growth by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>statistically accepted number of employees per acre of land in order to arrive at the number of acres needed to support employment growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In the target-industries approach developed here, the city aimed to promote economic growth by pursuing development that would create higher-paying jobs to attract new residents who would both live and work in Woodburn. To facilitate that goal, the city identified high-wage target industries that it believed might locate in Woodburn because of its location on 1-5 between Portland and Salem. The city then identified the site and building requirements and preferences of the targeted industries. The city also adopted an employment-growth forecast. In light of academic and federal population estimates and forecasts, the city predicted a 20-year employment-growth rate of 3 percent, leading to a projected increase of 8,374 jobs. Ultimately, the city determined that, to further its economic-development strategy and accommodate the volume of job growth that it projected, it needed 42 total industrial sites, 23 of which were available on land within the existing UGB and 19 of which it decided to provide by expanding its UGB into its Southwest Industrial Reserve (SWIR).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In the Woodburn UGB Justification Report, to which LCDC referred in its original order and its order on remand, the city explained the reasons that it needed the additional sites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cGoal 14, Land Need factor (2), recognizes that changes to a UGB may be based on demonstrated need for employment opportunities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cThe employment land needs analysis in ECONorthwest\u2019s \u2018Site Requirements for Woodburn Target Industries\u2019 (October 2003) concluded that about 370 acres would need to be developed for basic employment uses to accommodate a mid-range need of 7,140 new employees between 2000 and 2020, based on emplovee-per-acre ratios. However, <em>to attract targeted industries[,] Woodburn must provide choice among and an adequate inventory of suitable sites. Under the site suitability method, it is possible that some sites may not fully develop during the planning period, either because a portion of the site will be held for future development or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>because a reserved site will not be selected by a targeted industry. </em>*** [T]he proposed Plan includes measures to ensure that * * * such parcels cannot be re-designated for commercial use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cWoodburn\u2019s employment land needs are designed to meet ORS 197.712 and the Goal 9 Rule (OAR Chapter 660, Division 009) requirements that cities \u2018identify the types of sites that are likely to be needed by industrial and commercial uses which might expand or locate in the planning area.\u2019 To be clear, industrial site needs are not based on floor-area ratios or employee per acre ratios.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">(First and third emphasis in original; second emphasis added; footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Petitioners objected to the UGB amendment, and LCDC considered those objections. Petitioners contended, among other things, that the city had included more industrial land within its amended boundary than was needed to accommodate projected industrial job growth or the needs of its target industries and, accordingly, more industrial land than the city expected to develop over the 20-year planning period, in violation of Goal 9, the land use planning goal that addresses economic development. <em>Woodburn I, </em>237 Or App at 222. Petitioners further argued that the city\u2019s target-industries approach \u201cinflate [d]\u201d the number of acres that needed to be included within the UGB to accommodate industrial job growth and did not address the demonstrated need for any additional industrial land to be included in the proposed UGB expansion as required by Goal 14, the land use planning goal that addresses urbanization. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">LCDC approved the city\u2019s expansion of its UGB. LCDC reasoned as follows in rejecting petitioners\u2019 objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201c[The city\u2019s UGB Justification Report] identified] the total number of sites required for all the site size needs, and [found] 42 total sites needed for all targeted industries. According to 1000 Friends, this is an oversupply of sites that leads to more land than is justified. <em>However, the city has designated these sites </em>to provide for the required short-term supply as well as <em>to provide market choice among sites. The Commission finds that this is a key component of a successful industrial development strategy, and is required by OAR 660-009-0025. </em>In addition, the objection states that the city acknowledges that \u2018not all of the industrial land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>proposed for inclusion is expected to develop by 2020.\u2019 This is due to the fact that industrial users often choose to purchase a site larger than their immediate need in order to ensure that they have adequate land for future expansion, and the statement referred to by the objector is recognition of that fact. Additionally, OAR 660-009-[0]025(2) specifies that plans must designate serviceable land suitable to meet the site needs identified in Section (1) of this rule. Except as provided for in Section (5) of this rule, the total acreage of land designated must at least equal the total projected land needs for each industrial or other employment use category identified in the plan during the 20-year planning period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cIn conclusion, the Commission finds that Woodburn\u2019s plans for economic development comply with the Goal 9 and Goal 14 rules. The city\u2019s employment projection and land needs assessment are reasonable, for the reasons explained in these findings and more particularly described in the Woodburn UGB Justification Report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>Woodburn I, </em>237 Or App at 222-23 (internal quotation marks omitted; some bracketed material added; emphasis in <em>Woodburn I). </em>Petitioners sought judicial review of LCDC\u2019s approval of the city\u2019s UGB amendments. As we characterized petitioners\u2019 arguments in our original opinion, they contended that the city had included more land in the UGB than it would need during the 20-year planning period in violation of Goals 9 and 14, and that LCDC\u2019s justification for affirming that <em>inclusion </em>\u2014 i.e., that the inclusion is required by OAR 660-009-0025 to provide market choice among sites \u2014 is not allowed under Goals 9 or 14. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We concluded that LCDC\u2019s order did not provide an adequate basis for us to review petitioners\u2019 contentions. We noted that, \u201calthough LCDC discusse[d] Goal 9 and its implementing rules and conclude [d] that the UGB amendment complies with both Goals 9 and 14, LCDC provided essentially no reasoning as to that conclusion with respect to Goal 14. In particular, LCDC offered no explanation concerning the reasons that the need factors of Goal 14 are satisfied under the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">With respect to Goal 9, we stated that LCDC\u2019s \u201cmere reference to \u2018market choice\u2019 [was] insufficient to explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>reason that the city\u2019s UGB expansion is consistent with that goal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225. We acknowledged that LCDC might have been correct that some forms of \u201cmarket choice\u201d would be consistent with Goal 9, but rejected the proposition that <em>all </em>\u201cforms and degrees\u201d of market choice would be. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that, \u201cgiven the variety of the industries that the city targeted and the diversity and multiplicity of the sites that the city designated, it [was] incumbent on LCDC to cogently explain the reasons that the degree of market choice employed by the city *** is consistent with the requirements of Goal 9 and OAR 660-009-0025.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">With respect to Goal 14, we observed that \u201ca local government is not permitted to establish [a UGB] containing more land than the locality needs for future growth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We noted that LCDC had provided only a summary conclusion that the city\u2019s UGB amendment was consistent with Goal 14; LCDC had not referred to or explained how the city had satisfied the Goal 14 need factors. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that LCDC\u2019s treatment was insufficient to explain why including more land than was expected to be developed during the planning period was consistent with Goal 14. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In addition, we noted that compliance with Goal 9 does not necessarily establish compliance with Goal 14. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, and because petitioners had asserted that the UGB amendment violated both goals, LCDC had to explain why the amendment was consistent with both the economic development principles of Goal 9 and the urbanization requirements of Goal 14. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201c[B]ecause LCDC did not adequately explain the reasons that the UGB amendment \u2014 which included more industrial land than will be developed during the planning period so that the city could provide for market choice among sites\u2014 was consistent with Goals 9 and 14, its order failed to respond to petitioners\u2019 objections and [was] inadequate for judicial review *** concerning the propriety of the UGB amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>On remand, LCDC circulated a draft revised order to the parties and considered written and oral arguments. On March 16, 2011, LCDC issued a revised order again approving the city\u2019s amendment of its UGB. LCDC\u2019s analysis rests on two foundations: first, what it characterized as a \u201cclose correlation\u201d between the need for industrial land calculated using the employees-per-acre approach and the need for industrial land determined using the target-industries approach, and second, the city\u2019s analysis of population, employment, target industries, and site requirements, which LCDC concluded provided a factual and analytical base to establish that the city\u2019s decision was consistent with Goal 14, Goal 9, and <em>ORS </em>197.712 (setting out comprehensive plan requirements). For the reasons explained below, we conclude that LCDC\u2019s analysis is not supported by substantial reason.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>LCDC began its analysis by comparing the projected land need (in buildable acres) based on employment projections and an employee-per-acre <em>calculation </em>\u2014 viz., 311 acres \u2014 with the projected land need based on the target-industries approach used by the <em>city </em>\u2014 viz., 362 acres. LCDC stated that \u201cthe relatively close correlation\u201d between those two numbers \u201cprovide [d] important corroboration for the city\u2019s ultimate decision concerning the amount of land needed for industrial and office uses.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Generally, LCDC wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cThe more a city\u2019s land need for employment based on its analysis of economic opportunities and sites diverges from what would be predicted based solely on forecasted population and employment growth and employee-per-acre ratios, the more thoroughly the city will need to substantiate its economic opportunities analysis and resulting site needs. In effect, the population and employment projections (Goal 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>factor 1), serve as an elastic constraint on a community\u2019s projected land needs based on the aspirations and opportunities (Goal 14, factor 2 and Goal 9), as documented through an EOA and through site requirements. The further the two diverge, the stronger the substantiation required that future opportunities are real (in the sense of land need under Goal 14, factor 1) and not speculative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Here, according to LCDC, the two numbers (311 and 362) are \u201crelatively close,\u201d and so LCDC determined that the population and employment projections \u201csupport a conclusion that the city\u2019s UGB expansion for industrial and office uses contains an amount of land that is reasonably related to both its forecasted growth (Goal 14, factor 1) and its employment opportunities (Goal 14, factor 2, and Goal 9).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">LCDC did not explain why a close correlation between projected land need based on an employee-per-acre ratio and projected land need based on a target-industries analysis \u201ccorroborates\u201d the number projected by the target-industries analysis. Moreover, although LCDC indicated that a local government with a target-industries-based number that is \u201cmore\u201d divergent from the employee-per-acre-based number will need to provide \u201cmore\u201d thorough substantiation of its EOA and site needs, it gave no content to that analysis: how much more \u201cdivergence\u201d requires how much more substantiation? Here, the numbers diverge by more than 16 percent. Would 20 percent no longer be considered \u201cclose\u201d? Most importantly, LCDC did not explain why the relationship between the two numbers, in any case, should relieve it from reviewing \u2014 or local governments from explaining \u2014 why the amount of land proposed to be added to the UGB is consistent with the goals and other law just as carefully as it would if the correlation were not \u201cclose.\u201d We are not persuaded that the purportedly \u201cclose correlation\u201d in this case provides analytical support for LCDC\u2019s conclusion that the city added a legally permissible amount of industrial land to its UGB. Accordingly, we turn to the other justifications for approval of the UGB expansion in LCDC\u2019s order on remand to determine whether they support the conclusion that LCDC reached.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Inits order onremand, LCDC concluded that the city\u2019s analysis of population, employment, target industries, and site requirements provided a factual and analytical base to establish that the city\u2019s decision was consistent with Goal 14, Goal 9, and ORS 197.712. LCDC thoroughly reiterated the steps undertaken by the city and its consultant in order to arrive at the conclusion that, under a target-industries analysis and to support the economic opportunities that the city wished to offer, the city needed to add 409 gross acres of land for industrial use. The city indeed engaged in a lengthy process, resulting in a voluminous record, in this periodic-review process. Similarly, LCDC, in its order on remand, recounted in detail the steps that the city took in engaging in and documenting its process. LCDC also walked through applicable goals and other legal provisions, and concluded that the city\u2019s expansion of its UGB was consistent with each. What is lacking, however, is a meaningful explanation of <em>why </em>the steps taken by the city satisfy those legal standards. Instead, LCDC recounted all the steps that the city took and then concluded \u2014 without analysis \u2014 that those steps are factually and analytically supported, and are consistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">LCDC\u2019s discussion of Goal 14, factor 2, is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cThe city\u2019s population and employment forecasts provide context for the city\u2019s determination of its need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>employment opportunities under Goal 14, factor <em>2***. </em>The commission finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the city\u2019s estimate of 8,374 new jobs during the 2000-2020 planning period and the amount of land it has determined is needed for employment opportunities based on its analysis of economic opportunities, target industries and suitable sites. The commission concludes that for these reasons, and the reasons set forth in the department\u2019s response to the written argument of the parties (dated January 7, 2011 and expressly incorporated by this reference) that the amount of land the city has added to its UGB is consistent with both Goal 9 and Goal 14. The city has not added more land than needed during the 20-year planning period. Nor, despite some contradictory statements in the city\u2019s planning documents, has it added land in order to provide for \u2018market choice\u2019 (as explained in more detail below). Instead, the amount of land included in the UGB expansion is based on a reasonable projection of what target industries the city is most likely to succeed in attracting or having expand during the planning period, and the site requirements of those industries (the types of sites companies in those industries typically require in order to locate in a community). Finally, *** the commission also finds that the city\u2019s estimate of land need is reasonably related to its projections of population and employment growth during the planning period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cThe commission further finds that the city has demonstrated compliance with Goal 14, factor 2 *** through its analysis of target industries and suitable sites needed to provide employment opportunities that are reasonably likely to generate the employment needed for the city\u2019s current and projected future population. In this instance, the target industries methodology the city used is appropriate and complies with *** Goal 14, factor 2. Using an employees-per-acre methodology is not required to demonstrate compliance with *** Goal 14, factor 2, and the city did not use it to demonstrate total land need. The city\u2019s decision to use a targeted industries methodology instead of an employees-per-acre [methodology] is permissible under Goal[] *** 14. As explained above, the city\u2019s decision to plan for employment opportunities rather than projected employment based on population growth does not mean that the city added more land than it needs for employment during 2000-2020.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cGoal 9 and Goal 14, factor 2, and the commission\u2019s Goal 9 rule (OAR 660-009-0025(2)(2005)) require the city to plan for an amount of land in each site category that at least equals the projected land needs for each category during the 20-year planning period. The city projected land needs by size class \u2014 tied to the particular requirements of its target industries, and demonstrated a need for approximately 409 gross acres of land after accounting for sites within the prior UGB. The commission finds that the city\u2019s analysis complies with Goals 9 and 14, as well as OAR 660-009 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cThe city\u2019s decision *** complies with Goal 14, factor[] 2 ***.

If it were sufficient, local governments could establish compliance with Goal 14, factor 2, simply by verifying that they had engaged in the correct process, regardless of their conclusions. Substantial reason requires, at the least, an explanation of why the process in which a local government engaged <em>and </em>the results that it reached are consistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In addition, LCDC incorporated into its discussion of Goal 14, factor 2, \u201cthe reasons set forth in the department\u2019s response to the written argument of the parties.\u201d We have examined that response and conclude that it fails to supply LCDC\u2019s order with substantial reason. The response relies on the same two foundations described above: (1) the \u201cclose correlation\u201d between the amount of land actually added to the UGB and the amount that would have been added using an employees-per-acre approach (\u201c[E]ven under the employee per acre method of estimating future land need, the approximately 360 net acres of land that the city has added to its UGB for industrial and office uses *** is reasonably related to the amount of land shown to be needed under a traditional employee per acre methodology.\u201d) and (2) the city engaged in \u201csteps [that] are a permissible means of complying with Goals 9 and 14[.]\u201d As we have explained, those foundations do not provide substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We have carefully reviewed LCDC\u2019s entire order on remand, and we conclude that LCDC did not adequately explain the reasons that led it to conclude the city\u2019s UGB amendment complied with applicable law. As noted, in light of that disposition, we do not address petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the inclusion of certain high-value farmland within the UGB as industrial land.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> In the initial judicial review proceeding in this court, the petitioners were 1000 Friends of Oregon, Friends of Marion County, Lolita Carl, Kathleen Carl, Diane Mikkelson, Carla Mikkelson, and Marion County Farm Bureau. In this judicial review proceeding, the petitioners are the same except that Carla Mikkelson does not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> The pertinent Oregon Administrative Rules in this case are those that were in effect when the city amended its UGB on November 2, 2005. Accordingly, all references to the OARs in this opinion are to the rules in effect on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-4\"> We note that our standard of review of LCDC orders like the one in this case has changed since we decided <em>Woodburn I. </em>In 2011, after LCDC issued its revised order in this case and after petitioners had sought judicial review of that order, the legislature amended ORS 197.650 (and other statutes, including ORS 197.633, which includes the standard of review LCDC is to apply to local government actions) at the request of Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) to alter the standards of review that both LCDC and this court will apply in, among other things, periodic-review proceedings. Or Laws 2011, ch 469; <em>see also </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 469, \u00a7 9 (making amendment effective on passage, June 23, 2011). In so doing, the legislature intended to streamline, in a coordinated way, the process of review \u2014 before both LCDC and this court \u2014 of local government decisions on UGB amendments. <em>See </em>Audio Recording, Senate Committee on Environment &amp; Natural Resources, HB 2031, May 24,2011, at 52:14 (statement of Bob Rindy, Policy Analyst and Legislative Coordinator, DLCD), https://olis.Ieg.state.or.us (accessed Dec 19, 2013); Audio Recording, Senate Floor Debate, HB 2031, June 8, 2011, at 56:10 (statement of Senator Dingfelder, carrier of the bill), http://olis.leg.state.or.us (accessed Dec 19, 2013); Staff Measure Summary, Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, HB 2031, June 7, 2011. As pertinent here, under the 2011 amendments, the standard of review described in ORS 197.651(10) \u2014 which is substantively akin to our standard of review of Land Use Board of Appeals orders \u2014 replaced the standard derived from the Administrative Procedures Act, which we had generally applied when reviewing an LCDC order such as the one in this case. <em>See </em>ORS 197.650(1) (2009) (providing, in part, that LCDC orders \u201cmay be appealed to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in ORS 183.482\u201d); <em>see also Woodburn I, </em>237 Or App at 223-27 (applying that standard; reasoning that, to be adequate for judicial review, LCDC\u2019s order had to demonstrate substantial reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Here, as noted above, before the 2011 amendments became effective, LCDC conducted its post-remand review of the city\u2019s actions and issued its revised order \u2014 which noted that \u201cjudicial review is pursuant to the provision[s] of ORS 183.482 and 197.650\u201d \u2014 and petitioners sought judicial review of that order. In light of that unique posture, we conclude that the former standard of review in ORS 197.650(1) (2009) applies. That understanding is consistent with what we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>understand to be the legislature\u2019s intent in adopting Oregon Laws 2011, chapter 469, as a coordinated package of legislation that would streamline review of local government decisions regarding their UGBs. <em>See also 1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC, </em>244 Or App 267-68, 259 P3d 1021 (2011) (applying pre-2011 standard of judicial review where the case was pending before the effective date of the 2011 amendments and our decision issued thereafter).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Petitioners contend that, on remand, LCDC impermissibly added the projected land need for \u201coffice\u201d employment to the projected land need for \u201cindustrial\u201d employment to support its conclusion that the city added a permissible amount of industrial land to its UGB. As we explain below, we conclude that the prong of LCDC\u2019s analysis that relies upon that calculation does not meaningfully support its conclusion. Accordingly, we need not address petitioners\u2019 argument that LCDC impermissibly added \u201coffice\u201d and \u201cindustrial\u201d land needs together. We note, however, that LCDC argues on judicial review that the city\u2019s \u201ctarget industries\u201d included both \u201cindustrial industries\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>printing and publishing, electronics fabrication) and \u201cnon-industrial industries\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>nondepository credit institutions, health services). And the city relied on the projected employment and site needs of all the targeted industries \u2014 both \u201cindustrial\u201d and \u201cnon-industrial\u201d \u2014 to justify the expansion of its UGB to include more land for industrial use. It is not readily apparent to us why the targeting of <em>nonindustrial </em>employers justifies inclusion within the UGB of any land for <em>industrial </em>use. Moreover, the site requirements analysis provided by ECONorthwest provides limited support for the conclusion that the targeted employers require industrial-zoned land. In the site-requirements analysis, ECONorthwest specifically described the site needs for most of the target industries (there is no specific description of the site needs of the industry identified as Industry #36 \u201cElectronics - Fab Plants\u201d \u2014 the industry that purportedly needs lot sizes of 100 to 300 acres). As to the four \u201cnon-industrial industries,\u201d the site requirements analysis indicated that those employers could locate on commercially zoned land. And, even the description of the needs of some of the \u201cindustrial industries\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>printing and publishing, wholesale trade) mentions no particular zoning need for the pertinent employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> In its brief in this judicial review proceeding, LCDC identifies the \u201cclose correlation\u201d approach as LCDC\u2019s \u201canalytic framework\u201d for evaluating this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>LCDC noted that DLCD Director Richard Whitman acknowledged that there was a \u201ccertain element of professional judgment by the experts advising the city as to whether [these] sites are necessary to achieve these employment opportunities\u201d and that such an approach \u201cappear[ed] to give to a consultant\u201d a \u201cdegree of discretion\u201d that might lead to \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d Accordingly, Whitman explained, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s why we looked at the employee-per-acre approach as a check on that to see if the numbers were in fairly close alignment ***.\u201d In its brief, LCDC conceded that, given the \u201cclose correlation\u201d between the employee-per-acre number and the target-industries number, \u201cLCDC did not closely scrutinize the substantiation behind the city\u2019s stated needs. Instead, it accorded the city a fair amount of deference.\u201d Aside from the \u201cclose-correlation\u201d comparison, however, LCDC\u2019s brief does not identify how it reasoned that the city\u2019s land need complied with the law. LCDC\u2019s brief does point to LCDC\u2019s reliance on the city\u2019s \u201cexhaustive and comprehensive assessment of the site needs of its target industries,\u201d but we do not understand LCDC to argue that that reliance provides independent reasoning. Although LCDC appears to argue that the only analytical underpinning for the order on remand was the \u201cclose correlation\u201d calculation, we nonetheless have reviewed the other justifications in LCDC\u2019s order to determine whether they provide substantial reason for its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
