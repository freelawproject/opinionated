On review, SAIF initially argues that, because the disc herniation preceded the foot injury by at least two years, it is not \u201clegally or logically possible\u201d that the disc herniation was a consequence of the foot injury that followed it. SAIF further contends, alternatively, that there is not substantial medical evidence to support a finding of an actual <em>worsening </em>of claimant\u2019s L4-5 herniation as a consequence of the foot injury, but only evidence of a \u201csymptomatic aggravation\u201d of that condition. We review the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(8), and for the reasons below, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s determination that the worsening of claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation was a consequential condition of the 2008 foot injury. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In 2004, before beginning work with Quantum, claimant fell out of a truck and struck his lower back while working in Arizona. He reported lower back pain and occasional tingling in his right thigh. In May 2006, claimant underwent an MRI scan of the lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a 4-to-5-mm L4-5 disc protrusion, which had a slight mass effect on the right L5 nerve root.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In October 2006, while working for Quantum, claimant heard a \u201cpop\u201d and experienced lower back pain as he was pushing heavy barrels. Thereafter, claimant had pain and tenderness in his right lower back and some numbness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and tingling down his left leg, and he underwent a second lumbar MRI scan in November 2006. That scan showed that the L4-5 disc protrusion had \u201cincreased noticeably because of extruded disc material,\u201d as compared to the earlier MRI, and that there was mass effect on both the L5 and the SI nerve root sleeves.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">SAIF accepted the October 2006 injury as a lumbar strain. Claimant received treatment for that injury over the next year and by October 2007 was determined to be medically stationary. In November 2007, the claim for lumbar strain was closed with no award of permanent impairment. In February 2008, claimant wrote to SAIF, asking it to add a \u201cworsening * * * of L4 and L5 disc protrusion\u201d to his claim. SAIF denied that request, relying on an April 2008 opinion from Dr. Bergquist that the October 2006 injury was not a material cause of the disability or need for treatment of claimant\u2019s disc herniation. Claimant did not pursue review of that denial, and it became final by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In August 2008, while working at Quantum, a pallet jack fell onto claimant\u2019s left foot. SAIF accepted a left foot crush injury. A few months later, during treatment with Dr. Thomas, claimant reported severe back pain, a limited range of motion in his lower back, and right leg pain with radiculopathy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In early November 2008, claimant underwent a third MRI. The reviewing radiologist reported that the disc material at the L4-5 level was still protruding into the spinal canal, but there was no \u201csignificant interval change in its size or contours\u201d as compared to the second 2006 MRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Dr. Wayson saw claimant in December 2008. Wayson noted that claimant had an injury in October 2006 with back pain and right leg pain. Wayson further noted that, following claimant\u2019s August 2008 left foot injury, he was compensating for his left foot, which \u201cled to an aggravation of his right leg symptoms and he has become progressively uncomfortable.\u201d Wayson\u2019s assessment was of \u201clumbar radiculopathy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>secondary to a disc herniation.\u201d After seeing Wayson, claimant sent a letter to SAIF requesting acceptance of \u201c[ljumbar disc herniation, L4-5\u201d and \u201c [l]umbar radiculitis secondary to #1\u201d as new or omitted medical conditions. The letter further stated that claimant\u2019s \u201cfile indicates that according to some of the medical evidence [he] may have a preexisting condition in his lower back. If appropriate please process this request as a worsening of the above referenced conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In January 2009, Dr. Carr performed an independent medical evaluation. Carr noted that, before claimant\u2019s October 2006 back injury, he had degenerative disc disease at L4-5. In Carr\u2019s view, following the October 2006 back injury, claimant suffered a \u201cdefinite pathological worsening of the disc protrusion\u201d and \u201cradicular symptoms which would be called radiculitis which in [his] opinion were secondary to the worsening of the disc herniation at L4-5.\u201d Carr believed that the 2006 injury \u201cwas the major contributing cause of the disability and need for treatment following the combined condition\u201d but the October 2006 back injury \u201cceased to be the major contributing cause of disability and need for treatment at the time [claimant] was declared medically stationary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">As to the 2008 foot injury, Carr believed that it combined with the preexisting disc condition to cause the resulting need for treatment of the lower back. In Carr\u2019s view, the altered gait due to the foot injury \u201calter [ed] the stresses on the back\u201d and \u201cproduce [d] symptomatic aggravation of the degenerative disc disease.\u201d Carr believed that the 2008 foot injury \u201cand its sequela was a <em>material </em>contributing cause of [claimant\u2019s] disability and need for treatment for his low back following the work incident!,]\u201d but he did not believe that the foot injury was the <em>major </em>contributing cause of the disability and need for treatment resulting from the combined condition. (Emphasis added.) Rather, Carr believed that the preexisting disc condition \u2014 not the 2008 foot injury \u2014 was the major contributing cause of the disability and the need for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In February 2009, Wayson wrote to claimant\u2019s counsel that, \u201c[f]or the most part [he] agree [d] with Dr. Carr\u2019s assessment * * * \u201d Specifically, Wayson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cbelieve [d] that [claimant\u2019s] primary injury is the work injury of October of 2006 in which he suffered a progression of his disc herniation at L4-5.1 think that that is the underlying and the primary cause for his need for treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cHe has remained symptomatic since that [time] and the foot injury [of] 2008 has led to an exacerbation, but the primary underlying cause is the disc herniation of 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cTherefore, I disagree with Dr. Carr\u2019s conclusion on page 16 that \u2018it is not the continuing and major contributing cause to his current disability.\u2019 I do believe that the underlying disc herniation is and continues to be symptomatic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Later in February 2009, SAIF denied the conditions for \u201cL4-5 disc herniation\u201d and \u201cL4-5 radiculitis.\u201d SAIF amended that denial in June 2009, stating that, with respect to the October 2006 injury, the April 2008 denial of the disc herniation was final and claimant\u2019s L4-5 radiculitis was \u201ca product of the previously denied L4-5 disc herniation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In August 2009, Wayson signed a concurrence letter prepared by claimant\u2019s counsel after a conference between them. That letter explained that Wayson had the opportunity to review a \u201cformal exhibit pack,\u201d including the MRIs from 2006, and that he agreed that \u201cthe major contributing cause, more than 50.1%, of [claimant\u2019s] current low back condition, diagnosed as an L4-5 disc herniation with radiculopathy/radiculitis, is his August 21, 2008 injury where he sustained a crush injury to his left foot.\u201d Wayson further agreed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201cas a result of the crush injury to his left foot [claimant] altered his gait by increasing use and weight bearing on his right leg. As a result of his altered gait due to the crush injury to his left foot <em>his low back condition has been worsened </em>irritating the nerves in his low back causing inflammation and increased symptoms. Your opinion is based on the history provided to you by [claimant] of increased pain after this injury, as well as your examination, including his decreased sensation in an L5-S1 distribution on the right side, giveaway weakness in his right lower extremity, and positive straight leg raise testing. In your opinion these are all verifiable and reproducible *** findings <em>of an actual worsening of [claimant\u2019s] L4-5 disc herniation. </em>It is your opinion that the major contributing cause, more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>50.1% of <em>this worsening </em>is [claimant\u2019s] altered gait due to the crush injury to his left foot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">(Emphases added.) Carr responded to Wayson\u2019s opinion during a deposition in October 2009. He testified that he did not agree with Wayson that there was a pathological worsening. Carr noted that the decreased sensation and positive straight leg raising were both observed prior to the 2008 injury and that the 2008 MRI showed that the disc fragment was no larger than it was when the MRI was taken after the 2006 injury. Thomas, who had treated claimant just after his injury, signed a concurrence letter prepared by SAIF\u2019s counsel in which he agreed with Carr\u2019s conclusions regarding claimant\u2019s disc herniation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">At a hearing held in November 2010, an administrative law judge (ALJ) considered claimant\u2019s \u201cL4-5 disc protrusion and radiculitis claims\u201d and reasoned that, \u201c [\u00b6] or these conditions to be compensable as consequences of [the 2008 injury,] *** the injury [must] be the major contributing cause of these conditions.\u201d Noting that Carr \u201cdid not believe that the 2008 injury and sequela caused the disc herniation, or did anything more than cause a symptomatic aggravation of the L4-5 condition and radiculitis,\u201d the ALJ reasoned that whether \u201cthe L4-5 disc protrusion and radiculitis is compensably related to the work injury depends on the persuasiveness of Dr. Wayson\u2019s opinion\u201d that claimant\u2019s foot injury \u201cwas the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s current low back condition * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The ALJ noted that Wayson\u2019s opinion \u201cwas based on claimant\u2019s history, as well as on findings of decreased sensation, give [a] way weakness in the right lower extremity and positive straight leg raise testing.\u201d But the ALJ credited Carr\u2019s response that \u201cgive [a]way weakness is not an objective finding and not true weakness\u201d and further noted that another doctor \u201chad documented positive straight leg raising and decreased sensation in his pre-August 2008 * * * examinations, so these findings were not new.\u201d Further, the ALJ reasoned that \u201cWayson\u2019s August 7, 2009 concurrence letter reflects a change in his opinion, compared to his February 11, 2009 opinion],]\u201d but \u201cWayson did not explain in his August 7, 2009 concurrence letter why he changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>his opinion ***.\u201d For those reasons, the ALJ \u201c[did] not find Dr. Wayson\u2019s August 7, 2009 opinion to be persuasive\u201d and affirmed SAIF\u2019s \u201cdenial issued in the 2008 claim * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Claimant appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the board. Addressing the 2008 foot crush injury, the board reasoned that \u201c[t]he parties do not dispute that the claimed L4-5 disc herniation should be analyzed [as] a \u2018consequential condition.\u2019 Therefore, claimant must prove that the accepted crush injury to the left foot was the major contributing cause of his L4-5 disc herniation with radiculitis.\u201d According to the board, Wayson\u2019s opinion that the altered gait \u201cresulted in a worsened L4-5 herniated disc with radiculitis\u201d established a compensable consequential condition. Although the board noted that, in August 2009, Wayson had partially agreed with Carr\u2019s opinion that the foot injury was not the major contributing cause of the worsened disc herniation, the board explained that Wayson\u2019s February 2009 opinion was consistent with his August 2009 opinion that the foot injury \u201cexacerbatfed] or worsened] claimant\u2019s underlying L4-5 disc herniation.\u201d Further, the board noted that, before giving the later opinion, Wayson had the opportunity to review all of the then-available medical records, and his review of those additional materials was sufficient to explain his change in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As to Wayson\u2019s August 2009 opinion, the board determined that Wayson\u2019s conclusion of a \u201c\u2018worsened\u2019 L4-5 disc herniation\u201d were supported by \u201c\u2018verifiable and reproducible\u2019\u201d findings that were not present before the 2008 foot injury, such as \u201c\u2018giveaway weakness in [the] right lower extremity\u2019 and \u2018increased pain\u2019 and inflammation.\u201d Finally, the board noted that Carr\u2019s opinion was \u201cconsistent\u201d with a consequential condition in that he \u201cagreed that the injury materially contributed to a \u2018symptomatic aggravation\u2019 * * * \u201d In the board\u2019s view, however, \u201cWayson\u2019s opinion [was] better explained and more consistent with claimant\u2019s symptoms and the overall record [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Ultimately, the board reversed \u201c[t]hat portion of the ALJ\u2019s order that upheld SAIF\u2019s denial of the L4-5 disc herniation with radiculitis as a consequence of the August 2008 work injury * * * \u201d One member of the board dissented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>from that reversal. The dissenting board member, crediting Carr\u2019s opinion, disagreed that the medical evidence was sufficient to establish that the 2008 foot injury was the major contributing cause of a pathological worsening of the L4-5 disc herniation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">On judicial review, SAIF first raises a threshold issue as to what the board decided in its order. SAIF argues that the board\u2019s order requires SAIF to accept the \u201cdisc herniation in toto\u201d \u2014 not the worsening of the disc herniation caused by the foot injury. With that view of the order, SAIF makes the straightforward argument that \u201ca \u2018consequential condition\u2019 must follow the \u2018compensable injury\u2019 that allegedly causes it\u201d; there is no dispute that \u201cthe L4-5 disc herniation occurred two years <em>before </em>the compensable left foot injury\u201d; and therefore it is not \u201clegally or logically possible\u201d that the disc herniation was a consequence of the foot injury that followed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">With regard to the worsening of claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation, SAIF argues that \u201cthe record in this case, including Dr. Wayson\u2019s opinion, does not logically allow a lay fact-finder such as the board to find a worsening of anything other than symptoms.\u201d Relying on Carr\u2019s opinion that there was not a pathological change in the disc herniation, SAIF argues that \u201c[t]here [was] no evidence that the disc herniation itself was made larger or otherwise worse by the 2008 left foot injury.\u201d In SAIF\u2019s view, then, the board improperly determined that the disc herniation was compensable merely because the altered gait due to the foot injury caused an increase in radiculitis and other symptoms of claimant\u2019s preexisting disc herniation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In response, claimant acknowledges that the L4-5 disc herniation was diagnosed years before the foot injury, but he argues that his claim related to the foot injury \u201cis based on a <em>worsening </em>of [that] prior L4-5 disc condition * * (Emphasis added.) According to claimant, \u201cthe board specifically addressed the major contributing cause of [his] L4-5 disc herniation condition, including a finding that it was worsened by his August 2008 left foot crush injury].]\u201d Claimant contends that substantial medical evidence supported that finding; the board relied on Wayson\u2019s opinion that the foot injury caused an altered gait that was the major contributing cause of an \u201cactual worsening\u201d of the L4-5 disc herniation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">As to the threshold issue of the scope of the board\u2019s order, we agree with claimant that the board, relying on Wayson\u2019s opinion, found that the <em>worsening </em>of claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation was a consequential condition of the 2008 foot injury. Although the board at times referenced claimant\u2019s \u201cL4-5 disc herniation\u201d or \u201cdisc herniation with radiculitis\u201d without using the term \u201cworsening,\u201d those references must be understood in the context of the board\u2019s entire order, the parties\u2019 arguments to the board and the ALJ, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the medical evidence that the board reviewed. There is no question that claimant\u2019s disc herniation at L4-5 preexisted the 2008 injury, and so with respect to the relationship between the 2008 injury and the L4-5 disc herniation, the parties\u2019 oral arguments to the ALJ and their written submissions to the board focused on a worsening of the L4-5 disc herniation. Those arguments were based on the medical evidence: both Carr and Wayson believed that the 2008 injury caused a worsening of some sort. As the board\u2019s review of the evidence makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>clear, however, the doctors disagreed as to the nature of that worsening \u2014 that is, whether claimant\u2019s altered gait gave rise to an actual worsening of his underlying L4-5 disc herniation or simply caused a symptomatic worsening with no worsening in the disc herniation itself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The remaining question for our review, then, is whether there is substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s determination that the 2008 foot injury was the major contributing cause of the worsening of claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation. ORS 183.482(8)(c). Specifically, we must determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of expert medical opinions is supported by evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make the findings. <em>Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988); <em>SAIF v. Pepperling, </em>237 Or App 79, 84-85, 238 P3d 1013 (2010) (\u201cIn reviewing the board\u2019s evaluation of [an expert\u2019s] opinion, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was reasonable.\u201d (Citation omitted.)). To determine whether a particular finding is supported by substantial evidence, we \u201cevaluate evidence against the finding as well as evidence supporting it to determine whether substantial evidence exists to support that finding.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Garcia v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>309 Or 292, 295, 787 P2d 884 (1990). In a case involving conflicting medical evidence, \u201cwe will reverse the board \u2018only when the credible evidence apparently weighs overwhelmingly in favor of one finding and the [b] oard finds the other without giving a persuasive explanation.\u2019\u201d <em>SAIF v. Pruitt, </em>198 Or App 253, 258, 108 P3d 586 (2005) (quoting <em>Armstrong, </em>90 Or App at 206). Put more bluntly, \u201cif there are doctors on both sides of a medical issue, whichever way the [b]oard finds the facts will probably have substantial evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>90 Or App at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The evidentiary support for a worsening claim generally comes in two forms: direct proof of a pathological worsening or a medical expert\u2019s opinion that worsened symptoms constitute a worsening of the underlying condition. <em>See SAIF v. Walker, </em>330 Or 102, 118, 996 P2d 979 (2000) (\u201c[BJecause evidence of worsened symptoms is relevant to the question whether the compensable condition actually has worsened, and might in some cases be the best evidence regarding that fact, a physician may rely upon that kind of evidence in determining whether the compensable condition has worsened * * *.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. January, </em>166 Or App 620, 624, 998 P2d 1286 (2000) (if a medical expert\u2019s opinion establishes that the symptomatic worsening represents an actual worsening of the underlying condition, then such evidence may carry the worker\u2019s burden); <em>Johnson v. SAIF, </em>194 Or App 689, 694, 96 P3d 830 (2004) (describing MRI results as evidence of a pathological change).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Here, SAIF contends that there was no evidence that the disc herniation was made worse by the left foot injury and that \u201cthe only evidence [was] that there was no such worsening\u201d because, in Carr\u2019s opinion, the disc fragment shown in the 2008 MRI was no larger than in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>2006 MRI. That argument ignores the evidence of an actual worsening that the board relied upon: Wayson concluded that, based on objective findings of giveaway weakness and increased pain and symptoms following the 2008 foot injury, claimant\u2019s underlying disc herniation at L4-5 had actually worsened. Under <em>Walker, </em>that opinion was sufficient to establish an actual worsening, and \u201c[w]hether that opinion was persuasive was for the [b]oard to determine.\u201d <em>January, </em>166 Or App at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">That Carr reached a different conclusion by focusing on the 2008 MRI results does not render Wayson\u2019s opinion without any value, so that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence. As this court has recognized, evidence of an actual worsening may come in the form of evidence of a pathological worsening, such as an MRI, or in the form of expert medical opinion based on symptomatic worsening. <em>See Johnson, </em>194 Or App at 694 (noting that claimant presented evidence of \u201can increase in symptoms, such as her urinary incontinence and difficulty walking\u201d along with evidence of pathological changes such as a \u201cbuild up of scar tissue\u201d shown in an MRI). And SAIF has presented no authority for the principle that, as a matter of law or of medicine, evidence of pathological changes trumps contrary medical <em>evidence </em>\u2014 i.e., an expert medical opinion \u2014 that worsening symptoms constitute a worsening underlying condition. Rather, SAIF presented an opinion from Carr, who viewed the MRI results as the \u201cmost important\u201d evidence that the disc herniation had not worsened. But even as Carr focused on the MRI results to support his opinion, he did not opine that the MRI results were irrefutable and definitive evidence that claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation had not worsened, without regard to contrary evidence of a symptomatic worsening.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Ultimately, the \u201cdivided medical opinion\u201d in this case left the board \u201cin the position of evaluating the evidence.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>172 Or App 484, 489, 19 P3d 951 (2001); <em>Bluemer v. Southland Industries, </em>221 Or App 252, 260, 190 P3d 418 (2008) (rejecting claim \u201cthat the board erred in not giving more weight to the opinion of [one medical expert], who was the treating physician and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>relied on a more complete medical history\u201d because that argument merely suggested that the board erred in weighing the evidence). As the board recognized, Carr\u2019s and Wayson\u2019s disagreement was based on a fine distinction between a worsening of symptoms and a worsening of the underlying condition itself. In resolving those conflicting opinions, one member found Carr\u2019s opinion more persuasive, but a majority of the board found that \u201cWayson\u2019s opinion [was] better explained and more consistent with claimant\u2019s symptoms and the overall record [.]\u201d Our role on judicial review is not to reweigh the evidence or \u201cchoose sides\u201d among the medical experts or the members of the board. <em>Armstrong, </em>90 Or App at 206. Based on our review of the record, the board\u2019s resolution of the conflicting medical evidence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that the 2008 foot injury was the major contributing cause of the worsening of claimant\u2019s L4-5 disc herniation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> For ease of reference, we refer to petitioners collectively as SAIF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> Radiculopathy or radiculitis \u201cis a generalized term that most commonly refers to pain or numbness and can encompass a variety of underlying conditions.\u201d <em>Armenta v. PCC Structural, Inc., </em>253 Or App 682, 692 n 7, 292 P3d 573 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> SAIF does not dispute that the L4-5 disc herniation is a separate condition arising from the 2008 foot injury. <em>See Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Crompton, </em>150 Or App 531, 536, 946 P2d 1171 (1997) (\u201c[A] consequential condition is a separate condition that arises from the compensable injury, for example, when a worker suffers a compensable foot injury that results in an altered gait that, in turn, results in back strain.\u201d). Further, at no point has SAIF argued that the worsening of claimant\u2019s disc herniation must be viewed as a combined condition under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B), rather than a consequential condition, on the theory that the foot injury combined with the preexisting disc herniation to bring about claimant\u2019s disability or need for treatment. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) (\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d); <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Evans, </em>171 Or App 569, 573-74, 15 P3d 1261 (2000) (rejecting employer\u2019s argument that when a compensable injury makes a preexisting condition worse, that condition must be treated as a consequential condition rather than a combined condition and reasoning that claimant\u2019s degenerative disc disease in her neck that preexisted her injury was \u201cnot a separate condition that arose from the compensable injury; it preexisted and combined with it\u201d). We therefore consider the worsening of the disc herniation as a consequential condition under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\"> We also reject SAIF\u2019s argument that the board erred by failing to separately analyze claimant\u2019s request for acceptance of the L4-5 disc herniation and the radiculitis secondary to that herniation. SAIF advances that contention in support of its larger claim that the board found the disc herniation compensable solely because the 2008 injury caused an increase in radiculitis. As the board\u2019s order explains, however, Wayson found an \u201cactual worsening of [claimant\u2019s] disc herniation\u201d based on his examination and findings of a symptomatic worsening following the 2008 injury \u2014 not simply based on the presence of radiculitis following the 2008 injury. To the extent that SAIF separately argues that the board erred in ordering acceptance of the claimed radiculitis because claimant\u2019s radiculitis or radiculopathy was merely a symptom of the L4-5 disc herniation, SAIF did not present that argument to the board. <em>See Armenta v. PCC Structural, Inc., </em>253 Or App 682, 692 n 7, 292 P3d 573 (2012) (noting that \u201cthis court has openly debated [radiculopathy\u2019s] status as a \u2018condition,\u2019 though that is ultimately a question of fact to be decided based on the medical evidence in individual cases\u201d); <em>Young v. Hermiston Good Samaritan, </em>223 Or App 99, 101, 107, 194 P3d 857 (2008) (finding that \u201cradiculopathy,\u201d defined by the medical evidence as \u201cpain that radiates along the course of a nerve root that exits from the spine,\u201d was a \u201csymptom and not a condition\u201d). Moreover, any argument that radiculitis \u2014 which was claimed as \u201csecondary to\u201d the L4-5 disc herniation \u2014 was not properly found to be compensable fails in light of the board\u2019s conclusion that the 2008 foot injury caused an actual worsening of the L4-5 disc herniation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\"> Both parties \u2014 and the medical experts on which they rely \u2014 speak to the worsening of the condition in this case as an \u201cactual worsening,\u201d i.e., the statutory standard for worsening in aggravation cases. ORS 656.273(1) (\u201cA worsened condition resulting from the original injury is established by medical evidence of an actual worsening of the compensable condition supported by objective findings.\u201d). As noted, SAIF has not argued that an actual worsening of a condition cannot be viewed as a consequential condition under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(A); rather, SAIF has argued that the evidence in the record shows nothing more than a symptomatic worsening resulting from the 2008 foot injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
