Defendant, who was incarcerated at all relevant times, contended that the state\u2019s failure to try him within 90 days required the trial court to dismiss the criminal proceeding under ORS 135.760 to 135.765, set out below. The trial court concluded that there was good cause for the failure to try defendant within the statutory period and denied the motion. Defendant was convicted following a bench trial; he appeals the resulting judgment of conviction, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence on two counts of conviction. We write only to address defendant\u2019s speedy trial assignment of error, and, for the following reasons, we reverse and remand for entry of a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The applicable statutes in this case are ORS 135.760, ORS 135.763, and ORS 135.765. ORS 135.760 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201c(1) Any inmate in the custody of the Department of Corrections or of the supervisory authority of a county pursuant to a commitment under ORS 137.124(2) against whom there is pending at the time of commitment or against whom there is filed at any time during imprisonment, in any court of this state, an indictment, information or criminal complaint charging the inmate with the commission of a crime, may give written notice to the district attorney of the county in which the inmate is so charged requesting the district attorney to prosecute and bring the inmate to trial on the charge forthwith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201c(2) The notice provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall be signed by the inmate and set forth the place and term of imprisonment. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the court in which the inmate has been charged by indictment, information or complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">ORS 135.763 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201c(1) The district attorney, after receiving a notice requesting trial under ORS 135.760, shall, within 90 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>of receipt of the notice, bring the inmate to trial upon the pending charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201c(2) The court shall grant any reasonable continuance with the consent of the defendant. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s lack of consent, the court may grant a continuance on motion of the district attorney or on its own motion, for good cause shown. The fact of imprisonment is not good cause for the purposes of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Finally, ORS 135.765 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201c(1) On motion of the defendant or the counsel of the defendant, or on its own motion, the court shall dismiss any criminal proceeding not brought to trial in accordance with ORS 135.763.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201c(2) This section shall not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">\u201c(a) When failure to bring the inmate to trial within 90 days after the district attorney receives notice under ORS 135.760 was the result of motions filed on behalf of the inmate, or of a grant by the court of a continuance on motion of the district attorney or on its own motion, for good cause shown; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">\u201c(b) When the inmate is unavailable for trial, other than by imprisonment, or because of other pending criminal proceedings against the inmate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">\u201cIn cases involving the speedy trial statutes, we review for errors of law a trial court\u2019s determination as to whether \u2018good cause\u2019 existed to continue a case past a statutory deadline.\u201d <em>State v. Tatarinov, </em>211 Or App 280, 285, 155 P3d 67, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 727 (2007). We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is evidence in the record to support those facts, <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993); we recite the following facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">The state indicted defendant on seven felony counts in May 2009, accusing him of assaulting two correctional officers while incarcerated on a prior conviction. On August 14, 2009, the district attorney received a letter from defendant requesting a speedy trial pursuant to ORS 135.760. At defendant\u2019s August 25 arraignment, the court acknowledged that it too had received a copy of the speedy trial request and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>stated that \u201cI want to make sure everyone else is aware of that also.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state requested that a trial date be set within the 90-day period specified by ORS 135.763; that 90-day period expired on November 12. The court scheduled defendant\u2019s trial for November 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">By the time of an October 27 trial readiness hearing, defense counsel had been appointed to represent defendant. Defendant\u2019s appointed counsel was concurrently representing a different defendant, Ceja, in an unrelated case. Ceja\u2019s case was scheduled to go to trial in the same court as defendant on November 3. At the trial readiness hearing, which defendant did not attend, the totality of the discussion on the scheduling of defendant\u2019s case was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: The next in line would be [defendant] in CF090166. If [Ceja] does not go, is the state ready to proceed on [defendant]\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201c[THE STATE]: I believe the state is ready. The state is ready to proceed, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Defense ready * * *?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: On [defendant]\u2019s case, [defendant] is in prison, and the state has made an offer, and I talked to the state about a counter-offer. I would like a little more time to settle this, if we can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: By this Friday? By this Friday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">\u201cWhen I say \u2018this Friday,\u2019 I\u2019m talking about when we have [Ceja]\u2019s hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-11\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">The court scheduled a second hearing in defendant\u2019s case for that Friday, October 30. We recite the contents of that hearing in their entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, that- \u2014 we\u2014is [defendant] in custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-14\">\u201cTHE CLERK: He\u2019s been (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Deputy. We\u2019ll advise the Department of Corrections, or we\u2019d ask you * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>if you would advise the Department of Corrections not to transport [defendant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">\u201c [THE STATE]: I will do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: And we\u2019ll advise the other cases [sic] that they won\u2019t be going, and we\u2019ll see you on Tuesday, [defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We\u2019ll be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201c [THE STATE]: Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Defendant was not at that second hearing. A notation in the Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN) register in defendant\u2019s case states: \u201cNot primary case for Tuesday; court will notify parties of new dates; [trial] off docket[.]\u201d The OJIN register also indicates that on October 30 defendant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for January 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">On November 10, defendant filed a letter with the court seeking dismissal of the charges against him because of the state\u2019s failure to bring him to trial within 90 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 19, the trial court convened a hearing, which it opened by stating: \u201cNow, counsel, State v. [defendant]. I asked counsel to be present because it appears that the court has messed up, and [defendant]\u2019s 90 days have passed, and I don\u2019t know of any way out of dismissing these charges against [defendant] * * * \u201d The court also recounted its recollection of the trial readiness hearing: \u201cthere was no mention made about the 90 days, and, of course, the court wasn\u2019t here when he was arraigned, and so after getting his letter, I went back and looked at the file and he\u2019s correct.\u201d The state responded by stating that \u201cI believe the court can find good cause in this situation,\u201d but before either side could present arguments on that point, the trial court asked both sides to submit briefing on the matter. At that point, the state averred: \u201cTo be completely candid to the court, I didn\u2019t notice the 90 days either, and yesterday is when it hit me, and that\u2019s why I had not responded * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The trial court subsequently held a hearing on the motion to dismiss. The state asked the trial court to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>that there was good cause for not bringing defendant to trial within 90 days of his request for a speedy trial. The reason, argued the state, had to do both with the fact that defense counsel was double-booked on November 3 and with representations made by defendant\u2019s counsel in the Ceja trial readiness hearing that immediately preceded defendant\u2019s readiness hearing on October 27. In arguing the motion to dismiss, the state asked the trial court to take judicial notice of the Ceja proceedings. Specifically, the state asked the court to judicially notice \u201cone, the * * * Ceja file\u201d and, two, \u201cthe court proceedings \u2014 the record that was created by the court on October the 27th, which was the [Ceja] trial readiness date. The proper time for that would begin at 1:26 p.m., Your Honor. That\u2019s when we initially start talking about Ceja and [defendant] together.\u201d The court stated that it would take judicial notice of that proceeding, and it was apparently the court\u2019s review of the October 27 Ceja hearing, perhaps in conjunction with the state\u2019s representations about the contents of those hearings, that led the trial court to make the following findings in its memorandum denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">\u201cOn October 27, 2009 a trial readiness hearing was held with counsel. Defense counsel had two cases scheduled for trial on November 3, 2009, this case as well as <em>State v. Ceja, * </em>* *. Defense counsel argued that the Ceja case had priority since the defendant in that case was present on a detainer out of Washington and it was necessary to bring [Ceja] to [trial] within 180 [] days. As a result!,] defense counsel argued that the Ceja case should go as scheduled on November 3, 2009 and [defendant\u2019s] case would have to be set over. The court hel[d] a final status hearing on October 30, 2009 and as a result of counsels\u2019 advising the court that the Ceja case was ready to be tried, since defense counsel could not try both cases at the same time, the court continued [defendant\u2019s] case to January 21, 2010.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">After a review of the relevant law, the court found \u201cthat there was good cause to continue the defendant\u2019s case herein beyond the 90 days as a result of defense counsel\u2019s having two cases to try on the same date and the Ceja case having priority as argued by defense counsel.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>On appeal, defendant, echoing the arguments he made before the trial court, asserts that the court, having already inadvertently overlooked defendant\u2019s speedy trial right, could not properly make a good-cause determination after the fact, <em>viz., </em>after the 90-day period had already expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alternatively, he argues that the state failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay. The state counters that the record in this case establishes that defendant \u201cimplicitly consented\u201d to extend the 90-day period by virtue of defense counsel\u2019s representations to the court in the Ceja proceeding; the state also reprises its argument that there was sufficient good cause for a continuance because defense counsel was \u201cdouble booked\u201d for trials on November 3 and had represented to the court that the Ceja trial should take priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">We begin by rejecting the state\u2019s assertion that defendant implicitly consented to an extension of the 90-day period. Again, ORS 135.763(2) provides: \u201cThe court shall grant any reasonable continuance with the consent of the defendant. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s lack of consent, the court may grant a continuance on motion of the district attorney or on its own motion, for good cause shown.\u201d Defendant\u2019s only relevant communication to the court was that he wished to have a speedy trial; there is no indication that he was aware of defense counsel\u2019s representations about the need to try the Ceja case first. Defendant was not present when any of the relevant scheduling decisions were made. In short, there is no evidence that defendant, who was consistent and unequivocal in demanding a speedy trial, consented to a continuance of his trial date past the 90-day statutory period. <em>See State v. Benner, </em>253 Or App 164, 169, 177, 288 P3d 1016 (2012) (defendant did not waive his speedy trial request when his defense counsel scheduled a trial after the 90-day period without defendant\u2019s knowledge); <em>State v. Glushko/Little, </em>351 Or 297, 315, 266 P3d 50 (2011) (under the speedy trial provision of ORS 135.747, \u201ca defendant gives \u2018consent\u2019 to a delay only when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>expressly agrees to a postponement requested by the state or the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Nonetheless, it remains to consider whether there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the continuation of the 90-day period within the meaning of ORS 136.763(2). \u201cAlthough no precise, all-encompassing definition of \u2018good cause\u2019 exists,\u201d circumstances such as overcrowded dockets, the unavailability of a prosecution witness, and the state\u2019s suspension of funding for indigent defense have all been found to constitute good cause. <em>Tatarinov, </em>211 Or App at 285-86, 289 (summarizing cases, and holding that state budget cuts that made it impossible to appoint indigent defense counsel constituted good cause). Here, the continuance was granted on October 30 while the state and the court inadvertently overlooked that defendant had requested a speedy trial. The court acknowledged that it had \u201cmessed up\u201d when it rescheduled defendant\u2019s trial for January and the state acknowledged that it \u201cdidn\u2019t notice the 90 days\u201d until after the 90-day period had lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Trying a defendant within the statutory period is the responsibility of the state: \u201cOnce the district attorney receives an inmate\u2019s request for a speedy trial, the statutory scheme \u2018plainly places responsibility on the district attorney to bring an inmate to trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Benner, </em>253 Or App at 167 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Gilliland, </em>90 Or App 477, 480, 752 P2d 1255 (1988)). \u201cUnder the statutory scheme, \u2018the state cannot abdicate its responsibility to control a prosecution. It must take affirmative action to bring a defendant to trial within 90 days, request a continuance for good cause or suffer a dismissal under ORS 135.765.\u2019\u201d <em>Benner, </em>253 Or App at 167-68 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Person, </em>113 Or App 40, 44, 831 P2d 700 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>316 Or 585, 853 P2d 813 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">As noted, the state argues that defense counsel\u2019s scheduling conflict with the Ceja case constituted good cause to reschedule defendant\u2019s trial date, given defense counsel\u2019s representation that the Ceja case \u201chad priority.\u201d Even assuming that the state is correct, that is a different inquiry than the proper one, which is whether good cause existed to postpone defendant\u2019s trial date <em>past the 90-day limit. See Tatarinov, </em>211 Or App at 289 (good cause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>shown when the record demonstrated that a backlog of cases caused by state budget cuts \u201cmade a trial <em>within the statutory period </em>impossible to achieve\u201d) (emphasis added). In other words, even accepting that there was good cause \u2014 owing to counsel\u2019s representations and the fact that counsel was double-booked \u2014 for not trying defendant on November 3, there were eight business days between October 30 \u2014 the day that defendant\u2019s trial was postponed \u2014 and November 13\u2014 the day after the 90-day window expired. The state contends that it is \u201cludicrous\u201d to suggest that the trial could have been rescheduled on any of those dates, because of the \u201ctypical delays inherent in scheduling court dates.\u201d Perhaps that is so, but it is a contention that is without any support in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Crucially, that lack of support owes to the fact that the state overlooked its duty to bring defendant to trial within the statutory timeframe. If the state had brought it to the court\u2019s attention that defendant had invoked his statutory speedy trial right, several potential alternatives to postponing defendant\u2019s trial outside the 90-day limit would have been apparent on October 30. For instance, the parties could have examined the court\u2019s docket and made a determination whether it was practicable to reschedule defendant\u2019s trial before November 12, perhaps by rescheduling some other, less-pressing business for a later date. At the least, the court might have adhered to the arrangement that existed on October 30, <em>viz., </em>that the Ceja case would retain priority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>and defendant\u2019s case would be scheduled to go to trial in the event that Ceja\u2019s did not. Had that happened, defendant\u2019s trial would have begun within the 90-day limit, for the OJIN register in the Ceja case, which the state attached to its brief in this appeal, indicates that Ceja\u2019s trial was also postponed past the November 3 date on which both cases were originally scheduled to go to trial. The court never considered \u2014 and was never asked to consider \u2014 whether it was possible to bring defendant to trial by November 12; that failure owes to the fact that the state inadvertently overlooked its statutory duty to bring defendant to trial within the 90-day window.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We do not suggest that the state must always \u2014 as it did in <em>Tatarinov </em>\u2014 demonstrate that it is (or, perhaps, was) impossible to try a defendant within 90 days in order to demonstrate good cause; however, it is the state\u2019s responsibility to make at least <em>some </em>showing of the difficulty or impracticability of trying an inmate within the statutory period, whatever the underlying cause for the delay might be. In sum, inadvertently overlooking both that defendant had requested a speedy trial and that the state had a duty to bring him to trial within the statutory period \u2014 without any consideration of the feasibility of complying with the statutory 90-day period \u2014 is not \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Defendant did not consent to a continuance, and the state did not demonstrate good cause for the failure to bring defendant to trial within 90 days of the invocation of his statutory speedy trial right. Because defendant was thus not \u201cbrought to trial in accordance with ORS 135.763 [,]\u201d and because none of the exceptions provided by ORS 135.765(2) apply, the trial court was required to dismiss the case. ORS 135.765(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-16\"> Defense counsel had not yet been appointed at the time of the arraignment; the trial court judge who presided over the arraignment was not the same one who presided over the rest of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-11\"> Despite that the court was apparently in receipt of defendant\u2019s letter before the November 12 statutory deadline, OJIN indicates that it was not entered into the record until November 13. Defense counsel subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the case on the same ground that defendant had stated in the letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-5\"> Because we conclude that, in all events, the record does not demonstrate good cause for the continuance of the 90-day period, we do not address whether a good cause determination could be made after the expiration of that period in the circumstances of this case. <em>But see Tatarinov, </em>211 Or App at 283 (the trial court could properly make a good cause determination after the statutory period had expired when the state filed a continuance motion before that expiration).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-5\"> The state also argues that defendant is not entitled to dismissal of the case under ORS 135.765(2)(a), which provides that a court is not required to dismiss a criminal proceeding when the failure to bring defendant to trial in accordance with ORS 135.763 \u201cwas the result of motions filed on behalf of the inmate.\u201d The state thus urges us to treat defense counsel\u2019s representations about the scheduling conflict that were made in the Ceja proceedings as motions filed on behalf of defendant. The transcripts of the Ceja proceedings are not before us. Even assuming, however, that defense counsel\u2019s expressed preference for trying the Ceja case first could be construed as a motion filed on \u201cbehalf of\u201d defendant, that motion was not the reason that defendant was not tried within 90 days, but rather only the reason that defendant was not tried on November 3. Defense counsel never requested any alternative trial date on anyone\u2019s behalf; the record is silent about why defendant\u2019s case was scheduled for January. Again, we reiterate that it was the state\u2019s duty to try defendant within 90 days. <em>Benner, </em>253 Or App at 167-68. The failure to try defendant in accordance with ORS 135.763 was the \u201cresult\u201d of the state inadvertently overlooking its duty to do so, not of motions filed on behalf of defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
