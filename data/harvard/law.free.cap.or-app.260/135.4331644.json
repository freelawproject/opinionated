(respondent), alleging that respondent performed negligent and improper work in connection with examining windows in a home that complainant was preparing to purchase and providing an opinion about related damage. Complainant seeks judicial review of a final board order, which dismissed his complaint and concluded that complainant had failed to state a claim for relief for negligent or improper work pursuant to ORS 701.140<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and OAR 812-004-0535(l)(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the board did not err in dismissing the claim and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We review the board\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence; that is, we must determine whether the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make the factual findings that the board made. ORS 183.482(8)(c). We review the board\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law and substantial reason. The latter requires us to determine whether the board\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact logically lead to its conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Goin v. Employment Dept., </em>203 Or App 758, 763, 126 P3d 734 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Because, as we explain below, we reject complainant\u2019s challenges to the board\u2019s factual findings, we state the facts consistently with the board\u2019s Final Order on Second Reconsideration (final order).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In April 2007, complainant was negotiating with Schlottman (seller) to purchase seller\u2019s house. Licensed residential inspector McLean inspected the house and wrote a report noting, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">\u201c#5: Windows - Water Intrusion - Sills of windows in S.E. bedroom show swelling; sills of windows in den below this room also show swelling and one window shows water damaged paint on its die casing - Indications of water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>intrusion, possible rot damage, mold etc., in walls. Consult qualified specialty contractor to evaluate and remediate water intrusion as deemed appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Based on that report, complainant and seller entered into a \u201cBuyer\u2019s Repair Addendum,\u201d in which the parties agreed that seller would remove the moss on the roof and have a \u201c[[licensed and bonded contractor *** identify and correct [the] source of [the] water intrusion per item 5 of inspection and identify and repair/replace and paint all water damaged areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Seller contacted respondent to clean the roof and gutters. When respondent\u2019s corporate president, Richard Lundstrom, visited the house to check on the work performed, seller requested that he look at two windows on the southeast corner of the house. Seller and seller\u2019s real estate agent, Raja, were present when Lundstrom inspected the windows from the interior of the house only. Lundstrom assisted seller in removing the window sills and sheetrock beneath one of the windows, and seller took pictures of the wood underneath the sills.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Lundstrom later wrote a letter to seller, dated April 25, 2007, on respondent\u2019s corporate letterhead, but Lundstrom had not seen a copy of either the Buyer\u2019s Repair Addendum or the initial inspection report before writing the letter. The letter, written at seller\u2019s request, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201cOn April 25, 2007 [,] I removed the window sills in both the upstairs front bedroom and the main floor front room ***. Neither window has water damage. The visual surface problem was contained to the * * * window sill and it would be my recommendation to replace the * * * bottom sill of both windows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cThere is absolutely no mold, dry rot[,] or other damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">At the request of complainant\u2019s realtor, Lundstrom later added the following paragraph to the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\u201cThe visual problem with the sheetrock around the front window is of no concern. My recommendation would be to remove, retexture and reapply paint in the area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Based on those recommendations, seller had the drywall repaired and the window sills replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In May 2007, complainant purchased, and moved into, the house. In October 2007, after a heavy rain, complainant found water leaking into the upstairs window. In December 2007, he discovered water leaks around the downstairs window. Complainant then filed a complaint with the board against respondent, alleging that respondent performed improper and negligent work on his house, pursuant to OAR 812-004-0535(1), and seeking monetary damages. The board dismissed the complaint, concluding that respondent did not perform negligent or improper work. Complainant thereafter requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">At the hearing, complainant testified that he had received the April 25, 2007, letter from seller, who had had the window sills replaced and interior carpentry work done based on the recommendations contained in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Complainant\u2019s realtor testified that, because seller\u2019s realtor, Raja, had told him that the April 25, 2007, letter satisfied the requirements of the Buyer\u2019s Repair Addendum, he believed that Lundstrom had inspected the windows per the terms of the addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Raja stated that she was present when Lundstrom examined the windows and felt that Lundstrom\u2019s inspection satisfied the terms of the addendum. She also believed that seller had hired respondent, a licensed and bonded contractor, to satisfy the requirements of the Buyer\u2019s Repair Addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Seller testified that he had asked Lundstrom to inspect the windows and that he had supplied pictures of the window sills to complainant after the repairs were complete. Seller noted that complainant declined to have the repairs inspected by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Complainant called two licensed residential real estate inspectors to testify. The first, McLean, had initially identified the potential water damage. Before the hearing, McLean examined the photos taken by seller in April 2007 while the window sills were removed. He opined that the pictures showed staining and darkening from water damage that had occurred over a period of time. The second inspector, McMullen, testified that he had noticed construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>defects near the windows as he approached the house for the first time. McMullen determined that water had leaked in around the upper window and then ran down the wall cavity, which compounded the effects of a similar leak on the lower window. He found that flashing had not been installed and that the decorative trim near the window was angled toward the house, worsening the leakage problem. McMullen opined that a proper investigation of the source of the water intrusion would require an investigation of the house\u2019s exterior and that Lundstrom\u2019s inspection was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Lundstrom testified that seller contacted his company to obtain roof cleaning services. Lundstrom recalled that seller \u201cneeded to have [the window] looked at\u201d because it \u201chad some water intrusion.\u201d Lundstrom initially agreed to look at the window because he believed that seller thought that respondent\u2019s pressure washing had caused the window leak. After looking at the windows, seller asked his opinion, and Lundstrom responded that he did not think it was a problem. Seller mentioned to Lundstrom that the window had been left open and that he had never noticed any leaks. Lundstrom did not think it was necessary to view the exterior because the sill did not look damaged. Lundstrom spent approximately 15 minutes examining the windows and did not view the exterior of the house. Lundstrom stated that he never saw an inspection report, never had any conversations with complainant, and had \u201cno idea\u201d that complainant was going to rely on his opinion. Lundstrom did not provide any verbal or written warranties, and suggested to seller that \u201cthey hire somebody to have [the window] looked at * * * while [the wall] was open.\u201d Lundstrom explained that seller requested that he draft the April 25, 2007, letter, and complainant\u2019s realtor subsequently asked Lundstrom to insert the new paragraph. Lundstrom denied that he had been asked to find the source of the water intrusion. He also stated that his opinion only pertained to the interior work, because seller had only asked him to remove sheetrock and the interior sill on two windows to confirm whether there was any \u201cvisual mold or dry rot moisture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After the hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ), on behalf of the board, issued a Proposed and Final Order, dismissing the complaint. The proposed order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>determined that the board had jurisdiction \u2014 under ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0320(5)(d) \u2014 because complainant had purchased property \u201cconditioned on an inspection report\u201d by respondent, but concluded that complainant had not (1) established detrimental reliance under the doctrine of equitable estoppel or (2) proved that Lundstrom had caused any damages, as required by ORS 701.140(1) and OAR 812-004-0535(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Complainant filed exceptions to parts of the ALJ\u2019s proposed findings of fact, relying, in part, on testimony from the hearing. The board issued a final order in May 2009 (2009 final order), concluding that complainant\u2019s exceptions were meritless. In the 2009 final order, the board amended and adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings. After complainant petitioned for judicial review, the board withdrew the 2009 final order and issued a Final Order on Reconsideration, dismissing the complaint because complainant had \u201cfailed to establish that [Respondent had a duty of care beyond his contractual obligations and had failed to establish that [Respondent had breached his contractual obligations or performed improper work on his contractual obligations.\u201d Complainant again filed a notice of intent to seek judicial review. Before briefing was complete, the Oregon Supreme Court issued <em>Abraham v. T. Henry Construction, Inc., </em>350 Or 29, 249 P3d 534 (2011), and the board withdrew its Final Order on Reconsideration to \u201caddress the effect of <em>Abraham </em>on the board\u2019s analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In March 2012, the board issued the final order at issue here, dismissing the complaint based on another legal ground. The board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, and made several additional factual findings, which it added to the order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board also incorporated the text of Lundstrom\u2019s April 25, 2007, letter into its factual findings. <em>See </em>260 Or App at 138 (quoting April 25, 2007, letter). Based on the ALJ\u2019s findings, and the facts it found independently, the board concluded that the record did not support a conclusion that \u201c[Respondent improperly performed the work that he contracted to perform.\u201d Further, the board concluded that the record did not support a conclusion that respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>was negligent, because complainant had alleged purely economic losses but had failed to establish that a special relationship existed between complainant and respondent. Thus, the \u201ceconomic loss\u201d doctrine barred complainant\u2019s negligence claim. Based on those conclusions, the board dismissed the complaint for failing to state a claim for relief against respondent for negligent or improper work under ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0535. Complainant sought judicial review of the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">On review, complainant first asserts that the board\u2019s refusal to consider testimony favorable to him impaired the fairness of the proceedings. The board responds that it properly refused to consider the oral evidence in complainant\u2019s exceptions when it adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, because complainant did not follow the board\u2019s procedural rules for challenging those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">When the AL J issued the initial Proposed and Final Order, complainant filed exceptions to parts of the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, relying, in part, on testimony from the hearing. However, complainant did not provide a transcript of the hearing to support his exceptions, as required by OAR 812-009-0400(6)(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board has the discretion to \u201crefuse to consider evidence of oral testimony submitted by a party\u201d if the party fails to comply with the procedural requirements of OAR 812-009-0400(6), including the requirement of providing a transcript. OAR 812-009-0400(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency with regard to any issue of agency discretion, ORS 183.482(7), and therefore conclude that the board did not err in refusing to consider complainant\u2019s exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Complainant next asserts that the board erred in finding that seller did not ask respondent for an opinion about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>water intrusion, only about interior damage. He argues that the board erred by \u201cmodifying\u201d the ALJ\u2019s finding without identifying and explaining the modifications as is required under ORS 183.650(2) and OAR 137-003-0665(3). He also argues that the board\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence. After a thorough review of the record, we reject that assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Complainant next challenges the board\u2019s conclusions that his complaint must be dismissed because (1) respondent\u2019s work was not improper and (2) the economic loss doctrine barred complainant\u2019s negligence claim for economic damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">OAR 812-004-0535(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201c[I]n order for the agency to award damages to claimant the record of the claim must contain evidence that persuades the agency, arbitrator or administrative law judge that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201c(a) Claimant suffered damages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201c(b) [T]he [Respondent caused those damages by acts or omissions within the scope of ORS 701.140; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201c(c) The monetary value of those damages is substantiated on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u201c(2) The agency shall dismiss the claim if the evidence in the record of the claim does not persuade the agency, arbitrator or administrative law judge of the existence of the facts described in section (1) of this rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">ORS 701.140, in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">\u201cA complaint under ORS 701.139 [governing the board\u2019s authority over disputes] must arise from the performance * * * of work that requires a contractor license issued by the Construction Contractors Board. The complaint must be of one or more of the following types:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">\u201c(1) A complaint against a contractor by the owner of a structure or other real property for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201c(a) Negligent work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201c(b) Improper work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Thus, to support an award of damages, the record must contain evidence that persuades the agency or ALJ that a complainant \u201csuffered damages,\u201d that the \u201cmonetary value of those damages is substantiated on the record,\u201d and that the respondent caused those damages by acting or failing to act within the scope of ORS 701.140. OAR 812-004-0535(l)(a) - (c). As relevant here, \u201cwithin the scope of ORS 701.140\u201d refers to complaints alleging \u201cimproper work\u201d and \u201cnegligent work.\u201d ORS 701.140(l)(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Complainant first challenges the board\u2019s dismissal of his complaint regarding his assertion of \u201cimproper work.\u201d He contends that certain pertinent facts found by the board are not supported by substantial evidence and that its analysis is not supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The board argues that we should not reach complainant\u2019s arguments regarding the \u201cimproper work\u201d claim, because he has not adequately developed that argument on appeal. Alternatively, the board argues that it properly concluded that complainant failed to establish that the inspection was improper, because the facts, as found by the board, are supported by substantial evidence and demonstrate that respondent properly performed the services that the seller hired him to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Even assuming that complainant adequately developed his argument regarding the \u201cimproper work\u201d claim, we conclude that the board did not err in dismissing the complaint on that basis, because the facts found by the board establish that respondent properly performed the services that seller hired him to perform and those findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">To determine what constitutes a claim for \u201cimproper work,\u201d we must determine the meaning of that term as used in ORS 701.140. When construing a statute, our \u201cparamount goal\u201d is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, by looking first to the text and context of the statute. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). When we consider the text of a statute we give words of common usage their plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>and ordinary meaning while also giving effect to the \u201cwell-defined legal meanings\u201d of legal terms. <em>State v. Contreras, </em>253 Or App 693, 695, 291 P3d 799 (2012) (citing <em>Fresk v. Kraemer, </em>337 Or 513, 520, 99 P3d 282 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">ORS 701.140 provides that complaints must \u201carise from the performance * * * of work that requires a contractor license.\u201d The nature of the complaint allowed by ORS 701.140(l)(b) arising from the performance of \u201cwork\u201d is described by the adjective \u201cimproper.\u201d Nowhere in ORS chapter 701, nor in any other applicable statute, is the phrase \u201cimproper work\u201d defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The adjective \u201cimproper,\u201d as relevant here, is defined as \u201cnot suited to the circumstances, design, or end.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1137 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, a claim that work was improper for purposes of ORS 701.140(l)(b) may be characterized as a claim that the work was not suited to the circumstances under which the work was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Here, the board adopted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and added several findings to the final order. The board found that seller contacted respondent, but did not show Lundstrom the inspection report. The board also found that, after seller directed Lundstrom to the interior of the house and asked him to look at the windows, Lundstrom agreed to inspect them because he believed that seller was concerned that water from respondent\u2019s pressure washing had caused the leak. The board found that seller did not ask Lundstrom about the source of any water intrusion, only interior damage. The board also found that seller had not explained to Lundstrom that he had concerns regarding persistent water intrusion, and that seller had not asked Lundstrom to look at the exterior of the windows. Additionally, the board found that seller asked Lundstrom to provide his opinion of damage to the windows, and Lundstrom determined that the wood showed no damage. After a review of the record, we conclude that those findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Based on those findings, the board concluded that \u201c[t]he evidence in the record does not support a conclusion that [r]espondent *** improperly performed the work <em>that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>he contracted to perform,\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Further, the board focused on what seller had asked Lundstrom to do, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201c[Seller] hired [Respondent to clean moss from the house\u2019s roof and clean the gutters, and that is the only work for which [Respondent ever received payment. When Lundstr[o]m came * * * to check on his workers\u2019 performance of that job, [seller] asked Lundstr[o]m to look at the windows at issue. * * * [Seller] voiced his opinion about the nature of any possible water intrusion, and asked Lundstr[o]m if his inspection supported that opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201c [A] s explained in detail above, <em>to the extent that Respondent contracted to inspect the windows, he entered into the terms of that contract with the home seller *** and performed the tasks that [seller] asked him to do.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, based on the evidence in the record that speaks to the conditions under which the work was performed and the information presented to Lundstrom by seller, the board concluded that the inspection that Lundstrom performed was suitable to the circumstances and, accordingly, was not improper. That conclusion is logically supported by the factual findings and is thus supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">We turn to complainant\u2019s contention that the board erred in concluding that respondent did not perform \u201cnegligent work.\u201d He argues that he established the existence of a common-law special relationship with respondent and that, in any event, a \u201cnegligent work\u201d claim under ORS 701.140(1) is independent of a claim for negligence under common law. The board responds that ORS 701.140 does not create an independent cause of action and instead grants the board jurisdiction over claims for common-law negligence as long as certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">As noted, under ORS 701.140, a complaint may be brought to the board if a complainant alleges \u201cnegligent work.\u201d \u201cNegligent work\u201d is not defined in ORS chapter 701 or in any other pertinent statute. However, negligence is a term of art and, thus, to inform our consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we look to case law to give that term its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201cwell-defined legal meaning.\u201d <em>Contreras, </em>253 Or App at 695. Generally speaking, to recover in negligence, a complainant must prove that the respondent\u2019s conduct created a foreseeable risk of harm and caused injury to the complainant. <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 17, 734 P2d 1326 (1987). However, under the common-law \u201ceconomic loss\u201d doctrine, economic damages \u2014 such as those suffered by complainant here \u2014 \u201care recoverable in negligence <em>only if the defendant is subject to a heightened standard of care, </em>such as one arising out of a special relationship\u201d or statute. <em>Abraham, </em>350 at 40 (emphasis added). Therefore, if common-law principles of negligence apply here, complainant must demonstrate \u201cthe existence of a special relationship in which the [respondent] had some obligation to pursue the [complainant]\u2019s economic interests.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Fearey, </em>162 Or App 546, 550, 986 P2d 690 (1999) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In <em>Bell v. PERB, </em>239 Or App 239, 249-50, 247 P3d 319 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 230 (2011), we held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201c[A] special relationship is defined by these traits: (1) One party relinquishes control over matters, usually financial, and entrusts them to the other party[;] (2) The party with control is authorized to exercise independent judgment; (3) in order to further the other party\u2019s interests; and (4) The relationship either is, or resembles, other relationships in which the law imposes a duty on parties to conduct themselves reasonably, so as to protect the other parties to the relationship * * *. In such relationships, the party in control has a heightened duty to the other party, and the other party has a right to rely on the controlling party\u2019s non-negligent performance of that duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Whether a special relationship exists depends on the \u201croles that the parties assume <em>in the particular interaction </em>where the alleged tort occurfs].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251 (emphasis and brackets in <em>Bell) </em>(citing <em>Strader v. Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>179 Or App 329, 334, 39 P3d 903, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 190 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">As noted, complainant argues that a claim for \u201cnegligent work\u201d under ORS 701.140 is independent of a claim for negligence under common law. However, complainant cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>no authority for the proposition that a claim for negligent work is somehow different from a claim for common-law negligence. We have reviewed the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 701.140, and we conclude that \u201cnegligent work\u201d as set forth in that statute refers to common-law negligence and does not create an independent cause of action. That is the only plausible interpretation that we can draw. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 169 (if statutory meaning is clear from examination of text, context, and legislative history, further inquiry is unnecessary). Therefore, we conclude that the board did not err when it applied principles of common-law negligence, including the economic loss doctrine, in the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In applying the principles of common-law negligence and the economic loss doctrine, the board determined that no special relationship existed between complainant and respondent. Having determined that the board\u2019s factual findings underlying that conclusion are supported by substantial evidence, we review those facts and the board\u2019s analysis leading to its legal conclusion for substantial reason. <em>Goin, </em>203 Or App at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As discussed above, the board found that seller hired respondent and did not show Lundstrom the inspection report or the Buyer\u2019s Repair Addendum. The board also found that seller requested that Lundstrom view and inspect the interior of the windows for damage and provide his opinion of the damage to the windows. The board found that Lundstrom had agreed to inspect the interior of the windows because he believed that respondent\u2019s pressure washing had caused the leak and that seller had not explained that he had concerns about persistent water intrusion. The board also found that seller had not asked Lundstrom to look at the exterior of the window or to determine the source of any water leaks and that Lundstrom had determined that the wood showed no damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Based on those findings, the board concluded that complainant did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a special relationship existed. The board concluded that \u2014 because seller had hired and contracted with respondent, and complainant had neither hired nor consulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>with respondent \u2014 there w\u00e1s no direct relationship between complainant and respondent, i.e., no \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed between complainant and respondent. That conclusion logically flows from the board\u2019s factual findings \u2014 i.e., that Lundstrom never saw the inspection report, and that seller did not ask Lundstrom to determine the source of any water leaks \u2014 and therefore is supported by substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Complainant nonetheless argues that the board was required to allow his negligence claim as a matter of law for the reasons expressed in <em>Meininger v. Henris Roofing &amp; Supply, </em>137 Or App 451, 905 P2d 861 (1995). In <em>Meininger, </em>the plaintiffs purchased a home after the defendant, a roofing company hired by the seller\u2019s real estate agent, performed a roof inspection and provided a report to the plaintiffs which concluded that the roof would last eight to ten more years. 137 Or App at 453. The roof leaked the following winter, and the plaintiffs sued for negligent misrepresentation. The defendant argued that it had no duty to the plaintiffs, because the seller\u2019s real estate agent \u2014 not the plaintiffs\u2019 agent \u2014 had hired it to perform the inspection. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed, concluding that a special relationship existed because \u201c[defendant was hired to provide a professional opinion about the condition of the roof, which it knew would be communicated to and relied upon by plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455. We held that \u201cnot all types of relationships give rise to a duty of care to protect against purely economic loss\u201d and noted that \u201c[t]he common thread *** is that the professional is acting, at least in part, to further the economic interests of the person to whom the duty is owed.\u201d <em>Meininger, </em>137 Or App at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The crux of <em>Meininger </em>is not, as complainant suggests, to announce that a special relationship is created in all cases in which a contractor performs an inspection and creates an inspection report. To the contrary, as we did in <em>Meininger, </em>a decisionmaker must examine the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a special relationship exists. <em>See Shin v. Sunriver Preparatory School, Inc., </em>199 Or App 352, 366, 111 P3d 762 (2005) (stating that whether a special relationship exists is driven by the facts of the case); <em>Strader, </em>179 Or App at 334 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(explaining that a court uses a \u201cfunctional as opposed to a formal analysis\u201d to determine a special relationship exists based on the roles the parties assume in the transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Complainant next asserts that, under <em>Meininger, </em>Lundstrom\u2019s knowledge is relevant to the determination of whether a special relationship exists, but argues that the board\u2019s finding that Lundstrom \u201cwas not aware of [c]omplainant\u2019s interest in Lundstr[o]m\u2019s opinion, and was not aware that [c] omplainant would be making any economic decisions based on Lundstr[o]m\u2019s opinion\u201d is \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the determination of whether a special relationship existed between complainant and respondent. The board responds that, although Lundstrom knew that the letter would be forwarded to a potential buyer, that knowledge does not, in itself, create a special relationship between complainant and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We conclude that the board\u2019s finding was not \u201cmisleading\u201d because it was supported by substantial evidence, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201c[seller] did not show Lundstr[o]m the inspection report.\u201d No other factual findings in the final order tend to suggest that Lundstrom knew that complainant would rely on Lundstrom\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We next determine whether Lundstrom\u2019s knowledge that the letter would be forwarded to a potential buyer was sufficient to create a special relationship between complainant and respondent such that respondent would have \u201csome obligation to pursue the [complainant]\u2019s economic interests.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>162 Or App at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We begin with whether Lundstrom\u2019s knowledge, at the time of the inspection and the creation of the April 25, 2007, letter, was sufficient to create a special relationship. As found by the board, Lundstrom was never informed by seller of the purpose of the inspection, nor was there ever any indication that the visual inspection that he performed was inadequate for seller\u2019s purposes. At the time of the inspection, Lundstrom dealt exclusively with seller, had no contact with complainant or complainant\u2019s realtor, had no written contract with seller for any work relating to the inspection, and received no payment for the inspection. Lundstrom verbally recommended that a specialty inspector examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the windows and also recommended that seller buy a home warranty. Although seller\u2019s realtor was present during the inspection, there is no indication from the record that she had any involvement with the request for the inspection, the discussion between seller and Lundstrom, or seller\u2019s request for the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">When Lundstrom wrote the April 25, 2007, letter, he did so at seller\u2019s request and addressed the letter directly to seller. At that point, Lundstrom had no contact or involvement with complainant or complainant\u2019s realtor and had not been informed of seller\u2019s reasons for wanting the written opinion. There also was no indication that the letter was inadequate for seller\u2019s purposes; in the letter, Lundstrom presented no new information to seller. Instead, the letter reiterated the contents of Lundstrom and seller\u2019s previous discussion. Based on those facts, Lundstrom had insufficient knowledge that his opinion would be relied upon by anyone but seller, or of complainant\u2019s interest in the inspection, to create a relationship between respondent and complainant that would obligate respondent to pursue complainant\u2019s economic interests. <em>Roberts, </em>162 Or App at 550. Thus, we conclude that Lundstrom\u2019s knowledge \u2014 as of the time of the inspection and the creation of the April 25, 2007, letter \u2014 did not create a special relationship with complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We turn to the addition of the final paragraph of the April 25, 2007, letter, added at the request of complainant\u2019s realtor approximately one week after the inspection. Although Lundstrom did not know that anyone other than seller would rely on Lundstrom\u2019s opinion about the windows\u2019 condition at the time of the inspection and the creation of the letter, there is no question that, when he added the paragraph one week later, he knew that someone other than seller would rely on the letter. However, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the realtor\u2019s request provided Lundstrom with any new information about the purpose of the inspection or the letter that would give Lundstrom sufficient knowledge of complainant\u2019s interest in the inspection to create a special relationship between respondent and complainant. Thus, we agree with the board that such knowledge \u2014 that someone would rely on Lundstrom\u2019s opinion \u2014 does not demonstrate that Lundstrom had sufficient information to know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>about \u2014 and thus be required to pursue \u2014 complainant\u2019s economic interests. Accordingly, Lundstrom\u2019s mere knowledge that complainant would rely on the letter cannot support a conclusion that a special relationship existed, and thus cannot support a negligence claim under the economic loss doctrine. Thus, although complainant may have relied on Lundstrom\u2019s opinion, our conclusion that no special relationship existed demonstrates that he lacked the <em>right </em>to do so. <em>See Conway v. Pacific University, </em>324 Or 231, 242 n 5, 924 P2d 818 (1996) (distinguishing a plaintiffs actual reliance from a situation in which the plaintiff \u201cha [d] a <em>right </em>to rely upon\u201d the defendant (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Further, as required by <em>Meininger, </em>the board made an examination of the record, and, as we have explained, its conclusion that there was no special relationship between complainant and respondent is supported by substantial reason given the record in this case. 137 Or App at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Complainant also argues that ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0320 create a special relationship, distinct from the common law, between himself and respondent sufficient to support his claim for negligent work. The board responds that ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0320 do not create a special relationship and that OAR 812-004-0535(1) requires complainant to prove the underlying claim for common-law negligence, which would include proving facts that would avoid the economic loss doctrine. For the following reasons, we agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">As pertinent here, ORS 701.140 provides that complaints filed with the board must arise from the performance of negligent work. OAR 812-004-0320(5) (2007) states, in relevant part, that \u201c[cjlaims will be accepted only when one or more of the following relationships exist between the claimant and the respondent: * * * [a] real estate purchase conditioned upon <em>an inspection report </em>or repairs made by the respondent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0320(5)(d) merely describe the board\u2019s jurisdiction to hear certain claims and do not alter the requirement that the complainant must also prove the underlying claim of <em>negligence </em>\u2014 i.e., that the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions caused damages within the scope of ORS 701.140 \u2014 as per OAR 812-004-0535(1). Accordingly, we reject complainant\u2019s argument that ORS 701.140 and OAR 812-004-0320(5)(d) create a special relationship sufficient to support complainant\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Finally, complainant asserts that the board erred in concluding that he failed to prove that Lundstrom\u2019s inspection was negligent. We have already concluded that the board did not err when it concluded that no special relationship existed between complainant and respondent and there was no heightened duty of care. Thus, complainant\u2019s negligence claim cannot be entertained. <em>Abraham, </em>350 Or at 40; <em>see Roberts, </em>162 Or App at 550 (stating that, only after a special relationship has been established, creating a heightened duty of care, \u201cdoes <em>Fazzolari\u2019s </em>[common-law negligence] foreseeability analysis come into play\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\"> We set out ORS 701.140(1) and OAR 812-004-0535(1) below. 260 Or App at 143-44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\"> The Oregon Administrative Rules to which we cite in this case have been amended since the institution of this case.
