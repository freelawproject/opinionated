He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of a nurse practitioner\u2019s testimony that she found the child complainant \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse based on what [the child] had previously said *** [a]nd what [the child] told [her],\u201d where there was no confirming physical evidence of sexual abuse. Defendant acknowledges that defense counsel did not move to strike the \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d testimony after the witness offered it during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of her, but now argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to strike that testimony <em>sua sponte </em>represents an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45 (1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in light of <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), and <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010). Although we agree that the nurse\u2019s testimony would have been inadmissible, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to strike it is not plain error because it is plausible that counsel, aware of both <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli </em>but nevertheless directing questions and argument at the nurse practitioner\u2019s ability to evaluate the child\u2019s credibility, made a strategic decision not to move to strike the testimony. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The child, M, lived with her mother, her two brothers, and defendant, who had been romantically involved with M\u2019s mother since M was about five years old. On August 20, 2009, when M was 12 years old, defendant got into M\u2019s bed and pulled down M\u2019s pajama pants and underwear. Defendant touched her vagina, put his finger inside her vagina, and touched her breasts and bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On December 11, 2009, M told her middle school counselor about an incident earlier that summer where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>defendant had inappropriately touched her chest and vagina. When a detective spoke with M later that day, M told her about the August 20, 2009, incident. M also told the detective about another encounter where defendant had touched her breast and three other encounters where defendant had touched her breast and her vagina. The officers discussed those claims with defendant, and he denied sexually abusing M. Later that day, however, defendant told police that one time he had touched M by accident and that he had an erection at that time. Defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On December 21, 2009, M was evaluated by Daly, a nurse practitioner for CARES Northwest, a regional center that conducts child abuse assessments. Daly found no physical evidence of sexual abuse but, during the physical examination, M told Daly that M\u2019s \u201cstepfather\u201d had touched her in her vaginal area. Although Daly normally would have engaged in a \u201clengthy video taped forensic interview\u201d as part of the CARES evaluation, M told Daly that she did not want to talk further about what had happened to her. About a month after Daly evaluated M, in January 2010, M told two police officers that she had previously lied about what defendant had done to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Defendant was charged with four counts of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration and 10 counts of first-degree sexual abuse. At trial, the state offered Daly as \u201can expert in child sexual abuse.\u201d On direct examination, Daly did not reveal any diagnosis or any recommendations she made for M, and the prosecutor specifically stated that he was not asking for a diagnosis. Daly did testify, however, that she \u201cdid not diagnose sexual abuse\u201d because she did not get \u201cadditional detail\u201d from the formal interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Defense counsel pursued that lack of detail on cross-examination. Daly admitted that, as summarized in the CARES evaluation she prepared, M reported to the Department of Human Services (DHS) that defendant \u201cdid this only one time,\u201d but \u201cthe police report [was] different than what [Daly] received in the DHS report.\u201d Defense counsel sought to emphasize that, given the lack of a formal interview, Daly\u2019s evaluation was based largely on the police and DHS reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cQ. So you try and make them feel comfortable? Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">\u201cA. Well, * * * I do an examination with them, and generally they\u2019ve been there since 8:30, and * * * the interview doesn\u2019t usually start until 10:30, so I offer them something to eat at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cQ. Okay, in this case as you testified, [M] did not want to participate in that next portion of the evaluation, did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cA. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cQ. Did you make any attempt to encourage her to talk about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cA. I asked her *** as I said she was whispering, hunched up and appeared terrified, and as I stated previously she had provided significant detail about this previously. So, when she said no, I did not try to push her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cQ. So, for the purpose of this [CARES] evaluation you relied on almost complete [ly] the DHS report and the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201cA. If you note <em>I said this was highly concerning for sexual abuse based on what she had previously said.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cQ. And you base\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\n<em>\u201cA. And what she told me.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">\u201cQ. Right, and again we\u2019re not going to talk about any diagnosis as you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">\u201cA. Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">(Emphases added.) Defense counsel offered no objection to the testimony highlighted above, nor did counsel move to strike that testimony or seek a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty on three counts of second-degree unlawful penetration and eight counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">Before we address the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we must clarify defendant\u2019s description of the legal error supporting his claim of plain error. Under <em>State v. </em>Brown, 310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990), an error is plain if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and (3) the error appears on the record, meaning that \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it[.]\u201d On appeal, defendant vaguely asserts that the \u201cadmission of the diagnosis\u201d was error and that \u201cthe trial court should have excluded [the testimony].\u201d In this case, however, the trial court did nothing to admit the challenged portion of Daly\u2019s testimony; because no objection was made, the trial court did not make a ruling on the admissibility of that testimony. If there was error, then, it was necessarily based on the trial court\u2019s <em>inaction </em>\u2014 i.e., the trial court\u2019s failure to strike the testimony <em>sua sponte </em>when Daly offered it on cross-examination. <em>See State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629-30, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (suggesting that a trial court, <em>\u201csua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated\u201d by impermissible testimony about the credibility of another witness); <em>B. A. v. Webb, </em>253 Or App 1, 12, 289 P3d 300 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 428 (2013) (explaining that, under <em>Milbradt, </em>\u201ctrial courts are obligated, <em>sua sponte, </em>to exclude and, if necessary, strike testimony that comments on a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">So understood, we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal. Initially, the parties disagree about whether the testimony offered by Daly is clearly prohibited by <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli. </em>According to defendant, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli, </em>it is beyond dispute that Daly\u2019s testimony that M was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d was inadmissible in the absence of confirming physical evidence. The state responds that the claimed legal error here is \u201creasonably in dispute\u201d under those cases because Daly \u201cdid not clearly communicate either that [highly concerning for sexual abuse] constituted a <em>diagnosis </em>or that it was based on an assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Southard, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether a diagnosis of \u2018sexual <em>abuse\u2019 </em>\u2014 i.e., a statement from an expert that, in the expert\u2019s opinion, the child was sexually abused \u2014 is admissible in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse.\u201d 347 Or at 142. As relevant here, the court determined that a diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence was inadmissible under OEC 403 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the probative value of that evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The probative value was slight, the court reasoned, because a diagnosis of sexual abuse based solely on an evaluation of the child\u2019s credibility \u201cdid not tell the jury anything that it was not equally capable of determining on its own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. The court found that the risk of prejudice was great:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">\u201cThe fact that the diagnosis came from a credentialed expert, surrounded with the hallmarks of the scientific method, created a substantial risk that the jury may be overly impressed or prejudiced by a perhaps misplaced aura of reliability or validity of the evidence. *** [T]he diagnosis is particularly problematic because the diagnosis, which was based primarily on an assessment of the boy\u2019s credibility, posed the risk that the jury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 140-41 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201cthe risk that the jury will defer to the expert\u2019s assessment outweighs whatever probative value the diagnosis may have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In Lupoli, the court reaffirmed the long-held principle \u201cthat one witness may not give <em>an opinion </em>on whether he or she believes another witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 357 (citing <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983)) (emphasis added). Specifically, the court reasoned that, where there is no physical evidence of abuse, a sexual abuse diagnosis is inadmissible because that diagnosis is \u201cnecessarily * * * based on [an] assessment of the child\u2019s believability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. Thus, in <em>Lupoli, </em>the court concluded that it was error to admit experts\u2019 statements explaining their sexual abuse diagnoses (generally, that \u201cthe children in question displayed the characteristics of truthful children and lacked characteristics indicative of suggestion, influence, or fantasy\u201d) where those statements could not be meaningfully separated from the experts\u2019 \u201ccredibility-based opinion[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We agree with defendant that, under <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli, </em>it is beyond reasonable dispute that Daly\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>was inadmissible. Under <em>Southard, </em>the governing question is whether the prejudicial effect of the witness\u2019s opinion testimony substantially outweighs its probative value. Daly\u2019s assessment of \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse,\u201d like the diagnosis in <em>Southard, </em>was of little probative value without confirming physical evidence of abuse; Daly did not tell the jury anything that it could not determine on its own. And, as in <em>Southard, </em>here there was a significant risk of prejudice because, given Daly\u2019s expressed view, the jury might have \u201cdefer [red] to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse [were] credible.\u201d 347 Or at 141; <em>see State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 521, 228 P3d 666 (2010) (explaining that a diagnosis of highly concerning for sexual abuse \u201ccarries with it the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the [alleged] victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible,\u201d even if \u201cthat implicit conclusion is, perhaps, not as pronounced as when an expert makes a definitive diagnosis of abuse\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The state argues, however, that the prejudicial effect of Daly\u2019s testimony was minimal because the jurors in this case would not have understood that testimony to have the same \u201challmarks of the scientific method\u201d that were present in <em>Southard, </em>where Daly did not explain that \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d was a diagnosis. We disagree. Daly was presented as \u201can expert in child sexual abuse,\u201d she explained the various components of her evaluation to the jury, and she ultimately expressed her opinion that, given M\u2019s statements, M was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d Although Daly did not explain that her opinion was a \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d as the expert witness did in <em>Southard, </em>Daly\u2019s testimony \u201cclearly [fell] within <em>Southard\u2019s </em>prohibition.\u201d <em>State v. Volynets-Vasylchenko, </em>246 Or App 632, 638-39, 267 P3d 206 (2011) (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that expert\u2019s treatment recommendations were \u201cnot a diagnosis of sexual abuse\u201d because \u201c[n]o juror could take [one of the recommendations] as anything other than a statement that [the child] ha[d] been the victim of abuse\u201d and that recommendation colored the others).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Moreover, apart from <em>Southard, </em>it is beyond reasonable dispute that Daly\u2019s testimony constituted impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>vouching under <em>Lupoli. </em>Because Daly found no evidence of physical abuse, her statement \u201cnecessarily was based on her assessment of the child\u2019s believability.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 362. In fact, Daly made her reliance on M\u2019s statements explicit; she testified that the child was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d <em>based on what the child had said </em>to Daly during the physical examination (and earlier to the police and DHS officials). Daly\u2019s \u201ccredibility-based opinion,\u201d <em>id., </em>was therefore inadmissible under <em>Lupoli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Having determined that Daly\u2019s testimony was prohibited under <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli, </em>we must determine whether the trial court plainly erred in failing to strike that testimony <em>sua sponte. </em>The state argues that \u201cthe trial court had no obligation to draw attention to the testimony by attempting to \u2018cure\u2019 it on defendant\u2019s behalf\u2019 because it is plausible that defense counsel made a strategic decision not to move to strike Daly\u2019s testimony or seek a curative instruction to avoid \u201chighlight [ing] the fact that \u2018highly concerning\u2019 was, in fact, a diagnosis and thereby emphasize the significance of what the witness had said.\u201d The state emphasizes that the trial occurred after <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli, </em>both the state and defendant avoided asking about a diagnosis, and \u201c[t]he testimony was elicited by defense counsel\u2019s own questioning concerning the basis on which the witness evaluated the victim.\u201d Defendant asserts that, \u201c[o]n this record, there is no plausible inference that defendant wanted the diagnosis admitted or made a strategic decision to not object.\u201d According to defendant, the fact that the testimony was elicited during cross-examination \u201cdoes not alter the analysis\u201d because \u201cthe nurse\u2019s answer not only went beyond [the question asked] but also was not responsive to the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We first consider the parties\u2019 dispute about whether defense counsel made a strategic decision not to move to strike Daly\u2019s testimony or ask for a curative instruction. We have held that a determination that defense counsel made a tactical choice not to object to impermissible testimony must be \u201cplausible\u201d in view of \u201cwhat actually occurred at trial.\u201d <em>Lovern, </em>234 Or App at 512. We therefore have rejected the specific claim that a defendant failed to object because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>he \u201cmight not have wanted to cause the jury to \u2018dwell on\u2019\u201d improper vouching testimony where \u201cthere [was] nothing in the record indicating that [the] defendant made any kind of strategic choice not to object[.]\u201d <em>State v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 177, 181, 308 P3d 352 (2013). Similarly, we have refused to simply assume that the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cmade a tactical decision not to object\u201d to a sexual abuse diagnosis because <em>Southard </em>had been decided before the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>State v. Lopez-Cruz, </em>256 Or App 32, 37, 299 P3d 569 (2013). The record must reflect a \u201cplausible tactical reason why counsel would have chosen not to object to * * * diagnosis testimony under <em>Southard[.]\u201d Id. </em>at 37-38. In this case, then, we cannot assume that defendant\u2019s counsel made a strategic decision not to move to strike Daly\u2019s testimony simply because <em>Southard </em>and <em>Lupoli </em>were decided before trial; instead, we must determine \u2014 based on the record \u2014 whether there is a plausible tactical reason why defense counsel forewent a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">At trial, defense counsel\u2019s theory of the case from the outset was that M\u2019s various disclosures were insufficient to allow the jury to meaningfully evaluate M\u2019s description of events. For example, during opening statements, defense counsel argued that, because M refused to give a formal interview as part of Daly\u2019s CARES evaluation, Daly \u2014 and the jury \u2014 were denied an opportunity to evaluate \u201cwhat exactly happened\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cYou know, why isn\u2019t there an interview with her? Why don\u2019t you have, usually there\u2019s a narrative, a child comes and says this is what happened to me, this is what occurred. And she doesn\u2019t talk about it. She says, T don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cSo [you\u2019re] missing that piece. Usually that interview is video taped. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s what \u2014 in some pieces that\u2019s not so important, but it\u2019s very much a piece of child abuse investigation [ to] have a video of the narrative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>\u201cSo, we\u2019re all clear if it ever comes to this what exactly happened.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>On Daly\u2019s direct examination, the state sought to downplay the importance of the formal interview. The state asked Daly if the lack of a formal interview had any effect on her ability to evaluate the child physically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201cQ. Okay, and so did her reluctance to speak about the abuse further in a further interview make *** your review of her body and your review of her privates deficient in some manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cA. Well, it would depend on what you\u2019re asking me to do, I was able to identify whether she had any physical injuries, and able to identify whether she had any additional medical needs. I was able to make recommendations for her safety, and for her mental health treatment. If * * * you are asking me to diagnose\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cQ. Which I\u2019m not, and please don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cA. \u2014definitively I <em>would </em>\u2014 I <em>did not diagnose sexual abuse because I did not get the additional detail there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cQ. You \u2014 so, with regards to what you were called upon to do which was to evaluate her medically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cQ. As you said, and to see how she was doing and if she needed any medical or other recommendations to be made, do you feel like your lack of an interview made that piece of what you did deficient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201cA. No it did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">On cross-examination, defense counsel focused on Daly\u2019s inability to conduct a formal interview to support her evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u201cQ. Okay, in this case as you testified, [M] did not want to participate in that next portion of the evaluation, did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201cA. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-17\">\u201cQ. So, for the purpose of this [CARES] evaluation you relied on almost complete [ly] the DHS report and the police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cA.

Well, she told me \u2014 in my exam she did tell me that her stepfather put his finger in her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">\u201cQ. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">\u201cA. And that was for me enough information to make recommendations about her safety and her health, regardless of the additional details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Defense counsel then went on to specifically connect the lack of a formal interview with Daly\u2019s inability to adequately evaluate M\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">\u201cQ. If [M] had given an interview with you, a videoed interview or without a video, and <em>she had told you something different </em>than you read in the police report or at DHS <em>would that have raised some questions in your mindf?]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>You know, it\u2019s interesting, because when we\u2019re reading the reports, we\u2019re often reading paraphrases and we\u2019re reading things that can sometimes get changed when they get passed along. <em>So, I tend to go more on what I hear directly.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">\u201cQ. Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">\u201cA. So, I can\u2019t say for certain. <em>It would depend on how different it was.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">\u201cQ. Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">\u201cA. You know, if she told me that it didn\u2019t happen it would change. But if some of \u2014 it\u2019s the core of [what] she was saying was the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cQ. Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">(Emphases added.) In closing argument, defense counsel again suggested that the formal interview was an important missed opportunity for M to give a statement to Daly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cAnd what does [M] do? Nothing. She doesn\u2019t talk about what happened at all. With the exception of this kind of common theme, which is [\u2018]I was touched this one timed\u2019] * * * And will she do the interview even though she\u2019s offered snacks, in this child center in private with this sweet woman. No, no statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Counsel ultimately asserted that the lack of a formal interview rendered Daly\u2019s evaluation \u201cworthless\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201cSo, you have no statement, and no physical evidence. So, we would assert, and we hope you agree that the CARES evaluation [is] totally worthless. Totally worthless in this case. It doesn\u2019t show one thing or another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Those specific arguments were part of the defense\u2019s broader claim that M\u2019s testimony at trial and her various disclosures (to the police, DHS workers, and Daly) were inconsistent \u2014 with varying degrees of detail \u2014 and that the jury needed more information than it was given to evaluate M\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to ask you to listen to what [M] said, and use what [M] said as your guidepost. Would it have been helpful to have a couple more interviews for everybody? Of course it would have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cWhat if you had another interview? What if you had another interview between a recantation and [now, w]here she tells the story that\u2019s just like the one that she told the first time [?] Would * * * that have helped? Of course it would have. You all want that. Everybody would want that. Everybody would want that who\u2019s listening to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cWould that have helped [you] use what [M] said as your guidepost [?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">In view of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination and arguments to the jury, we conclude that it is plausible that defense counsel chose not to move to strike Daly\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that M was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d Both parties were clearly aware of <em>Southard </em>and Lupoli; they both steered Daly away from discussing her specific diagnosis and recommendations. Defense counsel nevertheless made a conscious choice to argue that a formal interview \u2014 which would allow Daly to assess the child\u2019s credibility \u2014 was an important part of Daly\u2019s evaluation; indeed, counsel claimed that Daly\u2019s evaluation was \u201cworthless\u201d without that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">It is therefore plausible that, when Daly revealed her credibility-based opinion on cross-examination, counsel chose to downplay that testimony by immediately noting that Daly was not \u201cgoing to talk about any diagnosis,\u201d especially where Daly had already testified that M had not given Daly the necessary information for a diagnosis \u201cof sexual abuse.\u201d Further, defense counsel may have determined that it was better not to ask the court to strike the testimony or seek a curative instruction, given that counsel went on to emphasize, through continued questioning on cross-examination, that Daly could not adequately evaluate M\u2019s credibility without a formal interview. Defense counsel may have sought to avoid drawing attention to the fact that Daly could and did form an opinion that M was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse,\u201d or counsel may have not wanted an instruction essentially telling the jury to disregard Daly\u2019s assessment of M\u2019s credibility. Those strategic calls are plausible in light of the course of action that defense counsel took: Counsel, in control of cross-examination, conveyed to the jury that Daly was \u201cnot going to talk about any diagnosis\u201d; continued to question Daly about her ability to evaluate M\u2019s credibility without a formal interview; and ultimately argued that Daly\u2019s evaluation was \u201ctotally worthless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Having found that it was plausible that defense counsel made a strategic decision to forgo a motion to strike or curative instruction, we cannot fault the trial court for failing to strike Daly\u2019s testimony as an inappropriate diagnosis and credibility assessment without prompting from defense counsel. This case is markedly and materially different from those cases where we have held that the trial court has a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to strike objectionable testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Starting with <em>Milbradt, </em>where defense counsel had objected to the prosecutor\u2019s elicitation of vouching testimony from a psychotherapist, the Supreme Court \u201csuggest [ed] in the future that if counsel attempts to elicit similar testimony the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>should summarily cut off the inquiry before a jury is contaminated by it.\u201d 305 Or at 630. Thereafter, in <em>State v. McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 776 P2d 1304 (1989), a case where the trial court had denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike statements made by an officer that the complaining witness was telling the truth, we similarly reasoned that \u201cthe trial court had a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>not to allow testimony which commented on a witness\u2019[s] credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520 (citing <em>Milbradt, </em>305 Or at 629-30).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We have reiterated that the trial court has a <em>sua sponte </em>obligation to intervene by striking testimony or giving an instruction in a number of cases where the state elicited the improper testimony or the witness volunteered it on the state\u2019s examination, where nothing in the record showed that it was plausible that defense counsel made a strategic call not to object. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366-70, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (holding that the trial court committed plain error by allowing an investigating detective to testify, during the state\u2019s direct examination, that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest\u201d during his interview); <em>State v. Hollywood, </em>250 Or App 675, 678, 282 P3d 944 (2012) (concluding that the trial court plainly erred when it failed to strike <em>sua sponte </em>a sexual abuse diagnosis given by a state witness on direct examination that was \u201clogically countenanced\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s question, even though the \u201cchallenged testimony was not explicitly elicited by the prosecutor\u2019s question\u201d); <em>Higgins, </em>258 Or App at 180-81 (concluding that the trial court plainly erred when it failed to strike a witness\u2019s testimony, <em>sua sponte, </em>where the witness volunteered during the state\u2019s direct examination that \u201c\u2018[the complainant] wasn\u2019t lying\u2019\u201d and where nothing in the record showed that defense counsel may have chosen not to object for strategic purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">By contrast, here defense counsel questioned Daly about the specific basis of her evaluation of the child on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>cross-examination in order to advance an argument that Daly could not adequately evaluate the child\u2019s credibility, and after Daly offered the impermissible testimony, counsel immediately interjected that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to talk about any diagnosis.\u201d Defense counsel chose to attack the bases for Daly\u2019s conclusion rather than the conclusion itself to emphasize that Daly (and the jury) had insufficient information from which to assess whether the complaint was truthful. In that context, where defense counsel had a plausible strategic reason not to move to strike or ask for a curative instruction, and where counsel immediately sought to emphasize that Daly was not offering a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d and then continued to question her about her ability to evaluate the child, we conclude that it is not beyond reasonable dispute that the trial court was legally obligated to strike the testimony or give an instruction without prompting from counsel. Any error by the trial court\u2019s inaction was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-9\"> We reject without published discussion defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court plainly erred by instructing the jury that it could convict defendant without reaching unanimity and by accepting and entering convictions based on nonunanimous verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
