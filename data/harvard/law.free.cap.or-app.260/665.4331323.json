The amendment added approximately 68,302 acres owned by intervenor-respondent JWTR, LLC to the county\u2019s Destination Resort Overlay (DRO) map of eligible lands. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The facts pertinent to our review are not disputed. JWTR owns land in Klamath County for which it seeks approval for the siting of a destination resort under ORS 197.435 to 197.467. To that end, JWTR applied to Klamath County for an amendment to the county\u2019s comprehensive plan and zoning maps. JWTR requested that the maps be amended to add 90,000 acres owned by JWTR to the county\u2019s DRO map of eligible lands. The county amended the maps in the manner requested. Petitioners, among others, appealed to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">On appeal, in <em>Root v. Klamath County, </em>63 Or LUBA 230 (2011) <em>(Root I), </em>LUBA concluded that the county\u2019s action was deficient in several respects and remanded to the county to address the identified deficiencies. Pertinent to the issues raised in this proceeding, LUBA concluded that the county was required to more thoroughly analyze whether any \u201ctract\u201d proposed to be included in the DRO map contained lands ineligible for destination resort siting under ORS 197.455(1)(e)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, if so, whether ORS 197.435(7)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the tract from the DRO map. <em>Root I, </em>63 Or LUBA at 236-38. LUBA also concluded that the county\u2019s Goal 5 analysis was deficient because (a) its findings failed to adequately account for the fact that \u201cthere [was] an inventoried Goal 5 resource, especially sensitive big game habitat, located on or near some of the proposed lands\u201d; and (b) the county failed to adequately analyze potential \u201cconflicts with inventoried Goal 5 resources off-site from the proposed lands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247-48. Finally, LUBA concluded that the county erred by deferring the assessment of whether the plan amendment complied with the Transportation Planning Rule, OAR 660-012-0060, until after approval of the amendment, contrary to <em>Willamette Oaks, LLC v. City of Eugene, </em>232 Or App 29, 36, 220 P3d 445 (2009). <em>Root I, </em>63 Or LUBA at 249-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">On remand, JWTR again applied to the county for an amendment to the comprehensive plan and zoning maps, this time requesting that approximately 68,302 acres owned by JWTR be added to the DRO map of eligible lands. To demonstrate that the proposal did not contain any \u201ctracts\u201d required to be excluded from the DRO map, JWTR submitted a letter from its expert, Andr\u00e9a Rabe. Rabe explained that she had reviewed the proposed amendment to the DRO map against the \u201cland ownership layer for Klamath County\u201d to identify \u201cownership tracts.\u201d After identifying tracts, she excluded from the proposed amended map any tracts that did not meet the statutory requirements for inclusion on the DRO map. She then prepared a map and a tract list reflecting those changes to the map originally proposed by JWTR. Rabe explained that she \u201cincluded tracts in the Proposed Amended Destination Resort Overlay that in [her] professional opinion, satisfy the requirement in ORS 197.435(7) that any property excluded from a tract be located on the boundary of the tract and constitute [] less than 30% of the total tract.\u201d Based on Rabe\u2019s report, the county found that the tract list and map for the proposed amended DRO map of eligible lands only included tracts satisfying the requirements of ORS 197.435(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">To address LUBA\u2019s concern that the proposed amended DRO map would affect the inventoried Goal 5 resource of especially sensitive big game habitat, the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>excluded from the proposed map approximately 10,000 acres to avoid conflict with the inventoried Goal 5 resource of Big Game Winter Range (BGWR) habitat. JWTR\u2019s expert, Rabe, opined that, as a result of the exclusion of those lands, there was no overlap between the proposed amended DRO map and any BGWR habitat and, thus, no on-site conflict between the proposed amendment and BGWR habitat. Based on the changes and Rabe\u2019s opinion, the county found that the proposed amendment did not affect any on-site Goal 5 resources. The county also conducted a more extensive analysis of the potential impact of the overlay on off-site inventoried Goal 5 resources. It ultimately concluded that its existing Goal 5 management program would \u201ccontinue to be adequate\u201d to protect off-site BGWR habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Finally, to address compliance with the Transportation Planning Rule, the county adopted the following condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201cThis decision is final for purposes of appeal but shall not be effective for purposes of amending the Klamath County Comprehensive Plan Map and the Klamath County Land Development Code Map to add approximately 68,302 acres to the Plan and zoning maps until such time as the County imposes the Limited Use (\u2018LU\u2019) Overlay zoning district zone to those same properties in a post-acknowledgment Plan amendment proceeding and provides in that post-acknowledgment Plan amendment proceeding [th]at the LU Overlay zoning district shall not allow any new uses allowed by the destination resort overlay designation until such time as the LU is removed in a subsequent post-acknowledgment Plan amendment proceeding that demonstrates compliance with then-applicable provisions of the [Transportation Planning Rule]. The effect of this condition is that no new uses are allowed by this decision and, therefore, as a matter of law pursuant to OAR 660-012-0060(1), this decision does not significantly affect any transportation facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Based on that condition, the county found that the proposed amendment did not significantly affect any transportation facility and, therefore, satisfied the Transportation Planning Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cBased on the above, the Board finds that this Application is not a plan amendment that allows uses potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>inconsistent with the capacity of transportation facilities because it does not authorize new land uses and, therefore, as a matter of law, does not significantly affect any transportation facility because of the condition of approval based on OAR 660-012-0060(2)(e). For these reasons, the Board finds that the [Transportation Planning Rule] remand issue has been satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Petitioners again appealed to LUBA. LUBA affirmed. <em>Root v. Klamath </em>County,___Or LUBA___(LUBA No 2013-008, Aug 9, 2013) <em>(Root II). </em>Petitioners timely sought review in this court. Before this court, petitioners argue that LUBA erred in three respects: (a) by concluding that JWTR\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion constituted substantial evidence supporting the finding that the tracts included in the amended DRO map satisfied the requirements of ORS 197.435(7) and ORS 197.455(1)(e); (b) by concluding that \u201cthere were no conflicts between inventoried Goal 5 resources and proposed destination resort lands\u201d and by \u201cimproperly shifting the burden of proof to Petitioners to demonstrate there were no conflicts between inventoried Statewide Goal 5 resources and proposed destination resort lands\u201d; and (c) by rejecting on ripeness grounds petitioners\u2019 claim that the county erred by determining that the amendment, as conditioned, complied with the Transportation Planning Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">We generally review a LUBA order to determine whether it is \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure [.]\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a). We elaborate further on that standard of review as needed in addressing petitioners\u2019 specific assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\">A. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">In the first assignment of error, petitioners assert that LUBA erred in its substantial-evidence review of the county\u2019s finding that JWTR\u2019s lands satisfy the requirements under ORS 197.435(7) and ORS 197.455(1)(e) for inclusion on the DRO map of eligible lands. In particular, petitioners contend that the only evidence in the record on that point\u2014 Rabe\u2019s letter opinion \u2014 lacks sufficient detail and information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>about Rabe\u2019s qualifications to permit a reasonable person to rely on it, and that, as a result, there is no evidence in the record to support the county\u2019s determination that tracts included on the DRO map comply with ORS 197.435(7) and ORS 197.455(l)(e). Our standard of review compels us to reject that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">As we have explained, \u201c[o]ur role in this circumstance is to ensure that LUBA has followed the proper \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard in reviewing\u201d the county\u2019s decision. <em>Gunderson, LLC v. City of Portland, </em>243 Or App 612, 636, 259 P3d 1007 (2011), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>352 Or 648, 290 P3d 803 (2012) (some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOur task is not to assess whether the local government erred in making a finding, but to determine whether LUBA properly exercised its review authority.\u201d <em>Citizens for Responsibility v. Lane County, </em>218 Or App 339, 345, 180 P3d 35 (2008). If LUBA correctly articulates its standard of review, we cannot reverse LUBA\u2019s decision unless \u201cthere is no evidence to support the finding or if the evidence in the case is \u2018so at odds with LUBA\u2019s evaluation that a reviewing court could infer that LUBA had misunderstood or misapplied its scope of review.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Younger v. City of Portland, </em>305 Or 346, 359, 752 P2d 262 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Here, LUBA\u2019s order reflects that it understood its role on substantial-evidence review. LUBA correctly explained that its task was to assess whether the evidence in the record would permit a reasonable person \u201cto conclude that the properties included on the map are made up of tracts that include no ineligible lands or comply with the 30 percent rule[.]\u201d <em>Root </em>II,___Or LUBA___(slip op at 6). LUBA then concluded that Rabe\u2019s report constituted substantial evidence supporting the county\u2019s finding \u201cthat the proposed map includes only \u2018tracts\u2019 that qualify for inclusion under ORS 197.435(7).\u201d <em>Id. </em>LUBA noted that Rabe\u2019s description of her methodology for determining whether the tracts on the map satisfied ORS 197.435(7) made it reasonable for the county to credit her opinion, particularly in view of petitioners\u2019 failure to identify any countervailing evidence in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 4-6. Although petitioners argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the absence of information about Rabe\u2019s qualifications, and the conclusory nature of Rabe\u2019s opinion, made it unreasonable for the county to credit Rabe\u2019s report, those arguments attack the weight to be assigned to the report by the fact-finder, something that is outside our \u2014 and LUBA\u2019s \u2014 scope of review. <em>Tigard Sand and Gravel, Inc. v. Clackamas County, </em>151 Or App 16, 20, 949 P2d 1225 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 83 (1998) (\u201c [Substantial evidence review does not entail or permit the reviewing tribunal to reweigh or to assess the credibility of the evidence that was presented to the fact-finding body.\u201d). Regardless, under the circumstances, Rabe\u2019s description of her methodology provides a sufficient indicator of the report\u2019s reliability that we cannot say that LUBA\u2019s conclusion that the report constituted substantial evidence supporting the county\u2019s finding reflects a misunderstanding of substantial-evidence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Moreover, this is not a case where \u201cno evidence\u201d supports the county\u2019s finding. Rabe\u2019s report, if credited, is direct evidence of the fact that the property proposed for inclusion on the DRO map meets the requirements of ORS 197.435(7). This also is not a case where the evidence in the record is \u201cso at odds\u201d with the county\u2019s finding that we can infer that LUBA misunderstood or misapplied its standard of review. As noted, Rabe\u2019s report, the only evidence in the record addressing the point, supports the county\u2019s finding. Accordingly, we affirm on the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">B. <em>Goal 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In the second assignment of error, petitioners assert that \u201cLUBA erred in determining there were no conflicts between inventoried Goal 5 resources and proposed destination resort lands when there is no evidence in the record supporting the determination.\u201d We reject that argument because it does not address LUBA\u2019s actual ruling on the Goal 5 issue that petitioners presented to LUBA. LUBA\u2019s order reflects that it did not, in fact, review the county\u2019s Goal 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>determination on the merits, or otherwise make any determination regarding conflicts between inventoried Goal 5 resources and the lands to be added to the DRO map. Instead, LUBA rejected petitioners\u2019 attack on the county\u2019s Goal 5 analysis for the procedural reason that petitioners failed to \u201cidentify any inventoried Goal 5 resource that the proposed post-acknowledgment plan amendment \u2018would affect[,]\u2019\u201d as required by OAR 660-023-0250(3). <em>Root </em>II,___Or LUBA___ (slip op at 11). Consequently, because petitioners\u2019 merits argument does not challenge the ruling actually made by LUBA, it does not provide a basis for this court to conclude that LUBA\u2019s order is unlawful in substance or procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Petitioners also assert that LUBA \u201cerred in improperly shifting the burden of proof to Petitioners to demonstrate there were no conflicts between inventoried Statewide Goal 5 resources and proposed destination resort lands.\u201d In particular, petitioners claim that, by requiring them to identify a specific Goal 5 resource that is affected by the amendment to the DRO map, LUBA improperly shifted the burden of proving Goal 5 compliance from JWTR to petitioners. That argument \u2014 unlike petitioners\u2019 first argument \u2014 addresses the basis for LUBA\u2019s denial of their Goal 5 assignment of error. However, we nonetheless reject it. LUBA\u2019s longstanding procedural requirement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a party challenging a local government\u2019s Goal 5 analysis must identify the particular Goal 5 resource or resources alleged to be affected by the local government\u2019s action does not shift any burden of proof. Rather, it simply requires the challenging party to focus the dispute before LUBA on those specific resources that may be affected by the local governmental action, so that LUBA can assess whether the local government conducted whatever Goal 5 analysis was required under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In that regard, we note that LUBA\u2019s requirement is consistent with OAR 660-023-0250(3), the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) rule governing Goal 5 analysis in conjunction with a post-acknowledgment plan amendment (PAPA) (the type of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>at issue in this proceeding).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That rule provides that, absent circumstances not present here, a local government is not required to apply Goal 5 when adopting a PAPA unless the PAPA would affect a Goal 5 resource. OAR 660-023-0250(3). In other words, under the terms of the rule, absent an allegation that a specific inventoried Goal 5 resource would be affected by a particular PAPA, Goal 5 is not implicated by the PAPA process. LUBA\u2019s procedural practice implements the LCDC rule by requiring a party challenging a PAPA before LUBA to allege specific facts demonstrating that Goal 5 is triggered by the local government\u2019s action. That does not constitute a shift in the burden of proof. We therefore affirm on the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">C. <em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In the third assignment of error, petitioners assert that LUBA erred when it rejected their challenge to the county\u2019s determination that the proposed DRO map satisfied the Transportation Planning Rule as premature. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In amending its comprehensive plan and zoning maps to add JWTR\u2019s lands to the DRO map of eligible lands, the county made a final determination that the plan amendment \u201cdoes not significantly affect any transportation facility.\u201d The county based that determination on the condition preventing the plan amendment from taking effect until after the county had adopted a limited use overlay prohibiting the use of the lands added to the DRO map for destination-resort purposes until a demonstration of full compliance with the Transportation Planning Rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 theory before LUBA was that the condition is unlawful, and that, as a result, the county erred when it relied on that condition to determine that the amendment would not significantly affect a transportation facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Contrary to LUBA\u2019s conclusion, there was nothing \u201cpremature\u201d about petitioners\u2019 challenge to the county\u2019s determination that the amendment to the maps would not significantly affect a transportation facility. Although we acknowledge LUBA\u2019s concern about evaluating a claim where, as here, a local government\u2019s plan amendment might never take effect, that is the inevitable consequence of the interplay between (a) the statute governing LUBA\u2019s review of a local government\u2019s plan amendment, and (b) a local government\u2019s decision to make the effective date of a plan amendment contingent on some future event which may or may not transpire.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">ORS 197.830 requires a party that desires review of a local government\u2019s final decision on a plan amendment to do so within 21 days of the date that the decision becomes final,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and further requires LUBA to issue its decision on review within 77 days of the date of transmittal of the record. ORS 197.830(9), (14).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Those statutory timelines generally do not permit LUBA to wait and see whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>final but conditionally effective plan amendment will, in fact, take effect, before reviewing a timely initiated appeal of the amendment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to LUBA to address the merits of petitioners\u2019 contention that the county erred when it determined that the amendment to the maps would not significantly affect a transportation facility. <em>See Recovery House VI v. City of Eugene, </em>150 Or App 382, 389-90, 946 P2d 342 (1997) (remanding to LUBA under similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">LUBA correctly applied the substantial-evidence standard in reviewing the county\u2019s decision, and did not err by rejecting on procedural grounds petitioners\u2019 challenge to the county\u2019s Goal 5 analysis. We therefore affirm LUBA\u2019s order in those regards. However, LUBA erred when it rejected as \u201cpremature\u201d petitioners\u2019 challenge to the county\u2019s determination that the map amendments will not significantly affect a transportation facility; we therefore reverse on that issue and remand to LUBA to consider it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Reversed in part and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> ORS 197.455(l)(e) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">\u201c(1) A destination resort may be sited only on lands mapped as eligible for destination resort siting by the affected county.

We disagree. As we previously noted when rejecting a similar argument, \u201c[b]y observing that petitioner presented no evidence that weighed against that finding, LUBA was not shifting the burden; it was observing that respondents presented the administrative equivalent of a <em>prima facie </em>case and nothing in the record rebutted it.\u201d <em>Devin Oil Co., Inc. v.
