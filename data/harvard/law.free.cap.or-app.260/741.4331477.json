Defendant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to give his requested jury instruction and argues that the error was not harmless. The state concedes the error, but argues that, in light of the jury instructions that were given and the other evidence presented at trial, the error was harmless. We accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court erred; however, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in refusing to give the corroboration instruction likely affected the jury\u2019s verdict. ORS 138.230. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for errors of law. <em>State v. Worthington, </em>251 Or App 110, 113, 282 P3d 24 (2012). In reviewing the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction, we view the record in the light most favorable to establishment of the facts necessary to require that instruction. <em>State v. Black, </em>208 Or App 719, 721, 145 P3d 367 (2006). In light of that standard, the facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Defendant had legitimate prescriptions for the pain medication Oxycontin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s nurse practitioner, LM, told him that she had a patient being treated for cancer who needed assistance obtaining hydrocodone for pain relief. Defendant agreed to allow LM to prescribe hydrocodone to him, and, in turn, defendant would provide those medications to LM for that patient\u2019s use. Unbeknownst to defendant, LM, who was addicted to hydrocodone, kept the medications for her own consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Defendant was charged with 21 counts of delivery of controlled substances arising over a 10-month period in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>2009. Ten of the charges were dismissed because they related to defendant\u2019s legitimate prescription for Oxycontin. Defendant went to trial on the remaining charges relating to delivery of hydrocodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">At defendant\u2019s trial, LM testified that she had prescribed hydrocodone to defendant between 2007 and late 2009. According to LM, she would perform medical services for defendant in exchange for hydrocodone. LM also testified about two specific instances in which she had allegedly received the prescription pills from defendant: once at a school book fair in September or October 2009 and again at a school volleyball game in October or November of 2009. LM stated that she had told defendant that she had lied about the cancer patient and disclosed her hydrocodone addiction to him in approximately September 2009. At that point, according to LM, defendant had agreed to continue to supply LM with pills to try to gradually wean her off of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">During the testimony of the investigating officer, McKinley, the state played a tape recording of a telephone call between defendant and McKinley that occurred in mid-February 2010. In it, defendant stated that he and LM had never exchanged medical services for drugs. McKinley told defendant that his medical records were missing from LM\u2019s office and inquired several times as to whether he and LM had ever exchanged medical services for drugs. The two had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201cMCKINLEY: How much do you think you\u2019ve paid in the last year and a half?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Uh, I haven\u2019t paid her anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Well, I mean, paid for pills and then she reimbursed you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Oh, I\u2019d imagine it was probably several thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Okay. And I guess the reason I keep poking around the ... If she was doing this in exchange for medical practices, uh, it just shows whether she\u2019s lying to me or not, too. \u2019Cause then she sent you a bill, I just find that amazing she sent you a bill, after what all I was told.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Defendant told McKinley that he would purchase the drugs and deliver them to LM, usually once a month, but sometimes more often, and LM would reimburse him with cash. McKinley asked defendant, \u201cWhen did you quit paying for [the drugs]?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cUm, probably the last, probably the last year and a half.\u201d He told McKinley that LM had never told him about her drug addiction. Defendant stated that he would not deliver the pills to LM\u2019s office, but would arrange with LM to meet at different locations or drop them in her mailbox. McKinley and defendant then had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Would she ever do any, um, medical procedures for you in exchange for the pills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cDEFENDANT: No. Nope. Never did that. Never, uh, ... I never gave her pills up at the office, uh, or anything like that. She\u2019s done stuff on me, you know, for, uh . . . removed some moles and some tumor things, you know, but never, um . . . nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT: It was all just straight exchange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">\u201cMCKINLEY: But never at the office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">\u201cDEFENDANT: No, I\u2019d um . . . no, I\u2019d meet her at * * * her house or she\u2019d meet me at Chester\u2019s or something like that, you know, as I was coming through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-11\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT: I mean, I came through there and went to her office, you know, and had stuff done * * * as I was coming through, but she wouldn\u2019t, um, have me give her pills at the office, or you know . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-13\">\u201cMCKINLEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT: I met her at [the school] one time when I came through late at night, she was up there for a volleyball game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-15\">\u201cMCKINLEY: So it was just wherever you happened to run into each other, it sounds like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-16\">\u201cDEFENDANT: Yeah, it would just be, you know . . . [inaudible] a lot of time my schedule would change, so I came through at midnight, so I\u2019d put them in her mailbox.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>McKinley asked defendant to tell him the last time that he had delivered pills to LM. Defendant responded, \u201c [P]robably right at the end of November, first of December.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">Defendant then testified that he had delivered the medications to LM in 2007 but not in 2008 or 2009. According to defendant, he had met LM at the school on one occasion, but that, contrary to LM\u2019s testimony, he had met her in the parking lot of the school to receive results from a cancer test. Defendant stated that he had planned to meet LM at her office to hear the results, but they later decided to meet at the school. According to defendant, he had never exchanged the drugs for medical services, and instead, testified that he had paid out of pocket for his medical procedures, but his medical records had \u201cgone missing\u201d from LM\u2019s office. Defendant testified that LM had disclosed her addiction to him in late 2009, but he did not provide her with any hydrocodone after the initial period of a few months in 2007. Instead, defendant stated that when LM spoke with him about her addiction, he had offered her advice on how to taper off of the medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Defendant\u2019s girlfriend also testified. She stated that she had accompanied defendant to the school parking lot to receive the results of the cancer test and had overheard the entire conversation between LM and defendant; she testified that drugs were not exchanged during that encounter. She also testified that she had never been to a book fair at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">At the close of testimony, defendant requested that the trial court give multiple instructions regarding accomplice-witness testimony. The trial court instructed the jury about the definition of an accomplice witness, and the definition of aiding and abetting. It also informed the jury that defendant had the burden to prove that LM was an accomplice witness, and if the jury found LM to be an accomplice, then her testimony should be viewed with distrust. The trial court, however, declined to give defendant\u2019s requested \u201ccorroboration\u201d instruction, Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction (UCrJI) 1056, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201cThe testimony of an accomplice in and of itself is not sufficient to support a conviction. There must be in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>some evidence other than the testimony of an accomplice that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-4\">\u201cThis other evidence, or corroboration, need not be sufficient by itself to support a conviction but it must tend to show something more than just that a crime was committed. It must also connect or tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Defendant objected to the court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction, arguing that \u201c[t]he question of corroboration[,] I think[,] is a jury issue.\u201d As support for its decision that defendant was not entitled to that instruction, the trial court stated, \u201cThis case has plenty on corroboration. Quite frankly, the audio tape of [defendant]\u2019s own statements certainly is corroboration. This is not a case that relies solely on an accomplice\u2019s testimony, so that\u2019s the court\u2019s ruling there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of three of the 11 counts submitted to the jury: delivery of a controlled substance in September 2009, delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school in September 2009, and delivery of a controlled substance in November 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to give UCrJI 1056. The state concedes that the trial court\u2019s refusal was error, but argues that the error was harmless. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession that refusal to give the instruction was error; however, after reviewing the pertinent law, we conclude that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In assessing whether a trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to give a requested jury instruction is harmless, we look to whether the error \u201clikely affected the outcome of the case\u201d and also to whether the lack of the jury instruction \u201c\u2018created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the [jurors] which affected the outcome of the case.\u2019\u201d <em>Hutcheson v. City of Keizer, </em>169 Or App 510, 528, 8 P3d 1010 (2000) (quoting <em>Waterway Terminals v. P. S. Lord, </em>256 Or 361, 370, 474 P2d 309 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ORS 136.440(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. The corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances of the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We have held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201c[i]f any [corroborating] evidence exists, however slight or circumstantial, tending to connect the defendant with the crime other than the testimony of the accomplice, the question <em>whether the accomplice\u2019s testimony is so corroborated </em>as to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt <em>is one for the trier of fact!\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>State v. Ortiz-Rodriguez, </em>229 Or App 373, 380, 211 P3d 373 (2009) (emphasis added) (citing <em>State v. Long et al., </em>113 Or 309, 312, 231 P 963 (1925)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The state first contends that the error was harmless based on the subject matter of the jury instructions given by the trial court. <em>See State v. </em>Montez, 324 Or 343, 362, 927 P2d 64 (1996) (\u201cIt is not error for a trial court to refuse to give a requested instruction if the instruction given by the court adequately addresses the subject of the requested instruction.\u201d) However, after reviewing the instructions given by the trial court, we conclude that the subject of the requested instruction was not adequately addressed by the instructions given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The state next argues that, because the jury convicted defendant, it must have accepted defendant\u2019s out-of-court statements to McKinley as true and rejected defendant\u2019s trial testimony. In other words, the state contends that the jury must have concluded that LM\u2019s testimony was corroborated by defendant\u2019s out-of-court statements, thus rendering the trial court\u2019s error harmless. The state argues that it was \u201cimprobable\u201d that the jury relied solely on LM\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">We are unable to readily discern that the jury did not rely solely on LM\u2019s testimony to convict defendant. We generally assume that jurors follow instructions, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>there is an \u201c\u2018overwhelming probability that they would be unable to do so.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Tidwell, </em>259 Or App 152, 156, 313 P3d 345 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 26, 791 P2d 836 (1990)). Had the jury been instructed correctly, it would have had to determine that LM\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated before it could convict defendant based on any of that testimony. However, in the absence of the instruction, it is just as likely that the jury did not determine whether LM\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated before relying on it to convict defendant. Although the jury may have accepted defendant\u2019s out-of-court statements to McKinley as true, it is equally possible that the jury relied only on LM\u2019s testimony. Because we cannot say on this record that the jury did the former, we cannot conclude on that basis that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Nonetheless, the state argues that, in light of the \u201csubstantial corroborating evidence presented at trial,\u201d the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. Not surprisingly, the state characterizes the corroboration requirement in a way that minimizes its importance, stating that the standard under the corroboration statute \u201cis a modest one\u201d and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction did not affect the verdict because LM\u2019s testimony <em>was </em>corroborated. Defendant counters that the corroboration requirement is a demanding standard, arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected because, without the requested instruction, the jury was not aware of the additional \u201cstringency necessary to sustain\u201d his conviction. We agree with defendant that the corroboration requirement is not so modest as to essentially discharge the jury\u2019s duty to determine <em>if </em>the evidence was sufficiently corroborated in a case with significant factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">For example, in <em>Black, </em>208 Or App at 719, the defendant had assigned error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that two of the witnesses were the defendant\u2019s accomplices. The defendant was charged with theft in the first degree. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the first witness, Carleton, testified that she had heard and observed the defendant commit the theft. The second witness, Murray, testified that, while she did not see anyone steal anything, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>recognized the items being unloaded at her house as stolen. Further, Flemming, who did not testify, had implicated the defendant in the theft before trial. We concluded that it was error for the trial court to refuse to give the requested instructions. Nevertheless, the error was harmless. We reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\u201cThe effect of refusing the requested instruction with respect to Carleton and Murray was that the jury was not told that it could not convict on the basis of their testimony unless that testimony was corroborated and that it should view their testimony with distrust. However, their testimony <em>was </em>corroborated \u2014 by Flemming\u2019s statements introduced by the state without objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 725 (emphasis in original). Thus, after examining the evidence presented at the trial to determine if there was little likelihood that giving the requested instruction would have resulted in a different verdict, we concluded that it would not because the two witnesses\u2019 testimony was cumulative of Flemming\u2019s uncontroverted statements implicating the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In contrast, where the evidence presented at trial consists solely of testimony by an accomplice that tends to connect the defendant with <em>an </em>offense, as opposed to the specific charges at issue, we have held that such evidence does not satisfy the corroboration requirement. <em>Ortiz-Rodriguez, </em>229 Or App at 380. In that case, the defendant had been convicted of 15 counts of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 375. The defendant appealed, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, asserting that the only evidence of his involvement in the conduct giving rise to the charges for which he was being tried was the testimony of an accomplice witness. The defendant argued that, because the accomplice\u2019s testimony was not corroborated, there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions under ORS 136.440(1). The state had argued that the accomplice\u2019s testimony <em>was </em>corroborated because the accomplice possessed methamphetamine, scales, and baggies, which \u201ctend[ed] \u2018to indicate that a crime *** had taken <em>place </em>\u2014 i.e., that someone had possessed and delivered methamphetamine to [the accomplice].\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>380. We concluded that that connection was insufficient to satisfy the requirement found in ORS 136.440(1) that corroborating evidence \u2018\u201ctend[] to connect *** [the] <em>defendant </em>with the commission of the offense [,]\u201d\u2019 noting that, although the state had introduced evidence of the accomplice\u2019s earlier drug purchases from the defendant, that evidence failed to connect the defendant with the specific instances to which the accomplice testified and upon which the charges were based. <em>Ortiz-Rodriguez, </em>229 Or App at 381 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">This case represents the midpoint between <em>Ortiz-Rodriguez </em>and <em>Black. </em>In <em>Ortiz-Rodriguez, </em>we concluded that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice\u2019s testimony and thus the requirement of ORS 136.440(1) was not satisfied. At the opposite end of the spectrum, in <em>Black, </em>we concluded that, although the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the corroboration requirement, that error was harmless because there was sufficient undisputed corroborative evidence, such that even if the jury had engaged in the proper determination, based on the evidence presented, the jury could not have found that the accomplice\u2019s testimony was not corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In this case, the evidence presented at trial\u2014 the tape-recorded conversation between defendant and McKinley, defendant\u2019s testimony, and defendant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s testimony \u2014 was not cumulative or corroborative of LM\u2019s testimony. To the contrary, much of the evidence presented relating to the events that occurred between September 2009 and November 2009 \u2014 the charges of which defendant was convicted \u2014 was contradictory or equivocal with respect to LM\u2019s account of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">LM testified that defendant provided her with hydrocodone between 2007 and late 2009. On this point, defendant\u2019s testimony directly contradicted LM\u2019s. Defendant repeatedly stated that he had never provided LM with hydrocodone in 2009. Defendant was recorded telling McKinley that he had last paid for the medications, \u201cUm, probably the last, probably the last year and a half.\u201d This statement, made during the police investigation in approximately February 2010, could, therefore, refer to activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>occurring in <em>2008 </em>\u2014 i.e., well before the time period upon which the charges were based. In that respect, defendant\u2019s recorded statement does not corroborate LM\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">LM testified that she had met defendant once at a school book fair in September or October 2009 to receive the medications from defendant. Both defendant\u2019s and his girlfriend\u2019s testimony contradicted LM\u2019s testimony, and defendant denied providing LM with medications in 2009 at trial and on the tape recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">According to LM, she had also met defendant once at a school volleyball game in October or November 2009, and drugs were exchanged. The testimony of both defendant and defendant\u2019s girlfriend contradicted LM\u2019s testimony. Defendant specifically addressed his recorded statements\u2014 that he \u201cmet her at [the school] one time when [he] came through late at night, she was up there for a volleyball game\u201d \u2014 testifying that he had just listed several places that he had met LM for other purposes, and that he had not meant that he had given LM medications there.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">LM testified that she had told defendant that she had lied about the cancer patient and disclosed her hydrocodone addiction to him in approximately September 2009, and, at that point, defendant had then agreed to continue to supply LM with pills, to try to gradually wean her off of them. Defendant\u2019s testimony again contradicted LM and he continued to deny giving her any medications during that year. Instead, he testified that he simply offered her advice when she told him about her addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">According to LM\u2019s testimony, she had traded medical services for the hydrocodone and would reimburse defendant for the pills he delivered to her. Defendant\u2019s testimony mirrored LM\u2019s testimony on the issue of payment: both testified that defendant paid for some of the medications when he first began delivering pills to LM, but more often LM reimbursed defendant when he dropped off the medications. However, defendant repeatedly denied, in testimony and on the tape recording, that he had traded medical services for drugs. Defendant testified that his remark that he had given her thousands of dollars was referring to the amount of money he had paid her for medical procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201c[E]vidence which merely raises a suspicion that defendant is the guilty party is not sufficiently corroborative of the testimony of an accomplice to warrant a conviction, <em>nor will uncertain or equivocal corroboration suffice\u201d State v. Reynolds, </em>160 Or 445, 459, 86 P2d 413 (1939) (emphasis added). Here, in light of the conflicting and equivocal nature of the evidence presented, we are persuaded that the jury\u2019s verdict was likely affected by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In short, had there been \u201csubstantial corroborating evidence presented at trial,\u201d then that corroboration presumably would have been evident by the number of convictions returned by the jury. That did not occur here. The evidence was closely contested and the jury returned a guilty verdict on only three of the 11 counts. The jury found defendant not guilty on one count relating to conduct in October 2009, by a margin of one vote. The jury found defendant not guilty or did not reach a verdict on the remaining seven counts, which were ultimately dismissed. Accordingly, we can infer that the jury did not accept all of LM\u2019s testimony at face value, and that it did accept at least some of defendant\u2019s contradictory testimony and evidence. Each of the three guilty verdicts was based on a jury vote of 10-2. Had the jury been properly instructed that it must determine that sufficient corroborating evidence of LM\u2019s account was presented on each count to convict defendant, it would be presumed to have undertaken that task. <em>Tidwell, </em>259 Or App at 155-56. Accordingly, in light of the contradictory and equivocal nature of the evidence presented, we conclude that the error likely affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> In defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that the verdict must be unanimous and imposed judgments of conviction based on a nonunanimous vote of guilty. We reject those assignments of error without further discussion. <em>State v.
