The creditor may file an appropriate action against the personal representative in a court of competent jurisdiction or, instead, may file a request for summary determination of the claim in the probate court. In this case, we address a question about the procedures that govern when a creditor opts to pursue summary determination of a disallowed claim: Can the personal representative assert counterclaims in a summary-determination proceeding? We hold that the answer to that question is no. Because the probate court concluded otherwise, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">ORS chapter 115 governs \u201cclaims\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against estates. It sets forth the procedures by which an estate creditor must present any claim to the personal representative, as well as the procedures by which a creditor can obtain adjudication of the personal representative\u2019s disallowance of a claim in whole or in part. Under ORS 115.005, a creditor with a claim against an estate must present the claim to the personal representative within a specified time period. The personal representative may then disallow the claim in whole or in part. ORS 115.135. Upon receiving notice that the personal representative has disallowed a claim in whole or in part, the claimant then has two potential avenues for challenging the personal representative\u2019s decision in court. One option is to \u201cCommence a separate action against the personal representative on the claim in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d ORS 115.145(l)(b). The other option is to file a request for summary determination of the claim by the probate court in the estate proceeding. ORS 115.145(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">When a claimant chooses to pursue summary determination, the personal representative can veto that choice. Under ORS 115.155, the personal representative \u201cmay notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the claimant in writing that if the claimant desires to prove the claim the claimant must commence a separate action against the personal representative within 60 days after the date of receipt of such notice.\u201d The claimant then must comply with that demand, or the claimant\u2019s claim \u201cto the extent disallowed by the personal representative, is barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the personal representative does not elect to force the creditor to bring a separate action, then the personal representative must respond to the claim in the summary-determination proceeding in probate court by \u201cmovfing] or plead[ing] to the claim as though the claim were a complaint filed in an action.\u201d ORS 115.165(1). The probate court then must \u201chear the matter without a jury, * * * determine the claim in a summary manner and * * * make an order allowing or disallowing the claim in whole or in part.\u201d ORS 115.165(2). The probate court\u2019s order on summary determination is not appealable. ORS 115.165(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In this case, claimant Eldon Flaig, the son of decedent Naida Ramey, timely made a claim against the estate for $8,136.20. The claim was for expenses that claimant had paid on behalf of decedent. The personal representative disallowed the claim. Claimant then filed a request for summary determination of the claim in the probate court. In response, the personal representative filed an \u201cAnswer and Counterclaim.\u201d In it, the personal representative denied the claim and asserted a counterclaim. The personal representative alleged that claimant had received $30,000 in insurance proceeds belonging to the estate, \u201cand has not responded to the personal representative\u2019s request for an accounting.\u201d The personal representative requested entry of judgment declaring \u201cthat the $30,000 [insurance] proceeds is property of the estate,\u201d and ordering \u201c[c]laimant to provide an accounting of the $30,000 [insurance] proceeds [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Claimant moved to dismiss or strike the counterclaim. Claimant asserted that the probate code does not authorize counterclaims by a personal representative in a summary-determination proceeding under ORS chapter 115, and that the counterclaim should be stricken or dismissed on that basis. Claimant argued, among other things, that he wanted a jury trial on the counterclaim, and to retain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>other procedural rights that would otherwise be available to claimant on the counterclaim, but would not be available in a summary-determination proceeding. In the alternative, claimant asserted that <em>Hendrickson v. Warburton, </em>276 Or 989, 557 P2d 224 (1976), and <em>Ledford v. Yonkers, </em>278 Or 37, 562 P2d 970 (1977), required dismissal of the counterclaim, because the personal representative did not allege that the estate was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The probate court denied the motion. It ruled that the probate code permitted the personal representative to assert counterclaims in a proceeding for summary determination. The court then summarily determined both the claim and the counterclaim following a hearing at which the court heard testimony from several witnesses. At the close of the hearing, the court ruled that <em>Hendrickson </em>and <em>Ledford </em>did not bar the counterclaim, because the personal representative sought only a determination that the insurance proceeds were estate property, and was not seeking to set aside a transfer of estate property. The court then allowed the claim in part, for $7,273.39. On the counterclaim, the court declared that the $30,000 insurance proceeds were estate property and that claimant held those proceeds under a power of attorney; it ordered claimant to return the proceeds to the estate. Thereafter, the probate court entered a general judgment approving the estate\u2019s final accounting and authorizing final distribution of the estate. The judgment contained a money judgment against claimant for $22,726.61\u2014 the $30,000 that the court had ordered claimant to return to the estate, less the amount of the allowed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Claimant timely appealed. On appeal, he asserts that the judgment must be reversed either for the reason that the probate code does not authorize counterclaims by the personal representative in summary-determination proceedings or for the reason that <em>Hendrickson </em>and <em>Ledford </em>barred the personal representative\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">As a threshold matter, we must address whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal. Although the judgment below otherwise meets the criteria for our exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>appellate jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 19.205, the personal representative contends that ORS 115.165(3) precludes jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">ORS 115.165 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cIn a proceeding for summary determination by the probate court of a claim disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201c(1) The personal representative shall move or plead to the claim as though the claim were a complaint filed in an action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201c(2) The court shall hear the matter without a jury, after notice to the claimant and personal representative. Upon the hearing the court shall determine the claim in a summary manner and shall make an order allowing or disallowing the claim in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201c(3) No appeal may be taken from the order of the court made upon the summary determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">By its terms, the statute bars appeal solely from one type of order: <em>\u201cthe </em>order of the court made upon <em>the </em>summary determination.\u201d ORS 115.165(3) (emphases added). Viewed in context, it is apparent that \u201cthe\u201d order on summary determination to which ORS 115.165(3) refers is the order described by ORS 115.165(2): the order \u201callowing or disallowing the claim in whole or in part\u201d that the probate court must enter upon summarily determining a claim that the personal representative previously disallowed. In other words, the statute bars appeals from a probate court order summarily determining a creditor\u2019s disallowed claim against an estate. It does not bar appeals from other types of orders or judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Here, claimant is not appealing from the probate court\u2019s order allowing his claim in part on summary determination. That is, claimant is not appealing from the probate court\u2019s order summarily determining that he was entitled only to $7,273.39 of the total amount that he claimed against the estate. Instead, claimant is appealing from something else: the general judgment approving the estate\u2019s final account and authorizing final distribution and the money judgment against claimant. That judgment is appealable, and the probate court\u2019s denial of the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to strike is reviewable under ORS 19.425. ORS 116.113(4); ORS 19.205(1); ORS 19.425. Consequently, ORS 115.165(3) does not bar this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In reviewing the probate court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss or strike the counterclaim, we review for legal error the court\u2019s determination that the probate code authorizes a personal representative to assert a counterclaim in a proceeding for summary determination under ORS chapter 115. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312 n 8, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (\u201c[A]ppellate courts review questions of law anew without deference to trial courts.\u201d). We also review for legal error the probate court\u2019s determination that <em>Hendrickson </em>and <em>Ledford </em>do not bar the personal representative\u2019s counterclaim. <em>Rennie v. Freeway Transport, </em>55 Or App 1008, 1014, 640 P2d 704, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>294 Or 319, 656 P2d 919 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">A. Hendrickson <em>and </em>Ledford <em>do not bar the counterclaim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">We first address \u2014 and reject \u2014 claimant\u2019s contention that <em>Hendrickson </em>and <em>Ledford </em>required the probate court to dismiss the counterclaim. Those cases stand for the proposition that the probate code bars a personal representative from filing suit to set aside a transfer of property \u201cunless the remaining assets of the estate are insufficient to pay the claims of creditors or unless such a suit is otherwise required or appropriate for the purposes of administration of the estate.\u201d <em>Hendrickson, </em>276 Or at 997. However, as we have already recognized, those cases have no application where the personal representative is not suing to set aside a transfer of the decedent\u2019s property. <em>Rennie, </em>55 Or App at 1014. Here, as pleaded, the counterclaim did not seek to set aside a transfer of estate property; it sought a determination of whether certain funds held by claimant are estate property and, if so, an accounting of those funds. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the probate court correctly concluded that <em>Hendrickson </em>and <em>Ledford </em>did not require the dismissal of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">B. <em>The legislature did not authorize summary determination of counterclaims in proceedings under ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We turn to the primary question presented by this appeal: Did the legislature intend to permit counterclaims by the personal representative in proceedings for summary determination under ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165? The text, context, and legislative history of those provisions demonstrate that it did not. <em>See Halperin v. Pitts, </em>352 Or 482, 486, 287 P3d 1069 (2012) (explaining the methodology for discerning the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">To start, ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 do not, by their terms, state that counterclaims by the personal representative are a component of the summary-determination procedure authorized by those provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>because, as the Supreme Court has recognized, the legislature knows how to expressly authorize counterclaims when it intends to permit them in summary proceedings created by statute. <em>Class v. Carter, </em>293 Or 147, 153-54, 645 P2d 536 (1982) (conclusion that legislature did not intend to authorize counterclaims in commercial forcible entry and detainer (FED) proceedings \u2014 which are summary proceedings \u2014 was \u201cbolstered by the fact that when the legislature intended that counterclaims be assertable in FED actions, it specifically provided for them\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Moreover, apart from not mentioning counterclaims, ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 refer exclusively to the summary determination of claims disallowed by the personal representative; the statutes do not refer to the summary determination of any other type of dispute. ORS 115.145(l)(a) states that \u201c [i] f the personal representative disallows a claim in whole or in part,\u201d then the claimant may \u201c[f]ile in the estate proceeding a request for summary determination of <em>the </em>claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In describing the summary-determination procedure, ORS 115.165 continues the focus on claims disallowed by the personal representative. It denominates the proceeding permitted by ORS 115.145 as \u201ca proceeding for summary determination by the probate court of <em>a claim </em>disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative,\u201d and specifies that the result of such a proceeding is to be an \u201corder allowing or disallowing <em>the claim </em>in whole or in part.\u201d ORS 115.165 (emphases added). ORS 115.165(1) provides that the personal representative \u201cshall move or plead to <em>the claim as though the claim </em>were a complaint filed in an action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ORS 115.165(2) states that, after a hearing, \u201cthe court shall determine <em>the claim </em>in a summary manner [.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) That singular concentration on one specified type of claim supports the inference that the legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>to restrict the scope of summary-determination proceedings to the resolution of \u201cclaims disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative,\u201d and did not intend to authorize counterclaims by a personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The other provisions regarding summary determination in ORS chapter 115 strengthen that inference. Each refers to summary determination of \u201ca claim\u201d or \u201cthe <em>claim\u201d </em>ORS 115.155; ORS 115.175 (emphases added). A \u201cclaim\u201d under the probate code generally means a \u201cliabilit[y] of the decedent.\u201d ORS 111.005(7); <em>see generally </em>ORS ch 115 (governing \u201cclaims\u201d against an estate). By referring solely to the summary determination of \u201cclaims\u201d \u2014 and by omitting references to the summary determination of other matters \u2014 the legislature further evidenced its intent to restrict the scope of summary-determination proceedings to the resolution of the liabilities of the decedent to others, a scope that does not include the determination of others\u2019 liabilities to the decedent (which would be the subject matter of any counterclaim by a personal representative).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">ORS 115.155 is probative of the legislature\u2019s intent for an additional reason. It provides that the personal representative may force a claimant who has requested summary determination of a disallowed claim to instead file an action on the claim. ORS 115.155. That suggests that the legislature intended for a personal representative who deems a particular dispute with an estate creditor to be too complex for summary determination to force the adjudication of the dispute by way of an action or other appropriate means, rather than by asserting counterclaims or otherwise complicating the summary-determination process.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The balance of the probate code reinforces the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to permit summary determination of counterclaims asserted by a personal representative. Notably, the probate code is devoid of other references to a summary-determination process in probate court. ORS chapter 111, which governs probate jurisdiction, does not state that the probate court generally has the power to summarily determine matters within its jurisdiction; rather, the probate court\u2019s powers are coextensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>with the powers of the circuit court: \u201cThe general legal and equitable powers of a circuit court are applicable to effectuate the jurisdiction of a probate court[.]\u201d ORS 111.095(1). Additionally, although ORS 114.305(19) and (20) empower the personal representative to prosecute \u201cclaims of the decedent\u201d and \u201cactions, claims or proceedings * * * for the protection of the estate,\u201d those provisions do not, by their terms, arm the personal representative with the ability to compel summary determination of a dispute between the estate and a third party, or purport to create some form of summary proceeding. <em>See </em>ORS 114.305 (setting forth powers of the personal representative).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The legislature\u2019s silence regarding summary determination of claims, actions, or proceedings initiated by the personal representative on behalf of the estate \u2014 by way of counterclaim or otherwise \u2014 indicates that the legislature did not intend to authorize summary determination of those matters. The procedure established by ORS 115.165 eliminates any right to a jury trial, as well as any right to appeal. ORS 115.165(2) - (3). The summary-determination procedure also may foreclose discovery, because it mandates that the probate court hear and determine the claim in a \u201csummary manner\u201d upon notifying the claimant and the personal representative of the hearing. ORS 115.165(2). Given the potential importance of those significant procedural protections to a party defending against a personal representative\u2019s allegations, we decline to infer that the legislature intended to eliminate them without saying so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Notwithstanding those textual and contextual indicia of legislative intent, the personal representative argues that context demonstrates that the legislature did intend to authorize counterclaims in summary-determination proceedings. Specifically, she asserts that ORS 115.165(1) authorizes the summary determination of counterclaims by the personal representative. She notes that ORS 115.165(1) states that \u201c[t]he personal representative shall move or plead to the claim as though the claim were a complaint filed in an action,\u201d and asserts that that reference to procedure indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to allow counterclaims in a summary-determination proceeding, in view of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the rules of pleading procedure permit a defendant to assert counterclaims when answering a complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">For two reasons, we are not persuaded that the legislature\u2019s reference to pleading procedure in ORS 115.165(1) evidences an intent to authorize the assertion and adjudication of counterclaims in a summary-determination proceeding. First, as earlier noted, ORS 115.165(1) specifically refers to the personal representative\u2019s <em>moving or pleading to the claim. </em>However, ORS 115.165 does not, by its terms, state that a claimant may file a responsive pleading (or a response to a motion) once the personal representative has moved or pleaded to the claim. Had the legislature intended to permit the personal representative to assert counterclaims in summary-determination proceedings, we believe that it also would have provided specifically for a reply by the claimant in response to any counterclaim asserted. <em>See former </em>ORS 16.240 (1967), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1979, ch 284, \u00a7 199 (authorizing a plaintiff to reply to counterclaims or other \u201cnew matter\u201d contained in an answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Second, as noted, the summary-determination process eliminates significant procedural protections to which a counterclaim defendant might otherwise be entitled. If the legislature had intended to eliminate those protections for potential counterclaim defendants, we think that it would have done so expressly, not through an oblique reference to pleading procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Finally, the legislative history of ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 furnishes additional support for our reading of those provisions. The discussions in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the proposed ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 centered on the need for simplifying the procedures by which an estate creditor could challenge the personal representative\u2019s disallowance of a claim. Minutes, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 506 (Probate Code), Feb 3, 1969, Ex 2 at 3. The pertinent commentary to the Proposed Oregon Probate Code indicates the same objective: \u201cSection 156 is similar in content to [former] ORS 116.530, except that guidelines are provided for the procedure involved. * * * This provision was put in so that the present duplicate procedure[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] on contesting rejected claims would be eliminated under the proposed code.\u201d Commentary to Advisory Committee on Probate Law Revision Proposed Oregon Probate Code, Preliminary Draft \u00a7 156, 153 (1968). That history indicates that the legislative purpose in enacting ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 was to streamline the process for contesting the personal representative\u2019s rejection of a creditor\u2019s claim. That purpose weighs against the conclusion that a personal representative can assert counterclaims in summary-determination proceedings, because permitting counterclaims would result in the summary determination of categories of disputes beyond those expressly contemplated by the legislature, and would complicate the summary-determination process, in contravention of the legislature\u2019s intent to simplify it. <em>See Class, </em>293 Or at 151 (noting that if counterclaims were permitted in FED actions, \u201cthe object the legislature had in view\u2014 summary determination of possessory disputes \u2014 would be frustrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Accordingly, based on our review of the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165, we hold that ORS 115.165 does not permit counterclaims in a proceeding for summary determination under ORS 115.145. The probate court therefore erred when it declined to strike the counterclaim and, instead, proceeded to summarily determine the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">ORS 115.145 and ORS 115.165 do not authorize the summary determination of counterclaims by a personal representative. The probate court therefore erred by summarily determining the counterclaim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> Under the probate code, \u201c\u2018[c]laim\u2019 includes liabilities of a decedent, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise.\u201d ORS 111.005(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> The personal representative previously raised the issue of whether ORS 115.165 bars jurisdiction over this appeal in a motion to dismiss.

However, the legislature enacted ORS 115.165 in 1969, before the legislature abolished the distinction between law and equity. <em>See </em>ORS 174.590 (acknowledging the abolition of the distinction between law and equity resulting from the adoption of ORCP 2). Because, at that time, \u201caction\u201d was a term of art referring to actions at law, we look also to the procedural statutes in effect at that time, in order to assess whether the legislature\u2019s reference to an \u201caction\u201d bears on our analysis. <em>Nibler v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>338 Or 19, 24, 105 P3d 360 (2005) (\u201c[T]he statutory context of references to \u2018actions\u2019 and \u2018suits\u2019 has particular importance in discerning the legislature\u2019s intent in using those terms.\u201d). Those provisions are <em>former </em>ORS 16.290(b) (1967), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1979, ch 284, \u00a7 199 (describing answers); <em>former </em>ORS 16.300 (1967), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1975, ch 158, \u00a7 6 (identifying permissible counterclaims in actions); <em>former </em>ORS 16.310, <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1975, ch 158, \u00a7 6 (identifying permissible counterclaims in suits). Ultimately, pleading procedures then and now authorized the assertion of counterclaims in answers and we need not determine whether the reference to pleading procedure in ORS 115.165 should be construed to refer to the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, in the light of ORCP 2 and ORS 174.590, or should, instead, be construed to refer to the procedures in <em>former </em>ORS 16.290(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-5\"> Under the prior probate code, either party could seek to have the matter tried anew as an action or suit if the party was dissatisfied with the probate court\u2019s ruling on summary determination of a disallowed claim by a creditor. <em>Former </em>ORS 116.540 (1967), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1969, ch 591, \u00a7 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> Although we conclude that the probate court erred by summarily determining the counterclaim, we express no opinion on whether claimant otherwise would have a right to a jury trial on the personal representative\u2019s request for a determination that the insurance proceeds are estate property, and for an accounting for those proceeds. The law in that regard has been evolving. <em>See Foster v.
