In 1895 the plaintiff performed for the Long Beach Association work, which was used in said hotel, and he knew it belonged to the association, similar to that in controversy. It appears, further, that the plaintiff knew that the articles which he was to plate and repair were also the property of this association. There is no evidence of an original promise on the part of the defendant, and unless the defendant made some unequivocal promise to pay this debt of the association, and that in writing, the plaintiff cannot recover. We think, therefore, the court erred in refusing the following request to charge: \u201cDefendant\u2019s Attorney: I ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the plaintiff knew that Mr. Murray was acting as manager of the Long Beach Association at the time h\u00e9 gave the order, then the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. The Court: I decline to charge as requested. (Exception taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel),\u201d\u2014for if the plaintiff dealt with the defendant knowing he was not the principal, but simply the agent or representative of the association, he cannot recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">For this reason the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
