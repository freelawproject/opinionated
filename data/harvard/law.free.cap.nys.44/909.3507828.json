Barry v. Calder, 48 Hun, 449, 1 N. Y. Supp. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">The allegation that \u201cplaintiff was entitled to the immediate possession of a certain steam pump, his property, theretofore by him let for hire to the defendants,\u201d was a sufficient allegation that the term of hiring had ended, and the court properly denied the motion to dismiss the complaint, made at the opening of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">The judgment rolls in the supreme court actions (Exhibits A and B) were properly admitted in evidence. They established the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>of the lease of the pump to defendants, and in this class of bailments the term ceased upon plaintiff\u2019s demand for his pump, and conversion began upon the pump\u2019s retention after such demand. A loan of a chattel for hire, without specification as to time, is a bare license, which may be recalled at any time. Edw. Bailm. \u00a7 133. The bailee, refusing to restore on demand, is liable for conversion. Id. \u00a7 152. The supreme court judgment was a complete bar to any attempt to revive the questions of ownership of the chattel by plaintiff, and its delivery to and use by defendants, under a contract for hire. The record could not be excluded if it proved any material fact in support of plaintiff\u2019s case. Carleton v. Lombard, Ayres &amp; Co., 149 N. Y. 152, 43 N. E. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The property being under the control of the defendants, and possession demanded, noncompliance with the demand that plaintiff be put in possession is prima facie evidence of conversion; and defendant\u2019s denials of a demand, and refusal to return, created a conflict of evidence, which was properly left to the jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The judgment azud order appealed from should he affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
