This second reason for the return was not relied on, as it appears that the answer was not over two folios in length, and therefore not required to be folioed. The plaintiff, however, insists upon his right to return the answer for the reason first given, viz. upon the ground that the post-office and office address, with the street number, was not stated upon the face of the answer. The plaintiff having specified the irregularity of which he complains in his notice returning the answer, he must be confined to the irregularity specified. The question, therefore, depends upon the provisions of section 421 of the Code. That section relates solely to the appearance of the defendant, and it provides that such appearance must be made by serving upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, within 20 days after service of the summons, a notice of appearance, or a copy of the demurrer or answer. The sufficiency of an answer, as an appearance by the defendant, is regulated by this section. The title, which includes this section in question, relates to the commencement of the action, and the method by which a defendant may be made a party thereto. Section 417 of the Code, to which reference is made in section 421, relates to the summons, and the requirements thereof, and to the signature of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and his post-office address, as indicating the place for the service of all papers to be subsequently served in the action. Section 421 regulates the appearance of the defendant, and such appearance must be subscribed by the defendant\u2019s attorney in the same way as the summons by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. When, however, the defendant\u2019s appearance has been entered by the service of a notice of appearance to which the defendant\u2019s name is subscribed as required by section 421, the defendant has appeared in the action. Such appearance has been duly made in this case, and the answer of the defendant was not served as an appearance of the defendant in the action. The provision of the section that a notice or pleading- so served, viz. served as the appearance of the defendant, did not apply to a pleading served not as such appearance, but as the answer of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Section 422 of the Code provides for the service of an answer upon the plaintiffs attorney for the purpose of preventing judgment by default; but there is no provision there requiring that the post-office address must be added to the signature of the defendant\u2019s attorney. We think, therefore, that the answer served did not violate either of the sections of the Code mentioned, that its return by the plaintiff was unauthorized, and that the judgment entered by default was properly vacated. The order, however, after setting aside the judgment, provided that all further proceedings on the part of the plaintiff be stayed until the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of the costs directed to be paid by the order. This provision was unauthorized. The Code expressly provides under what circumstances the nonpayment of costs directed by an order shall stay the proceedings, and this provision is more extensive than the stay provided for by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">As the plaintiff has appealed from each and every part of the order, the order should be modified by striking out this clause in the order staying proceedings; and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
