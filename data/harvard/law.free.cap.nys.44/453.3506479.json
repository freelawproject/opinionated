J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEH\">This action having been brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to real property, under section 1670 of the Code the plaintiff could file a notice of pendency of action; and this, irrespective of the question as to whether the action was well brought or not. In such a case the court has power to cancel the notice of pendency after the time to appeal from a final judgment in the action has expired; or the court may do so if the plaintiff unreasonably neglects to proceed with the action. It is undoubtedly true that, where a notice of pendency of action is filed in an action in which such filing is not authorized, the court may set it aside. But where such notice is filed in a proper action it would seem that the circumstances enumerated in the Code must exist before the court is authorized to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The motion in the case at bar .was, therefore, prematurely made, and the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion dismissed, without costs, and without prejudice to a renewal of the motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
