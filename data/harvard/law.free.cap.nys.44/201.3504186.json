The fire occurred at Saratoga Springs, March 8, 1896. Charles Hartwell was the defendant\u2019s local agent there, and, as such, had countersigned the policy. John H. Scotland was, as defendant admitted upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the trial, \u201cthe special agent of the defendant, and had charge of this and other agencies in northern New York.\u201d Two days after the fire, Scotland went to Saratoga, and, after making an examination, he had the following conversation with Mr. Brusnihan, who was acting for the insured. Mr. Brusnihan asked him: \u201cDo you want us to file any proofs of loss under the policy?\u201d Scotland answered: \u201cNo;. it is entirely unnecessary. We decline all liability for the loss.\u201d Brusnihan then asked: \u201cYou don\u2019t want appraisers appointed under the policy?\u201d Scotland answered: \u201cNo; go ahead, and sue as quick as you wish to.\u201d The fair inference from defendant\u2019s admission was that Scotland\u2019s powers were specially complete and ample in respect to defendant\u2019s interests under the policy. His explicit verbal waiver of proofs of loss bound the defendant, unless, as the trial court held, the waiver, to be valid, must be in writing. The policy, in addition to requiring the insured to furnish the defendant, within 60 days after the fire, written proofs of loss, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u201cNo officer, agent, or other representative of this company shall have power to waive any provision or condition of this policy, except such as by the terms of this policy may be the subject of agreement indorsed hereon or added hereto; and, as to such provisions and conditions, no officer, agent, or representative shall have such power, or be deemed or held to have waived such provisions or conditions, unless such waiver, if any, shall be written upon or attached hereto; nor shall any privilege or permission affecting the insurance under this policy exist or be claimed by the insured, unless so written or attached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">This provision seems to embody the potentiality of successful fraud. It has received the criticism of a foreign jurisdiction. O\u2019Neil v. Insurance Co., 166 Pa. St. 72, 30 Atl. 943. The defendant sends its agent, apparently clothed with full powers, to the scene of the fire, and he there tells the representative of the insured that it is entirely unnecessary to file proofs of loss under the policy. He was then and there, for that business, the defendant, ostensibly and actually. If he did not mean what he said, he meant to mislead the insured. If he did mean what he said, he should stand by it,\u2014the defendant should stand by it. The defendant does not stand by it, but steals behind the quoted provision of the policy. What for? If to reap the advantage of its misleading declaration upon which the insured relied, then, upon familiar principles, it -should be estopped from asserting this provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">It is true that the waiver was not in writing, and therefore not that which the contract calls for; but the defendant, like every person competent to contract, is subject to the rules of estoppel, and it is not conceived that it can, by any antecedent contract, escape from them. Public policy forbids that it shall in advance make any contract exempting itself from the just responsibility of such of its subsequent acts as are injurious to others. We therefore hold that the defendant, by its declarations subsequent to the contract, and impossible for the contract to prevent, upon which the insured relied, is estopped from insisting that the waiver should be in writing, or, to put it in another form, from insisting upon a forfeiture by reason of a nonperformance which the company has induced.

Assurance Co., 151 N. Y. 88, 45 N. E. 381. Besides, the furnishing of proofs of loss is part of the procedure to which the insured resorts to collect what is due him upon his policy. The courts are reluctant to assist the insurance companies in withholding the payment they have promised when the insured is misled as to the practice by the acts or artifice of the agents of the companies.
