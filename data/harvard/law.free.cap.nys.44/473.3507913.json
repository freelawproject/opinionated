If this practice should be upheld, they can forever prevent an appeal from any order they have obtained or can obtain in this case, for they can appear especially in each instance, obtain an order, and then withdraw. Although it is sometimes said that the retainer of an attorney ends with the entry of a judgment, yet it is well settled that, after judgment, the attorney\u2019s relations to his client continue in the matter for many purposes. He can issue execution, give satisfaction of the judgment, and is the proper party upon whom the defeated party should serve notice of appeal. Likewise, where attorneys appear for a certain purpose, as it is claimed in this case, to obtain an order, their relation to their client still exists for the purposes of an appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">FITZSIMONS, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
