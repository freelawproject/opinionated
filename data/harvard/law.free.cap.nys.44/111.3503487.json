In People v. Cullen, 151 N. Y. 54, 45 N. E. 401, the court'of appeals intimated that the right to such an appeal is open to grave doubt. But we find no reason to interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>with the judgment of the court below on the merits. On the hearing in the county court the appellant insisted that that court was limited to an examination of the proceedings before the police justice, and the only matter to be determined by the court was whether the police justice erred on the evidence before him. The appellant declined to offer any evidence, and refused to cross-examine plaintiff's witnesses. There is no authority whatever for this claim of the appellant. Section 864, Code Cr. Proc., is a re-enactment of section 28, p. 902, 2 Rev. St. (6th Ed.). There seems to have never been any dispute as to the true construction of this section, or any denial that its provisions required a trial de novo in the county court. Roy v. Targee, 7 Wend. 358; People v. Lyon, 83 Hun, 303, 31 N. <em>Y. </em>Supp. 942; People v. Schildwachter, 87 Hun, 363, 34 N. Y. Supp. 352. The amendments of 1890 (chapter 39) to sections 749 and 751, Code Cr. Proc., have not changed the character of proceedings on appeals from orders in bastardy proceedings. The language of section 749 is for the review of \u201ca judgment upon conviction.\u201d The orders made in bastardy proceedings are never so characterized by the Code, but are spoken of as \u201corders of filiation.\u201d If there were no other means of review of decisions in bastardy cases than those prescribed by section 749, the court might be inclined to strain the interpretation of the term \u201ca judgment upon conviction,\u201d so as to include such cases. But sections 861 to 880 provide a complete scheme for appeals in such cases, and prescribe the powers of the court on appeals. It is unreasonable to suppose that, by the amendments to sections 749 and 751 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was intended to abrogate that scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
