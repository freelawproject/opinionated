The plaintiff demanded judgment, that a trust be impressed upon the money in possession of the defendants drawn from the savings bank to the extent of $80, and that that sum be paid to the plaintiff. To this complaint, the defendant Abraham Sindrack, individually, and both defendants, as administrators, interposed several demurrers, on the ground that several causes of action are improperly united. From an interlocutory judgment overruling such demurrers, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">It is not necessary to say whether the plaintiff could have maintained an action at law against the administrators individually on its claim for services in the burial of the deceased. As a general rule, such a claim can be maintained where the administrator has received sufficient assets to discharge it. Rappelyea v. Russell, 1 Daly, 214; Patterson v. Patterson, 59 N. Y. 574. Whether the action would lie in this case, as the services were rendered, not on the credit of the estate, but on that of the brother individually, may be involved in some doubt. Lucas v. Hessen, 17 Abb. N. C. 271. If, however, it were conceded that the plaintiff could sue at law the defendants individually, it does not follow that it is limited to that remedy. The defendant Abraham Sindrack assigned to the plaintiff $80 out of the savings bank deposit. Of course, the plaintiff is all wrong in its claim that the title to this money was in the brother as next of kin, and that its withdrawal by the administrators was, an act in fraud of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. Nevertheless, the instrument was operative as an equitable assignment of the brother\u2019s interest as next of kin in the estate of the deceased, to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s claim. The action was therefore properly brought to establish the assignment, and to enforce the payment by the administrators of the claim out of any distributive share to which Abraham might be entitled upon closing the estate. To such an action the assignor and the administrators who held the fund were both necessary and proper parties. A good cause of action is stated against each, and it is but a single cause of action to establish plaintiff\u2019s interest in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, but as the complaint is drawn singularly inartificially, and possibly misleading, the affirmance should be without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
