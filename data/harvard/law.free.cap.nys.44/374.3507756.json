Welling against the Ivoroyd Manufacturing Company. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff, on two causes of action, defendant appeals, bringing up for review an order of the special term denying leave to defendant to tax costs on judgment in its favor on a third cause of action. Judgment affirmed, and order reversed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">The complaint alleged in its first paragraph the residence of plaintiff, and in the second paragraph the incorporation of defendant. The third paragraph stated the first cause of action for goods sold to defendant by plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the fourth paragraph alleged a second cause of action for salary of plaintiff\u2019s assignor, as president of defendant company, under an agreement, and the fifth paragraph alleged a third cause of action for money paid out by plaintiff\u2019s assignor for defendant\u2019s benefit. The answer admits that, between the dates alleged in the complaint, plaintiff\u2019s assignor \u201csold and delivered to defendant some goods, wares, and merchandise, but denies they were of the value of $3,886\u201d; admits that in October, 1892, it entered into an agreement, as alleged in the fourth paragraph of the complaint, but denies that plaintiff\u2019s assignor performed said agreement on his part; denies any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the other allegations of the complaint; alleges that, during the time mentioned in the complaint, plaintiff\u2019s assignor was a director of defendant; that defendant was at the time of the assignment of the claim to plaintiff insolvent, as plaintiff\u2019s assignor well knew; that the corporation laws of the state of New Jersey, in which defendant was incorporated, prohibit the preferring of creditors by corporations; that the assignment of the claim in suit to plaintiff was for the purpose of obtaining a preference thereon over other creditors, and a judgment would give plaintiff\u2019s assignor an unlawful preference. The answer further alleged as a defense that plaintiff\u2019s assignor was incapable of entering into the contract to act as president of defendant, because not a shareholder, and alleged, as a counterclaim, damages by reason of the failure of plaintiff\u2019s assignor to deliver goods included among those sold, as alleged in the first cause of action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">The opinion of LAWRENCE GO'DICIN, Esq., to whom the case was referred to hear and determine, is as follows:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">The plaintiff is the wife of William M. Welling, and is the assignee of claims against the defendant, a manufacturing corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of New Jersey, which claims arose under the following circumstances: Under date of October 5, 1892, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor made an offer in writing to the defendant company (plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit O), the material parts of which are as follows:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\">\u201cNew York, October 5th, 1892.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-12\">\u201cTo the Ivoroyd Manufacturing Co.\u2014Gentlemen: I hereby offer to sell to you all my machinery, dies, tools, &amp;c., constituting the plant of my factory, now located at No. 251 Center street, in the city of New York, for the sum of fifty thousand dollars, and the performance by you of the other agreements stated below; and I further agree to accept 500 shares of the full-paid capital stock of your company in payment of the said sum of $50,000.

At a meeting of the directors of the corporation held on May 3, 1893, a resolution was adopted providing that \u201cthe stock of manufacturing ma- . terials purchased from the Consolidated Brush &amp; Novelty Company and William M.

M. Welling was present and presided at the meeting at which this offer of resignation was accepted and the contract in pursuance thereof was authorized.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-19\">The plaintiff sues upon three causes of action, all of which grow out of the agreements before set forth, made between the plaintiff\u2019s assignor and the defendant company, of which he was president and director. These contracts were made for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, while he was a director and president of the defendant, and were adopted and ratified at meetings at which he was present and presided. On well-settled principles of law regulating the dealings between agents of corporations and a corporation, the contracts would appear to be invalid, and I do so hold them to be; but I believe a part of these agreements to be saved by the principle that, if the directors or other agents of a corporation supply it with money or other property, under a pretended contract with themselves, and the money or property is properly used in carrying on the company\u2019s business, or in adding to its assets, they are entitled to recover the value of the money or property so supplied and used in an action against the company. \u201cThe obligation of the company to pay, under these circumstances, does not rest upon any actual contract with the directors, but it is a duty which the law imposes, for reasons of justice, to make fair compensation for what has been properly received and applied.\u201d Mor. Priv. Corp. \u00a7 526; Gardner v. Butler, 30 N. J. Eq. 702. \u201cThe general rule is that, if an agreement is legally void and unenforceable by reason of some statutory or common-law prohibition, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>party to the agreement, who has received anything from the other party, and has failed to perform the agreement on his part, must account to the latter for what has been so received. Under these cire\u00famstances, the courts will grant relief, irrespective of the invalid agreement.\u201d Mor. Priv. Oorp. \u00a7 721, and cases cited. I think that these principles apply to the first cause of action, and that there should therefore be a recovery upon this cause of action, if the plaintiff has established the fact that her assignor has supplied the defendant with property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">During the month of March, 1893, and in June of the same year, plaintiff's assignor sent to the defendant certain goods, wares, and merchandise, manufactured and unmanufactured, which he claims was the stock which he had on hand on January 1, 1893. The defendant, in its answer, admitted the delivery to it of goods, but denied their value as pleaded, and endeavored at the trial to introduce evidence to show that the goods delivered were not suitable for the business of the company. This evidence was excluded, as the only question under this part of the contract seemed to be, did the plaintiff deliver to the defendant the stock which he had on hand, and what was its actual cost price? The plaintiff\u2019s assignor testified with particularity in regard to each item, as to its cost price, and the total, as testified to, aggregated $3,056.09. This evidence, in my opinion, has not been successfully rebutted. There was evidence that one of the defendant\u2019s officers took a list of these goods, and it was proved that the goods were delivered at the defendant\u2019s factory at Lansingburgh. Evidence was also introduced tending to show that it was agreed upon between plaintiff\u2019s assignor and the defendant\u2019s officers, or some of them, that the defendant was indebted t\u00f3 the plaintiff for these goods to the amount of about $3,400. I think that the plaintiff has established her right to recover upon this cause of action by a fair preponderance of evidence, and I have decided to give her judgment thereon for the sum of $3,056.09.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">As to the second cause of action, whether regarded as a contract, by which the defendant agreed to employ the plaintiff as president for five years from the 1st day of January, 1893, under the proposition of October 5, 1892, or as a guaranty of a pension of that amount, under the instrument of May 11, 1893, there does not seem to be any principle of law upon which this claim can be maintained. I do not see how the directors of a corporation, whose officers are to be elected annually by the board of directors, who are also to be elected annually, can bind the corporation to employ any one man as president for five years at a fixed salary, by an agreement made at a meeting of the directors at which the beneficiary of this contract presided. I believe the decision of the general term of the First department of this state in the case of Beers v. Insurance Co. to be a controlling and precise authority that such a contract is ultra vires and invalid (Beers v. Insurance Co., 66 Hun, 75, 20 N. Y. Supp. 788; Guild v. Parker, 43 N. J. Law, 430; Gardner v. Butler, 30 N. J. Eq. 702); and 1 think that, under the complaint, and the variance in the proof offered to sustain the second cause of action, the defendant was entitled to avail itself of this defense, whether it had been originally properly pleaded or not (Milbank v. Jones, 141 N. Y. 347, 36 N. E. 388). I have therefore decided to direct judgment for the defendant upon the second cause of action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">Upon the third cause of action, I think that judgment should be directed for the plaintiff for $92. The claim is that moneys were paid out by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to the use of the defendant, and at its request. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor testified that he paid out $92 for taking down the plant, which he sold to defendant. I am of the opinion that there should be a recovery for this amount. As\" to the money which he claims to have expended \u201cfor the running of the company, to get out samples, and for wages of an engineer and bookkeeper,\u201d the evidene\u00e9 of authority for, and the necessity of, these payments is contradictory and unsatisfactory, and I have decided that, upon the evidence as a whole, in regard to this part of this cause of action, the plaintiff has not made out her case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">The defendant, in its answer, set up various defenses to all three of the \u2022causes of action, and pleaded a counterclaim for the damages for failure on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to deliver to the defendant all of his plant, and for delay in delivery until after January 1, 1893. Upon the merits, I am of the \u2022opinion that this counterclaim has not been sustained by the evidence. There was no satisfactory evidence given to show that actual ascertainable pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>damage was caused to the defendant, if any, by the delay in delivery of the goods. There was some evidence to show that a certain brush machine, named on a schedule given by the' plaintiff\u2019s: assignor to the defendant, had never been delivered; but no satisfactory evidence was produced of the value of this brush machine, or the damage caused to the defendant by its nondelivery, and it appeared that the brush machine was not part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor\u2019s plant, and never was at his factory.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-4\">The defense set up to all the causes of action that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest, and that the assignment to the plaintiff by her husband was invalid, and for the purpose of enabling him to gain an unlawful preference in the distribution of the assets of the corporation, I do not think well taken. Even assuming that the assignment was merely colorable, and without consideration, still it was good, in so far as it gave the plaintiff the right to sue (Sheridan v. Mayor, etc., 68 N. Y. 30; Bedford v. Sherman, 68 Hun, 317, 22 N. Y. Supp. 892; Armitage v. Mace, 96 N. Y. 538; Fruhauf v. Bendheim, 127 N. Y. 587, 28 N. E. 417); and, even admitting that the object of the assignment was to enable the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to get a preference over other creditors of the defendant, I do not think that the preference which it is claimed that the plaintiff or her assignor may have obtained by levy of the warrant of attachment is an unlawful preference.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">The decision in the case of Throop v. Lithographing Go., 125 N. Y. 530, 26 N. E. 742, was expressly based upon the statute of the state of New York, and the court says that it reached its conclusion with some hesitation, and three of the judges dissented. Under familiar rules of construction, therefore, this case is only authority upon a state of facts precisely similar to those there presented. It is well settled that the statute relied upon in the Throop Oase has no extraterritorial force (Hill v. Power Go. [Sup.] 18 N. Y. Supp. 813; Goats v. Donnell, 94 N. Y. 168); and there is no such statute in the state of New Jersey, nor do preferences of creditors by corporations seem to be prohibited in the state of New Jersey. In that state a corporation may prefer one creditor over another, and it may secure one' of the directors by mortgage, although the appointment of a receiver is at the time contemplated (Wilkinson v. Bauerle, 41 N. J. Eq. 635, .7 Ati. 514; Whittaker v. Bank [N. J. Oh.] 29 Atl. 203; Bergen v. Fishing Co.,\u201942 N. J. Eq. 397, 8 Atl. 523); so that, assuming everything claimed by the defendant,\u2014such as the insolvency of the defendant, the knowledge of its insolvency on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and the object of his assignment to his wife, and the result of that assignment, and the levying of the warrant of attachment,\u2014still I cannot hold that the preference which the plaintiff thus obtained by the attachment is an unlawful one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">Upon the whole case, therefore, I direct judgment for the plaintiff upon the first cause of action for the sum of $3,056.09, judgment for the defendant upon the second cause of action, judgment for the plaintiff for $92 upon the-third cause of action, and judgment for the plaintiff upon the counterclaim.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b396-7\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

Welling, sued the defendant on three causes of action,\u2014the first for goods sold and delivered, the second for salary of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor as president of the defendant, and the third for moneys expended for the defendant\u2019s benefit. The referee reported in favor of the plaintiff on the first cause of action, and for part of the claim the subject of the third cause of action, and for the defendant on the second cause of action. The defendant moved for leave to tax a bill of costs on its recovery on the second cause of action. This application was denied. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff on the report of the referee, with costs. From that judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ment this appeal is taken, and the defendant gave notice of its intention to review the order denying it a bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The learned referee wrote an elaborate opinion upon his decision of the case. It deals so fully with the questions of fact involved that it is unnecessary to review those questions further than to answer some criticisms on his decision made by the appellant. We think the answer of the defendant did not put in issue the sale and delivery of the goods claimed to have been sold by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to the defendant. The answer simply put in issue the value of the goods. The learned referee held that the written contracts under which these sales were made, and also the services rendered by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and the subject of the claim in the second cause of action, were invalid, on account of the relation the plaintiff\u2019s assignor bore to the defendant,\u2014that of director. He held, however, that the defendant, having received and appropriated the goods sold, was liable for their value, apart from, the validity of the written contract. The only evidence of the value of the goods sold, which were partly manufactured, arid partly in process of manufacture, or raw stock, was their cost price. The contract belAveen the parties provided that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor should be paid for them at such price. In his opinion the referee seems to have regarded this provision as controlling; but, as he had held i hat contract void, we do not see how the provision as to the price to be paid could have any effect. The plaintiff was only entitled to recover the fair and reasonable value of the goods. But the cost of the goods was undoubtedly some evidence of their value; in fact, in this case it was the only evidence offered on either side, and it is sufficient to uphold the finding of the referee in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">No error was committed in refusing to allow the defendant to show that the goods were of less value to it than their reasonable market value. The argument of the appellant that it-should have been allowed to prove that the goods were not suitable for defendant\u2019s purposes, or that it did not require them, is apart from any question raised by the pleadings. It did not deny that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor sold the goods, and it did not allege any rejection. The claim that the defendant should have been allowed its counterclaim to the extent of $5,000, the value of the brush machine, Avhich it is claimed the plaintiff\u2019s assignor agreed to sell to it, is not well founded. It was not part of the plant in Welling\u2019s factory, in Center street, which he had agreed to sell to the defendant, but Avas then at Brooklyn, in the process of construction. The appellant asserts that it was included in the schedule part of the bill of sale subsequently executed by Welling to the defendant. I can find no evidence of this fact in the case. But, assuming it to be the fact, by that bill of sale the title passed to the defendant. There is no evidence that Welling ever converted it, or refused to deliver it. We can therefore see no ground on which this set-off or counterclaim can be sustained, though Ave differ from the referee in his opinion that the proof of the cost of the machine was not sufficient evidence to justify a finding of its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s assignor was a director of the defendant, a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>corporation, organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey. Shortly before the commencement of the action, he transferred to the plaintiff his claims against the defendant. The defendant, in its answer, set forth the relation the plaintiff\u2019s assignor bore to the defendant; the assignment to the plaintiff; alleged that at the time the defendant was insolvent, and unable to pay its debts; and that the assignment was made to the plaintiff for the benefit of the assignor, with intent to get a preference in the payment of his claims over those of other creditors of the corporation. The referee disposed of this defense on the ground that the law of this state prohibiting transfers by corporations in contemplation of insolvency did not apply to a New Jersey corporation, and that by the laws of New Jersey preferential transfers were not illegal. We are inclined to the opinion that the referee erred in his determination of the law of the state of New Jersey on this subject. The case of Montgomery v. Phillips, 53 N. J. Eq. 203, 31 Atl. 622, a later decision than any cited by the referee, holds that a director of an insolvent corporation cannot obtain, by the action of the board of directors, a preference over other creditors of the corporation. But, however this may be, and, also, however the question may be determined whether the laws of this state affect the disposition of property of insolvent foreign corporations doing business within this state, we think that the question does not properly arise as a defense to the action. In Throop v. Lithographing Co., 125 N. Y. 530, 26 N. E. 742, the question arose on a motion to vacate an attachment, which the plaintiff had obtained in the action. It was there held that the director of a domestic corporation could not, by attachment, obtain a preference in the payment of his claim. But in'that case the objection was raised by a motion to vacate the attachment, which was granted. The only other case on the subject of importance is that of Kingsley v. Bank, 31 Hun, 329, the reasoning of which is referred to with approval by the court of appeals in the Throop Case. In the Kingsley Case a director had recovered judgment against the insolvent corporation, and, under an execution issued on the judgment, levied on the property of the corporation. The action was brought by the receiver of the corporation to set aside the judgment and execution, as creating ah illegal preference. The court held that the director had the right to bring the action, that there was no statutory restraint upon it, and that it might be necessary and proper, so as to determine the existence, validity, or extent of the claim of the director against the company. But it was held that he had no right to obtain a preference by the execution levy on the assets of the corporation. In accordance with this determination, the judgment was allowed to stand, but the execution and levy under it were set aside. Therefore, Kingsley v. Bank is authority that the facts pleaded on this subject by the defendant do not constitute a defense to the cause of action, but that relief against an unlawful preference must be obtained in another way. Here the plaintiff obtained an attachment, and we may assume has levied execution on her judgment uuon the attached property. If the proceedings taken by the plaintiff to obtain satisfaction of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>claim have resulted in an unlawful preference in favor of a director or officer of the corporation against other creditors, the defendant may obtain relief by a motion to vacate her attachment, and to set aside the execution, or the receiver of the corporation may maintain an action to set aside such attachment and execution; but we think that the facts shown do not constitute a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We are of opinion that the defendant was improperly denied its costs. As to the second cause of action, it obtained, not a nonsuit, but an affirmative finding in its favor that \u201cjudgment should be entered for the defendant upon the second cause of action set forth in the complaint,\u201d upon the ground that \u201cthe contract upon which said cause of action is based is invalid.\u201d This effectively disposed of that cause of action, l\u00edo new suit upon it can ever be brought. It is, therefore, precisely such a case as is stated in the opinion of Judge O\u2019Brien in Burns v. Railroad Co., 135 N. Y. 268, 31 N. E. 1080, entitles the defendant to his costs, within the -provisions of the Code. In Moosbrugger v. Kaufman, 7 App. Div. 380, 40 N. Y. Supp. 213, the appellate division in the Fourth department, by a vote of three to two, in a case substantially the same as that now before us, held that the defendant was not entitled to costs. We look upon this decision as opposed to the doctrine of the Burns Case; and, Avhile it may be that the statement of the court of appeals on this question was obiter, and not necessary to the determination of the question before it, it certainly was related to the subject-matter, and fairly proceeded from its discussion. It should, therefore, be regarded as controlling authority. The case of Dougherty v. Insurance Co., 3 App. Div. 317, 38 N. Y. Supp. 258, is not in point. There there was not a decision of the second cause of action in favor of the defendant. On the contrary, the plaintiff on that cause of action recovered three dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, except that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs; and that such costs and the costs of the action as they may be taxed by the defendant be applied upon the judgment hereby affirmed, and such judgment reduced accordingly. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
