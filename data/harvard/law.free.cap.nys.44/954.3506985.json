Reversed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b972-11\">The complaint alleges that the appellant and others were unlawfully associated in a certain illegal business of selling and offering to sell what are commonly called \u201clottery policies,\u201d \u201cand writings, papers, and documents in the nature of bets, wagers, and insurance upon the drawing and drawn numbers of certain public and private lotteries, and indorsing and using books and other documents for the purpose of enabling others to sell such lottery policies, writings, papers, and documents, at the city of Buffalo, N. Y.\u201d It also alleges that \u201cthe plaintiff, at Buffalo, N. Y., paid and delivered to the defendants, and the defendants then and there wrongfully and unlawfully received from the plaintiff, various large sums of money in consideration of. certain agreements made by the defendants from time to time to repay to this plaintiff certain other sums of money if certain numbers in certain illegal lotteries known as the \u2018Kentucky,\u2019 \u2018Frankfort,\u2019 and \u2018Henry\u2019 lotteries, and also known as a \u2018policy game,\u2019 should prove fortunate or unfortunate, or if certain numbers should be drawn in a particular order or otherwise, contrary to the provisions of the Revised Statutes relating to \u2018Raffling and Lotteries\u2019; which sums of money so paid and delivered by plaintiff, and wrongfully and unlawfully received by the defendants, amount in the aggregate to four thousand dollars.\u201d When the order of arrest was applied for, an affidavit made by the plaintiff and an affidavit made by Graves were presented, in which were more particularly described the business carried on by the defendants. In the order of arrest it is recited that it was made to appear \u201cthat a sufficient cause of action exists in favor of the above-named plaintiff against the above-named defendants for a penalty, being double the amount of money paid by plaintiff to defendants on the purchase of certain tickets, shares, and interests in certain illegal lotteries, and unlawfully received by defendants, contrary to the provisions of article 4, c. 20, of the Revised Statutes, relating to \u2018Raffling and Lotteries.\u2019 \u201d</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b972-12\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

St. (9th Ed.) pp. 1765,1766.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Apparently this action was brought to recover money which the plaintiff had parted with, seeking to avail himself of the provisions of the sections of the law to which we have referred. Hathaway v. Johnson, 55 N. Y. 93; Stockwell v. U. S., 13 Wall. 531. In Meech v. Stoner, 19 N. Y. 26, it was held that the right to recover money or property lost in gaming in virtue of the statutes might be assigned, and that an assignee might maintain an action. In Bones v. Booth, 2 W. Bl. 1226, it was held that \u201can action brought by the loser to recover back money lost at play is remedial, and not penal, and new trial may be had therein.\u201d In that case Nares, J., said: \u201cThe statute is remedial where the action is brought by the party injured, but penal where brought by a common informer.\u201d That case is referred to with approval in Meech v. Stoner, supra. In chapter 8 of the Penal Code, \u00a7 323 et seq., provision is made against lotteries, drawing lottery tickets, selling lottery tickets, advertising lotteries, offering property for disposal dependent upon the drawing of any lottery, and against other practices of a similar nature; and violations of the sections are declared to be a misdemeanor, and specific penalties are imposed for violations of those sections. This action was not brought to recover any penalty named in any of those sections. U. S. v. Reid, 4 Civ. Proc. R. 1. It is contended in behalf of the plaintiff' that, because the statute authorizes the recovery of the sum paid or lost, and \u201cdouble the sum of money and double the value of any goods and things in action which he may have paid or delivered in consideration of such purchase, with double costs of suit,\u201d the action is an action to r\u00e9cover a penalty. We think the contention cannot be sustained. In Paper Co. v. White, 58 How. Prac. 174, it was said that, \u201cto subject a party to arrest, the cause of action must be a fine or penalty, and not something of a penal character.\u201d Where a party brings an action to recover for slander, he may be entitled to recover $50 damages in compensation for injuries sustained, and he may, in addition to that, be entitled to recover $100 punitive damages; yet in no sense can the action be said to be one to recover a penalty, as the word \u201cpenalty\u201d is used in section 549, subd. 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure. It has been suggested that the order of arrest may be sustained under subdivision 2 of section 549 of the Code of 'Civil Procedure. The contrary seems to have been held in Tompkins v. Smith, 62 How. Prac. 499, and that case was affirmed in 89 N. Y. 602. No case is cited, nor, after some considerable examination, has any been found, which sustains an order of arrest in an action of the character set out in the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>in- this action. The foregoing views lead to the conclusion that the order of the special term should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate the order of arrest granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">ADAMS and WARD, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b974-6\">FOLLETT, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AN2\">Title to property cannot be acquired through a fraud, much less through a crime. Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506, 22 N. E. 188. The act by which the appellant acquired the plaintiff\u2019s money was a crime (Pen. Code, tit. 10, c. 8), and money so acquired is wrongfully taken and wrongfully detained, and an order of arrest is authorized by subdivision 2 of section 549 of the Code of Civil Procedure in such cases. This view of the question was not considered in Tompkins v. Smith, 48 N. Y. Super. Ct. 113, 62 How. Prac. 499, affirmed 89 N. Y. 602, by a divided court, and without an opinion. Again, a motion to vacate an order of arrest cannot be made until the defendant has been arrested. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 567; Kern v. Rackow, 44 How. Prac. 443; Gedney v. Haas, 50 How. Prac. 310; Van Tassel v. Marks, 4 N. Y. Law Bul. 19. Martin v. Gross (Super. N. Y.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 337, not followed. The case last cited was decided on the ground that section 568 of the Code of 'Civil Procedure provides that a motion to vacate an order of arrest \u201cmay be founded only upon the papers upon which the order was granted,\u201d and that the provision of section 567 that the motion can be made only after arrest conflicts with section 568. BTad the order been executed, the return of the sheriff would show the fact, and the affidavit of the fact of arrest would be quite unnecessary. Besides, had the defendant moved on the original papers, accompanied by his affidavit showing that he had been arrested, the plaintiff could not have supported the arrest by new affidavits showing grounds therefor; at most he could be permitted only to deny that the defendant had been arrested. It not appearing that the order of arrest, the papers on which it was granted, or the summons has been served on the defendant, the motion to vacate the order was prematurely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The order of the special term denying the motion to vacate the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">GREEN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
