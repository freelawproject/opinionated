When a party seeks for the postponement of a trial upon the ground of the absence of a material witness, it must appear by competent evidence that such person has knowledge of material facts. His mere saying so, sworn to by some other person, is not sufficient or competent proof to establish the claim that the statement made by the alleged witness is true. It must satisfactorily appear that his statement is true, as well as material. There is no such proof contained in the record submitted to us, and the trial justice was right in his refusal to grant an adjournment. The defendant also failed to establish by competent proof that his counsel was actually engaged when this inquest was taken. In fact, the record shows that they were not actually engaged, but apparently hoped to be, so as to be able to secure the adjournment requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The order appealed from therefore is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
