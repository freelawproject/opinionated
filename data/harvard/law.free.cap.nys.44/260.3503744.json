Reversed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint is for money loaned, and demands judgment for $4,580, with interest from the 3d of June, 1896. The defendant, in his answer, interposed a general denial, and also set up a counterclaim for moneys paid by the defendant to the plaintiff to the amount .of $455. The plaintiff, by reply, denied the facts alleged as a counterclaim in defendant\u2019s answer. The plaintiff \u25a0caused the action to be placed on the short-cause calendar at the trial term of this court held in October, 1896, and the c\u00e1se was thereafter tried as a short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>cause, and was concluded within one hour. The jury found a verdict in favoro\u00ed the plaintiff for $3,516.50. Upon the coming in of the jury, and the rendition of the verdict, the court granted the plaintiff an extra allowance of 5 per cent, of the recovery. The defendant\u2019s attorney appears to have been absent when the verdict was rendered, and the motion for an extra allowance was made in-his absence. Thereafter, at a special term held by the same justice who presided at the trial term, a motion was made by the defendant to vacate the order granting the plaintiff an extra allowance. That motion was denied, and from-the order denying the same this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b279-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

What was said by the court in Duncan v. De Witt, 7 Hun, 184, is still the law in relation to allowances of costs in difficult and extraordinary cases, and there is no need of reiterating what was there-said. The expenses of litigation have become a great burden upon those compelled to go into courts of justice to settle their controversies, and the courts should be careful not to add to those burdens except for good and sufficient reasons. In this case the record does not disclose anything either difficult or extraordinary. It is a plain every-day lawsuit. The only thing that is exceptional in it is the very brief time it' took to try it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
