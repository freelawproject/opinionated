The writ operated to restrain the acting surrogate from enforcing the decree providing for the removal of the administrators upon an ex parte application, and the appointment of a particular person in their stead. We have already considered the force and effect of this decree, and reached the conclusion that in this respect the same was void. In re Engelbrecht (not yet officially reported) 44 N. Y. Supp. 551. It is well settled that a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent a judicial tribunal from exercising power over matters not within its cognizance or exceeding its jurisdiction in matters of which it may take cognizance. People v. Nichols, 79 N. Y. 582; Quimbo Appo v. People, 20 N. Y. 531; Thomson v. Tracy, 60 N. Y. 31. As the contemplated action was the enforcement of a void decree, it was proper that the writ should issue in restraint of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">The order should therefore be affirmed, with ,$10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
