Brian Draper (Draper), who was sixteen years-old at the time of Stoddart\u2019s murder, and Torey Adamcik (Adamcik), who was also a juvenile, were arrested and charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, tried as adults, and convicted during separate trials. Draper was sentenced to a term of fixed life imprisonment for the murder charge and a life sentence with thirty years fixed for the conspiracy charge. Draper now appeals, raising seven issues. He argues that a) the jury instructions for both murder and conspiracy relieved the State of proving all elements of the crimes and violated his right to due process of law; b) Draper\u2019s fourth police interview should have been suppressed as his parents were not present at the interview; c) the jury instructions and the district court\u2019s failure to suppress the interview, even if individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ually harmless, cumulatively constitute reversible error; d) the sentences should be vacated because the investigator\u2019s presentence report was biased; e) Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence for murder violated the Idaho and U.S. Constitutions\u2019 prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment; f) the district court\u2019s sentences constituted an abuse of discretion; and g) the district court\u2019s denial of Draper\u2019s motion under Idaho Criminal Rule 35 to modify his sentences constituted an abuse of discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">A. Events Surrounding Stoddart\u2019s Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Around August 31, 2006, eighteen-year-old Joe Lucero received a call from Torey Adameik asking if he would buy some knives for him. Together Adamcik and Lucero went with Draper to a local pawn shop to buy the knives. On the way, they stopped at an ATM so that Draper could withdraw money and, of the $45 paid for the knives, Draper provided $40. Adamcik pointed out one knife and Draper selected three others.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Draper and Adamcik had also begun videotaping snippets of themselves talking about killing. This videotape was later recovered with other evidence used in the murder and, at trial, Draper\u2019s counsel argued that this tape was part of a horror movie that Draper and Adamcik were making. Portions of the transcript from the video include the following, from the night before Stoddart\u2019s murder:</p>\n<p id=\"A_U\">1. <em>September 21, 2006 at 8:05:23 PM </em>\"Adamcik and Draper are in car, Adamcik is driving and Draper is filming from the passenger seat*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">Draper: We\u2019re going for a high death count</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">Adamcik: Plus, we\u2019re not going not to get caught Bryan, if we\u2019re going for guns, we\u2019re just gonna end it.

At trial, one of the detectives testified that he believed this note to have been written by Adamcik. The portion of the note that was not burned reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A82\">is home alone stop</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ4\">out the house</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">runs into Torey</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axg\">We murder Cassie</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">e is home alone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">ouse....

Beckham stated that he and Stoddart had invited Adamcik to the Whispering Cliffs residence that evening to \u201chang out.\u201d Adamcik and Draper arrived at the Whispering Cliffs residence at approximately 6:30 or 7:00 pm. After spending approximately two hours at the Whispering Cliffs residence, Draper informed Stoddart and Beckham that he needed to leave and shortly thereafter Draper and Adamcik departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-31\">A further section of the videotape appears to have been recorded at this time:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-32\">7. <em>September 22, 2006 at 9:53:20 PM </em>*It is dark and Draper and Adamcik are sitting in a car.*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-33\">Draper: We\u2019re here in his car.

Now we just got to wait and um ... yep, we\u2019re, we\u2019re really nervous right now but, you know, we\u2019re ready.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Adamcik: We\u2019re listening to the greatest rock band ever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">Draper: We\u2019ve waited for this for a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">Adamcik: Pink Floyd.

At some point after Beckham left, Stoddart was stabbed to death. The autopsy revealed that she had been stabbed approximately thirty times and twelve of the wounds were considered \u201cpotentially fatal.\u201d A second examination of the body concluded that two different knives had been used. One knife, with a serrated blade, had inflicted eleven of the twelve potentially fatal wounds. A second, single-bladed and non-serrated knife inflicted one potentially fatal wound and other non-fatal wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">A portion of the videotape appears to have been recorded just after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">8. <em>September 22, 2006 at 11:31:56 PM </em>* Adamcik and Draper are in a car driving.*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">Draper: \u2014 just killed Cassie!

They called the police who began their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">B. The Police Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b617-27\">Police officers contacted Draper and Adamcik that evening after speaking with Beckham. Draper\u2019s first interview was not recorded and Draper was not in custody at that point. Draper said that he and Adamcik had gone to see a movie and, while it was too late to see the movie they had originally intended to see they went to a different movie, <em>Pulse. </em>When asked about the movie, Draper was unable to explain the plot. Draper wrote out a description of what he said occurred during that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-28\">On Tuesday evening, September 26, 2006, the officers conducted Draper\u2019s second interview. Draper\u2019s parents were present but did not go into the interview. Draper was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights before the interview began. Draper initially maintained that he and Adamcik had gone to the movie but, after one of the officers told him that he did not believe that he had gone to the movies, Draper said that he and Adamcik had \u201cgone through\u201d ears and had said they went to a movie to hide that. When he was told that his car burglary story was not convincing, Draper insisted that it was the truth. After the interview, Draper left with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-29\">After the second interview, a detective went to the Draper residence and, with the consent of Draper and his parents, searched Draper\u2019s bedroom for gloves and other items related to Stoddart\u2019s murder. The detectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>found a knife sheath which Draper said belonged to a friend and that he did not know where the knife was but that he thought his friend had it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Draper\u2019s third interview occurred on Wednesday, September 27, 2006. Draper was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and again consented to speak. Draper\u2019s parents were present for this interview. At this interview, Draper admitted that he and Adamcik unlocked.a door at the Whispering Cliffs residence so that they could return to scare Stoddart and Beckham. He also stated that they wore masks, black clothing, and gloves and carried knives with them. Draper stated that after Beckham left, they went upstairs and Adamcik stabbed Stoddart. Draper said that he thought that it was a joke to scare him and only later realized that Stoddart was actually being stabbed. Draper denied that he had ever touched or stabbed Stoddart. Draper also stated that he had talked to Adamcik earlier that day and that Adamcik had threatened to kill him if he told the authorities the truth. Draper also agreed to show the officers where he and Adamcik had attempted to dispose of items used in Stoddart\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Draper went with several detectives and his father to the Black Rock Canyon area and directed the detectives to a site where evidence from the murder was buried. The evidence located included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">E Stick matches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">E A pair of black boots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">E A pair of blue rubber gloves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">E A pair of Athletics Works brand fingerless gloves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">E A melted brown hydrogen peroxide bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">E A multi-colored mask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">E A large dagger-type knife with a sheath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">E A silver and black-handled knife with a signature of \u201cSloan\u201d written on the inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">E A small dagger-type knife with a sheath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">EA Sony videotape. This is the videotape that was later repaired and straightened in order to make it playable and transcribed as above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">E A black-handled serrated folding knife. Later DNA testing revealed that Stoddart\u2019s blood was present on this knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">EA partly burned piece of paper with wilting in pencil. This is the note transcribed above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">EA red and white mask. Later DNA testing revealed a partial DNA profile of Adamcik on the mask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-19\">E A single black glove. Later DNA testing revealed a partial DNA profile from an unknown male.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-20\">EA pair of partially burned black Puma brand gloves. Later DNA testing revealed that Stoddart\u2019s blood had soaked into these gloves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-21\">E A blue plastic garbage bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-22\">EA partially burned black long-sleeved Haggar brand dress shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-23\">E A Calvin Klein black dress shirt. Later DNA testing revealed that Stoddart\u2019s blood was present on the shirt cuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-24\">E A white and grey sock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-25\">E A small piece of black cord.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-26\">At this point Draper was arrested and spent the night of September 27-28 in the Bannock County jail. Shortly after noon on Thursday, September 28, Draper was interviewed for a fourth time. Although the police attempted to contact Draper\u2019s parents they were unable to do so. Draper, after again being given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and being told that he could have his parents present, agreed to go ahead with the interview. Draper initially repeated that Adamcik was the only person who stabbed Stoddart. After one of the officers asked whether Draper stabbed Stoddart to keep Adamcik from turning on him, Draper nodded. Draper then admitted to stabbing Stoddart four times in the leg and chest. Draper said that Adamcik had told him \u201cyou need to stab her, you need to stab her.\u201d After stabbing Stoddart in the leg, Draper stated that Adamcik told him \u201cit\u2019s not going to work, she has to die.\u201d Shortly after, at about thirteen minutes into the interview, Draper asked if he could see his parents and the officers ended the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>C. Draper\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Draper and Adameik were each charged with one count of murder in the first degree and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree. They each moved to sever the trials and the district court granted the motions. Draper also filed a motion to suppress his fourth interview, arguing that, because his parents were not present, he had not voluntarily consented to the interview. The district court denied this motion, finding that, in light of the totality of the circumstances, Draper voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and that his parents had not unequivocally invoked Draper\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After trial by jury, Draper was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree. The jury instructions mirrored the Idaho Criminal Jury Instructions and did not include an instruction on aiding and abetting, nor did they include a definition of willfulness. Draper\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">D. Draper\u2019s Sentencing and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the district court ordered a presentence investigation (PSI), including a psychological evaluation. The district court\u2019s order allowed Draper\u2019s parents to sit in on the investigator\u2019s presentence interview with Draper. The investigator then wrote to the district court, asking that Draper\u2019s parents not be allowed to sit in on the interview, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">I question whether [Draper] can be totally honest regarding relationships (to include sexual relationships) or even substance abuse issues with a family member present. As the Court is aware, any areas of deception could reflect poorly on Mr. Draper if the truth should come out. I am also concerned the parents, in an effort to protect their son or themselves, will interfere with my interview if they do not like the direct questions regarding the crime or issues related to any abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">As a result, the district court ruled that Draper\u2019s parents could not attend his presentence interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">Before sentencing, Draper objected to the contents of the PSI, arguing that the investigator was biased and that the PSI did not conform to the dictates of Idaho Criminal Rule 32, which outlines the form and content of presentence investigations. The district court denied this motion, finding that, although not perfect, the PSI complied with Rule 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">Before pronouncing sentence, the district judge discussed the brutal nature of the crime and stated that he was convinced that if Draper \u201cwere released, that you would kill again. I\u2019m convinced of that beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Based on these conclusions, the district court sentenced Draper to a fixed life sentence for his first degree murder conviction and an indeterminate life sentence, with thirty years fixed, for conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Draper filed a motion under I.C.R. 35 for correction of his sentence. The motion included submissions from Draper\u2019s parents, from Draper, and from the Department of Correction, detailing his attempts to rehabilitate himself. The district court viewed this as a motion for leniency under I.C.R. 35 and found that the submissions did not change the court\u2019s initial view that the sentences imposed were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Draper timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A-3\">A. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">Draper makes two arguments that the jury instructions in his case constituted reversible error. He argues that the failure to define \u201cwillfulness\u201d in the murder instruction was error, as was the inclusion of \u201cpurpose\u201d as one of the overt acts in the elements of conspiracy. He notes that counsel failed to raise these objections at trial but argues that the claimed errors in the jury instructions constitute fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A25\">\u201cWhether jury instructions fairly and adequately present the issues and state the applicable law is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>State v. Humpherys, </em>134 Idaho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>657, 659, 8 P.3d 652, 654 (2000). Therefore, the correctness of a jury instruction depends on whether there is evidence at trial to support the instruction. <em>Craig Johnson Constr., L.L.C. v. Floyd Town Architects, P.A., </em>142 Idaho 797, 800, 134 P.3d 648, 651 (2006). We look at the jury instructions as a whole, not individually, to determine whether the jury was properly and adequately instructed. <em>Obendorf v. Terra Hug Spray Co., </em>145 Idaho 892, 896, 188 P.3d 834, 838 (2008). An erroneous instruction will not constitute reversible error unless the instructions as a whole misled the jury or prejudiced a party. <em>Kuhn v. Proctor, </em>141 Idaho 459, 462, 111 P.3d 144, 147 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>State v. Shackelford, </em>150 Idaho 355, 373-74, 247 P.3d 582, 600-01 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">An error generally is not reviewable if raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Sheahan, </em>139 Idaho 267, 277, 77 P.3d 956, 966 (2003). Moreover, Idaho Criminal Rule 30(b) provides that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving of or failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the instruction to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">However, this Court traditionally has reviewed \u201cfundamental\u201d errors on appeal, even when no objection was raised at trial. <em>State v. Haggard, </em>94 Idaho 249, 486 P.2d 260 (1971). An error is fundamental when it \u201cso profoundly distorts the trial that it produces manifest injustice and deprives the accused of his fundamental right to due process.\u201d <em>State v. Lavy, </em>121 Idaho 842, 844, 828 P.2d 871, 873 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>State v. Anderson, </em>144 Idaho 743, 748, 170 P.3d 886, 891 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">2. Fundamental Error</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">For both the murder and conspiracy instructions, the State argues that because Draper did not object to the instructions at trial (indeed, with regard to the murder instruction, Draper\u2019s counsel did not submit a definition of willfulness in his proposed jury instructions), these assignments of error are not reviewable for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">With regard to the murder instruction, the State argues that because Draper has failed to allege any actual error, Draper\u2019s argument cannot rise to the level of fundamental error. Similarly, with regard to the instruction for conspiracy, the State argues that the jury could have only understood the instruction correctly. These arguments avoid the issue. Draper\u2019s argument is that the jury instructions relieved the State of its duty to prove all elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. If these arguments are correct, Draper has been denied his right to due process and those errors would rise to the level of fundamental error. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that in criminal trials \u2018the State must prove every element of the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to give effect to that requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson, </em>144 Idaho at 749, 170 P.3d at 892 (quoting <em>Middleton v. McNeil, </em>541 U.S. 433, 437, 124 S.Ct. 1830, 1832-33, 158 L.Ed.2d 701, 707 (2004)). Here, if the instruction omitted a contested element of the crime, it would have violated Draper\u2019s due process rights and would consequently rise to the level of fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">3. Murder Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Draper argues that the jury instructions for murder were misleading. He points to the language in Instruction 13 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">In order for the Defendant to be guilty of First Degree Murder, the State must prove that the murder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">was willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, [sic] Premeditation means to consider beforehand whether to kill or not to kill, and then to decide to kill. There does not have to be any appreciable period of time during which the decision to kill was considered, as long as it was reflected upon before the decision was made. A mere unconsidered and rash impulse, even though it includes an intent to kill, is not premeditation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">Draper ai\u2019gues that by failing to define willfulness, the court relieved the State of its burden of proving one of the elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Draper cites <em>State v. Aragon, </em>107 Idaho 358, 363, 690 P.2d 293, 298 (1984), for the proposition that \u201c[mjalice, the intent to act feloniously, [is] properly distinguished from willfulness, the intent to take life____\u201d He also notes that willfulness has a variety of legal meanings, including, in the context of contempt, \u201c\u2018an indifferent disregard of duty\u2019 or \u2018a remissness and failure in performance of a dutjf but not a \u2018deliberately and maliciously planned dereliction of duty.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Weick, </em>142 Idaho 275, 281, 127 P.3d 178, 184 (2005). Because of these different meanings, including meanings that do not include a specific intent requirement, he argues that the failure to provide a definition of willfulness relieved the State of proving every element of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Draper also points to the statutory requirement that there must have been \u201ca union, or joint operation, of act and intent----\u201d I.C. \u00a7 18-114. He argues that a reasonable jury could have found that Draper\u2019s intent to kill, as included in the definition of premeditation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not present when he stabbed Stoddart as, he argues, he only stabbed her after Adamcik stabbed her and he did so only at Adamcik\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We reject these arguments. First, because the premeditation is only referable to Stoddart\u2019s murder (i.e. not some intent to kill that was not manifested), the jury evidently found an intent to commit the murder Draper was charged with. Second, \u201c[tjerms which are of common usage and are sufficiently generally understood need not be further defined when instructing the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Zichko, </em>129 Idaho 259, 264, 923 P.2d 966, 971 (1996) (citing <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>92 Idaho 152, 156, 438 P.2d 897, 901 (1968)). The jury was instructed that, in order to issue a guilty verdict on the first degree murder charge, the murder had to be a \u201cwillful, deliberate, <em>and </em>premeditated killing.\u201d Both willful and deliberate are included. The common understandings of willful and deliberate include an intention to commit the particular act. <em>See, e.g., Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary </em>1433 (11th ed. 2003) (\u201cWillful ... 2: done deliberately: Intentional.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, it did not constitute reversible error to omit that definition. When compared with the situation in <em>Aragon, </em>the difference is evident. There, the distinction was between malice and willfulness and, unlike malice, which has a specific legal definition, the common definition of willfulness is applicable. Here, Draper is attempting to insert legal definitions where the common definition is the appropriate one. Third, as noted above, Draper failed to request any definition of willfulness. His requested jury instructions included a definition of premeditation and omitted any definition of willfulness, as did the instructions given to the jury. \u201cAppellant cannot assert as error on appeal the giving of an instruction which he himself requested.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>107 Idaho at 363, 690 P.2d at 298 (citing <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965); <em>Daellenbach v. State, </em>562 P.2d 679 (Wyo.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We find that the jury was instructed to and did find that Draper decided to kill Stoddart, had the actual intent to kill her, and did, in fact, kill Stoddart.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">4. Conspiracy Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Draper\u2019s jury instructions for conspiracy, as read to the jury and as included in the record as the original instructions, changed the seventh element of the instruction to be a fifth \u201covert act.\u201d The instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-16\">In order for the defendant to be guilty of Conspiracy, the State must prove each of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-17\">1. On or between the 22nd and 23rd days of September, 2006</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-18\">2. in the state of Idaho</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-19\">3. the defendant Brian Lee Draper and Torey Michael Adamcik agreed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>4. to commit the crime of MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">5. the defendant intended that the crime would be committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">6. one of the parties to the agreement performed at least one of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">1. On or about the 29th and/or 30th days of August, 2006, BRIAN LEE DRAPER, did purchase and/or receive knives that were used in the commission of the murder of Cassie Stoddai\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">2. On or about the 21st and/or 22nd days of September, 2006, BRIAN LEE DRAPER, did travel to the residence located at 11372 Whispering Cliffs, Pocatello, Bannock County, Idaho, with Torey Michael Adamcik to commit the murder of Cassie Stoddai\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">3. On or about the 22nd and/or 23rd days of September, 2006, BRIAN LEE DRAPER did retrieve from a vehicle a change of clothes, mask, and murder weapons which were used in the commission of the murder of Cassie Stoddart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">4. On or about the 22nd and/or 23rd days of September, 2006, BRIAN LEE DRAPER did lie in wait in the downstairs portion of the residence located at 11372 Whispering Cliffs, Pocatello, Bannock County, Idaho, in preparation of committing the murder of Cassie Stoddart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such act was done for the purpose of carrying out the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">If each of the above has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant guilty. If any of the above has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">In reviewing jury instructions, the Court has noted that an \u201cinstruction complained of must be read and construed with the other instructions given.\u201d <em>Bushong v. Kamiah Grain Inc., </em>96 Idaho 659, 661, 534 P.2d 1099, 1101 (1975). Likewise,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">\u201c[w]here the jury instructions, taken as a whole, correctly state the law and are not inconsistent, but may be reasonably and fairly harmonized, it will be assumed that the jury gave due consideration to the whole charge contained in all the instructions and was not mislead by any isolated portion thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-16\"><em>State v. Enno, </em>119 Idaho 392, 405, 807 P.2d 610, 623 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">The State is correct that the \u201cdone for the purpose\u201d instruction does not constitute an act. However, it is impossible to say whether a reasonable jury would have determined that it was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the four preceding overt acts was committed for the purpose of furthering the agreement to commit first degree murder. When the instruction states that \u201cone of the parties to the agreement performed at least one of the following acts\u201d and then presents a list, the obvious message was that the jury was only required to find one item on the list to be true beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict Draper of conspiracy. The failure to clearly require the jury to find that an overt act was committed for the purpose of advancing the conspiracy relieved the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">A jury need not consider instructions that are mere surplusage. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>125 Idaho 546, 559-60, 873 P.2d 800, 813-14 (1993). If the jurors found one of the first four items on the list to be true, i.e., that Draper purchased knives, traveled to the Whispering Cliffs residence to commit murder, retrieved clothing, a mask and murder weapons from the vehicle, or lay in wait downstairs in preparation for the murder, they may have viewed the \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 language as surplusage, thus eliminating the requirement that the State prove one element of the crime. For example, the jury could easily have found that Draper purchased and/or received the knives used in Stoddart\u2019s murder, but stopped there without considering whether this was for the purpose of furthering the agreement with Adamcik to murder Stoddart.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Nor can we say with any certainty that instruction 17-A, stating that Draper \u201cis not guilty of Conspiracy if the defendant in good faith withdrew by informing another party to the conspiracy of the defendant\u2019s withdrawal before any party performed an act for the purpose of carrying out the agreement,\u201d necessarily conveyed to the jurors that they were required to find that the overt act was done to further the conspiracy. A reasonable juror might have viewed 17-A as a defense, separate and distinct from the elements of the conspiracy charge. Draper did not highlight withdrawal as a defense to the conspiracy charge. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that a reasonable jury would have understood that the withdrawal instruction required them to find the \u201cfor the puipose of\u2019 element to be true beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict Draper of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Three other considerations bear note here. First, there is the fact that the jury instructions were renumbered by hand. When a hand-written correction exists, the logical inference is that it was, in fact, a correction. That is, the prior version was incorrect and the revision was intended to correct the error. That indicates that the \u201cfor the purpose\u201d language was merely one of the available options within the list of overt acts and that the jury only needed to find one of them to be true in order to convict. To conclude otherwise, one would have to assume that the jury knew the law better than the judge <em>and </em>that it ignored the instruction that states \u201c[i]f anyone states a rule of law different from any I tell you, it is my instruction that you must follow.\u201d Second, there is the fact that the jury never asked the judge about the meaning of the conspiracy charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This indicates that the jury was not confused about their instruction (although it does not indicate <em>how </em>they construed the conspiracy instruction). Finally, the State, in its closing arguments reviewed the jury instructions and did not make any reference to the requirement that the overt act be undertaken for the purpose of furthering the agreement to kill Stoddart. In short, there is nothing to indicate how the jury viewed those instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">There is undoubtedly some disconnect between the \u201cone of the following\u201d instruction and the inclusion of the \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 instruction in that element of conspiracy. While the argument advanced by the State is not unreasonable, it is impossible to say that a reasonable jury <em>could not </em>have read the instruction to omit the required element that an overt act occurred in the furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>Garcia v. Windley, </em>144 Idaho 539, 543, 164 P.3d 819, 823 (2007) (\u201cAn erroneous instruction is prejudicial when it could have affected or did affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The State further argues that if the conspiracy instruction was erroneous, such error was harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">[W]here the jury instructions were only partially erroneous, such as where the jury instructions improperly omitted one element of a charged offense, the appellate court may apply the harmless error test, and where the evidence supporting a finding on the omitted element is overwhelming and uneontroverted, so that no rational jury could have found that the state failed to prove that element, the constitutional violation may be deemed harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-13\"><em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 224, 245 P.3d 961, 976 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">This statement in <em>Perry </em>was based, in part, upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Neder v. U.S., </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999). In <em>Neder, </em>the Court stated: \u201cUnlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before a biased judge, an instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <em>necessarily </em>render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (emphasis original). The Court concluded that \u201cwhere a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error, the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 119 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We are unable to conclude that the error was harmless because the defense vigorously contested the omitted element, asserting that Draper\u2019s conduct, including the four overt acts charged in the information, was not intended to further a conspiracy to commit first degree murder. Indeed, Draper\u2019s defense to the conspiracy charge was that his actions were intended as a joke to scare Stoddart, but that Adamcik then surprised him by attacking Stoddart.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As this case does not satisfy the requirement pronounced in <em>Neder </em>\u2014 that \u201cthe omitted element was uncontested\u201d \u2014 we are unable to find the instructional error to be harmless. For that reason, we vacate the judgment entered on the conspiracy charge and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">B. Draper\u2019s motion to suppress his fourth interview was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">In reviewing a district court order granting or denying a motion to suppress evidence, the standard of review is bifurcated. <em>State v.

The District Court\u2019s Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Draper\u2019s fourth interview occurred on September 28, 2006. The day before, during his third interview, Draper had admitted to being present at Stoddart\u2019s murder but said that only Adamcik stabbed Stoddart. Draper then went with several detectives and his father to the Black Rock Canyon area where they located a variety of evidence including the knives, clothing used in the attack, the partially burnt paper that included a number of references to killing including the phrase \u201cBrian kills\u201d and \u201cWe murder Cassie,\u201d the videotape of Draper and Adamcik, and other evidence admitted at trial. Draper was placed under arrest that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">During the fourth interview, Draper stated that, after Adamcik repeatedly stabbed Stoddart, Draper stabbed her as well but only because Adamcik told him to and only reluctantly. Shortly after making this admission, Draper asked for his parents and the interview ended. Before trial, Draper moved to suppress the fourth interview and any further evidence gained as a result of that interview.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">In response to Draper\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court made a variety of findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>1. Draper was 16 years of age at the time of the fourth interview with law enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">2. At the time of the fourth interview, Draper had completed his sophomore year of high school and was enrolled as a junior at Pocatello High School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">3. Draper had no prior experience with law enforcement prior to his first interview with Detectives Danske and Thomas on September 25, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">4. Draper\u2019s parents were present for Draper\u2019s first, second, and third interview, but were not present for Draper\u2019s fourth interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">5. Draper\u2019s prior experience with law enforcement includes only his first, second, and third interview, all occurring within the three days prior to the fourth interview. Draper was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form at the third interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">6. Following the third interview, Draper\u2019s parents and Sherriff [sic] Nielsen engaged in a conversation regarding legal representation for Draper, but the Drapers did not assert the right to counsel on behalf of their son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">7. There is no evidence, one way or the other, indicating that Draper was deprived of food or sleep prior to the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">8. It is not the Bannock County Jail\u2019s practice to deprive an inmate of food or sleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">9. Draper suffers from anxiety and has a dominant ear that affects the way he thinks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">10. At the time of the fourth interview, Draper was still under arrest from the previous day, and was not free to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">11. The form that the Sherriffs [sic] office uses for juveniles to waive <em>Miranda </em>rights does not indicate that the juvenile defendant has a right to have his or her parents present at the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\">12. Draper was verbally instructed that he had a right to have his parents present at the fourth interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\">13. Draper was mirandized before questioning at the fourth interview commenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-20\">14. Draper signed a form waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights before the questioning started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-21\">15. Draper did not invoke his right to have counsel present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-22\">16. Draper did not appear tired, ineffectual or vulnerable during the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-23\">17. Draper had a noticeable stutter during the fourth interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-24\">18. Draper is able to articulately express himself, both in verbal and written form to the extent that is expected of an average 16 year old high school sophomore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-25\">19. The fourth interview concluded because Draper requested the presence of his parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-26\">Given these findings, the district court denied Draper\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-27\">3. Draper\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-28\">Draper does not dispute the district court\u2019s findings of fact and we note that all of those findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence. Draper\u2019s main argument on appeal concerns the role of promises of assistance made by the police. This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-29\">Indications of cooperation are routinely brought to the attention of a sentencing judge and cases before this Court are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>p\u00edete with examples of such statements in the presentence report, which this Court has required to be before a sentencing judge. Nevertheless, even is [sic] such actions were deemed to be promises of leniency, they do not necessarily render a confession involuntary. <em>People v. York </em>[189 Colo. 16], 537 P.2d 294 (Colo.1975); <em>State v. Riley </em>[19 Wash.App. 289], 576 P.2d 1311 (Wash.Ct.App.1978). <em>But see People v. Jimenez </em>[21 Cal.3d 595, 147 Cal.Rptr. 172], 580 P.2d 672 (Cal.1978); <em>State v. Watson </em>[82 N.M. 769], 487 P.2d 197 (N.M.[App.]1971). Rather, we believe the question of voluntariness must be resolved by examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742 [90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747] (1970); <em>State v. Powers, </em>96 Idaho 833, 537 P.2d 1369, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1089 [96 S.Ct. 881, 47 L.Ed.2d 99] ... (1975); <em>See also Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653] (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIl\"><em>State v. Alger, </em>100 Idaho 675, 679-80, 603 P.2d 1009, 1013-14 (1979). That is, a court focuses on the totality of the circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s age and the effect of any promises made. The district court did exactly this. Based upon the record presented to the district court, there is no evidence that the promises of leniency, alone or in conjunction with Draper\u2019s age, overwhelmed Draper\u2019s ability to refuse to speak with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">As the Court addressed in <em>State v. Doe, </em>a court looks to six factors to determine whether a confession was voluntary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">(1) Whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">(2) The youth of the accused;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(3) The accused\u2019s level of education or low intelligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">(4) The length of detention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">(5) The repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">(6) Deprivation of food or sleep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">137 Idaho 519, 523, 50 P.3d 1014, 1018 (2002) (quoting <em>State v. Troy, </em>124 Idaho 211, 214, 858 P.2d 750, 753 (1993)). As indicated by the findings of fact quoted above, these were exactly the issues that the district court considered. \u201c[T]he power to judge the credibility of the witnesses, resolve any conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Valdez-Molina, </em>127 Idaho 102, 106, 897 P.2d 993, 997 (1995) (quoting <em>State v. Kirkwood, </em>111 Idaho 623, 625, 726 P.2d 735, 737 (1986)). We note that Draper never asked for specific findings of fact with regard to the promises of leniency and that the district court apparently placed little weight on the role of the promises of the police. We further note that Draper never offered any evidence that would tend to link the promises of leniency to the incriminating statements that occurred during the fourth interview. Indeed, it appears that most of Draper\u2019s statements were motivated by his being confronted with prior inconsistencies and false statements. Based upon these factors and the district court\u2019s findings of fact, the district court properly found that the waiver of Draper\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights was not coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">We find that Draper made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he was not coerced, and that the district court properly denied Draper\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">C. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Draper argues that the combination of the jury instructions and the use of the fourth interview at trial, even if individually they do not constitute reversible error, collectively constitute cumulative error that warrants reversal. \u201c[T]he cumulative error doctrine requires reversal of a conviction when there is \u2018an accumulation of irregularities, each of which by itself might be harmless, but when aggregated, the errors show the absence of a fair trial, in contravention of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Field, </em>144 Idaho 559, 572-73, 165 P.3d 273, 286-87 (2007) (quoting <em>State v. Moore, </em>131 Idaho 814, 823, 965 P.2d 174, 183 (1998)). The cumulative error doctrine is inapplicable to Draper\u2019s case. Although there was reversible error in the conspiracy instruction, there was no error affecting the conviction for first degree murder. We therefore find that Draper has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>that the cumulative error doctrine applies to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">D. Draper\u2019s Presentence Report</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">1. The Boundaries of Idaho Criminal Rule 32</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Idaho Criminal Rule 32 allows a judge to order a PSI for use in the sentencing phase of a trial. As envisioned by Criminal Rule 32, the PSI \u201cis used to assist the \u2018court in individualizing a rational sentence for the defendant. Simply put, the compelling need for information about the defendant at sentencing cannot be arbitrarily disregarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Romero, </em>116 Idaho 391, 393-94, 775 P.2d 1233, 1235-36 (1989) (quoting <em>Idaho Judge\u2019s Sentencing Manual </em>\u00a7 5.52). Draper points to two areas of the PSI that, he argues, fail to comply with I.C.R. 32.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, he argues that the investigator was biased, asked improperly probing questions, and presented a biased report. Second, he argues that the exclusion of his parents from the presentence interviews was a violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Rule 32 specifies the following contents of a PSI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">A tidal judge may request a record check and other background information concerning the defendant prior to sentence without conducting a full presentenee investigation of the defendant. However, whenever a full presentenee report is ordered, it shall contain the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">(1) The description of the situation surrounding the criminal activity with which the defendant has been charged, including the defendant\u2019s version of the criminal act and the defendant\u2019s explanation for the act, the arresting officer\u2019s version or report of the offense, where available, and the victim\u2019s version, where relevant to the sentencing decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">(2) Any prior criminal record of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">(3) The defendant\u2019s social history, including family relationships, marital status, age, interests and activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">(4) The defendant\u2019s educational background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">(5) The defendant\u2019s employment background, including any military record, and defendant\u2019s present employment status and capabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">(6) Residence history of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">(7) Financial status of defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">(8) Health of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">(9) The defendant\u2019s sense of values and outlook on life in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-21\">(10) The presentence investigator\u2019s analysis of the defendant\u2019s condition. That analysis of the defendant\u2019s condition contained in the presentence report should include a complete summary of the presentenee investigator\u2019s view of the psychological factors surrounding the commission of the crime or regarding the defendant individually which the investigator discovers. Where appropriate, the analysis should also include a specific recommendation regarding a psychological examination and a plan of rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">I.C.R. 32(b). The Rule also specifies the role of the investigator, as distinct from those areas that are particularly within the province of the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-23\">The presentence report may recommend incarceration but it should not contain specific recommendations concerning the length of incarceration, the imposition of a fine or the amount of a fine, or the length of probation or other matters which are within the province of the court. Provided, however, the presentence report may comment generally on the probability of the defendant\u2019s successfully completing the term of probation or the defendant\u2019s financial ability to pay a fine imposed by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-24\">I.C.R. 32(c).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-25\">The court of appeals has stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-26\">Provided that a defendant is afforded a full opportunity to present favorable evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and to explain and rebut adverse evidence, and a reasonable opportunity to examine all of the materials contained in the PSI, the defendant and the court can be assured of the reliability and the fairness of the conclusions presented therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><em>State v. Chapman, </em>120 Idaho 466, 471, 816 P.2d 1023, 1028 (Ct.App.1991), <em>quoted in State v. Dowalo, </em>122 Idaho 761, 763, 838 P.2d 890, 892 (Ct.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">2. The Nature of the Investigation and the Substance of the Report</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Draper raises objections to both the form of the investigation process and the substance of the final report. He points to questions such as \u201cI questioned Brian as to why they took real knives,\u201d \u201cI questioned Brian about when [Stoddart] was stabbed in the back,\u201d \u201cI asked Brian why he did not try to get away while Torey was turning the lights back on if he was afraid of him,\u201d and \u201cI questioned Brian about telling the truth because he was facing a polygraph test [on] that date.\u201d These and other statements in the PSI, Draper argues, \u201cwere pointed questions designed to illicit [sic] further incriminating statements from Brian about the crime and circumstances surrounding the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">There are two conflicting principles in assessing whether this questioning violates Criminal Rule 32. The first is the point that Draper focuses on, that investigatory questioning is not an opportunity to present \u201cthe defendant\u2019s version of the criminal act and the defendant\u2019s explanation for the act....\u201d I.C.R. 32(b)(1). The rule also states that \u201cconjecture and speculation should not be included in the presentence report.\u201d I.C.R. 32(e)(1). These indicate that the report is to be a neutral document and not an opportunity to simply advocate for the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">However, the primary purpose of a PSI is to assist the district court in sentencing. It includes the \u201cpresentence investigator\u2019s analysis of the defendant\u2019s condition ... [including] a complete summary of the presentence investigator\u2019s view of the psychological factors surrounding the commission of the crime or regarding the defendant individually which the investigator discovers.\u201d I.C.R. 32(b)(10). In order to adequately prepare this analysis and to assess the ways in which the defendant is accepting responsibility and cooperating in his or her rehabilitation, an investigator must go beyond simply accepting a narrative from the defendant. Rule 32 does not prohibit questioning the defendant. Viewing the PSI as a whole we find that the questioning in this case did not violate Rule 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Draper further argues that the PSI demonstrated the bias of the investigator. This comes much closer to violating the dictates of Rule 32. The PSI concludes that Draper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">made a choice to take the life of another human being, a choice the victim did not have----This is the type of behavior that we, as a society cannot take a second chance at, because you cannot replace a life as you can a stolen television or broken window.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Although this is followed by the statement that \u201cprobation is not a viable option in this matter\u201d the statement that \u201csociety cannot take a second chance\u201d straddles the line between recommending incarceration, as allowed by the Rule, and actively recommending a fixed life sentence, which is impermissible according to the Rule. I.C.R. 32(c) (\u201cThe presentence report may recommend incarceration but it should not contain specific recommendations concerning the length of incarceration....\u201d). Nevertheless, in light of the fact that the district judge recognized that the investigator (and, by implication, the PSI) was \u201cnot perfect,\u201d the fact that no specific sentence was, in fact, recommended, and the fact that there is no evidence that the district judge saw this as a recommendation of a fixed-life sentence, we cannot find that it was in violation of I.C.R. 32. We note, however, that this language was inappropriate and came close to crossing the line. In the future, presentence investigators would do well to avoid this kind of rhetoric.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">3. The Refusal to Allow Draper\u2019s Parents to Attend the Presentence Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Initially, the district court ruled that Draper could have his parents present dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ing the presentence investigation interview process. However, the presentence investigator wrote a letter to the court stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">I question whether [Draper] can be totally honest regarding relationships (to include sexual relationships) or even substance abuse issues with a family member present. As the Court is aware, any areas of deception could reflect poorly on Mr. Draper if the truth should come out. I am also concerned the parents, in an effort to protect their son or themselves, will interfere with my interview if they do not like the direct questions regarding the crime or issues related to any abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Based on this, the district court reversed its earlier decision, stating that \u201cgiven the serious nature of the crime that was committed in this case, I\u2019m going to defer to [the investigator\u2019s] request and it will be ordered that she can interview Draper without parents.\u201d This, perhaps more than the other issues regarding the PSI, is troubling. First, as noted above, I.C.R. 32 contemplates a neutral document for the use of the court in sentencing. It states that the trial judge is to order the PSI and, as such, it is the domain of the trial judge to determine the procedure for the interview. Second, as the investigator was not a party to the ease, he or she has no standing to make a motion to the court. Simply put, it was not the investigator\u2019s role to request a different procedure for the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Draper argues that the refusal to allow his parents to attend the presentence interview violated his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. This Court, in ruling that a psychosexual evaluation ordered by the trial court required access to counsel, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">A psychosexual exam concerned with the future dangerousness of a defendant is distinguishable from a \u201croutine\u201d presentence investigation. Specifically, Idaho Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 does not require a defendant\u2019s participation in a presentence investigation report.... The presentence report relies greatly on information already available in public records, such as educational background, residence history and employment information. <em>See </em>I.C.R. 32(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>Estrada v. State, </em>143 Idaho 558, 562, 149 P.3d 833, 837 (2006). More recently, the court of appeals, drawing on <em>Estrada </em>and the holdings of other state and federal courts, found that a routine presentence investigation did not constitute a critical stage of the proceedings and that counsel was not guaranteed. <em>Stuart v. State, </em>145 Idaho 467, 470, 180 P.3d 506, 509 (Ct.App.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Against this, Draper argues that the general right against self-incrimination extends to sentencing proceedings. While Draper is correct in this regard, it does not assist him. He had the opportunity to refuse to participate in the presentence interview although he did not choose to. Notably, <em>Estrada </em>focuses on the fact that the defendant there only wished to have counsel advise him prior to the psychosexual evaluation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">[T]he <em>Estelle </em>Court recognized that the defendant was not seeking a right to have counsel actually present during the exam. <em>[Estelle v.

Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence for the murder of Stoddart does not constitute unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Draper argues that, because he was a juvenile at the time of the crime, his fixed life sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions.

The Eighth Amendment Prohibition of Cruel and Unusual Punishments</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Draper argues that, by the same reasoning the U.S. Supreme Court applied in <em>Roper </em>to find that death sentences for juveniles constituted cruel and unusual punishment, fixed life sentences for juveniles are likewise cruel and unusual punishment. He notes that, in <em>Graham, </em>the Court applied a similar analysis to find all non-homicide fixed life sentences to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. These cases, he argues, compel a decision by. this Court that fixed life sentences for juveniles convicted of homicide are likewise unconstitutional. Draper has not argued that his sentence is disproportionate to his crime under the analysis enunciated in <em>Graham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">However, in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Roper, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court specifically distinguished homicide. In <em>Kennedy </em>the majority wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A96F\">Consistent with evolving standards of decency and the teachings of our precedents we conclude that, in determining whether the death penalty is excessive, there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons, even including child rape, on the other.

In <em>Graham, </em>the Court cited <em>Kennedy </em>specifically to differentiate non-homicide crimes. <em>Graham, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 2027, 176 L.Ed.2d 825, 842 (\u201cThe Court has recognized that defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\u201d). Likewise, in <em>Roper, </em>the Court approvingly noted instances where the death penalty for juveniles was commuted to life without parole (including Roper\u2019s own sentence). 543 U.S. at 560, 564-65,125 S.Ct. 1183, 1189-90, 1192-93, 161 L.Ed.2d 1, 18-19. Finally, in our recent decision in <em>State v. Windom, </em>this Court noted the \u201cclear line of demarcation\u201d in Eighth Amendment analysis between homicide and non-homicide offenses in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Kennedy. State v. Windom, </em>150 Idaho 873, 253 P.3d 310, 317 n. 2 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">While it is possible that a national consensus against fixed life sentences for juveniles convicted of homicide crimes may develop at some point,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Draper has provided no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>evidence of such a consensus. Indeed, our holding today is in line with the unanimous opinion of those courts that have considered juvenile life without parole sentences for homicide offenses following <em>Graham. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Ortiz, </em>17 A3d 417, 421-22 (Pa.Super.2011); <em>Cox v. State, </em>2011 Ark. 96,-, 2011 WL 737307, at *2 (Mar. 3, 2011); <em>State v.

We hold that Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">3. The Idaho Constitution\u2019s Prohibition on Cruel and Unusual Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Draper further argues that, even if the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would permit a fixed life sentence, the Idaho Constitution would forbid it under Article I, Section 6. This Court\u2019s analysis of whether a sentence violates Article I, Section 6, has traditionally tracked the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Brown, </em>121 Idaho 385, 393-94, 825 P.2d 482, 490-91 (1992) (modifying the Court\u2019s Article I, Section 6 proportionality analysis based on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991)). Draper has not pointed to any Article I, Section 6 analysis that would implicate \u201cthe concerns of this Court and the \u2018uniqueness of our state, our Constitution, and our long-standing jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rhoades v. State, </em>149 Idaho 130, 139, 233 P.3d 61, 70 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Donato, </em>135 Idaho 469, 472, 20 P.3d 5, 8 (2001)). Rather, Draper points to the statement in <em>State v. Broadhead, </em>120 Idaho 141, 146, 814 P.2d 401, 406 (1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Brown, </em>121 Idaho 385, 825 P.2d 482 (1992), that \u201c[i]n modifying sentences, the Court has given great weight to the age of a defendant____\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Adams, </em>99 Idaho 75, 79, 577 P.2d 1123, 1127 (1978) (Bistline, J. dissenting)). Notably, this statement came in the context of an analysis of the reasonableness of the sentence rather than the constitutionality of that sentence. As the Court noted in <em>Broadhead, </em>\u201c[i]n reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we are exercising our authority as an appellate court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. In deciding whether a sentence is cruel and unusual, we must decide whether it is proportional.\u201d 120 Idaho at 146, 814 P.2d at 406 (internal citation omitted). Likewise, in <em>Windom, </em>we refused to conflate the analysis of whether a sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment with the issue of whether a court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence. 150 Idaho at 880, 253 P.3d at 317 n. 2 (\u201c[I]t is neither necessary nor appropriate to confuse our well-established standard of review of a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision by selective application of statements found in decisions defining the scope of Eighth Amendment protections.\u201d). Thus, whether the district court considered Draper\u2019s age in applying his sentence is a question of the district court\u2019s discretion, rather than a categorical determination of whether the sentence was unconstitutional and is treated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence for murder does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. or Idaho Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">F.

Cannady, </em>137 Idaho 67, 73, 44 P.3d 1122, 1128 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">2. The District Court\u2019s Consideration of the Severity of Draper\u2019s Crime and the Goals of Protecting Society, Deterrence, Rehabilitation, and Retribution</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge highlighted findings of Alan Brantley, an FBI profiler, and Dr. Hazenbuehler, the psychologist appointed to evaluate Draper. He noted their findings that Draper was \u201ca severely disturbed individual\u201d and that Draper was \u201can entirely different individual than portrayed by [his] family members and friends, and also that [he] should not be released into society.\u201d He concluded that \u201cbased on all the evidence and all that I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m convinced that if you two [referring to Draper and Adamcik], or either one of you, were released, that you would kill again. I\u2019m convinced of that beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Draper further highlights two particular statements by the district court, including that \u201c[t]eenage killers perhaps should receive no mercy. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He also notes that the district court stated that \u201cI\u2019m not unmindful of how young you fellows are, but you commit a crime of this nature and it\u2019s got to be\u2014it\u2019s got to be known, not only by those who commit it, but to others in the community that punishment would not\u2014will not be so merciful. There\u2019s no mercy.\u201d These statements, Draper argues, indicate that the district court viewed his age as a solely aggravating factor in determining the sentence. This is incorrect. The statement \u201cI\u2019m not unmindful of how young you fellows are,\u201d and the earlier statement that \u201cyou are so young\u201d directly address Draper\u2019s age as a potentially mitigating circumstance. In addition, the entire sentencing hearing was focused on the planning and execution of Stoddart\u2019s murder and the importance of protecting society. This Court looks to the entire record on appeal in light of the objectives of sentencing to determine whether a sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>Stevens, </em>146 Idaho at 148, 191 P.3d at 226. In this context, it is not that the district court disregarded Draper\u2019s age but that the indications that Draper remained a danger to society outweighed that potentially mitigating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">We note that, as the district court stated, Stoddart\u2019s murder was \u201ca barbarous and cold-blooded horrific act.\u201d She was stabbed numerous times with multiple potentially fatal wounds. There was substantial evidence that this murder was part of a long-term plan by Draper and Adamcik and that it was the first in a planned spree of killings. We further note that the videotape includes Draper\u2019s statement that \u201cI just killed Cassie.\u201d These facts, combined with the constantly shifting nature of Draper\u2019s story to police and before the court and the evidence that he wielded the serrated knife that inflicted the majority of the wounds, suggests that he does pose a continuing danger to society and will for the remainder of his life. These facts lead us to reject Draper\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s decision could not have been based on substantial and competent evidence because the reports of Mr. Brantley and Dr. Hazenbuehler assessed Draper as a \u201cmedium\u201d risk to reoffend in a similar fashion. In light of the assessment of even a medium risk of reoffending and the brutal and premeditated nature of this particular offense, there was substantial and competent evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Viewed in light of the gravity of the offense and the need to protect society from the defendant, we find that the district court\u2019s imposition of a fixed life sentence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">G. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Draper\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence under Idaho Criminal Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Rule 35 is a narrow rule which allows a trial court to correct an illegal sentence or to correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner. Generally, whether a sentence is illegal or whether it was imposed in an illegal manner is a question of law, over which we exercise free review. However, if the basis for the illegality of the sentence is that the sentence is excessive, and the sentence is within the statutory limits, a motion for reduction of sentence under Rule 35 is a plea for leniency, and this Court will then review a denial or grant of the motion for an abuse of discretion. When presenting a Rule 35 motion, the defendant must show that the sentence is excessive in light of new or additional information subsequently provided to the district court in support of the Rule 35 motion. An appeal from the denial of a Rule 35 motion cannot be used as a vehicle to review the underlying sentence absent the presentation of new information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHg\"><em>Farwell, </em>144 Idaho at 735, 170 P.3d at 400 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cIf the sentence was not excessive when pronounced, the defendant must later show that it is excessive in view of new or additional information presented with the motion for reduction.\u201d <em>State v. Knighton, </em>143 Idaho 318, 320, 144 P.3d 23, 25 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Draper\u2019s Rule 35 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Draper contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a correction of sentence under I.C.R. 35. He points to statements provided by Draper and his parents as well as a progress report from the Department of Correction and additional documents that he provided with his Rule 35 motion. These, he argues, \u201cdemonstrate that Brian has rehabilitative potential and still continues to strive to make [sic] for his actions and [Stoddart\u2019s] death.\u201d It is unclear whether Draper is arguing that the district court did not consider that additional evidence and thus abused its discretion, or whether he is arguing that, based on the additional information, the district court acted outside the bounds of its discretion. In either case, Draper\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">The district court did consider the additional information. The court properly concluded that the motion was effectively a request for leniency. Similar testimony as to Draper\u2019s character and his characterization of the events surrounding Stoddart\u2019s murder were presented at sentencing. Nevertheless, the court \u201creviewed everything again \u2014 including the new documents ... filed.\u201d In light of its review, the district court stated that \u201c[t]he killing of Cassie Stoddart was not done on a whim. It was carefully planned\u2014 and intentional, senseless, brutal, barbaric conduct.\u201d The district court did not ignore the Rule 35 motion but declined to alter the sentence in light of Draper\u2019s additional submissions. In short, the additional evidence was considered but did not change the trial court\u2019s original views.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Draper\u2019s I.C.R. 35 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">We find that there was no error in the murder instruction. The jury instruction regarding the elements of conspiracy to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>first degree murder was erroneous and the error was not harmless. The district court did not err in admitting Draper\u2019s fourth confession and there was no cumulative error. Although the PSI was problematic, we cannot find that it resulted in prejudice to Draper. Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence for first degree murder does not constitute unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment and the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Draper to a fixed life sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reduce Draper\u2019s sentence. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment and sentence entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict that Draper committed first degree murder. We vacate the conviction for conspiracy to commit first degree murder and remand for a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-4\">Chief Justice BURDICK and Justice EISMANN concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">. The jury instructions defined premeditation as whether Draper \"considered] beforehand whether to kill or not to kill, and then ... decide[d] to kill.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-20\">. Draper\u2019s argument that the jury could have read \"willful\u201d as having required only an intention to stab as opposed to an intention to kill is undercut by the fact that the jury instruction reads that it must have been a \"willful, deliberate, and premeditated <em>killing.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\">.

Draper does not identify any additional evidence gathered as a result of the fourth interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\">. We reach this issue despite the State\u2019s argument that the only issue raised below was the question of whether Draper waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and not whether promises to assist Draper made by the police officers coerced Draper into his admission. \"The longstanding rule of this Court is that we will not consider issues that are presented for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Lovelace, </em>140 Idaho 53, 62, 90 P.3d 278, 287 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Robbins, </em>123 Idaho 527, 529, 850 P.2d 176, 178 (1993)). However, as Draper argues, the issue below was not merely whether Draper waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights but whether the interview was coerced. As such, it is proper to consider the entirety of the district court\u2019s determination that Draper knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent or his right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">.

The misnumbered item had the same margin as the other six elements of the conspiracy charge, rather than the indented margin of the four factual situations listed in the sixth element. The first word in the misnumbered element began with a lower case letter, indicating its connection to the other six elements, rather than to the four factual situations listed under the sixth element, in all of which the first word began with a capital letter. The word \u201cact\u201d in the misnumbered element could only refer back to the \u201cfollowing acts\u201d referenced in the introduction of the sixth element, since that word appears nowhere else in the instruction. It is unlikely that a rational jury\u2019s attention would be focused on the numeral five that had been renumbered, rather than on the substance of the text, which was the critical part necessary for the jury to carry out its responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Turning to the substance of Instruction No. 17, any infirmity in the misnumbered seventh element was cured by the substance of the four factual situations listed under element six. The jury was instructed to find that Draper had performed at least one of those factual situations and it must be assumed that the jury complied with the instruction. Pursuant to the first five elements of the instruction, the jury found that Draper had agreed with Adameik to commit the crime of murder in the first degree. Each of the factual situations in the sixth element described certain facts and then ended with the conclusion that the actions were performed to commit, or for the commission of, the murder of Cassie Stoddart, which was the subject of the agreement. Had this concluding phrase been left off of any of the four factual situations, Draper may have a better argument. However, the concluding phrase on each of the four factual situations essentially furnished the seventh element of the conspiracy, making the misnumbered seventh element largely superfluous. Rational jurors could not have concluded that any of the four factual situations was performed for any purpose other than to cany out the subject matter of the agreement \u2014 commission of the murder of Cassie Stoddart.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Fm\u2019thermore, jury instructions are to be viewed as a whole because \u201c[i]t is well estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>lished that [an] instruction \u2018may not be judged in artificial isolation\u2019 but must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385, 399 (1991) (quoting <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368, 373 (1973)). Instruction No. 17-A instructed, \u201cThe defendant is not guilty of Conspiracy if the defendant in good faith withdrew by informing another party to the conspiracy of the defendant\u2019s withdrawal before any party performed <em>an act for the purpose of carrying out the agreement.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) Reading Instruction Nos. 17 and 17-A together, it is clear that the State was required to prove Draper had performed one of the four described factual situations for the purpose of carrying out the agreement in order to be convicted of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">This is not a case where an element of the offense was omitted. Rather, the instruction was complete, but one element was merely mislabeled. However, even if one were to consider this as an omitted element instruction, it would pass the harmless error test. In <em>State v. Perry, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">[W]here the jury instructions were only partially erroneous, such as where the jury instructions improperly omitted one element of a charged offense, the appellate court may apply the harmless error test, and where the evidence supporting a finding on the omitted element is overwhelming and uncontroverted, so that no rationale jury could have found that the State failed to prove that element, the constitutional violation may be deemed harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1s\">150 Idaho 209, 224, 245 P.3d 961, 976 (2010). The evidence in this case overwhelmingly supports Draper\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit first degree murder. No rational jury could have found that the State failed to prove the seventh element of the charged offense. Although Draper does contest that element, such contest must be viewed in context of the six elements of the charged offense which the jury found to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury found that, \u201cOn or between the 22nd and 23rd days of September, 2006, in the State of Idaho, the defendant Brian Lee Draper and Torrey Michael Adameik agreed to commit the crime of murder in the first degree, [Draper] intended that the crime would be committed, [and that] one of the parties to the agreement performed at least one of the following acts.\u201d The instruction then lists the four previously discussed factual situations, all of which directly involved Draper and all of which were specifically directed toward commission of the murder of Cassie Stoddart \u2014 purchasing the knives to use in the commission of the murder, driving to the residence where she was located that night to commit the murder, retrieving the clothing and murder weapons for use in the commission of the murder, and lying in wait in the residence in preparation for the commission of the murder. In light of the jury\u2019s undisputed finding of agreement and intent to kill Cassie Stoddart, these acts are logically inseparable from a finding that they were committed in furtherance of the murder agreement. Despite Draper\u2019s feeble protestations, no rational jury could have found that any one of the four factual situations was performed for any other purpose than to commit the parties\u2019 agreed and intended crime \u2014 the first degree murder of Cassie Stoddart. This is particularly true with respect to the second factual situation \u2014 that Draper traveled to the Whispering Cliffs residence with Adameik \u201cto commit the murder of Cassie Stoddart\u201d \u2014 because Draper proclaimed that to be the ease in the video recording. There is no possibility a rational jury could have found otherwise. Thus, even if there were an error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">There is overwhelming evidence in the record to support Draper\u2019s conviction for first degree murder and to support his conviction for conspiring to commit that murder. Any contention that Draper only intended to scare Stoddart as a joke, and not to murder her, rings hollow in light of his first degree murder conviction. I would uphold both convictions. They are inseparable.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b635-10\">W. JONES, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AiO\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">I concur in the majority Opinion in all respects but for Section II A(4) in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>majority vacates Draper\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">First, with respect to the remainder of the majority Opinion, I write separately only for the purpose of reconciling my dissent in <em>State v. Windom, </em>150 Idaho 873, 253 P.3d 310 (2011), with the Court\u2019s holding in Section II F(2) affirming Draper\u2019s fixed life sentence for first degree murder. In <em>Windom, </em>I stated that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a fixed-life sentence on a sixteen-year-old boy with a severe mental illness because an offender\u2019s individual characteristics are, in my opinion, relevant to the reprehensibility of a crime, contrary to the majority\u2019s holding in <em>Windom </em>that these individual characteristics need not be taken into consideration in determining reprehensibility. 150 Idaho at 883-85, 253 P.3d at 320-22. As I explained there, \u201c[a] crime is less reprehensible \u2014 and therefore potentially less deserving of severe retribution \u2014 if the criminal has personally mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 884-85, 253 P.3d at 321-22. The Majority here analogizes this case to <em>Windom </em>and holds, consistent with the majority in <em>Windom, </em>that the nature of the crime alone is sufficient to support the fixed-life sentence. Under the facts of this particular case, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion affirming the fixed-life sentence, but not</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The district court\u2019s imposition of a fixed-life sentence here is consistent with my dissent in <em>Windom </em>because, given Draper\u2019s individual characteristics, the reprehensibility of this crime fully supports the fixed-life sentence. There are substantial and important differences between the facts of <em>Windom </em>and this case. The main similarity between the two cases is that both Draper and Windom were sixteen years of age and committed murder in a particularly heinous way: Draper by stabbing a friend to death with 37 stab wounds and Windom by beating his mother to death with a dumbbell. However, other than their respective ages at the time the crimes were committed, I do not find parallels in their individual characteristics such that I believe the district court abused its discretion in imposing a fixed-life sentence on Draper. Windom, on the other hand, had a psychotic disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, which <em>caused </em>him to kill his mother. <em>Id. </em>at 885-86, 253 P.3d at 322-23. Draper had no such psychotic disorder. The only evidence here relates to personality disorders, not psychosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In the present case, there is no evidence that Draper suffered from any pathological drive or desire that <em>caused </em>him to commit this crime. Rather, as shown in the video tape of Draper and his co-conspirator, Adamcik, the evidence shows that Draper murdered Stoddart in an attempt to achieve fame in the same manner as the Columbine killers. The facts here simply do not indicate that Draper, unlike Windom, killed as a result of a serious mental illness which can be properly treated. Indeed, the facts show that Draper killed to achieve fame by not only killing Stoddart, but also intending to kill individuals to exceed the number of deaths in the Columbine killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Also, in contrast to Draper, Windom reported his homicidal thoughts to authority figures and continually sought help for his mental illness weeks before the murder but was never taken seriously. Draper, on the other hand, secretly plotted and planned the murder of Cassie Stoddart days before the killing, which was to be a \u201ctune up\u201d or practice before other intended killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Because I believe that under these circumstances the reprehensibility of the crime fully supports the fixed life sentence imposed here, I agree with the Majority that there is no need to consider rehabilitation in this case and that Draper\u2019s sentence was not an abuse of discretion and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">With respect to my dissent from the Majority\u2019s vacation of the conspiracy conviction in Section IIA(4), I agree that there was error in the court\u2019s instruction regarding the elements required to prove conspiracy but, unlike the Majority, I believe the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the verdict would have been the same regardless of the error. I fully understand the reasoning of the Majority on this issue, but I am unable to understand how a reasonable jury could possibly, under the facts of this ease, come to the conclusion that Cassie Stoddart\u2019s murder was not the result of a conspiracy between Adamcik and Draper to commit it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>In my opinion, no reasonable person could possibly watch the video tapes in evidence showing Draper and Adamcik discussing and planning the murder and not find a conspiracy. There was also substantial evidence proving the joint actions of both Adamcik and Draper in burying the evidence and preparing an alibi to cover up their involvement in the crime. I would, therefore, affirm the conviction and sentence on the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
