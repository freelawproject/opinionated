JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">This case involves a custody dispute between Charles V. Hernandez, the biological father of two minor children, and Janice Ausburn, the children\u2019s maternal grandmother. The magistrate court granted shared physical custody to Charles and Janice. Charles appealed to the district court, which affirmed. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Charles V. Hernandez and Kerri A. Hernandez divorced in Elmore County in September 2000. Charles and Kerri had two minor children at the time. Before their divorce, Charles and Kerri briefly lived with Kerri\u2019s mother, Janice Ausburn, in Houston, Texas. Janice also briefly lived with the couple in Mountain Home before the divorce. Janice moved into her own place in Mountain Home just before Charles and Kerri divorced. After the divorce, Charles moved to Houston, Texas, and has lived there since. In the divorce decree, the court awarded Kerri primary physical custody and Charles reasonable visitation, including four weeks each summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">In March 2001, Kerri left the children with Janice because Kerri was straggling with drug addiction. The children continued to live with Janice and she raised them without physical help from Charles or Kerri. One of the children, an infant at the time, did live with a maternal aunt for about a year and a half while Janice recovered from shoulder surgery, but the children otherwise lived with Janice exclusively. Charles had no physical contact with the children between November 2002 and early 2008. He did occasionally speak with the children by phone over the years. Charles also paid some child support until March 2008, when this action was filed. Kern continued to struggle with personal issues and had nothing to do with the children after turning them over to Janice. Despite acting as the children\u2019s primary custodian, Janice never petitioned a court for guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">In Mai\u2019ch 2008, Charles and Kerri stipulated to a change in the custody arrangement, whereby Charles would have sole physical custody of the children and Kerri would have visitation each summer. The court entered a modification order based on the stipulation. The court was unaware that the children were actually residing with Janice when it entered the order. Janice was not made aware of either the stipulation or the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">After the court entered the modification order, Charles and Kerri planned for Kerri to take the children from school in Mountain Home, without telling Janice, and to meet Charles in Salt Lake City, Utah. The couple agreed that Kerri would hand over the children and Chai\u2019les would take them to Houston. Janice found out about the plan and kept the boys home from school on the day Kerri was to take them. Janice then filed a separate action for custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">In the subsequent custody proceeding, the court considered whether Charles or Janice should be the children\u2019s primary custodian. The court ultimately granted Charles sole legal custody and Charles and Janice shared physical custody, with Charles having primary custody and Janice having custody for six weeks during the summers. The court based its decision largely on a court-ordered parenting assessment and custody recommendation prepared by a third-party evaluator.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">Charles appealed the magistrate court's decision to the district court. He did not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings but, rather, argued the award of limited custodial rights to Janice violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ment to the United States Constitution. In its decision affirming the magistrate court, the district court noted, \u201cNone of the substantive factual findings of the Magistrate Court are at issue for purposes of this decision. The only question before this Court is whether Idaho law as applied and/or on its face is in contradiction to established United States Supreme Court precedent.\u201d Charles filed a timely appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">(1) Whether I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) facially violates the Fourteenth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">(2) Whether I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) is unconstitutional as applied in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">(3) Whether this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Stockwell v. Stockwell, </em>116 Idaho 297, 775 P.2d 611 (1989) violates the Fourteenth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">(4) Whether Charles is entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">A. Standard of Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Constitutional questions are questions of law over which we exercise free review. <em>Allied Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Kootenai </em>151 Idaho 405, 409, 258 P.3d 340, 344 (2011). This Court presumes the constitutionality of challenged statutes and we are obligated to seek an interpretation of the statute that upholds its constitutionality. <em>American Falls Reservoir Dist. No. 2 v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Water Res., </em>143 Idaho 862, 869, 154 P.3d 433, 440 (2007). The party challenging a statute bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>To succeed on a facial challenge, one must demonstrate that under no circumstances is the statute valid. <em>State v. Korsen, </em>138 Idaho 706, 712, 69 P.3d 126, 132 (2003). But, to prevail in an as-applied challenge, one must demonstrate only that the statute is unconstitutional as applied in a specific instance. <em>Lochsa Falls, L.L.C. v. State, </em>147 Idaho 232, 241, 207 P.3d 963, 972 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">B. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) is facially constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">The statute at issue here, I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-19\">In any case where a child is actually residing with a grandparent in a stable relationship, the court may recognize the grandparent as having the same standing as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Charles contends that I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) is facially unconstitutional in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">In Troxel, the Supreme Court considered and invalidated a Washington visitation statute. Troxel, 530 U.S. at 60, 63, 120 S.Ct. at 2057-59, 147 L.Ed.2d at 53, 55. That Washington statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-22\">Any person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited to, custody proceedings. The court may order visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-23\"><em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 61, 120 S.Ct. at 2058, 147 L.Ed.2d at 54 (citing Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 26.10.160(3) (1994)). Charles maintains <em>\u201cTroxel </em>specifically required that unless a parent is unfit, the Court must presume that the parent\u2019s decisions regarding the care and custody of the children are in the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d Charles therefore argues that \u201cbecause [I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) ] places par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ents and grandparents on equal footing regarding custody without requiring a finding that the parents are unfit,\u201d I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) infringes on a parent\u2019s fundamental rights. Janice counters that the <em>Troxel </em>court recognized a State\u2019s authority to make custody determinations contrary to a parent\u2019s demands, if a court appropriately considers a parent\u2019s wishes. Janice also argues that I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) contains a built-in deference to parental decisionmaking because a child cannot come to live with a grandparent in a stable relationship absent a parent\u2019s approval or acquiescence. The <em>Troxel </em>court recognized \u201cthe fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children,\u201d stating \u201cit cannot now be doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects [that] fundamental right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d at 57 (plurality opinion by O\u2019Connor, J.). <em>See also id. </em>at 77, 120 S.Ct. at 2066, 147 L.Ed.2d at 63-64 (Souter, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 80, 120 S.Ct. at 2067-68, 147 L.Ed.2d at 65-66 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 86, 120 S.Ct. at 2070-71, 147 L.Ed.2d at 68-69 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id. </em>at 95, 120 S.Ct. at 2075-76, 147 L.Ed.2d at 74-75 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). A majority of the Court also agreed that Washington\u2019s statute unconstitutionally infringed on that right, but the Court did not reach a consensus holding. <em>Id. </em>at 72-73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 60-61 (plurality opinion by O\u2019Connor, J.); <em>id. </em>at 75-79, 120 S.Ct. at 2065-67, 147 L.Ed.2d at 62-65 (Souter, J., concurring); <em>id.. </em>at 80, 120 S.Ct. at 2067-68, 147 L.Ed.2d at 65-66 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">A four-justice plurality said that the statute was \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d and that, \u201cas applied to Granville [the children\u2019s mother and respondent], [it] unconstitutionally infringes on [her] fundamental parental right [to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her children].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 72-73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 60-61 (plurality opinion by O\u2019Connor, J.). Justices Souter and Thomas opined that the statute was unconstitutional, but for different reasons. Justice Souter wrote that the statute was facially invalid, so the Court need not consider it as applied to the respondent. <em>Id. </em>at 75-79, 120 S.Ct. at 2065-67, 147 L.Ed.2d at 62-65 (Souter, J., concurring). Justice Thomas would have held that the State lacked a legitimate interest \u201cin second-guessing a fit parent\u2019s decisions regarding visitation with third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 120 S.Ct. at 2067-68, 147 L.Ed.2d at 65 (Thomas, J., concurring). <em>TroxeVs </em>import, therefore, is limited. It stands for the narrow proposition that Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 26.10.160(3) (1994) is constitutionally infirm as applied in that ease. The Court certainly had the opportunity to declare the breathtakingly broad statute unconstitutional on its face, but a majority of the Court failed to take that opportunity. In light of the decision in <em>Troxel, </em>Charles fails to explain why this Court should declare the much narrower Idaho statute to be facially unconstitutional. We hold that the district court correctly upheld the facial constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">C. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) is constitutional as applied to Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Charles\u2019 challenge to Section 32-717(3) is both facial and as applied, although his argument fails to clearly distinguish between the two attacks. On the other hand, the Supreme Court was not entirely clear in making that distinction in the <em>Troxel </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The <em>Troxel </em>plurality did offer some support for Charles\u2019 position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-11\">[S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children <em>(i.e., </em>is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of the parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-12\">[I]f a fit parent\u2019s decision [involving visitation] becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-13\"><em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 68-70, 120 S.Ct. at 2061-62, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58-59. The plurality did discuss \u201cthe traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child,\u201d and it noted that the Washington court failed to adequately acknowledge that presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 120 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>2061-62, 147 L.Ed.2d at 58-59. But the plurality would have been satisfied had the Washington court afforded \u201cspecial weight\u201d to a fit parent\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 70,120 S.Ct. at 2062, 147 L.Ed.2d at 59. And, read together, the divergent opinions of <em>Troxel </em>clearly do not support Charles\u2019 constitutional attack on Section 32-717(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) is obviously distinguishable from Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 26.10.160(3) (1994). The Idaho provision applies only in limited circumstances: when a minor child is actually living with the grandparent in a stable relationship. When Section 32-717(3) does apply, the result is only that the <em>actual custodian </em>\u2014 i.e., the grandparent \u2014 has standing to participate in a custody determination in a divorce action. Section 32-717(3) does not expressly curtail parental rights, and it does not allow anyone and everyone to invoke the court\u2019s power to determine custody. The Washington statute, by contrast, provided that <em>any </em>person could petition a court for visitation at <em>any </em>time. That statute was not limited to actual custodians. Nor was the Washington statute limited to divorce actions. Nor did it even reference the rights of parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Moreover, Section 32-717(3) does not conflict with <em>Troxel\u2019s </em>constitutional basis \u2014 the longstanding notion that parents have a liberty interest in raising their children without excessive government interference. We interpret statutes by giving effect to their \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning.\u201d <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Health and Welfare v. Housel, </em>140 Idaho 96, 103, 90 P.3d 321, 328 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 32-717(3) does not, as Charles contends, \u201cclearly disregard!] a parent\u2019s fundamental rights ... because the statute attempts to place parents and grandparents on equal footing without a finding that the parent is unfit.\u201d Rather, Section 32-717(3) merely grants an actual custodial grandparent \u201cthe same <em>standing </em>as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child\u201d in a divorce action. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) (emphasis added). Standing is \u201c[a] party\u2019s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1536 (9th ed.2009). Section 32-717(3) does not grant any substantive right and it requires a threshold finding that the child in question \u201cactually resid[es] with the grandparent in a stable relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">!7] This Court has, in fact, specifically acknowledged that in the Section 32-717(3) context, a grandparent\u2019s right is <em>not </em>equal to a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise his or her children. In <em>Leavitt v. Leavitt, </em>we noted that \u201cI.C. \u00a7 32-717 applies to custody disputes between equal and competing fundamental interests, <em>with one limited exception </em>when a grandparent seeks custody \u2018where the child is actually residing with a grandparent in a stable relationship.\u2019 \u201d 142 Idaho 664, 671, 132 P.3d 421, 428 (2006) (quoting I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3)) (emphasis added). So, rather than infringing on a parent\u2019s right, Section 32-717(3) recognizes that an actual custodial grandparent may help the court determine what custody arrangement is in the best interest of the child in a divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">This reading honors a parent\u2019s fundamental interest, and it accommodates two other important, if sometimes competing, interests: \u201cthe State\u2019s long-recognized interest! ] <em>interests </em>as <em>parens patriae ... </em>and, critically, the child\u2019s own complementary interest in preserving relationships that serve her welfare and protection.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 88, 120 S.Ct. at 2072, 147 L.Ed.2d at 70 (Stevens, J., dissenting). As Justice Stevens pointed out, the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to \u201celucidate the nature of a child\u2019s liberty interest in preserving established familial or family-like bonds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room for States to consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91,120 S.Ct. at 2073, 147 L.Ed.2d at 72. It is the State\u2019s job, not that of the federal courts, \u201cto assess in the first instance the relative importance of the conflicting interests that give rise to disputes such as this.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Charles argues that Section 32-717(3) offends the Fourteenth Amendment because it elevates a grandparent\u2019s right to that of a parent without a threshold finding of unfitness. Yet, neither the U.S. Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>nor this Court\u2019s precedent supports Charles\u2019 argument. Nor does the plain language of Section 32-717(3) lend itself to such an understanding. <em>Troxel </em>gives <em>an </em>instance of when parental decisionmaking may be questioned, <em>ie. </em>where the parent is not fit. <em>Id. </em>at 68. <em>Troxel </em>does not, however, spell out the only such instance. <em>See Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d at 61. The situation contemplated by Section 32-717(3) is certainly one in which the State can direct a court to consider interests other than the biological parents\u2019. Section 32-717(3) applies only to children actually living with a grandparent in a stable relationship, and it is hard to imagine how this could happen without some affirmative choice, or acquiescence, by the parent. It would therefore be unreasonable for us to hold that such a grandparent has no standing to advise a court as what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The magistrate judge did a remark-able job of applying Section 32-717(3) in this case. The magistrate found that Charles was a fit parent and therefore presumed that Charles\u2019 wishes with respect to his children were entitled to great deference. Indeed, the magistrate gave \u201cspecial weight to the wishes of Charles\u201d and noted \u201cthat [Charles] wishes to have primary custody of his children as well as to control when Janice is to exercise custodial time or visitation.\u201d The magistrate recognized, however, that Janice proved the children had been living with her in a stable relationship and therefore allowed her to participate in the custody determination pursuant to Section 32-717(3). The magistrate carefully considered the best interests of the children, the fact that they had formed a strong bond with Janice, and the fact that Charles had tried to have a better relationship with them despite some resistance from Janice. After considering at length what would be in the best interest of the children, the magistrate concluded that Charles should have sole legal custody and he should share physical custody with Janice. The magistrate thus gave due regard to Charles\u2019 parental rights, but balanced them with the competing interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Based on the prior discussion about the limits of <em>Troxel </em>and the facial constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3), Charles has not demonstrated how the magistrate\u2019s findings infringed on his rights. We therefore hold I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) constitutional as applied to Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">D. Our <em>Stockwell </em>holding is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The magistrate court relied on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stockwell v. Stockwell, </em>116 Idaho 297, 775 P.2d 611 (1989) in determining its custody order and the district court upheld that order based on <em>Stockwell. </em>In <em>Stockwell, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">It is thus clearly established under Idaho precedent, that where a child has been in the custody of a third party for an appreciable period of time (and thereby developed a bond with that person), the custody of the child will be awarded to that party if the best interests of the child so dictate. In this circumstance, neither \u201ca mandatory showing of abandonment nor of patent unfitness\u201d is necessary to overcome a natural parent\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 300, 775 P.2d at 614 (quoting <em>In re Ewing, </em>96 Idaho 424, 425-26, 529 P.2d 1296, 1297-98 (1974)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Charles argues that the <em>Stockwell </em>holding was rendered unconstitutional by <em>Troxel. </em>As explained previously, <em>Troxel </em>is a narrow decision that reaffirmed the right of parents to raise their children without excessive governmental interference and held the Washington statute to infringe upon such right in that ease. <em>Troxel </em>has no application here. The <em>Stockwell </em>holding Charles now challenges allows a court to award custody to a nonparent third party who has acted as the child\u2019s actual custodian. <em>Stockwell </em>does not require a threshold finding of parental unfitness. The <em>Stockwell </em>holding recognizes that a custody grant to a nonparent, with whom the child lives and has established a bond, might be in a child\u2019s best interest despite a parent\u2019s contrary wishes. As discussed, the Fourteenth Amendment accommodates a State\u2019s decision to grant nonparents custody in such cases. <em>Troxel </em>did not announce a different interpretation by the U.S. Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>nor did it hold, as Charles argues, that \u201cunless a parent is unfit, the Court must presume that the parent\u2019s decisions regarding the care and custody of the children are in the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d So, <em>Troxel </em>did not impliedly invalidate the <em>Stockwell </em>holding. Accordingly, we decline to overrule <em>Stockwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">E. Charles is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Charles seeks fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120 and 12-121. Under both sections, this Court may award the prevailing party reasonable fees. Here, Charles has not prevailed and therefore is not entitled to a fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision upholding the magistrate court\u2019s custody order because the district court correctly determined that neither I.C. \u00a7 32-717(3) nor the <em>Stockwell </em>holding are violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. We award costs on appeal to Janice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b920-9\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\">. Charles asserts several additional assignments of error before this Court, but nothing in the record suggests that he raised those other issues in the district court. \"On appeal of a decision rendered by a district court while acting in its intermediate appellate capacity, this Court directly reviews the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>In Re Doe, </em>147 Idaho 243, 248, 207 P.3d 974, 979 (2009). Because the district court did not consider or rule upon the other issues Charles now raises, we will not consider them on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b920-10\">Justice E ISM ANN,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">The right to liberty includes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of ... liberty ... without due process of law.\u201d It recognizes that the right of liberty is not absolute. A state can deprive someone of liberty with due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">Idaho Code section 32-717(3) only applies to divorce actions. <em>In re Doe, </em>148 Idaho 432, 440, 224 P.3d 499, 507 (2009). Janice Ausburn intervened in the divorce action,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was consolidated with the separate action that she filed. Therefore, the statute applies here. It does not grant or diminish any constitutional right. It simply permits the trial court to recognize a grandparent\u2019s standing when evaluating custody arrangements when the child is actually residing with that grandparent in a stable relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">A parent\u2019s right to direct the upbringing and education of children under the parent\u2019s control is not absolute. For example, a parent can lose all rights with respect to a child because of the parent\u2019s conduct in abusing, neglecting, or abandoning the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">In <em>Stockwell v. Stockwell, </em>116 Idaho 297, 775 P.2d 611 (1989), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-18\">In custody disputes between a \u201cnon-parent\u201d (i.e., an individual who is neither legal nor natural parent) and a natural parent, Idaho courts apply a presumption that a natural parent should have custody as opposed to other lineal or collateral relatives or interested parties. This presumption operates to preclude consideration of the best interests of the child unless the non-parent demonstrates either that the natural parent has abandoned the child, that the natural parent is unfit or that the child has been in the nonparent\u2019s custody for an appreciable period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-19\">116 Idaho at 299, 775 P.2d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">After the divorce in Elmore County, Idaho, in September 2000, Charles chose to move to Houston, Texas, and he thereafter did not participate in the rearing of his children. As a result of his failure to assume parental responsibilities, Janice did so. As the magistrate judge found, \u201cFor most of their lives Janice has raised and nurtured the boys without physical assistance from either of their parents.\u201d That finding is not challenged on appeal. As a result of Charles\u2019 conduct, the magistrate judge had the authority to award shared physical custody of the children to Janice if doing so was in their best interests. The magistrate judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>that it is \u201cin the best interest of the boys that Charles and Janice share physical custody,\u201d and that finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">There is nothing in <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), that impacts this ease because of the differences between the Washington statute and Idaho\u2019s statutory law and case law. Therefore, I agree to affirm the judgment of the district court, which affirmed the order of the magistrate court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-13\">. Because provisions of a divorce decree regarding the care and custody of children can be modified, a divorce action is still pending, even though the divorce had been granted, until the children reach their majority. <em>Gifford v. Gifford, </em>50 Idaho 517, 520, 297 P. 1100, 1101 (1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
