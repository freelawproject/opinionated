(Four Rivers), finding that Four Rivers breached a contract for long-term employment. Four Rivers\u2019 appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict, the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding contract formation, and the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the statute of frauds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Four Rivers operates an onion packing plant near Weiser, Idaho that began business in 1999. In August of that year, Four Rivers\u2019 general manager, Randy Smith (Smith), suggested that Four Rivers hire Maekay as the company\u2019s field man. Mackay had been in the onion business for decades and knew many onion farmers near Weiser. Four Rivers authorized Smith to offer Mackay the position, but required Smith to personally pay Mackay\u2019s wages during Mackay\u2019s first year. As field man, Maekay was responsible for purchasing enough onions to keep Four Rivers\u2019 packing shed stocked through mid-March, at a price Smith would set.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">The parties dispute facts regarding the contract at the center of this appeal. Mackay alleges that in March of 2000, Smith orally offered him a long-term employment contract. Mackay alleges he discussed the offer with his wife and accepted the offer the following day. According to Mackay, the parties intended the employment contract to continue until Mackay chose to retire. Mackay claims he informed Smith he might not retire for as long as ten years. Smith denies ever having any conversation with Mackay about a long-term employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">During the 1999-2000 season, Smith and Mackay both procured onions for Four Rivers\u2019 shed. Mackay was able to purchase onions at prices specified by Smith, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>shed remained stocked until April, with Four Rivers packing a total 800,000 bags of onions that year. Meanwhile, Four Rivers experienced financial and managerial hardship. As the result of a dispute between the owners, on June 2, 2000, an injunction stopped all Four Rivers\u2019 business. Mackay and other employees were laid off. Mackay alleges that, during the time that the injunction remained in effect, Four Rivers asked him to maintain contact with farmers in order to reassure them that Four Rivers would return to normal business and perform on its existing contracts. Mackay claims he agreed to do so because he wanted to protect his interest in long-term employment. Four Rivers denies it made any such request. The injunction was lifted in mid-August 2000. Four Rivers rehired Mackay and relieved Smith of responsibility for paying Mackay\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In subsequent seasons, Mackay experienced difficulty purchasing onions at the prices specified by Smith. During the 2000-2001 packing season, Four Rivers gave Maekay a contact list for over two hundred onion farmers and instructed him to build more business relationships. Smith contends Mackay failed to do so, and merely maintained his earlier relationships with farmers in the Weiser area. That season, Four Rivers packed approximately 400,000 bags of onions. Witnesses for both Mackay and Four Rivers acknowledged that the injunction in 2000 adversely affected the number of contracts Four Rivers obtained in advance of the 2000-2001 season.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In October of 2001, Four Rivers drafted a written employment contract at Maekay\u2019s request. The proposed contract contained an at-will provision that permitted Four Rivers to terminate Mackay\u2019s employment upon fourteen days\u2019 notice. Although Mackay made several handwritten notations on the contract, neither party signed the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Smith testified that Mackay\u2019s performance remained unsatisfactory during the 2001-2002 season. Smith testified that he met with Mackay twice to explain that if Mackay did not obtain enough onions to meet Four Rivers\u2019 needs, everyone at Four Rivers would lose their jobs. Memoranda subsequently were entered in Mackay\u2019s employment file to document that Mackay was informed that his performance was unsatisfactory and that he would lose his job if he did not obtain more onions. After the meetings, Mackay\u2019s travel log reflected a decrease in his travel, which Four Rivers contends indicates he failed to meet these expectations. However, Mackay testified that in response to Smith\u2019s urgings, he increased his efforts and even worked thirty-six days straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In 2003, Four Rivers once again struggled to keep the onion sheds stocked. As a consequence, Four Rivers closed its shed in mid-February, one month earlier than planned. On Mai\u2019ch 7, 2003, Four Rivers laid Mackay off, and Mackay obtained unemployment benefits. Smith testified that in June 2003, Mackay rejected Four Rivers\u2019 offer of employment as an outside foreman. Mackay denied Four Rivers made any such offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Mackay filed suit in August of 2004, alleging breach of contract. The district court initially granted Four Rivers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that because the employment agreement could not be performed by its terms within one year, it violated the statute of frauds. Mackay appealed, and in <em>Mackay v. Four Rivers Packing Co., </em>145 Idaho 408, 179 P.3d 1064 (2008) <em>(Mackay </em>I), we vacated the grant of summary judgment, holding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the duration of the alleged agreement. This Court also held, taking \u201cas true Mackay\u2019s allegation that the contract was to last \u2018until retirement,\u2019 \u201d the contract would fall outside the statute of frauds because \u201cMackay could have retired within one year under the terms of the alleged contract____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 179 P.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">At trial following remand, Four Rivers contended that the parties had not entered into an employment contract for any specified term. Four Rivers objected to a jury instruction given by the court because it suggested that the parties had reached an agreement as to at least some terms of an employment contract. Four Rivers also objected to the district court\u2019s failure to provide the jury with an instruction on the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>frauds. The district court overruled Four Rivers\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mackay. In its answers to the questions presented in the special verdict form, the jury found that the parties had entered \u201cinto a long term employment contract of up to ten years, or such time as the Plaintiff retired.\u201d Four Rivers timely appealed, challenging the juiy instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThe propriety of jury instructions is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review, and the standard of review of whether a jury instruction should or should not have been given is whether there is evidence at trial to support the instruction, and whether the instruction is a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>Clark v. Klein, </em>137 Idaho 154, 156, 45 P.3d 810, 812 (2002) (internal citations omitted). This Court reviews jury instructions as a whole to determine whether the instructions fairly and adequately present the issues and state the law. <em>Silver Creek Computers, Inc. v. Petra, Inc., </em>136 Idaho 879, 882, 42 P.3d 672, 675 (2002). Even where an instruction is erroneous, the error is not reversible unless the jury instructions taken as a whole mislead or prejudice a party. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, a special verdict form does not constitute reversible error unless it incorrectly instructed the jury as to the law or its form was confusing. <em>VFP VC v. Dakota Co., </em>141 Idaho 326, 332, 109 P.3d 714, 720 (2005) (citing <em>Le\u2019Gall v. Lewis Cnty., </em>129 Idaho 182, 185, 923 P.2d 427, 430 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict, this Court will not set aside the verdict if it is supported by substantial and competent evidence.\u201d <em>Stoddard v. Nelson, </em>99 Idaho 293, 296, 581 P.2d 339, 342 (1978). The evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict may be contradicted, but the verdict will be upheld if it is \u201cof such sufficient quantity and probative value that reasonable minds could conclude that the verdict of the jury was proper.\u201d <em>Mann v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>95 Idaho 732, 736, 518 P.2d 1194, 1198 (1974). This Court will not second guess the jury\u2019s determinations as to the weight of the evidence and witness credibility. <em>McKim v. Horner, </em>143 Idaho 568, 572, 149 P.3d 843, 847 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">We first consider Four Rivers\u2019 claims that the district court erred by instructing the jury in a manner that infringed on the fact-finding role of the jury and by failing to instruct the jury as to the statute of frauds. We then consider whether substantial, competent evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">A. The district court properly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">1. <em>The jury instructions accurately stated Idaho employment contract law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">Four Rivers contends that whether the parties entered into an employment contract is a disputed fact and that one of the instructions submitted to the jury infringed upon the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder because it instructed the jury that the parties agreed to some terms of an employment contract. The challenged instruction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-17\">In this case, the Defendant alleges that all parties did not agree to <em>all </em>essential terms of a contract. This requirement is sometimes <em>referred to </em>as the \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d and means that all parties to a contract must have understood and accepted all of the essential terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-18\">There is no contract unless all of the essential terms have been communicated to all parties, understood by all parties, and accepted by all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-19\">(emphasis added). According to Four Rivers, the instruction\u2019s statement that the \u201cparties did not agree to all essential terms\u201d implies that the parties did agree to some terms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>This Court reviews jury instructions as a whole to determine whether a jury has been adequately instructed as to the issues presented and the law. <em>Silver Creek Computers, Inc., </em>136 Idaho at 882, 42 P.3d at 675. In addition to the above-quoted jury instruction, the jury was instructed as to the elements of an enforceable contract, the presumption that an employment relationship is at will unless duration or justifications for discharge are specified, and Mackay\u2019s burden of proving both the existence of a contract and that Four Rivers breached the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Standing alone, the challenged jury instruction made it clear to the jury that there was no contract \u201cunless all of the essential terns\u201d of such contract were communicated, understood, and accepted by both Four Rivers and Mackay. The instruction plainly conditions the existence of an enforceable contract on the parties\u2019 communication and acceptance of all essential terms of a contract. We are unable to agree with Four Rivers\u2019 strained construction that this instruction advised the jury that the parties agreed to some, but not all terms of a contract, thereby infringing upon the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder. In any event, the other jury instructions emphasized to the jury that the relationship between Four Rivers and Maekay was one of at-will employment, absent mutual communication and acceptance of some other term. As the jury was accurately instructed as to the law and, in order to reach its verdict, was required to find that the parties agreed to all terms of the contract, we hold that the challenged jury instruction did not mislead the jury or infringe upon the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">2. <em>The district court properly denied Four Rivers\u2019 request for a jury instruction on the statute of frauds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Four Rivers argues that the district coui\u2019t improperly refused to instruct the jury regarding the statute of frauds because the evidence supported such an instruction. Four Rivers\u2019 argument is predicated on the contention that Mackay testified that the contract was to be for a ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Mackay first responds that Four Rivers failed to properly object to the failure to give such an instruction, as required by I.R.C.P. 51(b), and is therefore precluded from asserting error. We disagree. Counsel to Four Rivers stated during the jury instruction conference that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">If the jury were to conclude that there were a ten-year agreement, I believe it would be essential for them at that time also to have instructions on the statute of frauds, ... [I request] that they be instructed that if they should find that there is a ten-year agreement, that it is invalid by virtue of the statute of frauds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">A plainer request for an instruction on the statute of frauds is difficult to imagine. We find that Four Rivers preserved this issue for review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Mackay next contends that the district court properly refused Four Rivers\u2019 requests ed instruction because this Court ruled in <em>Mackay I </em>that the parties\u2019 contract was outside the statute of frauds as a matter of law. <em>Mackay I </em>considered an appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing Maekay\u2019s contract claim for failure to comply with the statute of frauds. <em>Mackay I, </em>145 Idaho at 410, 179 P.3d at 1066. Given the procedural posture of the appeal, this Court was required on review to construe all disputed facts and reasonable inferences in favor of Mackay, the nonmoving party, and determine whether Four Rivers was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>Mackay misconstrues this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mackay I, </em>as we explicitly recognized that the duration of the alleged contract was an unresolved question of fact and therefore the district court erred by granting summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 179 P.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Thus, we turn to the substance of Four Rivers\u2019 claim of error, i.e., whether the district court improperly denied Four Rivers\u2019 request for an instruction relating to the statute of frauds. We hold that it did not. If a party\u2019s \u201ctheory is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence,\u201d the party is entitled to a jury instruction on that theory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Vanderford Co. v. Knudson, </em>144 Idaho 547, 555, 165 P.3d 261, 269 (2007) (citing <em>Doty v. Bishara, </em>123 Idaho 329, 334, 848 P.2d 387, 392 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Our review of the testimony presented at trial reveals that there was no evidentiary support for a statute of frauds jury instruction. Witnesses for Four Rivers repeatedly and consistently testified that there was no agreement as to the duration of Mackay\u2019s employment. Thus, Four Rivers relies solely upon Mackay\u2019s testimony in support of its contention that his claim of promised long-term employment is invalid under the statute of frauds. Four Rivers urges this Court to interpret Mackay\u2019s testimony as an offer of employment for ten years, which would necessitate an insti\u2019uction as to the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Resolution of this issue has required careful consideration of the evidence presented at trial as to the duration of the employment offer to determine whether Mackay\u2019s employment was to be for a ten-year period, as contended by Four Rivers, or whether it was to continue until he chose to retire, as Mackay contends on appeal. This is so because if the evidence could reasonably be viewed as Four Rivers contends, then the district court was required to instruct the jury as to the statute of frauds. <em>Burton v. Atomic Workers Fed. Credit Union, </em>119 Idaho 17, 19-20, 803 P.2d 518, 520-21 (1990) (failure to give statute of frauds jury instruction on claimed contract of. employment to age 65, which could not by its terms have been performed within one year, held to be reversible error). However, if the only reasonable view of Mackay\u2019s testimony is that the term of his employment was until he chose to retire, the contract would fall outside the statute of frauds. <em>Mackay I, </em>145 Idaho at 412, 179 P.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The evidence on this subject primarily consisted of Mackay\u2019s testimony, including his explanation of a diary entry he made at the time (admitted as the second page of Exhibit G), and Mackay\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">At trial, Mackay repeatedly characterized the offer as one of long-term employment, lasting until he decided to retire. He also repeatedly testified that he informed Smith that his retirement could be as long as ten years from the time of the agreement. He initially testified as to the duration of his employment in response to questions from his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, tell us who made the offer to you and how it was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">A. Randy Smith, the general manager\u2014 the office building at Four Rivers, there is a sales office it\u2019s called, which is a large room. My office was kind of around the corner out of the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">Randy was in talking to Dennis Palmer, the salesman. He came into my office, we B.S.\u2019d a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-13\">Randy said, I would like to offer you a long-term employment agreement. I told Randy at the time I enjoyed the onion business, I enjoyed working for Four Rivers, but I might not retire for four \u2014 for ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">That didn\u2019t seem to be a problem. I told him I wanted to go home and talk to my wife before I accepted it. I did this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-15\">The next morning I came back, we sat down and shook hands about it, talked a little bit how we were going to procure onions, the long-range development of Four Rivers, and away we went.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-16\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, it sounds like after the offer was made to you by Mr. Smith, you didn\u2019t accept it right away, you went home and talked to your wife and then came\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-17\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-18\">Q. \u2014back the next day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-19\">A. We been married a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-20\">Q. Okay. And when you came back the next day, tell us where you met Mr. Smith and how \u2014 the type of discussion that you had with him at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-21\">A As near as I can recall, we were either in the sales office or in my office. I told Randy I\u2019d like to accept his offer, I enjoyed working for Four Rivers, I thought we could do a good thing together, I thought we could both be there until we retired and enjoy a good life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-22\">Q. And was there any discussion about the duration of the contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>A. At that time I again expressed to Randy that I may not retire for ten years. That wasn\u2019t a problem to Randy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Defense counsel briefly questioned Mackay on this subject in voir dire in aid of an objection based upon the statute of frauds. The district court curtailed the questioning, ruling that it was more appropriately developed in cross-examination. Maekay\u2019s attorney then elicited the following clarification from Mackay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">Q. Mr. Mackay, perhaps to try and clarify, the agreement you had x-eached with Mr. Smith meant that you have could stay on until you decided to x-etire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">A. Yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">Q. And did you indicate how long it might be before you retire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">A. Yes. I told Mr. Smith my plans at that time, x-etirement was ten yeax-s off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9_\">Q. Under the agreement that you had with Mr. Smith, did you undex-stand that if you wanted to you could have chosen to retix-e befox-e the ten yeax-s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">A. <em>The agreement between Mr. Smith and I, I would be employed by Four Rivers for ten years.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">Q. And what if you decided you wanted to retire before ten yeax-s had x-un, could you have done that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">A Nothing was ever said that I could not do it, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">Q. And so under the agx-eement, who detei-mined when it was youx- time to retire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">A Myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">Q. Okay. And if you decided to retire in the first year, do you believe you would have been in breach of your commitment to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-15\">Q. Okay. And so when you wex-e talking with Mr. Smith, you indicated you may not x-etix-e for another ten years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-16\">A. Yes, my plans at that time were to wox-k an additional ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">(emphasis added). On cross-examination, defense counsel explox-ed the discussions between Smith and Mackay as to the terms of the offer of long-term employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-18\">Q. Okay. Ml right. Now, let\u2019s go to the morning of March 3, 2000. Now, you testified that it was sometime in March that you met with Randy, but we\u2019ve introduced an exhibit on your desk pad indicating that March 3 you noted that an offer was made to you by Randy Smith. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-19\">Q. Let\u2019s talk about that. What do you recall him saying to you at the very outset? What did he say? Can you x-emember his exact words, or as close as you can? What was it that was said to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-20\">A. Don\u2019t x-emember his exact words. Said, I\u2019d like to offer you long-term employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-21\">Q. Okay. And after he said that, did he define for you what he meant by \u201clongtex-m\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-22\">A. I think my reply back to Randy was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO7\">Q. Well, no, no, my question is, did he define, and by long-term I mean? Did he do that? Did he tell you what he meant by \u201clong-term\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-23\">A. Not that I recall, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-24\">Q. Okay. Ml right. So you then said something to him, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-25\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-26\">Q. And that had something to do with your retirement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-28\">Q. And what do you x-ecall saying to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">A I told Randy that I, at the present time, did not plan to retire for approximately ten yeax-s. Randy said that was fine with him, when I x-eached that point in time we\u2019d discuss whether I wanted to wox-k longer or whether I wanted to x-etix-e.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZoI\">Q. So what you undex-stood Mr. Smith to say to you was, I\u2019m offex-ing you employment with Four Rivex-s Packing for ten years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-29\">A. Until I wanted to x-etire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-30\">Q. But you said that that would be ten years; cox-rect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-31\">A I said it could be ten yeax-s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-32\">Four Rivex-s\u2019 attorney then examined Mackay about his deposition testimony regarding the dux-ation of the employment offer and Exhibit G:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Q. All right. Now line 21, I asked you the question, \u201cHe, referring to Randy Smith, told me I had a job as long as I wanted one.

Could you explain to me and you\u2019ve indicated that this is a fairly accurate statement of what Randy said, maybe not exactly.\u201d Your attorney then objected, and I again asked another question on line 12 of page 32.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">\u201cWould it be correct to say that you and Randy were talking in generalities about possibilities?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">Your answer starting on line 15?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">A. Would you want me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">Q. Would you read that, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">A. <em>\u201cAt that time I explained to Randy that possible retirement was ten years away and my impression was the offer was good for ten years after that, Then it depended on what I wanted to do after ten years.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">Q. Now, if you would turn to page 92 of the deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">If you\u2019ll tell me when you\u2019re on page 92.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">Q. Thank you. And if you would refer to line 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-18\">Q. Now, this is a question that your attorney asked you, so I\u2019ll ask the question that Mr. Johnson asked you at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-19\">\u201cAnd if you would, Mr. Mackay, tell me everything you recall about the conversation you had with Mr. Smith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-21\">A. \u201cI was in my office at the time. My office and the sales office where Randy had his office adjoined each other. Randy then talked to the salesman at that time, Mr. Palmer. He came in and we B.S.\u2019d like we did every day a little bit. Randy made the comment that I\u2019d like to offer you long-term employment. I told him I expected to work ten years until I retire. He said that was fine, I had a job as long as I wanted, he hoped I would stay until I retired. I told him I wanted to go home and talk to my wife about it. I did that. I returned the next morning and accepted his \u2014 I told Randy I\u2019d like to take the offer. We shook hands and basically the discussion was, how do we get enough onions, I go, let\u2019s go. We just went to work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">(emphasis added). Mackay\u2019s attorney later questioned him about the manner of the offer of employment and his acceptance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-23\">Q. And about the duration of the contract, what was discussed between the two of you on that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-24\">A. I told Randy at the time that I may not retire for ten years. I didn\u2019t know exactly what I was going to do, how long it was going to be before I retired. I told Randy it may be ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-25\">He said, that\u2019s fine, I have no problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-26\">Q. Was it discussed the reason that you could be terminated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-27\">A. Yes. We, for lack of a better term, called it a code of conduct. I was advised not to get a D.W.I. I was advised drugs, alcohol, things like that were out of the question. I had to represent Four Rivers all the time, even on my own time out in public anywhere. I was Four Rivers\u2019 ambassador, for lack of a better term. I represented them constantly. I could not share any privileged information about Four Rivers with anybody else. Couldn\u2019t do business, couldn\u2019t work for anybody else. Couldn\u2019t do business with another shed. Couldn\u2019t share information with another shed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-28\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, let me ask you a question about that. Did you understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>there was a duty of loyalty involved in your\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">A. Yes, most definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">Q. \u2014relationship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">A. If I had chosen to retire, I was retired. I couldn\u2019t go to work \u2014 I couldn\u2019t work for Four Rivers this day and retire and go to work for shed B the next day. I really couldn\u2019t go to work for anybody. If I chose to retire, I was retired. So there definitely was a sense of loyalty or I was bound to Four Rivers \u2014 bound\u2019s maybe not the right word, <em>but my agreement was for ten years, </em>if I was going to work I was going to work for Four Rivers, nobody else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, did you communicate your acceptance of the employment offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">A. Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">Q. Did you accept the employment offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">Q. Okay. And you mentioned that you maybe spoke with your wife about that first or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">A. Yes. We\u2019d been manned a long time. We discussed basically everything. So I went home and told her what Randy and I had talked about, our agreement was going to be the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">She thought it was a good fit. I like the onion business, it fit our lifestyle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, then did you explain to Mr. Smith that you wanted the job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">A. Yes, most definitely I told him I would be very happy to accept his offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">Q. And when did that conversation take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">A The next morning, as I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-17\">Q. And take us through that. Who was all present and what was discussed and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANR\">A. As far as I recall, Randy was in his office, the salesman wasn\u2019t there at the time. We went through our morning bins like we usually do, and I said, I\u2019d like to accept your offer. It fits my lifestyle, fits my wife\u2019s lifestyle and kids, <em>and I definitely would like to have a job for the next ten years.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-18\">Q. Did you and Mr. Smith shake hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7\">A Yes, we did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-19\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">Mackay then testified as to his diary notes, admitted as Exhibit G, relating to the offer of employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-21\">Q: And what makes up Exhibit G?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-22\">A. They appear to be pages out of my diaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-23\">Q. Out of notes that you kept while you were working at Four Rivers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-25\">Q. And, Mr. Mackay, is there an entry in there that makes reference to the discussion you had with Mr. Randy Smith about long-term employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-26\">A. Yes. I believe it will be early February.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-27\">Q. And is that G \u2014 Exhibit G-2? Take a look at Exhibit G-2 and see if that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-28\">A. G-2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-29\">Q. Yes, page 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-30\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-31\">Q. Okay. Identify that for us if you would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-32\">A. It\u2019s a diary entry March 3, which was a Friday, that says, \u201cTalked to Randy about future plans for job. Told me I had a job as long as I wanted one. Randy told me he hoped I stayed until I retire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-33\">Q. And that\u2019s an entry you made in your diary on the same day of the discussion or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-34\">A. Yes, very close.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-35\">Mackay was then cross-examined about the diary entry and the circumstances of his conversations with Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-36\">Q. Now, in your note before you, you stated, \u201cRandy told me he hoped I stayed until I retired.\u201d And you testified yesterday that you told Mr. Smith that you may not retire for ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-37\">A. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-38\">Q. But at that time you had no plans of retiring, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-39\">A. In the back of my mind it was a possibility, but not in the front my mind, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>MR. BIRCH: Your Honor, may I approach the reporter? She has a transcript that I would like to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">MR. BIRCH: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">BY MR. BIRCH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">Q. Handing you this document, Mr. Mackay, now it\u2019s correct that you have had an opportunity to testify before this eoui\u2019t in this ease previously, haven\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">Q. And on that occasion you were sworn to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">Q. And you understood and the appreciated the importance of that oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">Q. And you testified regarding these same issues, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-14\">A. And some more, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">Q. Okay. And if you would please turn in the document I just handed you to page 31. Now you just testified that in the back of your mind retirement was something that might come in the near future or ten years; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-16\">Mr. Mackay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-17\">A. Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-18\">Q. Just testified a moment ago that retirement was something which in the back of your mind might come sooner than the ten years you told Mr. Smith, or you say you told Mr. Smith you were going to retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-19\">A. Yes, that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-20\">Q. If you would refer to page 31 line 12, you were being asked a question by your attorney, and I\u2019m going to read the question and ask you to read the response you made at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-21\">You were asked by your attorney, \u201cAnd did you indicate how long it might be before you retire?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-22\">If you read lines 14 and 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-23\">A. \u2018Tes. I told Mr. Smith my plans at that time, retirement was ten years off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUo\">Q. Your attorney then asked you, \u201cUnder the agreement that you had with Mr. Smith, did you understand that if you wanted you could have chosen to retire before the ten years?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-26\">Would you read lines 19 and 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-27\">A. <em>\u201cThe agreement between Mr. Smith and I, I would be employed by Four Rivers for ten years.\u201d </em>\u201cAnd what if you decided you wanted\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-28\">Q. No, if you\u2019d stop right there, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbK\">And if you got to page 32 you were asked this question by your attorney. \u201cAnd so when you\u201d this is on line 8 \u2014 \u201cand so when you were talking to Mr. Smith, you indicated you may not retire for another ten years?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-29\">If you\u2019d read lines 11 and 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-30\">A. <em>\u201cYes, my plans at that time were to work an additional ten years.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-31\">Q. <em>Okay. So based on your testimony then and now, as I understand it, you had a contract or you believed you had a contract or an agreement with Randy Smith to be employed by Four Rivers for ten years. That\u2019s what you said.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-32\">A. <em>Yes, </em>unless I wished to retire quicker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9J\">Q. But you didn\u2019t say that when you were under oath previously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-33\">A. I don\u2019t believe you asked me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-34\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-35\">The only other testimony relating to the duration of Maekay\u2019s employment was developed by defense counsel in his cross-examination of Macka/s wife, Martha:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-36\">Q. And you have a specific recollection of Mr. Mackay talking to you about a long contract with Four Rivers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-37\">A. Well yes. That\u2019s very important in one\u2019s life, one\u2019s livelihood. Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-38\">Q. So let\u2019s be a bit more specific. You claim that he came home and talked to you about an offer. What was this offer that he told you had been made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-39\">A. Well, I can\u2019t remember specifics of the offer, I just know that he came home, we visited about it. That\u2019s a long time ago to remember the specifics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-40\">Q. So all you recall is that he came home and talked to you about a job offer, that\u2019s it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-41\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Q. And you have no recollection of the duration of this claimed offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">A. He said long term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Q. Okay. Other than that you have no recollection of what that meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">A Until he chose to retire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">Q. So your recollection now is that he came home and told you he had a long-term offer until he retired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">If the testimony emphasized by italics were the only evidence presented at trial as to the duration of Mackay\u2019s employment offer, a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the offer of employment was for a fixed period of ten years. Our decision in <em>Burton v. Atomic Workers Federal Credit Union, </em>119 Idaho 17, 803 P.2d 518 (1990) would clearly require reversal of the judgment and a remand of the action for trial with an appropriate instruction relating to the statute of frauds. However, in order to accept Four Rivers\u2019 thesis advanced in this appeal that the offer of employment was for a ten-year period, we would have to accept excerpts of testimony extracted in such a manner as to distort the substance of Mackay\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">We cannot do so. Rather, viewing this testimony in its entirety, we conclude that a reasonable jury could not find that Four Rivers, acting through Smith, extended an offer of employment for a ten year period. Rather, accepting the veracity of the Maekays\u2019 testimony (the only basis upon which one could find that any offer of employment of any duration beyond that of an at-will employee), the only reasonable conclusion that could be reached by a jury was that Mackay was offered long-term employment until he chose to retire and that Mackay had communicated his intention to work for as long as ten years prior to his retirement. As we held in <em>Mackay I, </em>a contract of employment until such time as Mackay decided to retire does not fall within the statute of frauds. Therefore, the district court properly denied Four Rivers\u2019 request for a statute of frauds jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">B. There is substantial, competent evidence to support the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Four Rivers argues that the jury verdict is not supported by substantial, competent evidence because no reasonable jury would find that a new and financially-strapped employer would extend an offer of long-term employment to its employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantial and competent evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Uhl v. Ballard Med. Prods., Inc., </em>138 Idaho 653, 657, 67 P.3d 1265, 1269 (2003). While there was evidence in the record that Four Rivers experienced financial difficulties, there was also evidence that Four Rivers offered Mackay long term employment. Mackay testified that Smith offered him the contract, that he consulted his wife about the offer, and that he accepted the offer and explained to Smith that he might not retire for up to ten years. Maekay\u2019s diary notes also referred to Smith\u2019s offer of long-term employment. Further, Mackay testified that he refused to sign the proposed written employment contract drafted by Four Rivers because they did not express the long-term nature of his employment, and that he worked throughout the period of the injunction to keep Four Rivers\u2019 prospects alive because he wanted to protect his interest in the long-term position. Mackay\u2019s wife also testified that Four Rivers offered Mackay a \u201clong-term contract\u201d that was intended to last until Mackay retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">Four Rivers also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding that Four Rivers breached the long-term employment agreement, pointing to evidence that suggests Mackay was terminated because he had failed to fulfill his employment obligations. However, testimony in the record indicates that after the first season, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>petitors often outbid Four Rivers, based upon the prices Smith was willing to pay for onions, causing Mackay to struggle to obtain onions. Additionally, there was evidence supporting the inference that the injunction damaged Four Rivers\u2019 reputation, negatively impacting Mackay\u2019s ability to perform his onion procurement duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Despite conflicting evidence in the record, a reasonable mind could have reached the conclusions reached by the jury. The jury weighed the parties\u2019 conflicting evidence, assessed the credibility of the witnesses, and determined Mackay\u2019s version of the facts to be more probably true. Since substantial evidence in the record supports the jury\u2019s findings, we decline to second guess the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">C. Mackay is entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u201cActions brought for breach of an employment contract are considered commercial transactions and are subject to the attorney fee provision of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).\u201d <em>Willie v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>138 Idaho 131, 136, 59 P.3d 302, 307 (2002) (citing <em>Northwest Bec-Corp. v. Home Living Serv., </em>136 Idaho 835, 842, 41 P.3d 263, 270 (2002)). Mackay has prevailed as to all matters on appeal and is therefore entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We affirm the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict. Attorney fees and costs on appeal are awarded to Mackay.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-10\">Chief Justice EISMANN and Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and W. JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. Four Rivers\u2019 argument ignores an obvious point. It is undisputed that Four Rivers employed Mackay. Thus, some form of employment contract necessarily existed between the parties. The dispute at trial actually centered on the question whether the terms of that contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>included a mutual agreement as to the duration of Mackay\u2019s employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-11\">. Mackay contends that Four Rivers' challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict is not properly before this Court because Four Rivers did not raise the challenge below. However, \"[t]he failure of a party to move for a directed verdict, for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial shall not preclude appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence when proper assignment of error is made in the appellate court.\" I.R.C.P. 50(b). The issue of whether the jury's verdict is supported by substantial and competent evidence is properly before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
