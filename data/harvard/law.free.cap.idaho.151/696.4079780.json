The Commission found that this constituted employment-related misconduct which rendered Locker ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Locker was employed by Logan\u2019s Food-town from July 17, 2008 through June 1, 2009. During her interview for employment, Locker informed assistant manager Brian Cruz (Cruz) that she suffered from multiple sclerosis (MS). Logan\u2019s Foodtown hired Locker and employed her in a variety of positions, accommodating Locker\u2019s MS-related limitations by scheduling her on days that did not involve moving freight and allowing other employees to do heavy lifting or above-the-head reaching on Locker\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In April 2009, Locker took a six-week long medical leave in order to undergo and recover from a hysterectomy. She returned to work on June 1,2009. Locker had expressed interest in becoming the deli manager, and she took up that role upon her return. On Locker\u2019s first day back to work, she engaged in a conversation with manager Barb Chandler (Chandler), which she characterized as \u201cgirl talk.\u201d In that conversation, Locker and Chandler spoke about hysterectomies. Locker told Chandler that the surgery had been more difficult than she had expected, that she \u201cstill felt weak,\u201d and that being on her feet at work had increased the bleeding she was experiencing after the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">On this first day back to work, after two to three hours performing inventory and freight duties, Locker informed Chandler and Cruz that she could not continue to work. Although Locker later testified that balance problems caused by MS were causing her difficulty at work that day, both Cruz and Chandler testified that Locker did not mention her MS when she told them that she needed to leave work. Locker testified that she did not tell Cruz or Chandler that she was in pain, however, the two managers testified to the contrary. According to Chandler, Locker was crying and in visible pain. Chandler informed Greg Jarolimek (Jarolimek), manager and part owner of Logan\u2019s Foodtown, that Locker left work because she had not yet healed from the hysterectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Jarolimek testified that when Locker returned to work two days later, he told her he needed \u201csome information from a doctor that would let me know what limitations she might have.... Or if she actually needed more time off, you know, something that would give me something that I could work with, you know, to plan for the next two or three weeks, you know, if she took more time.\u201d Jarolimek testified that Locker never provided a medical release as requested,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which \u201cmade it hard for me to determine what she could or could not do.... [If] you bring me the information, I can determine what we can do, what changes we need to make----\u201d According to Jarolimek, he told Locker that \u201cif you gave me something from your doctor, you know, so that we can determine what you can do and what you can\u2019t do, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">Later that week, Locker returned to Logan\u2019s Foodtown to check the work schedule. She had an impromptu meeting with Cruz, Chandler, and a third manager. There is conflicting evidence in the record regarding the conversation that day. Cruz testified that he told Locker \u201cI was concerned for her safety and her well being and that ... I needed a safety note from the doctor or a release note and she fired at me and she said are you firing me and I said, no, I\u2019m not firing you, just concerned for your safety and until I get a note there is nothing I can do.\u201d Cruz also testified that \u201cI just talked to her about her safety and well being and how I was under the impression of a doctor\u2019s note that I needed, so I could tell what she could and could not do.\u201d According to Chandler, however, she heard Cruz tell Locker that Locker \u201cneeded to be able to do the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>details of a deli manager and that he had to let her go, because she cannot do that work entailed in that \u2014 in the lifting.\u201d Locker testified that she left the meeting with the clear impression that she was no longer employed by Logan\u2019s Foodtown. Locker left work and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Locker filed for unemployment benefits, and the Idaho Department of Labor found her ineligible for benefits because she had quit without cause. Locker appealed. The appeals examiner affirmed the eligibility determination on alternative grounds, finding that Logan\u2019s Foodtown had terminated Locker\u2019s employment and that Locker had committed misconduct by failing to produce the requested medical release. Locker appealed the issue to the Industrial Commission and asserted, for the first time, claims arising under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The Commission concluded that Locker\u2019s FMLA claims were waived as untimely and for lack of evidence that the Act was applicable, adopted the appeals examiner\u2019s findings of fact,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirmed the appeals examiner\u2019s decision denying Locker\u2019s request for unemployment benefits. Locker appeals the Commission\u2019s order and raises claims arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Idaho Human Rights Act (IHRA). Locker and the Department of Labor request attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">This Court upholds decisions of the Industrial Commission unless (1) the Commission has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its powers; (2) the Commission's findings of fact are not based on substantial and competent evidence; (3) the findings of fact, order or award were procured by fraud; (4) as a matter of law, the findings of fact do not support the order or award. I.C. \u00a7 72-732. When this Court reviews a decision of the Industrial Commission, we exercise free review over questions of law. <em>Funes v. Aardema Dairy, </em>150 Idaho 7, 10, 244 P.3d 151, 154 (2010) (citations omitted). However, our review of questions of fact is limited to a determination of whether substantial and competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial and competent evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. Because the Commission is the fact finder, its conclusions on the credibility and weight of the evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">A. The Commission\u2019s conclusion that Locker was terminated for misconduct is supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Article V, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution, conferring jurisdiction upon this Court to review orders of the Commission, applies to unemployment compensation cases. <em>Idaho Mut. Ben. Ass\u2019n v. Robison, </em>65 Idaho 793, 800, 154 P.2d 156, 159 (1944). This section provides, in pertinent part: \u201cOn appeal from orders of the industrial accident board the court shall be limited to a review of questions of law.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Idaho Const, art. V, \u00a7 9. Thus, this Court is \u201cconstitutionally compelled to defer to the Industrial Commission\u2019s findings of fact where supported by substantial and competent evidence.\u201d <em>Teffer v. Twin Falls School Dist. No. 411, </em>102 Idaho 439, 439, 631 P.2d 610, 610 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">Locker asserts that she was discharged because MS prevented her from performing the deli manager role and that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that she was discharged for committing misconduct is not supported by the record. We ai\u2019e constitutionally constrained to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">An employee is ineligible for unemployment benefits if she was \u201cdischarged for misconduct in connection with h[er] employment.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(5). The employer must prove misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Appeals Exam\u2019r of Idaho </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Labor v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>131 Idaho 318, 320-21, 955 P.2d 1097, 1099-100 (1998). Misconduct may take the form of \u201cwilful, intentional disregard of the employer\u2019s interest; a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules; or a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees.\u201d <em>Johns v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>78 Idaho 544, 548, 307 P.2d 217, 219 (1957). Misconduct does not include \u201c[m]ere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, [or] failure of good performance as the result of inability or incapacity.\u201d IDAPA 09.01.30.275.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Commission determined that the standards of behavior test applied to Locker\u2019s case. That test requires the employer to prove that (1) the employee\u2019s conduct fell below a standard of behavior (2) which the employer subjectively expected of its employee, and (3) that the employer\u2019s expectation was objectively reasonable. <em>Adams v. Aspen Water, Inc., </em>150 Idaho 408, 413, 247 P.3d 635, 640 (2011). In order to be reasonable, an employer\u2019s expectation should flow naturally from the employment relationship or be communicated to the employee. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, Logan\u2019s Foodtown communicated to Locker that it expected her to produce a medical release that would clarify what types of work she was able to perform, as is demonstrated by the testimony of both Cruz and Jarolimek, and therefore the second and third prongs of the test are satisfied. The remaining question, then, is whether Locker\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">This Court has recognized insubordination as one form of conduct that violates the standard-of-behavior test. <em>Avery v. B &amp; B Rental Toilets, </em>97 Idaho 611, 614, 549 P.2d 270, 273 (1976). Insubordination is an employee\u2019s \u201cdeliberate or wilful refusal ... to obey a reasonable order or directive which an employer is authorized to give and entitled to have obeyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When reviewing claims of insubordination, this Court looks to the facts of each case to determine whether an employee\u2019s conduct is reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, an employee\u2019s expression of disagreement or discontentment to her employer may not be an act of insubordination. <em>Folks v. Moscow School Dist. No. 281, </em>129 Idaho 833, 838, 933 P.2d 642, 647 (1997) (holding that employee lacked requisite intent where the interaction that led to her discharge was emotionally charged and instigated by stress); <em>Avery, </em>97 Idaho at 615, 549 P.2d at 274 (stating that the law does not require \u201cunswerving docility and servility\u201d of employees, and that \u201c[a] single incident of comparatively nonserious disrespect by complaining and arguing is not misconduct.\u201d); <em>cf. Pimley v. Best Values, Inc., </em>132 Idaho 432, 435, 974 P.2d 78, 81 (1999) (holding that employee\u2019s use of vulgar, disrespectful language in presence of retail customers fell below employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior). Likewise, an employee who informs his employer about circumstances that prevented compliance may protect himself against discharge for misconduct. <em>Whittier v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>137 Idaho 75, 79, 44 P.3d 1130, 1134 (2002). Thus, the applicable law takes the social realities of the workplace into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We are unable to conclude, as a matter of law, that an employee has not willfully and deliberately disregarded the employer\u2019s order when the employee has both failed to comply with her employer\u2019s order and also failed to communicate any justification for her lack of compliance. <em>Id. </em>(stating that employee \u201cshould have communicated to [his supervisor] the obstacles preventing him from performing her order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Thus, although there was a substantial conflict in the evidence presented to the Commission, we consider whether there is substantial evidence in the record which supports the Commission\u2019s factual determination that Locker was discharged for insubordination. It is uncontradicted that Locker did not provide a release to Logan\u2019s Foodtown. Although Jarolimek and Cruz each informed Locker that she could not return to work until she provided a medical release that \u201cshowfed] that she could perform the job duties,\u201d Locker did no more than make a single phone call to request the release. When she was rebuffed by her surgeon\u2019s nurse, Locker neither pursued other avenues of obtaining a medical release, nor took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>simple step of informing her employer that she was experiencing difficulty in obtaining the release. As was the case in <em>Whittier, </em>Locker both failed to comply with her employer\u2019s reasonable directive and failed to communicate the circumstances that prevented her compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Additionally, while Locker contends that she lacked the physical capacity to perform the deli manager role because of MS, she did not express that concern to anyone at Logan\u2019s Foodtown when her continued employment was conditioned on receipt of a medical release. Rather, the very day Locker returned to work after a six-week long medical leave for a hysterectomy, she discussed difficulties associated with that surgery with a female manager and soon after informed management that she could not continue to work that day. While Logan\u2019s Foodtown was aware that Locker suffered from MS, Locker\u2019s attempt to obtain the requested medical release from her surgeon indicates that she understood that Cruz and Jarolimek believed that any limitations on her ability to work were related to the surgery. A reasonable person could conclude that if Locker believed her inability to work was MS-related, she would have both informed Logan\u2019s Foodtown as such and requested accommodations similar to those she had received in the past. Thus, substantial and competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Locker was not terminated because she lacked the capacity to work, but rather because she failed to provide the medical release that Logan\u2019s Foodtown requested in order to determine the types of work she was able to perform. We therefore affirm the decision and order of the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">B. Locker waived all claims arising under the ADA and IHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Locker raised FMLA claims before the Commission, but she raises ADA and IHRA claims for the first time on appeal. \u201cIssues not raised before the Industrial Commission and presented for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this Court.\u201d <em>Creps v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>149 Idaho 684, 640, 238 P.3d 1284, 1290 (2010) (citing <em>Higgins v. Larry Miller Subaru-Mitsubishi, </em>145 Idaho 1, 6, 175 P.3d 163, 168 (2007)). Accordingly, we do not address Locker\u2019s ADA and IHRA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">C. Under <em>Smith v. Washington County, </em>we may not award attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Ml parties to this appeal request attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. However, \u201cI.C. \u00a7 12-117(1) does not allow a court to award attorney fees in an appeal from an administrative decision.\u201d <em>Smith v. Washington Cnty., </em>150 Idaho 388, 391, 247 P.3d 615, 618 (2010). Mthough the Department of Labor and Logan\u2019s Foodtown are the prevailing parties, we lack the power to award attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">We affirm the decision and order of the Industrial Commission finding Locker ineligible for unemployment benefits. Costs, but not attorney fees, to Respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b733-12\">Chief Justice BURDICK and Justices EISMANN, J. JONES and W. JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. According to Locker, a nurse denied her request to obtain a medical release from her surgeon\u2019s office.
