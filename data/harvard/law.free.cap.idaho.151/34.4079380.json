Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to allow the removal of trees within and adjacent to an access-road easement in favor of Appellants running over property belonging to their neighbors, the Comettos. Because there is substantial evidence that the trees do not unreasonably hinder maintenance or snow removal, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. The district court\u2019s denial of the parties\u2019 requests for attorney fees also is affirmed, as neither party prevailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b68-20\">This dispute involves several parcels of property in a forested rural portion of Bonner County, Idaho. An access road travels for roughly eight miles from the nearest county highway, crossing National Forest land along the way, before first reaching property belonging to Thomas and Lori Cometto, Respondents. The road enters the western edge of the Comettos\u2019 parcel and exits to the east, crossing onto one of two properties owned by David and Kathy Caldwell. It then proceeds through the Caldwells\u2019 second parcel and onward to land owned by Patricia St. Angelo and Lawrence and Theresa Seiler. St. Angelo, the Caldwells, and the Seilers are Appellants in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Until 1997, the access road ran in a straight line directly through the Comettos\u2019 parcel and was subject to a deeded easement benefiting Appellants. At that time, the Comettos rerouted the road so that it circumvented the buildings on their property, a project that added four new sharp turns to the road. The new road is also narrow, spanning just eleven to twelve feet in some places.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Shortly thereafter, two of the Appellants\u2019 predecessors in interest filed separate suits against the Comettos, alleging that the new road illegally injured their easement rights under I.C. \u00a7 55-313. To settle that litigation, in 2000 the Appellants and/or their predecessors in interest signed an easement agreement with the Comettos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement granted Appellants an easement over the newly constructed access road, \u201cwhich easement is believed to lie within the West thirty (30) feet, the North thirty (30) feet, and the East thirty (30) feet of the Cometto Property.\u201d It was recorded and, by its terms, is appurtenant to the Appellants\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Appellants filed this action in October of 2007, seeking an order quieting title to the new easement at a full thirty feet in width, a declaratory judgment that the Comettos must upgrade the road to the same standards as the previous road, an injunction against placing obstacles in the right-of-way, and other relief. Just prior to the bench trial, Appellants moved to amend their pleading to add a quiet-title claim based on a different supposed sixty-foot-wide deeded easement. On the first day of trial, the court responded to the motion by bifurcating the proceedings to allow the parties to later address easement claims other than those arising from the easement agreement. A three-day trial followed, focusing exclusively on the scope of the easement agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">After trial, the district court issued an Amended Partial Judgment in which it quieted title to the easement in favor of Appellants, incorporating a new professional survey of the road.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held that the agreement conveyed a primary easement over the new travelway, as well as a three-foot-wide secondary easement along each edge of the road up to a maximum of thirty total feet in width. It held that, in areas where the travelway was less than fourteen feet wide, the secondary easement would expand so that the total easement width would equal twenty feet. Although the partial judgment required the Comettos to keep debris and obstacles out of the easement, it expressly precluded Appellants from removing any of the nineteen mature trees from the secondary easement. The Amended Partial Judgment included a Certificate of Final Judgment as to Appellants\u2019 claims under the easement agreement pursuant to I.R.C.P. 54(b)(1). The court also issued an order denying the parties\u2019 cross-motions for costs and attorney fees, holding that there had been no prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">Appellants appealed from the Amended Partial Judgment and from the order denying their motion for attorney fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They assert that there is no substantial evidence supporting the district court\u2019s refusal to al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>low mature trees to be removed from within the secondary easement. They also contend that the district court\u2019s ruling on attorney fees was premature, as they have further claims remaining to be resolved. The Comettos respond that Appellants are simply asking this Court to second-guess the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the trees along the access road. They also filed a cross-appeal, asserting that the district court should have awarded them attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party below.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">III.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">1. Whether there is substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s refusal to allow or require trees within the secondary access-road easement to be removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">2.

Whether either party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">IV.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">This Court reviews the trial court\u2019s findings after a bench trial for clear error. I.R.C.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings of fact in a bench trial will be liberally construed on appeal in favor of the judgment entered, in view of the trial court\u2019s role as trier of fact.\u201d <em>Beckstead v. Price, </em>146 Idaho 57, 61, 190 P.3d 876, 880 (2008) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Larsen, </em>136 Idaho 402, 405, 34 P.3d 1085, 1088 (2001)). Factual findings will be upheld if supported by substantial, competent evidence, even if the parties presented conflicting evidence at trial. <em>Griffin v. Anderson, </em>144 Idaho 376, 378, 162 P.3d 755, 757 (2007). By contrast, this Court freely reviews issues of law. <em>Neider v. Shaw, </em>138 Idaho 503, 506, 65 P.3d 525, 528 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">V.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">A. The District Court\u2019s Refusal to Allow Mature Trees Within the Secondary Easement to Be Removed Was Supported by Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Neither party contests the district court\u2019s holding regarding the location and width of the access-road easement. Appellants, however, argue that they should be permitted to remove trees within the secondary easement that runs along the established travelway. Despite the fact that the district court granted a three-foot secondary easement along each side of the travelway, it declined to allow any trees to be removed. It held that the \u201cexisting mature trees within the secondary easement have not been shown to unreasonably interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 ability to maintain the travelway, and that removal of existing mature trees is precluded as it would constitute an alteration that unnecessarily burdens the servient tenement.\u201d The Caldwells testified that a number of trees are located just adjacent to the travel-way, making travel difficult. They contend that the trees present the greatest problem during the winter, as they impede or damage the Caldwells\u2019 heavy plowing equipment and make it difficult to store snow in large piles near the travelway.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The easement agreement conveyed to Appellants \u201can easement over and across the Cometto property, for the benefit of their respective properties,\u201d located on the newly constructed roadway. When construing an instrument granting an easement, the court must consider the intent of the parties and the circumstances in existence at the time the easement was granted. <em>Kolouch v. Kramer, </em>120 Idaho 65, 69, 813 P.2d 876, 880 (1991). \u201cWhere the grant or reservation of an easement is general in its terms, use of the easement includes those uses which are incidental or necessary to the reasonable and proper enjoyment of the easement, but is limited to those that burden the servient estate as little as possible.\u201d <em>Walker v. Boozer, </em>140 Idaho 451, 455, 95 P.3d 69, 73 (2004) (quoting <em>Abbott v. Nampa Sch. Dist. No. 131, </em>119 Idaho 544, 548, 808 P.2d 1289, 1293 (1991)). Idaho recognizes the existence of secondary easements, which convey the right to repair and maintain the primary easement so long as such activity is reasonable. <em>Drew </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>v. Sorensen, </em>133 Idaho 534, 538, 989 P.2d 276, 280 (1999); <em>see also Conley v. Whittlesey, </em>133 Idaho 265, 271, 985 P.2d 1127, 1133 (1999) (stating that secondary easements to repair \u00e1nd maintain the primary easement cannot enlarge the burden on the servient estate); <em>Simonson v. Moon, </em>72 Idaho 39, 48, 237 P.2d 93, 98 (1951) (recognizing that secondary easements exist as to ditch rights \u201cfor the purpose of cleaning and maintenance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">There was substantial evidence to justify the district court\u2019s finding that removing mature trees within the secondary easement would unreasonably burden the Comettos\u2019 estate. The district court provided the secondary easement along the length of the access road onto which the Caldwells could push snow. It also allowed two snow-storage areas adjacent to the road on the west side of their property, the portion furthest away from the Caldwells\u2019 parcel. The court reasoned that the Caldwells could store additional snow on their own property. The Caldwells own at least five pieces of heavy snow removal equipment, and although they have collided with trees before, there was no testimony that any specific trees make the road impassable in the winter. On appeal, rather than identifying particularly problematic individual trees, the Appellants seem to assert that all the trees within the secondary easement should be removed. Further, the district court had the benefit of a number of photographs that Appellants introduced at trial but did not provide to this Court on appeal. The district court\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellants expend considerable effort arguing that the Comettos violated I.C. \u00a7 55-313 in 1997 when they reconfigured the road so that a number of trees are directly adjacent to the travelway. This statute allows the servient-estate owner to relocate an access road when doing so does not injure interested parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Statewide Constr., Inc. v. Pietri, </em>150 Idaho 423, 429, 247 P.3d 650, 656 (2011). The Comettos contend that any claims under \u00a7 55-313 have already been litigated and settled by the easement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Whether I.C. \u00a7 55-313 prevents the Comettos\u2019 from realigning the access road is not an issue before this Court. The district court below expressly limited the bench trial to interpreting the scope of Appellants\u2019 easement rights under the easement agreement and did not address any \u00a7 55-313 arguments in its Amended Partial Judgment. Whether Appellants have any lingering claims under \u00a7 55-313 or whether such claims are blocked by res judicata are issues that remain to be resolved in the next stage of the bifurcated proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Declining to Award Attorney Fees and Costs After Issuing a Partial Judgment Because No Party Prevailed</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">The district court below bifurcated the proceedings, separating Appellants\u2019 claims under the easement agreement from any other claims relating to the easement. It then found that there was no prevailing party and denied each side\u2019s cross-motions for attorney fees. Appellants contend that it was premature for the district court to enter this order because midway through a bifurcated action is too soon to identify a prevailing party. Both sides also argue that the district court should have awarded them attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">\n<em>1. A Partial Judgment Certified Under I.R.C.P. 51(b)(1) Is a Final Order for Which the Court May Award Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">Costs are generally allowed as a matter of right to the prevailing party. I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(A). The courts may also award attorney fees to a prevailing party pursuant to statute or contract. I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). For both costs and fees, Rule 54(d)(1)(B) governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the determination of who, if anyone, is the prevailing party. I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B), 54(e)(1). This rule provides that \u201cthe trial court shall in its sound discretion consider the <em>final judgment </em>or result of the action.\u201d I.R.C.P. ' 54(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Judges are therefore empowered to award costs and fees pertaining either to a final judgment or to an action that has been completely adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The district court\u2019s ruling on costs and fees was not premature because a partial judgment is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as required in Rule 54(d)(1)(B). A judgment is final if it has been certified as such pursuant to Rule 54(b)(1). I.R.C.P. 54(a). A partial judgment certified as final is not subject to revision. I.R.C.P. 54(b)(1). The Amended Partial Judgment in this action has been certified as a final judgment with respect to Appellants\u2019 claims under the easement agreement. Because the judgment is final and is not subject to the court\u2019s revision, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to award costs and fees. The district court therefore could identify a prevailing party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>2. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Holding That Neither Party Prevailed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The court\u2019s decision as to which party prevailed is subject to abuse-of-diseretion review. <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 255, 258, 939 P.2d 574, 577 (1997). In examining whether a court has abused its discretion, this Court considers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">(1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of this discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\"><em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Idaho Power, </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991). To identify the prevailing party, the court considers the partial judgment \u201cin relation to the relief sought by the requested parties.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B). The district court may apportion costs and fees between the parties, and where the parties have each succeeded on some issues but not on others, the district court may find that neither party has prevailed. <em>E.g. Trilogy Network Sys., Inc. v. Johnson, </em>144 Idaho 844, 847-48, 172 P.3d 1119, 1122-23 (2007); <em>Israel v. Leachman, </em>139 Idaho 24, 27, 72 P.3d 864, 867 (2003). Here, the district court\u2019s decision satisfied the first element of the abuse-of-discretion analysis by recognizing that its decision was discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">The court below also acted within the bounds of its discretion and through an exercise of reason when it found that none of the parties had prevailed. Appellants sought to quiet title to a thirty-foot-wide easement pursuant to the easement agreement and to enjoin the Comettos from placing structures or obstacles in or near the roadway. Appellants prevailed in part in that the court quieted title in their favor both to the roadway itself as well as a secondary easement, which included two snow-storage areas. The Comettos must also keep the roadway clear. Appellants seek a number of other kinds of relief, including the right to upgrade and realign the road, but these claims have yet to be fully adjudicated, as they rest on other easement theories. The Comettos prevailed in part because the court found that the agreement conveyed an easement that, in most places, does not span a full thirty feet. They also may retain the mature trees along the travelway, even those within the secondary easement. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>there had been no prevailing party in the first stage of the bifurcated proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">C. Neither Party Is Entitled to Attorney Fees on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellants requested attorney fees on appeal under the terms of the easement agreement, which provides for attorney fees and costs on appeal to be awarded to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in any dispute relating to the interpretation or enforcement of the agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants do not prevail on either of the two issues they raised on appeal: (1) whether the district court should have allowed the trees within the secondary easement to be cut down; and (2) whether the court should have awarded costs and fees below to Appellants. Since they do not prevail on appeal, Appellants are not entitled to attorney fees under the easement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Comettos claim attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), which mandates a fee award to the prevailing party in civil actions involving commercial transactions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Blimka v. My Web Wholesaler, LLC, </em>143 Idaho 723, 728, 152 P.3d 594, 599 (2007). They also seek fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121, which allows courts discretion to award fees to the prevailing party in appeals that have been brought or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Berg v. Kendall, </em>147 Idaho 571, 579, 212 P.3d 1001, 1009 (2009). Where both parties prevail in part on appeal, this Court may deny fees. <em>See Boll v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>140 Idaho 334, 344-45, 92 P.3d 1081, 1091-92 (2004) (finding no prevailing party under \u00a7 12-121 because both the appeal and the cross-appeal failed); <em>Keller v. Inland Metals All Weather Cond., Inc., </em>139 Idaho 233, 241, 76 P.3d 977, 985 (2003) (referring to \u00a7 12-120(3)). While the Comettos correctly note that Appellants were simply inviting this Court to second-guess the district court\u2019s findings regarding trees along the easement, the Comettos also cross-appealed the district court\u2019s ruling on costs and attorney fees. Since they did not prevail on their cross-appeal, as discussed above, the Comettos are not entitled to attorney fees on appeal. Without a prevailing party, it is not necessary to discuss whether this appeal involves a \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d under \u00a7 12-120(3) or whether the appeal was brought or defended unreasonably under \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The Comettos also requested fees under the easement agreement, but for the reasons cited above, they are not the prevailing party under this contract provision and therefore are not entitled to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">The district court\u2019s Amended Partial Judgment is affirmed, as there is substantial evidence supporting its decision to allow the Comettos to keep the mature trees along the easement. The district court\u2019s order denying the parties\u2019 cross-motions for attorney fees is affirmed, as no party prevailed below. Neither party is entitled to attorney fees or costs on appeal because neither prevailed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">. The agreement is signed by Kathleen Caldwell, Appellant, David and Bonnie Crum, St. Angelo's predecessors in interest, and Arlan Lemen, who is the Seilers\u2019 predecessor in interest. Jerry and Judith Campbell also signed the agreement on behalf of their family trust. They are predecessors in interest to both of the Caldwells\u2019 properties. The Caldwells have owned a residential property near the Comettos' parcel since 1998, but did not obtain their second property until 2004, which is a largely unimproved neighboring parcel. The unimproved parcel lies directly to the east of the Comettos' property; it is the parcel through which the access road travels immediately after leaving the Comettos\u2019 land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. Although they were plaintiffs in this action and participated in discovery, St. Angelo and the Seilers did not actually participate in the trial. Along with Lori Cometto, the Caldwells were the only witnesses called on Appellants\u2019 behalf. The district court's Amended Partial Judgment nonetheless applies to all Appellants, not just the Caldwells.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-15\">.

A court may \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims or parties\u201d in an action if the district court finds there is no just reason to delay judgment.

It is true that an action has not been fully adjudicated until all the claims and defenses at issue have been resolved, but I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B) also provides that a court may award fees when it has issued a \"final judgment.\u201d Because a Rule 54(b) partial judgment is defined as a \"final judgment\u201d under I.R.C.P. 54(a), a court may issue fees pertaining to that portion of the action. It might well be preferable in bifurcated cases for the district court to wait to rule on motions for costs and attorney fees until the entire action has concluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">. Paragraph 12 of the easement agreement provides in full: \"In the event that any dispute arises regarding the interpretation, application, breach or enforcement of this provision of this Agreement, then the prevailing party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover their attorney fees and costs incurred, including attorney fees and costs on appeal.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">.
