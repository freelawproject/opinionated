Reed Taylor is the founder of AIA Insurance, Inc. (AIA Insurance), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIA Services, and at the time he negotiated the Stock Redemption Agreement, Reed Taylor was the majority shareholder of AIA Services. AIA Services failed to pay a $1.5 million note issued to Reed Taylor under the Stock Redemption Agreement when it became due on October 20, 1995. Reed Taylor and AIA Services agreed to modify the Stock Redemption Agreement and entered into the Stock Redemption Restructure Agreement, but thereafter, AIA Services failed to make certain payments that had become due under the new terms. On January 29, 2007, Reed Taylor filed suit against AIA Services, AIA Insurance and John Taylor, seeking to recover the amounts owed on the two promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">On June 17, 2009, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Respondents and dismissed six of Reed Taylor\u2019s causes of action upon finding the Stock Redemption Agreement to be illegal and unenforceable under the 1995 version of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, which restricts a corporation to use only earned surplus and, under certain circumstances, capital surplus when redeeming its shares. Reed Taylor appeals, arguing that the Stock Redemption Agreement complies with I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 and that even if the Stock Redemption Agreement fails to comply with I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, it is still enforceable under numerous theories. Reed Taylor also argues that the district court committed multiple errors in its proceedings. Respondents cross appeal, arguing that all causes of action in Reed Taylor\u2019s Complaint should be dismissed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">Reed Taylor is the founder of AIA Insurance, an insurance agency based in Lewiston, Idaho, which sells insurance products to farmers and members of various agricultural growers associations. Reed Taylor was the majority shareholder of AIA Services, a holding company which has wholly-owned AIA Insurance at all times relevant to this lawsuit. In 1995, he held 63 percent of approximately 973,000 outstanding shares of AIA Services common stock and served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of AIA Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">AIA Services noticed a meeting of shareholders to be held on March 7, 1995, to consider various transactions, including exercising an option to purchase 500,000 of Reed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Taylor\u2019s 613,494 shares of AIA Services common stock for $7.5 million. At the March 7, 1995 special meeting of shareholders, AIA Services shareholders approved the purchase of Reed Taylor\u2019s shares as well as other transactions. The shareholders were not provided information as to the source of funds from which Reed Taylor\u2019s shares would be purchased. The plan to redeem Reed Taylor\u2019s shares was not consummated because AIA Services failed to raise the necessary funds through the private placement of Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and Warrants, which the board approved by resolution on January 12, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">AIA Services sent a letter to its shareholders announcing that it could not proceed with the previously approved plan and announced a new plan for reorganization, which included redeeming all of Reed Taylor\u2019s AIA Services common stock for $7.5 million and other consideration, including airplanes and debt forgiveness. The letter sought shareholder approval to cancel the previously authorized Series B Preferred Stock and to amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Series C Preferred Stock from 150,000 to 500,000 shares. The letter informed the shareholders that the sale of the additional Series C Preferred Stock would be used to retire certain Series A Preferred Stock, to retire bank debt and/or to fund the balance of the redemption price due to Reed Taylor. The letter was accompanied by a Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated June 1, 1995 (\u201cPPM\u201d), offering up to 500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $10 per share. The PPM explained: \u201cAssuming the Company sells the maximum number of Shares offered hereby, the net proceeds from this private placement are expected to be sufficient____If the Company sells only the minimum number of shares, additional financing will be required to complete the proposed reorganization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">On July 12, 1995, AIA Services issued an Amended Notice of Special Meeting of AIA Services Shareholders to occur on July 18, 1995, accompanied by a Disclosure Statement. The notice states that certain transactions contemplated as part of the new reorganization plan require shareholder approval. Neither the notice nor the accompanying disclosure mentions the redemption of Reed Taylor\u2019s common stock. At the July 18 meeting, the shareholders were not asked to approve, and did not approve, the redemption of Reed Taylor\u2019s common stock. However, on that day, AIA Services\u2019 Board of Directors authorized the redemption of Reed Tayloi\u2019\u2019s common stock for $7.5 million and other consideration. The resolution provides that \u201cthe amount of the down payment for Mr. Taylor\u2019s Common Stock which [AIA Services] may be able to afford will depend on the amount of proceeds from commercial loans and from the sale of additional Series C Preferred Stock and attendant warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">AIA Services and Reed Taylor entered into a Stock Redemption Agreement effective July 22, 1995, to redeem all of Reed Taylor\u2019s common stock for $7.5 million and other consideration. AIA Services originally agreed to pay $1.5 million at the closing of the Stock Redemption Agreement; however, the parties entered into an Addendum whereby AIA Services would issue a $1.5 million down payment note payable 90 days after closing (the \u201c$1.5M Note\u201d). Pursuant to the Stock Redemption Agreement, Reed Taylor was given debt forgiveness, transfer of title to airplanes and other payments aggregating over $2 million. The balance of the $7.5 million redemption price was to be paid pursuant to a promissory note dated August 1, 1995, in the principal amount of $6 million (the \u201c$6M Note\u201d). The $6M Note provided for monthly interest payments and for all principal and accrued interest to be paid on August 1, 2005. As collateral for the Stock Redemption Agreement, the parties entered into a security agreement that granted Reed Taylor a secured interest in most of AIA Services\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">AIA Services was not able to pay the $1.5M Note when it became due on October 20, 1995, and Reed Taylor notified AIA Services that it was in default by three letters from April through June, 1996. On July 1, 1996, Reed Taylor and AIA Services executed the Stock Redemption Restructure Agreement, which called for the $1.5M Note to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>paid on October 31, 1996, and the $6M Note to be paid in full on July 1, 2005, with interest payments for ten years. AIA Services again failed to pay the $1.5M Note when it became due, and AIA Services fell behind in making interest payments on the $6M Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">On January 29, 2007, Reed Taylor filed the Complaint in this lawsuit seeking to obtain the money owed under the Stock Redemption Agreement and the Stock Redemption Restructure Agreement (collectively hereinafter the \u201cStock Redemption Agreement\u201d). The defendants (hereinafter \u201cRespondents\u201d) include AIA Services, AIA Insurance and John Taylor (Reed Taylor\u2019s brother and business partner), who were named in the original complaint, as well as other managers and directors of AIA Services, who were added in later amended complaints. The 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan for AIA Services Corporation (the Plan) intervened to assert the illegality of the Stock Redemption Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In April, 2008, Respondents filed a motion for partial summary judgment concerning the legality of the Stock Redemption Agreement, arguing that when the agreement was entered into, it violated the then-existing I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, which authorizes corporations to redeem their shares but places restrictions on the source of funds used to redeem shares. The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Respondents in its Opinion and Order dated June 17, 2009. The district court found that the Stock Redemption Agreement violated I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 because AIA Services did not have any earned surplus when it entered into the agreement and was not authorized by its articles of incorporation or by majority shareholder vote to use capital surplus to pay for Reed Taylor\u2019s shares. The district court then declared the Stock Redemption Agreement illegal and unenforceable and concluded that it must leave the parties where it finds them.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The district court denied Reed Taylor\u2019s motion for reconsideration in its Opinion and Order dated August 13, 2009. The district court issued a Judgment dismissing six of the eleven causes of action in Reed Taylor\u2019s Fifth Amended Complaint. Reed Taylor appealed to this Court. On September 01, 2010, we granted Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss certain extraneous issues raised on appeal by Reed Taylor which were beyond the scope of the I.R.C.P. 54(b) certified partial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">This Court set forth the standard of review for an appeal from an order on summary judgment in <em>Jones v. HealthSouth Treasure Valley Hospital:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">When reviewing an order for summary judgment, this Court applies the same standard of review as was used by the trial court in ruling on the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Cristo Viene Pentecostal Church v. Paz, </em>144 Idaho 304, 307, 160 P.3d 743, 746 (2007). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). \u201cIf there is no genuine issue of material fact, only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Cristo, </em>144 Idaho at 307, 160 P.3d at 746 (quoting <em>Infanger v. City of Salmon, </em>137 Idaho 45, 47, 44 P.3d 1100, 1102 (2002)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that upon a motion for summary judgment the non-moving party may not rely upon its pleadings, but must come forward with evidence by way of affidavit or otherwise which contradicts the evidence submitted by the moving party, and which establishes the existence of a material issue of disputed fact.\u201d <em>Zehm v. Associated Logging Contractors, Inc., </em>116 Idaho 349, 350, 775 P.2d 1191, 1192 (1988). This Court liberally construes all disputed facts in favor of the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences drawn from the record will be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Cristo, </em>144 Idaho at 307, 160 P.3d at 746. If reasonable persons could reach differing conclusions or di'aw conflicting inferences from the evidence presented, then summary judgment is im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>proper. <em>McPheters v. Maile, </em>138 Idaho 391, 394, 64 P.3d 317, 320 (2003).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">147 Idaho 109, 112, 206 P.3d 473, 476 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\u201cThe burden of showing the trial court abused its discretion rests with the appellant.\u201d <em>Walker v. Boozer, </em>140 Idaho 451, 456, 95 P.3d 69, 74 (2004). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion, this Court considers: (1) whether the court correctly perceived the issue as discretionary; (2) whether the court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with applicable legal standards; and (3) whether it reached its decision by an exercise of reason. <em>Stewart v. Stewart, </em>143 Idaho 673, 678,152 P.3d 544, 549 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">This Court will not consider an issue which is not supported by argument and authority in the opening brief. <em>Liponis v. Bach, </em>149 Idaho 372, 374, 234 P.3d 696, 698 (2010). \u201cThe argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented on appeal, the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the transcript and record relied upon.\u201d I.A.R. 35(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201cThis Court will not reverse the trial court if an alleged error is harmless.... [I]f an error did not affect a party\u2019s substantial rights or the error did not affect the result of the trial, the error is harmless and not grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Myers v. Workmen\u2019s Auto Ins. Co., </em>140 Idaho 495, 504, 95 P.3d 977, 986 (2004). <em>See </em>I.R.C.P. 61 (\u201cThe court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Respondents upon determining that the Stock Redemption Agreement violated I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 and was, therefore, illegal. Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1-6 (1995)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">Right of corporation to acquire and dispose of its own shares. A corporation shall have the right to purchase ... its own shares, but purchases of its own shares ... shall be made only to the extent of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus available therefor, and, if the articles of incorporation so permit or with the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares entitled to vote thereon, to the extent of unreserved and unrestricted capital surplus available therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Thus, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, a corporation is generally authorized to use earned surplus to redeem shares; whereas, the use of capital surplus to redeem shares requires authorization either in the articles of incorporation or by majority shareholder vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">On appeal, Reed Taylor argues: (1) AIA Services had sufficient earned surplus to enter into the Stock Redemption Agreement; (2) AIA Services was authorized by shareholder vote to redeem the shares out of capital surplus; (3) I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 does not apply, because AIA Services redeemed Reed Taylor\u2019s shares on credit; (4) Respondents and the Plan are barred from asserting illegality, because they are not intended beneficiaries of I.C. 30-1-6; and (5) even if the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal, it is nevertheless enforceable under multiple exceptions to illegality. Reed Taylor also raises other issues, all of which are addressed in turn. On cross appeal, Respondents argue that the district court erred in dismissing only six of Reed Taylor\u2019s causes of action and ask this Court to dismiss the remaining five causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">A. The Stock Redemption Agreement violates I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">\n<em>1. AIA Services had no earned surplus when it entered into the Stock Redemption Agreement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">Pursuant to the Stock Redemption Agreement, AIA Services agreed to pay Reed Taylor $7.5 million and give other consideration. In the Opinion and Order dated June 17, 2009, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Without exception, each of the accountants, including Plaintiffs expert, found AIA had no earned surplus in the years 1995 and 1996, but instead had an earned deficit. During oral arguments, counsel for Plaintiff conceded that the earned surplus numbers for AIA in 1995 and 1996 were in the negative and that no amount of accounting adjustment of numbers would turn the earned surplus sufficient to cover the $7.5 million debt incurred to Reed Taylor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">According to Reed Taylor, while he admits to acknowledging that AIA Services\u2019 balance sheets suggest that it had insufficient earned surplus, a corporation\u2019s balance sheet is not the conclusive indicator of earned surplus. Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred when it failed to consider the fair market value of AIA Services and asserts that the following evidence shows that AIA Services had sufficient earned surplus to redeem his shares: (1) appraisals from 1995 and 1996 that value a minority interest in AIA Services at $2 million and $4 million respectively; (2) a 1994 appraisal valuing the whole company at over $19 million; (3) Reed Taylor\u2019s valuation of the commissions and contractual relationships held by AIA Services at over $24 million in 1995; and (4) AIA Services\u2019 projection of substantial earnings upon redeeming Reed Taylor\u2019s shares and redirecting the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Reed Taylor relies primarily on <em>Klang v. Smith's Food &amp; Drug Centers, Inc., </em>702 A.2d 150, 152 (Del.1997), where the Delaware Supreme Court explained that \u201c[bjalance sheets are not ... conclusive indicators of surplus or a lack thereof.\u201d However, at issue in <em>Klang </em>was whether a corporation had sufficient \u201csurplus\u201d to redeem shares without violating a statutory prohibition against the impairment of capital. <em>Id. </em>at 153. In the ease at hand, \u201cearned surplus\u201d is at issue, which Idaho Code distinguished from \u201csurplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201cSurplus\u201d is defined in Idaho as \u201cthe excess of the net assets of a corporation over its stated capital.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 30-l-2(k). \u201cEarned surplus\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">\u201cEarned surplus\u201d means the portion of the surplus of a corporation equal to the balance of its <em>net profits, income, gains and losses </em>from the date of incorporation, or from the latest date when a deficit was eliminated by an application of its capital surplus or stated capital or otherwise, after deducting subsequent distributions to shareholders and transfers to stated capital and capital surplus to the extent such distributions and transfers are made out of earned surplus. Earned surplus shall include also any portion of surplus allocated to earned surplus in mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of all or substantially all of the outstanding shares or of the property and assets of another corporation, domestic or foreign.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">I.C. \u00a7 30 \u2014 1\u20142(i) (emphasis added). \u201cCapital surplus\u201d is defined as \u201cthe entire surplus of a corporation other than its earned surplus.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 30-l-2(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">American Law Reports explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abq\">[Generally for the protection of its creditors, the right of a corporation to purchase its own stock has been limited in various ways, such as a prohibition against such purchase when it would impair the capital of the corporation or while it is insolvent or when the transaction will render it insolvent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Apparently to make it easier to determine whether a corporation, at a particular point in time, may legally purchase its own shares, some states have required, by statute, that corporations may purchase their shares of stock only out of some fund in excess of capital, expressly limited by some statutes to earned surplus and more broadly defined by others to include surplus in general. In other words, a corporation cannot use its capital to purchase its stock. The terms \u201csurplus\u201d and \u201csurplus profits\u201d usually include various types of surplus which generally represent the excess of the aggregate value of assets over and above the aggregate value of liabilities. It has, however, been pointed out that whether a corporation has a surplus should be determined by examining the actual value, not the book value, of the corporation. <em>On the other hand, \u201cearned surplus\u201d has a narrower scope and has been construed to include only actual earnings or profits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>61 A.L.R.3d 1049 ch. I \u00a7 2 (2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">First, Reed Taylor provides no argument or explanation as to how any of the four pieces of evidence he set forth constitute earned surplus as then defined by I.C. \u00a7 30-l-2(k): profits, income or gains. Even if they do go toward earned surplus, Reed Taylor provides no argument or explanation as to whether they create a sufficient amount of earned surplus such that the agreement satisfies I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6. In his brief, Reed Taylor merely asserts that earned surplus is not limited to balance sheets and sets forth the four pieces of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Second, none of these four pieces of evidence upon which Reed Taylor relies constitute earned surplus. As to AIA Services\u2019 projections of future earnings and to Reed Taylor\u2019s valuation of AIA Services\u2019 commissions and contractual obligations, these are anticipated earnings, not actual earnings, and are not earned surplus. <em>See Mindenberg v. Carmel Film Prods., </em>132 Cal.App.2d 598, 282 P.2d 1024, 1030 (1955) (\u201cThe law is settled to the effect that paper profits, or anticipated earnings, or accrued items of debit or credit are not to be taken into consideration in computing earned surplus, either for purpose of dividends or as a basis for corporate purchase of its own shares of stock.\u201d). As to the other two pieces of evidence Reed Taylor puts forth, which are the appraisals of the company and the appraisals of minority shareholder interests, even assuming that they show some kind of increase in value (which Reed Taylor does not explain in his brief), such increases would not be earned surplus. <em>See Berks Broadcasting Co. v. Craumer, </em>356 Pa. 620, 52 A.2d 571, 573 (1947) (earned surplus does not include an unrealized appreciation in the value of fixed assets but must be founded on actual earnings or profits).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that AIA Services had insufficient earned surplus at the time it entered into the Stock Redemption Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\n<em>2. AIA Services was not authorized to use capital surplus to fund, the Stock Redemption Agreement.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Respondents and the Plan argue, and the district court held, that in order to authorize the use of capital surplus by shareholder vote, the shareholder vote must explicitly authorize the use of capital surplus and that the shareholder votes approving the Stock Redemption Agreement and the Resolutions failed to satisfy I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 because they did not specifically designate the source of funds for the payment of the promissory notes. Reed Taylor argues that AIA Services\u2019 shareholders impliedly authorized the use of capital surplus by voting in favor of the Stock Redemption Agreement. More specifically, according to Reed Taylor, the AIA Services shareholder votes approving the Stock Redemption Agreement and the Resolutions impliedly authorized the use of capital surplus, because: (1) the February 9, 1995 Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders to approve the Stock Redemption Agreement sought approval for \u201c[a]ll corporate actions necessary to ... reorganize the Company\u201d; (2) the March 7, 1995 shareholder vote in favor of the Stock Redemption Agreement approved \u201c[a]ll other corporate actions necessary\u201d and was not conditioned on AIA Services first selling a certain number of new shares; and (3) the July 18,1995 shareholder vote in favor the Resolutions not only approved all of the terms of the Stock Redemption Agreement but also approved the use of capital assets \u201cto secure payment of the corporation's promissory note for the balance of the redemption price\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">As set forth in <em>BHC Intermountain Hospital, Inc. v. Ada County, </em>150 Idaho 93, 95, 244 P.3d 237, 239 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. The statute is viewed as a whole, and the analysis begins with the language of the statute, which is given its plain, usual and ordinary meaning. In determining the ordinary meaning of the statute, effect must be given to all the words of the statute if possible, so that none will be void, superfluous, or redundant. However, if the language of the statute is capable of more than one reasonable construction it is ambiguous, and a statute that is ambiguous must be eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>strued with legislative intent in mind, which is ascertained by examining not only the literal words of the statute, but the reasonableness of the proposed interpretations, the policy behind the statute, and its legislative history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">(Citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The opening clause of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 provides that corporations may purchase their own shares; however, the remainder of this first sentence limits a corporation to making such purchases with \u201cunreserved and unrestricted earned surplus available therefore, and, <em>if the articles of incorporation so permit or with the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares entitled to vote thereon, </em>to the extent of unreserved and unrestricted capital surplus available therefore.\u201d (Emphasis added). Admittedly, the language of the statute does not entirely foreclose the possibility that the thing which a majority of shareholders must vote in favor of in order to authorize the use of capital surplus is the stock redemption agreement. However, under a plain, natural reading of the statute, in order to authorize the use of capital surplus to redeem stock, the thing which a majority of shareholders must vote in favor of is the use of capital surplus to redeem stock \u2014 not merely the redemption of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">On appeal, none of the parties cite any authority as to whether a shareholder vote must explicitly authorize the use of capital surplus to redeem shares or whether implicit authorization suffices. Upon reviewing the published cases from other jurisdictions which cite to statutes which are nearly identical to I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, only the Oregon Court of Appeals appears to have touched on this issue. <em>See, e.g., Am. Family Care v. Am. Family Physicians, </em>571 So.2d 1053 (Ala. 1990); <em>McCreery v. RSA Mgmt., </em>249 Ga. 43, 287 S.E.2d 203 (1982), <em>Evanenko v. Farmers Union Elevator, </em>191 N.W.2d 258 (N.D.1971). In <em>Hansen v. Singmaster Ins. Agency, </em>80 Or.App. 329, 722 P.2d 1254, 1256-57 (1986), the Oregon Court of Appeals found that the shareholders of a corporation voted to authorize the use of capital surplus pursuant to ORS 57.035(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which has the same earned surplus limitation and capital surplus authorization requirement as does I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The stock redemption agreement in <em>Hansen, </em>which was signed by all of the corporation\u2019s stockholders, provided that if the defendant did not have sufficient surplus out of which to make payments as they became due, then it would \u201cpromptly take all required action to enable it to make such payment out of surplus, including ... a reappraisal of [its] assets to reflect the market value of [its] assets ... in the event such market value exceeds the book value thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256. The issue presented to the <em>Hansen </em>court was whether the shareholders\u2019 signatures of the agreement constituted a majority vote, and the court held that this was such a vote. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. The <em>Hansen </em>court did not provide any analysis as to its finding that this vote authorized the use of capital surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Even though the stock redemption agreement in <em>Hansen </em>did not explicitly use the term \u201ccapital\u201d, it explicitly authorized the use of capital surplus. In <em>Hansen, </em>the stock redemption agreement specifically addressed what would happen if the corporation had insufficient surplus when payments became due, and the agreement provided the specific steps the corporation would take in such event (reappraising assets) to generate capital surplus. <em>Id. </em>at 1256. Whereas, in the case at hand, Reed Taylor relies on general authorizations to effectuate the goals of reorganizing AIA Services and repurchasing his stock without pointing to specific provisions related to funding sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">We agree with the district court where it stated in the Opinion and Order dated August 13,2009:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">Plaintiff further contends that a shareholder vote to redeem Reed Taylor\u2019s shares implied shareholder consent to draw from capital surplus for the purchase. The Court does not read the 1995 version of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 so broadly____ In 1995, when the shareholders of AIA voted to redeem Reed Taylors shares, the corporation had insufficient earned surplus for the purchase, yet no vote to draw from capital surplus was obtained from shareholders as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>required by statute. Neither the redemption agreement itself nor the resolution designated the source of funds for the future promissory note payment. <em>Such a substantial obligation cannot be incurred by implication.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Accordingly, we hold that, in order for a shareholder vote to authorize the use of capital surplus to redeem stock, I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 requires that the shareholder vote explicitly authoi-ize the use of capital surplus. A vote merely authorizing the redemption of stock does not suffice. Therefore, AIA Services\u2019 shareholders did not authorize the use of capital surplus to redeem Reed Taylor\u2019s shares when they voted in favor of the Stock Redemption Agreement and the Resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>3. The 500,000 shares AIA Services redeemed on credit are subject to the earned and capital surplus limitations of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6; of the remaining 113,191 shares AIA Services redeemed, those redeemed in exchange for airplanes are subject to the surplus limitations, and those redeemed to cancel Reed Taylor\u2019s debt to AIA Services are not subject to the surplus limitations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Pursuant to the Stock Redemption Agreement, AIA Services purchased 500,000 of Reed Taylor\u2019s shares with credit. Reed Taylor argues that the earned and capital surplus restrictions in I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 should not apply when a company purchases its own shares on credit. Reed Taylor relies on <em>Garrity v. Radel, </em>151 Conn. 349, 197 A.2d 775, 777 (1964), for the proposition that a stock redemption statute similar to I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 does \u201cnot prohibit a corporation from purchasing its own shares on credit.\u201d Respondents acknowledge that nothing in I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 appeal\u2019s to prohibit redeeming stock on credit; however, Respondents argue that stock purchased by a corporation on credit is still subject to the earned and capital surplus limitations, and Respondents point out that in <em>Garrity </em>there was \u201cno claim that there was an insufficient unreserved or unrestricted capital surplus.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We hold that I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 allows redeeming stock on credit, but the earned and capital surplus restrictions still apply. The primary purpose of stock redemption statutes is to protect minority shareholders and creditors from corporate mismanagement by preventing boards of directors from draining corporate assets. 19 C.J.S. <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 663. Nothing in I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 suggests that the timing of payment has any bearing on the statute\u2019s applicability, and given the statute\u2019s purpose, it would be an absurd result to allow a corporation to get around these restrictions by simply paying on a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Pursuant to the Stock Redemption Agreement, in addition to purchasing 500,000 shares with the two notes totaling $7.5 million, AIA Services agreed to \u201credeem Mr. Taylor\u2019s remaining common stock of 113,494 shares by transferring the Company\u2019s aircraft to Mr. Taylor, subject to its debt of approximately $590,000, and cancellation of approximately $480,000 in indebtedness to the Company.\u201d Reed Taylor claims that these shares are not subject to I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 and asserts that the district court erred by never addressing this issue. According to Reed Taylor, the gross value of these shares should be deducted from the amount of earned surplus that would be required to redeem his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">After imposing the earned and capital surplus limitations, I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing limitation, a corporation may purchase or otherwise acquire its own shares for the purpose of ... (b) Collecting or compromising indebtedness to the corporation.\u201d Therefore, any shares exchanged to cancel Reed Taylor\u2019s indebtedness to AIA Services are not subject to the earned and capital surplus limitations of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6. However, Reed Taylor has not explained with any argument or authority how the shares exchanged for airplanes ai\u2019e exempt from the earned and capital surplus limitations of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6. Therefore, the shares exchanged for airplanes must comply with the earned and capital surplus limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">B. The Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal and unenforceable, and we leave the parties as we find them.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Reed Taylor argues: (1) none of the Respondents nor the Plan can raise I.C. \u00a7 30-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>1-6 to invalidate the Stock Redemption Agreement; (2) a violation of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 does not render the Stock Redemption Agreement illegal and unenforceable; and (3) multiple exceptions to the rule that an illegal contract is unenforceable and requires a court to leave the parties where they lie apply to this case. These issues are addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">\n<em>1. The Stock Redemption Agreement\u2019s compliance with I.C. S 30-1-8 was properly raised.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred in finding the Stock Redemption Agreement illegal after first finding that no party had \u201cstanding\u201d to assert the illegality. Reed Taylor relies on <em>La Voy Supply Co. v. Young, </em>84 Idaho 120, 127, 369 P.2d 45, 49 (1962), for the proposition that a corporation cannot have a stock repurchase declared illegal. He also relies heavily on <em>Minnelusa Co. v. A.G. Andrikopoulos, </em>929 P.2d 1321, 1323 (Colo.1996), where the Colorado Supreme Court explained: \u201cStock repurchase statutes are designed to protect creditors and minority stockholders from corporate mismanagement of assets.\u201d The <em>Minnelusa </em>Court went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">A shareholder who is fully aware of, and consents to, a questionable transaction may not thereafter attack that transaction by requesting it be declared illegal____ [The shareholder] is not an intended beneficiary of the Florida stock repurchase statute, we hold that [the shareholder] may not use the Florida stock repurchase statute to relieve him of his personal guarantee on the promissory notes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1324-25. According to Reed Taylor, neither the Plan nor any of Respondents are intended beneficiaries of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, and therefore, they are barred from raising I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 to attack the Stock Redemption Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">In its Opinion and Order dated June 17, 2009, the district court found that neither the Plan nor any Respondents had standing to assert the defense of illegality. Specifically, the district court found that neither the Plan nor any Respondents were creditors of AIA Services when the corporation entered into the Stock Redemption Agreement. The district court also found that neither the Plan, James Beck, nor Corrine Beck were shareholders at the time of the agreement. Finally, the district court found that Connie Taylor and John Taylor, who were shareholders when the agreement was made, consented to Stock Redemption Agreement by voting their community shares in favor of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">First, we clarify that this is not an issue of standing. Standing is a subcategory of justiciability, and the standing inquiry is focused on the party seeking relief. <em>Martin v. Camas Cnty., </em>150 Idaho 508, 513, 248 P.3d 1243, 1248 (2011). The Respondents are defendants and have invoked I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 as a defense; thus, standing is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">As a general matter, we explained in <em>Stearns v. Williams, </em>72 Idaho 276, 290, 240 P.2d 833, 842 (1952), that \u201ca court of equity will not knowingly aid in the furtherance of an illegal transaction; in harmony with this principle, it does not concern itself as to the manner in which the illegality of a matter before it is brought to its attention.\u201d Therefore, John and Connie Taylor, who were minority shareholders when the Stock Redemption Agreement was entered into, may assert all legal and equitable defenses they have.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\"><em>2. The Stock Redemption Agreement </em>is <em>an illegal contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">\u201cAn illegal contract is one that rests on illegal consideration consisting of any act or forbearance which is contrary to law or public policy,\u201d and such a contract \u201cis illegal and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Farrell v. Whiteman, </em>146 Idaho 604, 609, 200 P.3d 1153, 1158 (2009). \u201c[W]hen the consideration for a contract explicitly violates a statute, the contract is illegal and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Trees v. Kersey, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-16\">The illegality of a contract ... can be raised at any stage in litigation. The Court has the duty to raise the issue of illegality <em>sua sponte. </em>Whether a contract is illegal is a question of law for the court to determine from all the facts and circumstances of each case. An illegal contract is one that rests on illegal consideration consisting of any act or forbearance which is contrary to law or public policy. The gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>eral rule is that a contract prohibited by law is illegal and unenforceable. A contract which is made for the purpose of furthering any matter or thing prohibited by statute is void. This rule applies on the ground of public policy to every contract which is founded on a transaction prohibited by statute. The Idaho Court of Appeals has suggested that where a statute intends to prohibit an act, it must be held that its violation is illegal, without regard to the reason of the inhibition or to the ignorance of the parties as to the prohibiting statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">138 Idaho 3, 6-7, 56 P.3d 765, 768-69 (2002) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 30-1-6 authorizes a corporation to purchase its own shares but limits the corporation to using only earned surplus and, if authorized, capital surplus to make the purchase. Because AIA Services had no earned surplus and was not authorized to use capital surplus when it agreed to purchase Reed Taylor\u2019s shares, the Stock Redemption Agreement violated the earned and capital surplus limitations of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6. Based upon a review of the policy for the statute and the facts in this case, the Stock Redemption Agreement is thereby prohibited by law and is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>3. None of the exceptions to the rule that an illegal contract is void and unenforceable put forth by Reed Taylor are applicable in this case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cIf a contract is illegal and void, the court will leave the parties as it finds them and refuse to enforce the contract.\u201d <em>Wernecke v. St. Maries Joint School Disk </em># <em>401, </em>147 Idaho 277, 287, 207 P.3d 1008, 1018 (2009). In <em>Wemecke, </em>this Court noted that Idaho recognizes the following exceptions to illegality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">This Court has recognized a certain limited exception to the illegality doctrine when public policy requires that some relief be granted. <em>Farrell v. Whiteman, </em>146 Idaho 604, 200 P.3d 1153 (2009). Additionally, when parties are not \u201cin pari delicto\u201d or when fraud, undue influence, or duress are present relief may be granted to the innocent party. <em>Barry v. Pac. W. Constr., Inc., </em>140 Idaho 827, 833, 103 P.3d 440, 446 (2004). Finally, this Court has allowed some relief to insureds who signed void insurance contracts, in cases where unenforceability would \u201cdefeat the purpose for which a statute has been enacted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\"><em>Wernecke, </em>147 Idaho at 288 n. 12, 207 P.3d at 1019 n. 12. Reed Taylor argues that even if the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal, it should still be enforced for the following reasons: (1) the shareholders acquiesced to the redemption for over twelve years; (2) he was justifiably ignorant and an innocent party and/or not <em>in pari delicto; </em>(3) the fraud exception to illegality applies; (4) the violation was merely technical; and (5) public policy grounds support enforcing the redemption agreement. Each of Reed Taylor\u2019s arguments are addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">First, an illegal contract \u201ccannot be treated as valid by invoking waiver or estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 207 P.3d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Second, as to Reed Taylor\u2019s argument that he was justifiably ignorant, he relies on <em>Williams v. Cont'l Life &amp; Accident Co., </em>100 Idaho 71, 73, 593 P.2d 708, 710 (1979), in which this Court explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that a contract prohibited by law is illegal and unenforceable\u201d but that an \u201cexception is that \u2018[a]n innocent plaintiff may recover on an illegal agreement which is not declared void by statute. Such innocence exists where the plaintiff is justifiably ignorant of the circumstances causing the illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quoting </em>14 S. Williston, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 1631 (3d ed. 1972)). While the record suggests that Reed Taylor may have been ignorant of the existence of the earned and capital surplus limitations of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, a party\u2019s ignorance of the law does not make an illegal contract enforceable. <em>Trees, </em>138 Idaho at 6-7, 56 P.3d at 768-69 (\u201cwhere a statute intends to prohibit an act, it must be held that its violation is illegal, without regard to ... the ignorance of the parties as to the prohibiting statute.\u201d). Nothing suggests that Reed Taylor, as CEO and Chairman of the Board, as well as majority shareholder, was justifiably ignorant as to the circumstances causing the illegality \u2014 the insufficient earned surplus and absence of a share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>holder vote explicitly authorizing the use of capital surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Reed Taylor also makes a similar argument that he was not equally at fault (he was not <em>\u201cin pari delicto </em>\u201d). In <em>McShane v. Quillin, </em>47 Idaho 542, 547, 277 P. 554, 559 (1929), we recognized this exception to illegality, stating: \u201c[Wjhere the parties are not <em>in pari delicto, </em>the innocent party may recover. This is particularly true where the prohibition of the statute ... is aimed at the act of the defendant, and not at that of the plaintiff.\u201d Reed Taylor sets forth a lengthy explanation in his brief as to how he was in no position to understand the circumstances surrounding the Stock Redemption Agreement and how AIA Services and its attorneys were in a better position to understand the situation and are thus more at fault. The district court ruled: \u201cThis is not a case where the parties to the agreement were not <em>in pari </em>delicto----If Reed Taylor was uninformed as to the financial status of his corporation, that was a voluntary choice on his part and is insufficient to make him an innocent party to the agreement.\u201d We agree. Reed Taylor was the majority shareholder of AIA Services, CEO and Chairman of the Board when he entered into the Stock Redemption Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Third, Reed Taylor argues that even if the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal, it should be enforced because he was fraudulently induced to enter into the agreement by an opinion letter (the Opinion Letter), which offered the opinion that the Stock Redemption Agreement was legal. The Opinion Letter was written by a law firm, acting as general counsel for AIA Services in connection with the agreement, and was addressed to Reed Taylor. Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred in: (1) refusing to enforce the Stock Redemption Agreement based upon fraud; (2) finding that the Opinion Letter did not provide factual representations or mixed representations of fact and opinion; and (3) making these decisions on fraud without ever permitting Reed Taylor to depose or conduct discovery with the attorneys who rendered the opinions and factual representations to him. Reed Taylor makes no argument and provides no explanation on these claims; he merely states that the district court made these errors. Furthermore, Reed Taylor cites nothing in the record except for the district court\u2019s Opinion and Order granting partial summary judgment and its Opinion and Order on the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Establishing fraud requires showing a false statement of fact on which the plaintiff relied. <em>See Country Cove Dev. v. May, </em>143 Idaho 595, 600-01, 150 P.3d 288, 293-294 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">Opinions and predictions cannot form the basis of a fraud claim because they do not speak to matters of fact. An exception to the general rules exists where a false prediction or opinion is given with the intent to mislead----[Wjhere a speaker gives an opinion when he is aware of facts incompatible with such opinion, the opinion may amount to a false statement of fact if made with the intention of deceiving or misleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 601, 150 P.3d at 294. The district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">[The Opinion Letter] expressed an opinion that no statute was violated by the stock redemption agreement, an opinion currently postulated to the Court by Plaintiff. Such an opinion was no more a statement of fact when expressed by corporate counsel in 1995 than it is now when asserted by Plaintiff. It is, simply, an opinion based on one\u2019s interpretation of law and cannot form the basis for a fraud claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">We affirm the district court in dismissing Reed Taylor\u2019s fraud argument. On appeal, Reed Taylor merely states the general proposition that an opinion can form the basis for fraud when there is intent to mislead, but he does not actually argue that anyone intended to mislead him in this case and points to nothing in the record suggesting that anyone had such intent. As to Reed Taylor\u2019s claim that the district court erred in finding an absence of fraud without giving him the opportunity to depose or conduct discovery with the lawyers who authored the Opinion Letter, Reed Taylor again makes no argument in this section of his brief concerning this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Fourth, Reed Taylor argues that a mere technical violation of a statute does not render a contract void unless the statute so provides, citing <em>Miller v. Haller, </em>129 Idaho 345, 924 P.2d 607 (1996). At issue in <em>Miller </em>was the legality of an oral contract which provided that if Miller voluntarily left the Silverton Partnership, surgical referrals to Miller would continue to be made in the same pattern as such referrals had been' made previously. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 924 P.2d at 614. This argument was based upon: (1) an Idaho Code provision giving the state board of medicine specific grounds for disciplining a licensed physician, including the division of fees or gifts or agreements to split or divide fees or gifts received for professional services in exchange for referral; and (2) a federal statute making the giving or receiving of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for referrals involving Medicare patients a felony. <em>Id. </em>This Court held: \u201cThis is not the form of consideration strictly proscribed by the statutes, and, for that reason, the oral contract alleged here cannot be termed illegal, as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Reed Taylor provides no explanation as to how the Stock Redemption Agreement\u2019s violation of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 is merely a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d, and he makes no argument as to how the unauthorized use of capital surplus or the use of other funds when there is no earned surplus is not the kind of use of funds to redeem stock which is strictly prohibited by I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6. The Stock Redemption Agreement appears to be precisely the type of agreement that I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 seeks to prohibit, as the agreement could drain AIA Services for the benefit of Reed Taylor \u2014 the sixty-three percent majority shareholder \u2014 at the expense of any minority shareholders or creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, Reed Taylor argues that the Stock Redemption Agreement should be enforced as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">This Court has recognized situations in which relief to a party to an illegal contract is warranted to avoid unduly harsh results. In such instances, the Court has awarded damages based on the rationale that, although illegal contracts are unenforceable as a matter of public policy, circumstances arise where denying a party relief would frustrate the public interest more than \u201cleaving the parties where they lie.\u201d This Court has stated that, \u201c[b]arring the strict application of the illegality doctrine, the central focus must be whether the ends of the law will be furthered or defeated by granting the relief requested.\u201d <em>Trees, </em>138 Idaho at 9, 56 P.3d at 771.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\"><em>Barry v. Pac. West Constr., </em>140 Idaho 827, 833, 103 P.3d 440, 446 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The only public policy argument Reed Taylor sets forth which is not merely a restatement of one of the above grounds Idaho recognizes for enforcing an otherwise illegal contract is that the Stock Redemption Agreement should be enforced given the malfeasance of the other parties and their attorneys in engineering this illegal agreement and unlawfully transferring millions of dollars from AIA Services to another entity, CropUSA As already explained, the Stock Redemption Agreement is precisely the type of agreement that public policy prohibits, as it was entered into when AIA Services had no earned surplus and was not authorized to use capital surplus; thus, the agreement implicates concerns that it was intended to favor Reed Taylor at the expense of minority shareholders and creditors. To the extent that not enforcing the agreement seems harsh given that AIA Services is trying to get out of an agreement it chose to enter into and given that it appears that none of the parties recognized the potential violation of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, it must be noted that Reed Taylor has already received substantial sums of money from AIA Services pursuant to the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">C. We will not consider whether the district court erred or abused its discretion in making certain findings in its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">In his opening brief, Reed Taylor asserts the following issue on appeal: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>court erred when it\u2018made certain other findings in its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Reed\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.\u201d His argument on this issue reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az0\">The court erred and abused its discretion when it made the following findings which were not based upon evidence in the record: that the statute of limitations did not apply. <em>Noyes, </em>255 B.R. [588], at 602 [ (Bankr.D. Idaho 2000)]; I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5-237; 5-224; 5-237; that Reed was not more innocent; that Reed was not justifiably ignorant, and that Reed was in a position to have intimate knowledge of AIA\u2019s finances (among other findings in both orders not supported by the evidence); and when the court refused to address all of Reed\u2019s arguments and objections in both motions. (R. Vol. XLV-XLVI, p. 8838-52, 9014-24.) At a minimum, for these reasons and all the reasons asserted in this Brief, the court abused its discretion and erred when it did not at least find an issue of fact precluding partial summary judgment in favor of Connie and Beck and when it failed to consider all of Reed\u2019s arguments and the evidence submitted in support of those arguments. Should the Court not enter partial summary judgment in favor of Reed, the Court should order all arguments to be considered and fully and fairly evaluated with the evidence on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">It is well established that this Court will not consider an issue raised on appeal if the error complained of is not identified, or if the issue is not supported by cogent argument and authority, in the opening brief. Idaho Appellate Rule 35(a)(6) requires: \u201cThe argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented on appeal, the reasons therefor, with citations to authorities, statutes and parts of the transcript and the record relied upon.\u201d \u201cRegardless of whether an issue is explicitly set forth in the party\u2019s brief as one of the issues on appeal, if the issue is only mentioned in passing and not supported by any cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered by this Court.\u201d <em>Liponis v. Bach, </em>149 Idaho 372, 374, 234 P.3d 696, 698 (2010). In <em>Liponis, </em>we declined to reach certain issues on appeal because the appellant \u201cfailed to support them with either relevant argument and authority or coherent thought\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As to the statute of limitations claim, Reed Taylor fails to identify how the district court erred and makes no argument. It seems that Reed Taylor is arguing that the statute of limitations bars Respondents from asserting that the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal. Idaho Code \u00a7 5-237 requires \u201cactions against directors or stockholders of a corporation to recover a penalty or forfeiture, or to enforce a liability by law\u201d to be brought within three years \u201cafter the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which the penalty or forfeiture attached, or the liability was created,\u201d and I.C. \u00a7 5-224 requires that any \u201caction for relief not herein-before provided for\u201d be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues. However, the statute of limitations does not apply to Respondents\u2019 defenses, such as the defense that the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal. <em>Frank v. Davis, </em>34 Idaho 678, 681, 203 P. 287, 288 (1921) (\u201cThe statute of limitations does not apply to defenses, but only where affirmative relief is sought.\u201d). As to Reed Taylor\u2019s claims concerning ignorance, innocence and knowledge, he appears to be suggesting that there were disputed issues of material fact concerning the justifiable ignorance exception to illegality that should have precluded granting summary judgment. However, this is only a guess, and Reed Taylor provides no argument or any citation to authority on this issue. As to whether the district court refused to address all of Reed Taylor\u2019s arguments and objections in \u201cboth motions\u201d (presumably Respondents\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and Reed Taylor\u2019s motion for reconsideration), Reed Taylor again provides no explanation or argument and merely cites to the district court\u2019s Opinion and Order granting partial summary judgment and Opinion and Order denying his motion for reconsideration. Therefore, we decline to consider these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">D. We decline to instruct the district court to issue an order barring Respondents from asserting that ALA Services is insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In addition to the earned surplus and capital surplus restrictions on a corporation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>purchase of its own shares, I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 provides: \u201cNo purchase or payment for its own shares shall be made at a time when the corporation is insolvent or when such purchase or payment would make it insolvent.\u201d Reed Taylor argues that Respondents failed to meet their burden of proving insolvency and that insolvency does not render a redemption agreement invalid. Therefore, Reed Taylor asks this Court to instruct the district court on remand to bar Respondents from asserting that AIA Services is insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\u201cThis Court is not empowered to issue purely advisory opinions.\u201d <em>MDS Invs., L.L.C. v. State, </em>138 Idaho 456, 464-65, 65 P.3d 197, 205-06 (2003). The district court did not address the insolvency issue in the partial summary judgment which is the subject of this appeal. This opinion is based on the earned and capital surplus restrictions of I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 and does not address the insolvency provision, and we decline to issue the requested order.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">E. We will not consider whether the district court erred when it refused to consider AIA Services\u2019 agreements to release Reed Taylor and AIA Services\u2019 obligations to indemnify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Reed Taylor\u2019s argument on this issue reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">In the absence of fraud, a release will be sustained. <em>Heath v. Utah Home Fire Ins. Co., </em>89 Idaho 490, 406 P.2d 341 (1965). On three different occasions AIA Services promised to indemnify and release Reed, specifically, on July 22, 1995, August 16, 1995, and on July 1, 1996. (Hr\u2019g., Ex. B, p. 6 \u00a7 3; Ex. AC; Ex. Z, p. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 6.1-6.2.) This bars a finding of illegality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Reed Taylor\u2019s reliance on <em>Heath </em>is misplaced. In <em>Heath, </em>the plaintiffs (lessors) owned a home which they rented to tenants. 89 Idaho 490, 492, 406 P.2d 341, 341. After a severe hail storm, the lessors inspected the roof and exterior of the home while the tenants were on an extended vacation and the home was vacant. <em>Id. </em>The lessors notified the insurance company of damage to the exterior and prepared and executed a proof of loss. <em>Id. </em>A settlement was entered into and the lessors signed a release of \u201call claims and demands for the loss and damage under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 406 P.2d at 342. Subsequently, the tenants returned and discovered that the interior of the house had been extensively damaged by the storm. <em>Id. </em>After the plaintiffs submitted a supplemental claim for the repairs, the insurance company relied on the release in deciding to deny the claims. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs filed suit for recovery of the supplemental claim. <em>Id. </em>This Court held the release was not binding due to a mutual mistake \u201cthat the damage to the interior of the house was not known to, nor in the contemplation of, either party at the time of the release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 406 P.2d at 344. Contrary to Reed Taylor\u2019s assertion that in the absence of fraud, a release will be sustained, the release in <em>Heath </em>was <em>not </em>sustained due to a mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Reed Taylor cites no other authority in support of his proposition that: \u201cThis\u201d (presumably AIA Services\u2019 alleged promises to indemnify and release Reed Taylor) \u201cbars a finding of illegality.\u201d Upon reviewing each release and indemnification agreement referenced by Reed Taylor, none of them appear to have any bearing on the issue of illegality of the Stock Redemption Agreement. Reed Taylor cites to the Restructure Agreement, which contains a release provision whereby Reed Taylor and the companies involved in the agreement agreed to release each other from all claims against each other arising out of previous agreements or business arrangements between them or arising out of Reed Taylor\u2019s ownership of or employment by AIA Services other than those obligations set forth in the Restructure Agreement. Reed Taylor also cites the document whereby the officers and directors consented to the Stock Redemption Agreement, which states that Reed Taylor is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">hereby fully and forever released, discharged and indemnified by the Company from all claims, causes of action, demands, rights, damages, costs, expenses, fees, compensation, liabilities and other obligations to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of whatever kind ... on account of or arising out of any agreement with or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>any act or omission by Mr. Taylor any time prior to the date hereof</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADq\">except for obligations that arise under the Stock Redemption Agreement. And finally, Reed Taylor cites the Stock Redemption Agreement\u2019s indemnification provision, which states that each party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzE\">agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party hereto ... from and against and in respect of any and all costs, losses, claims, liabilities, fines, penalties, damages and expenses ... incurred by an Indemnified Party in any action commenced by a third party in connection with or arising out of any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">First, on the facts of this case, AIA Services can rely upon the illegality of the Stock Redemption Agreement, which has been raised by John Taylor and Connie Taylor, the minority shareholders at the time AIA Services entered into the Stock Redemption Agreement, as a defense to Reed Taylor\u2019s claims. The release and indemnification agreements all concern claims, fees, liabilities fines, etc. Second, an illegal contract is against public policy, and any release promising not to assert illegality is also against public policy and is void as a document in furtherance of the illegal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">F. The district court did not err when it stayed general discovery, denied and refused to permit Reed Taylor to depose certain witnesses, refused to compel discovery of Respondents\u2019 expert witnesses and refused to exclude Respondents\u2019 belated expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">First, Reed Taylor argues that the district court abused its discretion when it stayed general discovery in its Opinion and Order dated January 30, 2009. The district court entered the stay after Respondents\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment was noticed for hearing. The order stayed general discovery but allowed discovery to continue if it was \u201c[r]elevant to [the] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\u201d including discovery related to the stock redemption agreement and the financial status of AIA Services in 1995 and 1996. On appeal, Reed Taylor baldly asserts that the district court unreasonably limited discovery, which prevented him from fully and fairly responding to Respondents\u2019 motions for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\u201cControl of discovery is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Jen-Rath Co. v. Kit Mfg. Co., </em>137 Idaho 330, 336, 48 P.3d 659, 665 (2002). Reed Taylor does reference the general proposition that discovery should not be stayed unless the entire action would be disposed of on the pending motion and that staying discovery is not favored by courts. In <em>Hovermale v. School Board of Hillsborough County, Florida, </em>the magistrate for the United States District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">A magistrate has broad discretion to stay discovery pending the decision on a dispositive motion. It is an abuse of that discretion, however, to stay general discovery if plaintiff [has] been denied discovery which relates to the summary judgment motion. In addition, motions to stay discovery are not favored and are rarely appropriate where resolution of the dispositive motion may not dispose of the entire case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">128 F.R.D. 287, 289 (M.D.Fla.1989) (citations and quotations omitted). In <em>Hovermale, </em>the Magistrate declined to stay discovery, finding that doing so would be overly broad since even if the court were to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, this may not dispose of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Reed Taylor has not made any argument on appeal as to how it was inappropriate to stay general discovery in this case and, therefore, how the district court abused its discretion. Given the complexity of this case, how much discovery had already taken place and given that the district court allowed discovery to proceed as to matters relevant to the motion for partial summary judgment, we cannot say that the district court acted without reason when it stayed general discovery pending the motion for partial summary judgment, especially since this motion for summary judgment could have been dis-positive of the entire case. <em>See infra </em>Part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>III.H. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not abuse his discretion in staying general discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Second, Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred and abused its discretion when it refused to hear certain motions to compel depositions and refused to permit him to depose individuals with knowledge of the Stock Redemption Agreement. The Affidavit of Roderick C. Bond (Reed Taylor\u2019s attorney) sets forth persons Reed Taylor sought to depose with some accompanying explanation as to each person. In its Opinion and Order dated June 17, 2009, which is the basis of this appeal, when considering Reed Taylor\u2019s motion for continuance, the district court explained that Reed Taylor \u201chas provided the Court with no reasonable basis to believe additional discovery will produce new or relevant information not previously disclosed and such discovery would only come at substantial additional costs to all parties with attendant delay in the pending proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to <em>compel </em>will not be disturbed by this Court unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sirius LC v. Erickson, </em>144 Idaho 38, 43, 156 P.3d 539, 544 (2007). Upon review of Bond\u2019s affidavit, we do not see how these depositions would have impacted the ultimate ruling that the Stock Redemption Agreement is illegal and unenforceable due to AIA Service\u2019s undisputed lack of earned surplus. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not commit a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Third, Reed Taylor argues that the district court abused its discretion when it \u201crefused to hear and decide Reed\u2019s Motions to Compel and award sanctions.\u201d Reed Taylor cites to some of his motions in the record but provides no argument and cites no authority in support of this claim. Therefore, we decline to consider this issue. <em>See supra </em>Part III.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Fourth, Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred when it refused to grant his motion to require AIA Services\u2019 and CropUSA\u2019s directors to be ordered to produce corporate documents. \u201cControl of discovery is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Jen-Rath Co. v. Kit Mfg. Co., </em>137 Idaho 330, 336, 48 P.3d 659, 665 (2002). Reed Taylor has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion. In his Opening Brief, Reed Taylor fails to cite anything in the record, cite any authority, or provide any further argument on this issue. <em>See supra </em>Part III.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Fifth, Reed Taylor argues that the district court abused its discretion when it \u201crefused to hear and decide issues of privilege and to compel the production of such documents, electronic data and information.\u201d Even though Reed Taylor sets forth, with citations to authority, various rules governing the waiver and disclosure of privileged information, and while he cites to numerous motions he made in the record, he provides no coherent argument and explanation on appeal as to how the district court abused its discretion. Therefore, we decline to consider the issue. <em>See supra </em>Part III.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Sixth, Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred when it denied his Motion to Compel Audit in its Opinion and Order dated August 2, 2007. In denying the motion, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">Plaintiff asks the Court to compel an audit of AIA Services and AIA Insurance but has presented ... no authority that would allow the Court to enter such an order. Plaintiff instead relies on the rules regarding discovery and asserts from those that the Court has the inherent power to order an audit. The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs argument nor is the Court aware of any authority that would allow it to order Defendants AIA Services and AIA Insurance to undergo an audit as a means of discovery. Plaintiff can, and has, made documentary discovery requests relative to the financial status of Defendants AIA Services and AIA Insurance. The Court finds that utilization of the discovery process should provide Plaintiff with significant information regarding the financial status of Defendants ... and, therefore, finds an audit at this time to be overly intrusive and untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">There being no authority presented to the Court and the Court having found no authority that would allow for an audit to be ordered, the Court denies Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>motion to compel an audit. Nevertheless, the Court will allow Plaintiff to renew his motion if he is unable to obtain sufficient documentation through conventional discovery to fully evaluate the financial status of AIA Services and AIA Insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The district coui\u2019t acknowledged that Reed Taylor could renew his motion to compel an audit if he was not able to fully evaluate AIA Services\u2019 financial status through conventional discovery. On appeal, Reed Taylor fails to argue what information regarding the financial situation of either corporation he has been unable to obtain that would have possibly affected the outcome of the partial summary judgment which is the subject of this appeal. Therefore, we hold that the district acted within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">G. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Reed Taylor\u2019s I.R.C.P. 6(b) and 56(f) motions, excluded his expert witness affidavit, and considered Respondents\u2019 expert affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">First, Reed Taylor argues that the district court erred when it denied his I.R.C.P. 56(f) and 6(b) motions. Rule 56(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Rule 6(b) provides that a party may request additional time to respond if good cause is shown. The decision to grant or deny a Rule 56(f) continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Carnell v. Barker Mgmt., </em>137 Idaho 322, 329, 48 P.3d 651, 658 (2002). On appeal, Reed Taylor asserts that the district court \u201cabused its discretion when it [1] denied one of Reed\u2019s Rule 56(f) Motions, [2] refused to render a decision on another Rule 56(f) Motion, and [3] refused to hear the Rule 56(f) Motion until after [the] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment had already been heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The district court denied Reed Taylor\u2019s Rule 56(f) Motion in the Opinion and Order dated June 17, 2009, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">Defendants\u2019 pending motion asserts the [Stock Redemption Agreement] was unlawful as it violated then existing statutory law. Plaintiff contends that before he can sufficiently defend against Defendants\u2019 assertion, he needs to conduct additional discovery----The Court recognizes Defendants\u2019 motion brings into question the financial status of AIA as it existed in 1995. However, Defendants\u2019 motion was filed in April 2008, more than one year ago, during which time discovery has been ongoing. Plaintiff has failed to direct the Court to any particular information or document relevant to the 1995 financial status of AIA that has been denied to him through the discovery process. Plaintiff merely contends in general, without any specificity, that the Defendants are likely hiding information even though the record indicates Defendant AIA has provided Plaintiff with reasonable opportunity to inspect all 1995 and 1996 financial information still within the possession of AIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden as required by Rule 56(f). His request for a continuance in order to conduct additional discovery is based on mere speculation and on presumptions unsupported by fact or law, despite Plaintiffs voluminous filings---- Plaintiff has provided the Court with no reasonable basis to believe additional discovery will produce new or relevant information not previously disclosed and such discovery would only come at substantial cost to all parties with attendant delay in the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">We do not find that the district court abused his discretion. On appeal, Reed Taylor provides no argument and cites no authority as to why this denial constituted an abuse of discretion, and he does not argue against the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to point to any information or document that may be relevant to the motion for partial summary judgment. As to Reed Taylor\u2019s arguments that this motion was heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>later than it should have been heard and that another motion was never heard, scheduling of court proceedings is within the discretion of the trial court. Furthermore, Reed Taylor fails to point to any information that might have been discovered that could change the outcome of the partial summary judgment, so he has not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice. Pursuant to I.R.C.P. 61, entitled \u201cHarmless error\u201d, courts are instructed to disregard error that does not affect the substantial rights of a party. <em>See Taylor v. McNichols, </em>149 Idaho 826, 836, 243 P.3d 642, 652 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Second, Reed Taylor argues that the district court abused its discretion when it: (1) failed to state why certain paragraphs from the affidavit of his expert witness Pedersen were excluded; and (2) excluded Pedersen\u2019s Amended and Restated Affidavit as untimely. The admission or exclusion of expert witness testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cosgrove v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>117 Idaho 470, 473, 788 P.2d 1293, 1296 (1989). Reed Taylor filed the affidavit of his expert witness Paul Pedersen (the Pedersen Affidavit) on February 26, 2009. In its Opinion and Order dated August 13, 2009, the district court clarified its ruling on the admissibility of the expert affidavits and set forth which paragraphs from the affidavits were admissible for purposes of this limited issue on summary judgment. The district court explained that it did not consider certain specified paragraphs of the Pedersen Affidavit because they were inadmissible or irrelevant. The district court explained that it <em>did </em>consider Pedersen\u2019s chart which set forth AIA Services\u2019 lack of earned surplus. Subsequently, Reed Taylor filed an Amended and Restated Affidavit of Paul Pedersen, which included the same chart showing AIA Sendees had no earned surplus at all relevant times. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Furthermore, even if the district erred in refusing to consider certain portions of the Pedersen Affidavit, and in failing to admit the Amended and Restated Affidavit, Reed Taylor did not suffer any prejudice because both affidavits included the chart which shows that AIA Services had no earned surplus, which was the most relevant portion of the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Third, Reed Taylor argues that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted and relied upon the testimony of Respondents\u2019 experts Voth and Hooper and failed to grant Reed Taylor\u2019s motion to exclude their testimony in full, because these experts were not timely disclosed, or ever disclosed, and Reed Taylor was not able to conduct discovery as to either expert or depose them. Respondents submitted these affidavits to address AIA Services\u2019 lack of earned surplus in 1995 and 1996. Again, Reed Taylor has not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice, as the district court explained, \u201ceach of the accountants, including the Plaintiffs expert, found AIA had no earned surplus in the years 1995 and 1996, but instead had an earned deficit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">H. We will not consider whether the district court erred in dismissing six of Reed Taylor\u2019s causes of action or whether Reed Taylor\u2019s remaining causes of action should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Upon finding the Stock Redemption Agreement to be illegal, the district court issued a Judgment dismissing six of Reed Taylor\u2019s causes of action (breaches of contract, misrepresentations/fraud, conversion, constructive trust, specific performance, breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing). Reed Taylor asserts that the motion for partial summary judgment pertained only to the finding of illegality and claims that the district court abused its discretion in entering the Judgment dismissing six of his causes of action without another hearing or motion. Reed Taylor provides no argument on this issue and cites no authority. Therefore, we will not consider this issue. <em>See supra </em>Part III.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">On cross appeal, Respondents argue that we should dismiss the remaining five causes of action in Reed Taylor\u2019s Fifth Amended Complaint (fraudulent transfers/conveyanees, alter ego, director liability, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy). Reed Taylor argues that these causes of action exceed the scope of this Rule 54(b) appeal. We decline to consider whether Reed Taylor\u2019s remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>causes of action should be dismissed, because doing so goes beyond the scope of this appeal. <em>See Edwards v. Prime, </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cAppellate jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory decision certified under Rule 54(b) is limited to the rulings or orders certified by the district court.\u201d). <em>See also Bowles v. Pro Indiviso, Inc., </em>132 Idaho 371, 376, 973 P.2d 142, 147 (1999) (explaining that an order denying summary judgment is not a final order and that an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">I.

We explained in <em>Trees, </em>138 Idaho at 12-13, 56 P.3d at 774-75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">While both parties\u2019 claims are based upon the commercial relationship between them, neither party should be permitted to claim the benefit of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). The commercial transaction was illegal. In <em>Kunz v. Lobo Lodge, Inc., </em>133 Idaho 608, 612, 990 P.2d 1219, 1223 (Ct.App.1999), the Court of Appeals held the district court erred in awarding attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) because the basis of the commercial transaction was illegal (the leases at issue were entered into knowingly and in direct contravention of a municipal criminal ordinance). The Court of Appeals, therefore, concluded the parties should be left where they were found. Id; <em>Whitney, </em>89 Idaho at 105, 403 P.2d at 579 (1965) (holding that if a contract is void as against public policy, then the court will refuse to enforce it and will leave the parties in the identical situation in which it found them); <em>Nash v. Meyer, </em>54 Idaho 283, 31 P.2d 273 (1934) (citing as fundamental the position that rights based on violation of law will never be enforced by the courts and that when a transaction is shown to be illegal because of contravention of a statute, a court is justified in its refusal to uphold the transaction in any way); <em>Libby v. Pelham, </em>30 Idaho 614, 166 P. 575 (1917) (asserting the position that if a transaction is illegal because in contravention to a statute, it is sufficient to justify a refusal to uphold the transaction in any way, leaving the parties in the situation in which they have voluntarily placed themselves).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Therefore, Respondents are not awarded attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Reed Taylor requests attorney fees and costs on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3), 12-121, and 12-123.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">On the specific facts of this case, we affirm the district court in finding that the Stock Redemption Agreement violates the earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>and </em>capital surplus limitations in I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 and is illegal and unenforceable. We affirm the district court in dismissing six of Reed Taylor\u2019s causes of action. Reed Taylor\u2019s other miscellaneous arguments on appeal fail. No attorney fees are awarded.

JONES, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"ANRK\">specially concurring in the l\u2019esult of Part III.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion, but write separately to specially concur in the result reached in Part III.B. Based upon the public policy of former I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, the overreaching of Reed Taylor, and the current financial situation of the parties under the contract, it is appropriate to hold the Stock Redemption Agreement to be void and unenforceable. This does not necessarily mean that any contract made in contravention of any corporate governance statute is automatically void and unenforceable. Each case should be decided on its own merits. The Colorado Supreme Court provided a helpful framework for analysis in <em>Minnelusa Co. v. A.G. Andrikopoulos, </em>929 P.2d 1321 (Colo. 1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">A minority of state appellate courts have held that stock repurchase agreements which violate statutory prohibitions are illegal and void, and refuse to enforce the obligations contained therein. <em>McGinley v. Massey, </em>71 Md.App. 352, 525 A.2d 1076, 1078-80 (1987); <em>Field v. Haupert, </em>58 Or. App. 117, 647 P.2d 952, 954 (1982); <em>American Heritage Inv. Corp. v. Illinois Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>68 Ill.App.3d 762, 25 Ill.Dee. 431, 436, 386 N.E.2d 905, 910 (1979). However, we find the following language in a case criticizing the minority view to be more enlightened:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">The Court has not, in fact, adopted such a rigid rule that any contract made in violation of any statute is unenforceable. What it has done, although sometimes fleetingly, is to examine the statute at issue and the public policy behind it in an attempt to discern whether the legislature intended for contracts made in violation of the statute to be void or unenforceable. Other Maryland eases have more clearly expressed this notion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\"><em>Springlake Corp. v. Symmarron Ltd. Partnership, </em>81 Md.App. 694, 569 A.2d 715, 718 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">I would suggest that the Court\u2019s opinion not be taken, without some caution, as precedent for the proposition that any contract made in contravention of any corporate governance statute will be held to be void and unenforceable. As indicated in <em>Minnelusa, </em>careful consideration must be devoted to the particular statute in question \u2014 to ensure that it embodies an important public policy \u2014 before a contract made in contravention of it is declared to be void and unenforceable. As the Court acknowledges in our opinion, the former I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6 served an important public policy function \u2014 to protect the interests of minority stockholders and creditors from the surreptitious depletion of a corporation\u2019s capital assets. The facts involved in this statutory violation are also compelling. The Stock Redemption Agreement was decidedly a self-interested one. Reed Taylor engineered a contract for his own benefit, acting as negotiator for the corporation, while at the same time acting on his own behalf as the other contracting party. This certainly heightens the public policy concern, making the transaction considerably more suspect. As to the current financial situation of the parties, Reed Taylor has given up control of his stock but, on the other hand, the respondents claim he has received over $9 million in cash, property, and debt forgiveness. Leaving the parties as they are does not adversely impact minority shareholders or creditors. Thus, given the considerations of public policy, the facts of this ease, and the present financial situation of the parties under the contract, it appears the interests of justice are served by leaving the parties where they currently are.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">While the appropriate result was reached in this case, practitioners should be cautious in drawing any hard and fast conclusions as to whether any contract made in violation of a corporate governance statute will be automatically deemed void and unenforceable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>First, the particular statute involved here embodied an important public policy. Second, the egregious facts support a holding that the transaction is violative of that public policy. Third, a somewhat less suspect transgression of a less critical corporate government statute may not obtain the same result. Fourth, the particular statute in question, I.C. \u00a7 30-1-6, has been repealed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
