JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">This is an appeal from the dismissal of an information against John Schulz, who was charged with felony domestic battery under I.C. \u00a7 18-903 and -918(2) and attempted strangulation under I.C. \u00a7 18-923 of his 15-year-old daughter, E.S. Both charges required the State to prove that E.S. was Schulz\u2019 \u201chousehold member\u201d as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a). The district court granted Schulz\u2019 motion to dismiss based on the fact that she did not fall within that definition. Because we find that the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d plainly limits its application to intimate partners and, thus, does not extend to a child living with her father, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-25\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b896-26\">John Schulz was charged in Kootenai County in July of 2009 with felony domestic battery under I.C. \u00a7 18-903 and -918(2) and attempted strangulation under I.C. \u00a7 18-923 for allegedly injuring his 15-year-old daughter, E.S. Following a preliminary hearing probable cause for the charges was found, based on E.S.\u2019 testimony. The State thereafter filed an information that was consistent with the charges in the complaint but which amended the dates of the alleged incidents to match the preliminary hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>According to E.S.\u2019 testimony, she was living with Schulz on a part-time basis under a shared custody arrangement with E.S.\u2019 stepmother at the time of the charged incidents. The felony domestic battery charge was based on an incident allegedly occurring April 12, 2009, where Schulz made E.S. lie on the ground while he struck her with a belt 10 to 15 times. The attempted strangulation charge was based on a second incident allegedly occurring June 28, 2009, where Schulz grabbed E.S. by the neck and squeezed for about one minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Schulz filed a motion to dismiss the information, asserting that an element of each charge is that the victim be a \u201chousehold member\u201d as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a) and that E.S. did not meet that definition because it did not extend to the parent-child relationship. Schulz asserted that the term \u201ccohabiting\u201d within the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d is ambiguous and, thus, turned to statutory construction to support his argument that the definition only applies to intimate partners. The State countered that the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d unambiguously includes anyone living together, as it was interpreted by the Idaho Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Hansell, </em>141 Idaho 587, 114 P.3d 145 (Ct.App.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The district court entered its Memorandum Decision Re: Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on January 12, 2010, granting Schulz\u2019 motion to dismiss. The district court found that: (1) the term \u201ccohabiting\u201d made the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d ambiguous; (2) the <em>Hansell </em>interpretation was nonbinding <em>dicta </em>as applied to the present case; (3) a plain-meaning reading of \u201ccohabiting\u201d to include all persons living under the same roof would lead to absurd results; (4) the text and legislative history of the definition indicated a focus on intimate relationships to the exclusion of the parent-child relationship; and (5) the Legislature provided child victims protection from parents separately under the injury to child statute, I.C. \u00a7 18-1501. On January 14, 2010, the district court entered its Order to Dismiss reflecting the decision in its prior memorandum. The State filed its Notice of Appeal on January 21, 2011, designating the district court\u2019s Memorandum Decision as the document from which it was appealing, rather than the subsequent Order to Dismiss. The State filed an amended notice of appeal on December 15, 2010, designating the Order to Dismiss along with the Memorandum Decision as the decisions from which the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-11\">I. Whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-12\">II. Whether the district court erred in dismissing the State\u2019s charges on the ground that the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18 \u2014 918(l)(a) does not extend to a daughter living with her father?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Whether an appeal is taken from an appealable order implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this Court; thus, it can be raised at any time by the parties or by the Court <em>sua sponte. State v. Loomis, </em>146 Idaho 700, 702, 201 P.3d 1277, 1279 (2009). Further, it is a question of law that this Court reviews <em>de novo. T.J.T. v. Mori, </em>148 Idaho 825, 826, 230 P.3d 435, 436 (2010). The interpretation of a statute is also a question of law this Court reviews <em>de novo. State v. Anderson, </em>145 Idaho 99, 103, 175 P.3d 788, 792 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">B. This Court has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">On appeal, Schulz asserts that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the State\u2019s Notice of Appeal designates the district court\u2019s January 12, 2011 Memorandum Decision Re: Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, rather than its January 14, 2011 Order to Dismiss, as the document from which the appeal is taken. Schulz argues that the Memorandum Decision is not an appealable order under Idaho Appellate Rule 11(c), so the State\u2019s reliance on that decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>in its notice is fatal to this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. The State counters with two related but distinct alternative arguments: (1) the Memorandum Decision is in substance a final, appealable order in compliance with Rule 11(c) despite the fact that it lacks the proper title; and (2) regardless of the status of the Memorandum Decision, the appeal was timely filed from the date of the undeniably final Order to Dismiss and, thus, any improper designation was a non-jurisdietional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The Memorandum Decision is appeal-able as \u201c[an] order granting a motion to dismiss an information or complaint.\u201d I.A.R. 11(c)(3). The concluding paragraph in the Memorandum Decision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">It is for the above cited reasons that this Court Grants Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and specifically finds that the legislative history and intent of I.C. \u00a7 18-918 does not extend domestic violence protections to crimes committed by parents against their minor children. The alleged conduct of Defendant is prosecutable under other criminal law statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\u201cWhether an instrument is an appealable order or judgment must be determined by its content and substance, and not by its title.\u201d <em>Howell v. Reimann, </em>77 Idaho 84, 87, 288 P.2d 649, 651 (1955). Because the Memorandum Decision clearly grants Schulz\u2019 motion to dismiss the information, it is an appealable order under I.A.R. 11(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">C. The district court did not err in dismissing the State\u2019s charges because the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d plainly limits its application to intimate partners and, thus, does not extend to a child living with a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">On appeal, the State argues that the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d unambiguously includes a child living with her parent because the plain meaning of \u201ccohabiting\u201d within that definition contemplates anyone living together and, therefore, the district court erred in engaging in statutory construction. The State relies heavily on the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>State v. Hansell, </em>141 Idaho 587, 114 P.3d 145 (Ct.App.2005), which interpreted the statute accordingly. Schulz responds that (1) the definition is ambiguous, (2) the <em>Hansell </em>interpretation is overbroad and would lead to absurd results, (3) the text and legislative history indicate a limitation to intimate relationships, (4) the Legislature provided protection for children elsewhere in the code, and (5) the rule of lenity requires construction in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">The crimes of felony domestic battery under I.C. \u00a7 18-903 and -918(2) and attempted strangulation under I.C. \u00a7 18-923 both require that the victim be the defendant\u2019s \u201chousehold member\u201d as that term is defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a). That section defines \u201chousehold member\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">a person who is a spouse, former spouse, or a person who has a child in common regardless of whether they have been married or <em>a person with whom a person is cohabiting, </em>whether or not they have married or have held themselves out to be husband or wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a) (emphasis added). The parties\u2019 focus on appeal is the only section of the definition arguably applicable to a child victim of a parent, \u201ca person with whom a person is cohabiting.\u201d Thus, at issue is the meaning of \u201ccohabiting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">In order to determine this issue, we employ the following principles of statutory interpretation: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Farber v. Idaho State Ins. Fund, </em>147 Idaho 307, 310, 208 P.3d 289, 292 (2009) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>The objective of statutory interpretation is to derive the intent of the legislative body that adopted the act. Statutory interpretation begins with the literal language of the statute. Provisions should not be read in isolation, but must be interpreted in the context of the entire document. The statute should be considered as a whole, and words should be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meanings. It should be noted that the Court must give effect to all the words and provisions of the statute so that none will be void, superfluous, or redundant. When the statutory language is unambiguous, the clearly expressed intent of the legislative body must be given effect, and the Court need not consider rules of statutory construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>We agree with the State that the statute is unambiguous but disagree with the State\u2019s contention that cohabiting extends to all persons living in the household. The term \u201ccohabiting\u201d is a long-recognized term of art plainly denoting an intimate relationship. <em>See State v. Oar, </em>129 Idaho 337, 340, 924 P.2d 599, 602 (1996) (quoting <em>Lorillard v. Pons, </em>434 U.S. 575, 583, 98 S.Ct. 866, 871, 55 L.Ed.2d 40, 47 (1978) (\u201c[W]here words are employed in a statute which had at the time a well-known meaning at common law ... they are presumed to have been used in that sense unless the context compels to the contrary.\u201d)). Since before statehood, Idaho courts have interpreted the term in this way. <em>E.g. U.S. v. Kuntze, </em>2 Idaho 446, 21 P. 407, 2 Hasb. 480 (Idaho Terr.1889) (interpreting the term \u201ccohabit\u201d in a federal bigamy statute to mean \u201cto dwell or live together as husband and wife\u201d). Further, the term was one of the touchstone requirements for proof of a common law marriage in Idaho, being used to describe a couple who lived together in intimacy. <em>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, </em>103 Idaho 122, 127, 645 P.2d 356, 361 (1982) (holding that a common law marriage could be proven in part by \u201ccohabitation, reputation and the manner in which the couple characterize their relationship\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Dictionary definitions also demonstrate that \u201ccohabiting\u201d plainly denotes an intimate relationship. For example, although Webster\u2019s Dictionary secondarily defines the term \u201ccohabit\u201d \u201cto live together or in company,\u201d its primary definition is \u201cto live together as or as if husband and wife usu. without a legal marriage having been performed,\u201d which echoes the common law marriage usage noted above. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 440 (2002). Moreover, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201cthe fact or state of living together, esp. as partners in life, usu. with the suggestion of sexual relations.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). An older Black\u2019s definition is even more limiting, defining \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201ca mutual assumption of those marital rights, duties and obligations which are usually manifested by married people.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">In addition, the surrounding text of the definition only supports this interpretation and shows us no reason why we should read decades of common-law meaning out of the word at issue. <em>Oar, </em>129 Idaho at 340, 924 P.2d at 602. In determining legislative intent, this Court applies the maxim <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which means \u201ca word is known by the company it keeps.\u201d <em>State v. Hammersley, </em>134 Idaho 816, 821, 10 P.3d 1285, 1290 (2000). Here, all examples of \u201chousehold member\u201d preceding the ambiguous phrase \u2014 \u201cspouse, former spouse, or a person who has a child in common regardless of whether they have been married\u201d \u2014 denote a marital or intimate relationship. I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a). In addition, the phrase at issue is followed by the qualifying phrase \u201cwhether or not they have married or have held themselves out to be husband or wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That qualifying phrase indicates legislative intent that \u201ca person with whom a person is cohabiting\u201d is to add to the definitional list any intimate relationships that do not rise to the marital or eoparental statuses already listed, such as boyfriend-girlfriend relationships. Indeed, if the Legislature had intended \u201ccohabiting\u201d to include anyone living under the same roof, regardless of relationship, there would be no need for the qualifying phrase at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">The holding in <em>Hansell, </em>on which the State heavily relies, does not affect our conclusion because it is an incorrect reading of the statute and, in any event, decisions of the Court of Appeals are not binding on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">In sum, because the term \u201ccohabiting\u201d in the definition of \u201chousehold member\u201d plainly does not apply in the absence of an intimate relationship, we find it does not extend to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>child victim of her father\u2019s violence. Therefore, the district court was correct in determining that E.S. was not Schulz\u2019 \u201chousehold member\u201d as required to support the charges against him under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-903, -918(2), and -923.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Because we find that E.S. was not a \u201chousehold member\u201d within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 18-918(l)(a), we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the charges against Schulz.</p>\n<judges id=\"b900-8\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">. The term is also given such meaning in jurisdictions across the country. <em>E.g. Allen v. Allen, 966 </em>S.W.2d 658 (Tex.Ct.App.1998) (discussing various meanings of \"cohabitation\u201d under Texas law, all of which denote a sexual relationship); <em>Kripp v. Kripp, </em>784 A.2d 158, 163 (Pa.Super.Ct.2001) (same); <em>Biggins v. Burdette, </em>392 S.C. 241, 708 S.E.2d 237, 239 (S.C.Ct.App.2011) (determining that \u201ccontinued cohabitation\u201d requires living together in a romantic relationship).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
