JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">Following the decision of this case on the merits, the Appellants sought an award of attorney fees under the \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d prong of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) and for frivolous litigation under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. The district court denied fees on both grounds. We affirm the denial of fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121, but reverse the denial under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">This case arose out of a dispute as to the easement rights of the Respondents over property formerly owned by the Appellants. On May 22, 1987, Daniel Garner entered into a contract to purchase a forty-acre parcel of real property located in Franklin County from Ralph and Thelma McCulloch. The contract of sale purported to provide Daniel an easement across the McCullochs\u2019 property, but the warranty deed whereby the McCullochs conveyed the property to Daniel did not grant an easement. As a result, Daniel did not obtain an express easement. However, as the district court subsequently determined, Daniel ultimately acquired an easement either by prescription or prior use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties refer to this easement as \u201cthe original access road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-23\">On May 23, 1990, Brad<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Leiza Povey (the Poveys) acquired, by warranty deed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>remaining property owned by the McCullochs. As a result of that transaction, the Poveys acquired the property containing the original access road. The warranty deed conveying the property to the Poveys does not mention any easement in favor of Daniel. In the district court, the Poveys conceded that Daniel was entitled to an easement across the property, but they disputed the location and the scope of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In 1992, the Poveys conveyed, by warranty deed, some of the property that they had acquired from the MeCulloehs to Daniel\u2019s parents, Gary and Nola Garner. This property is adjacent to Daniel\u2019s property. The Poveys retained the property containing the original access road. Although the property that Gary and Nola acquired from the Poveys was not accessible without crossing the Poveys\u2019 property, the warranty deed did not grant an easement in favor of the Garners. The deed contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATuS\">TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said premises, with their appurtenances unto the said Grantees, their heirs and assigns forever. And the said Grantors do hereby covenant to and with the said Grantees that they are the owners in fee simple of said premises; that they are free from all incumberances and that they will warrant and defend the same from all lawful claims whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Before the district court, the Garners argued that, because the warranty deed conveyed the property along with its \u201cappurtenances,\u201d the Poveys\u2019 right to use the original access road was conveyed to Nola and Gary. The district court determined that no express easement was granted to the Garners in the warranty deed, but concluded that Gary and Nola had an easement across the original access road by prescription or prior use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Over the next thirteen years, the Poveys conveyed to several other grantees, none of whom are parties to this appeal, portions of the land adjacent to the Garners. During that time, there has apparently been confusion and dispute as to the exact location and nature of the Garners\u2019 easement and the extent to which the Poveys\u2019 successors in interest were on notice of, and recognized, the easement. Indeed, it was the Poveys\u2019, and their successors\u2019, alleged interference with the easement that gave rise to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Daniel Garner, Sherri-Jo Garner, Nola Garner, and Nola Garner as trustee of the Nola Garner Living Trust (the Garners), filed suit against the Poveys alleging that (1) the Poveys physically interfered with the Garners\u2019 easement by plowing over the original access road; (2) the Poveys wrongfully conveyed their property without mentioning the Garners\u2019 easement in the deeds; and (3) the Poveys breached their duty, arising from the 1992 warranty deed between the Poveys and Gary and Nola Garner, to warrant and defend the Garners\u2019 easement. At the time the suit was filed, the Poveys no longer owned the land upon which the original access road is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The district court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the Poveys. The district court determined that the Poveys did not breach any duties owed to the Garners by transferring the property without specifically mentioning the Garners\u2019 easement in the deeds because a servient estate holder has no duty, upon sale of the servient estate, to protect implied or prescriptive easements. The court further determined that the Poveys did not physically interfere with the Garners\u2019 easement. Indeed, the district court found that the Garners were not prejudiced by the Poveys\u2019 act of plowing over the original access road, and that the plowing merely caused a minor inconvenience that did not constitute an unreasonable interference with the easement. The district court did not directly address the Garners\u2019 breach of warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Following the favorable summary judgment ruling, the Poveys submitted a memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>randum of costs and attorney fees. The Poveys requested attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121 on the ground that the Garners brought and pursued the action frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation, and pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) on the ground that the action involved a commercial transaction. In support of their claim for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), the Poveys argued that the Garners\u2019 claims were based on the transaction between the Poveys and Nola and Gary Garner in 1992 whereby Nola and Gary purchased property from the Poveys and that such transaction was commercial in nature. The Poveys also argued that the Garners attested, under oath, in their verified complaint that their action involved a commercial transaction. The district court ultimately denied the Poveys\u2019 request for attorney fees under both I.C. \u00a7 12-121 and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), and the Poveys timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Issues on Appeal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">I.

The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Garners\u2019 motion to strike the affidavit of Jeff Neigum.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">The Poveys assert that the Garners bought this action against the Poveys because Daniel and Sherri-Jo Garner were involved in a family dispute with Brad Povey, and wanted to use litigation as a way to get even. In support of their request for attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121, the Poveys submitted an affidavit from Jeff Neigum, wherein he testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-17\">[Daniel Garner] had a personal vendetta against Brad Povey and was hoping to make us mad at Brad so that we would sue him. He even told me some of the details about the trouble between him and Brad Povey. He told me that Brad had intervened with Brad\u2019s father (the grandfather of Dan Garner\u2019s wife, Sherri-Jo) to keep him from selling to Dan and Sherri-Jo the Troy Grave\u2019s dairy. That intervention by Brad had made Dan and Sherri-Jo very angry with Brad and that is why Dan wanted to make us mad so that we would sue Brad----I feel we were embroiled in this lawsuit because Dan Garner wanted to get even with Brad Povey for a completely unrelated event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">The district court granted the Garners\u2019 motion on the ground that the testimony in the affidavit was not relevant to the issue of whether the Poveys were entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. More specifically, the district court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar4\">a claim under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 must be based on an analysis of the legal positions taken in the case, and not on extraneous factors ____[T]he facts asserted in the affidavit are irrelevant to the question of whether Garners pursued this case frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation. There may be a variety of motives for bringing any lawsuit, some appropriate and some not. But the only question to be considered by this Court is whether the legal theories and facts of the case were pursued in violation of I.C. \u00a7 12-121 and I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). The Court has concluded [] that the issues raised in this case were fairly debatable and legitimate, even when resolved against the Garners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-22\">The Poveys argue that the district court \u201cmade a critical error in the law applicable to its decision\u201d by concluding that it must analyze the legal position taken by the Garners, and not extraneous factors, when determining whether attorney fees were appi\u2019opriate under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. The Poveys assert that Jeff Neigum\u2019s testimony in the affidavit demonstrated that the Garners had an ulterior motive for filing suit against the Poveys and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>therefore, it was relevant to the issue of whether the Garners pursued the action frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The district court determined, in essence, that the statements contained in the affidavit were irrelevant to the issue at hand. The court based its determination to strike the affidavit on I.R.C.P. 56(e), which pertains to affidavits filed in a summary judgment proceeding, but should have based its ruling on I.R.E. 402, which states that \u201c[e]videnee which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d \u201c \u2018The question of whether evidence is relevant is reviewed de novo, while the decision to admit relevant evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sheldon, </em>145 Idaho 225, 228, 178 P.3d 28, 31 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Shutz, </em>143 Idaho 200, 202, 141 P.3d 1069, 1071 (2006)). In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, the Court considers (1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason. <em>Cantwell v. City of Boise, </em>146 Idaho 127, 134, 191 P.3d 205, 212 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Poveys fail to explain how the district court \u201cmade a critical error in the law\u201d in concluding that Jeff Neigum\u2019s testimony was irrelevant to the question at hand. In many cases, the party bringing an action may have a variety of motives for doing so, some of which may be improper. But that fact is irrelevant when the party has a valid legal or factual basis for pursuing the action. Because the Poveys requested attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121, the <em>only </em>relevant inquiry is whether the Garners had a valid legal or factual basis for bringing the action. Therefore, the district court correctly perceived Mr. Neigum\u2019s testimony to be irrelevant to the fee issue and did not err in granting the Garners\u2019 motion to strike his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">B. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Poveys\u2019 request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The Poveys contend that the Garners pursued this action frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation. The Poveys argue that when the Garners brought this suit, the Poveys did not own any of the property involved, nor did the Poveys do anything to interfere with the Garners\u2019 use of the easement or deny the Garners\u2019 right to an easement. They thus conclude that the action was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">In denying the Poveys\u2019 request for attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121, the district court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">This ease raised important questions concerning the types of easements Garners had, what Poveys\u2019 responsibilities were regarding those easements, and whether Poveys had improperly interfered with those easements, either by physically plowing over them or in the [subsequent] conveyances____While the Court concluded as a matter of law that Poveys had no duty with regard to [another grantee\u2019s] deed, Poveys\u2019 duty was a serious and debatable question. There was a paucity of cases dealing with the duties of the servient estate holder with regard to any duty to protect the holder of a prescriptive or pri- or use easement and the Court had to carefully analyze many eases to decide what the duty was and whether Poveys breached that duty____ The Court finds that the many questions discussed in this case about the scope of the easements and Poveys\u2019 duties were \u201cfairly debatable\u201d and required substantial legal analysis for resolution. Under this standard, the Court is not left with the abiding belief that Garners\u2019 claim was pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">Fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 are not awarded to a prevailing party as a matter of right but, rather, are subject to the district court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Coward v. Hadley, </em>150 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Idaho 282, 290, 246 P.3d 391, 399 (2010). A district court should only award fees \u201cwhen it is left with the abiding belief that the action was pursued, defended, or brought frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation.\u201d <em>C &amp; G, Inc. v. Rule, </em>135 Idaho 763, 769, 25 P.3d 76, 82 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, \u201cwhen a party pursues an action which contains fairly debatable issues, the action is not considered to be frivolous and without foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claim is not necessarily frivolous simply because the district court concludes it fails as a matter of law. <em>Gulf Chem. Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Williams, </em>107 Idaho 890, 894, 693 P.2d 1092, 1096 (Ct.App.1984). Furthermore, \u201c[a] misperception of the law, or of one\u2019s interest under the law is not, by itself, unreasonable. Rather, the question is whether the position adopted was not only incorrect, but so plainly fallacious that it could be deemed frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Snipes v. Schalo, </em>130 Idaho 890, 893, 950 P.2d 262, 265 (Ct.App.1997) (internal citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A district court\u2019s denial of fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121 will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Chavez v. Barrus, </em>146 Idaho 212, 225, 192 P.3d 1036, 1049 (2008). In this ease, the district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court correctly perceived the I.C. \u00a7 12-121 issue as a matter within its discretion. The judge recognized that if he found the Garners pursued this action frivolously, unreasonably, or without merit, he could award fees to the Poveys. He then considered the relative merit of the Garners\u2019 claims in light of the limited case law on the subject finding them colorable despite failing as a matter of law. Furthermore, the district court addressed the Poveys\u2019 arguments regarding the Garners\u2019 motives for bringing the suit and their alleged failure to negotiate, appropriately finding both to be irrelevant in the I.C. \u00a7 12-121 analysis. Finally, after concluding that the Garners raised fairly debatable issues, the district court was not left the abiding belief that the Garners\u2019 action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">C. The Poveys are entitled to fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The Poveys assert that the district court erred in failing to award them attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). They present two arguments in support of their fee claim. First, they contend that by alleging in their complaint that the suit was a commercial transaction within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) the Garners \u201ctriggered\u201d the application of that section, entitling them to a fee award. Second, they assert that the transaction was, in fact, commercial in nature and, therefore, they are entitled to a fee award. The Garners counter that the trigger argument is without legal support and that the only way the Poveys could obtain a fee award is to establish that there was a transaction between the parties that was commercial in nature. The Garners submit there is nothing in the record to establish that any transaction between the parties could be characterized as being a commercial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In its ruling, the district court noted, \u201cPoveys first assert that because Garners alleged, in the Complaint, that this case involved a commercial transaction, it must be deemed one and attorney fees must be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d The court rejected this contention based on its interpretation of the holding in <em>Great Plains Equip., Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., </em>136 Idaho 466, 36 P.3d 218 (2001). The court went on to examine the nature of the Garners\u2019 action, finding that it was a dispute about the type of easement the Garners had acquired and whether the Poveys had a legal duty to protect that easement. According to the district court, \u201cthe primary purpose of this litigation was to confirm N[ola] Garner\u2019s easement right and to seek damages if that right was lost or interfered with, either physically or by conveyance, by Poveys.\u201d The district court noted that any commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>transaction in the ease was incidental to the primary purpose of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Disregarding the allegations of the complaint, there was little evidence before the district court that would establish the action as being commercial in nature. In their fee request to the district court, the Poveys failed to argue that the property was to be used for a commercial puipose. Indeed, it was first argued by the Poveys on appeal that the 1992 sale was a commercial transaction because the property was to be used for commercial farming and hauling gravel. Thus, the Poveys\u2019 entitlement to fees must be based upon their first assertion \u2014 that they were entitled to fees because the Garners alleged in their complaint that the parties had engaged in a commercial transaction within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), and that their action was based on such transaction. We conclude that the Poveys are entitled to attorney fees on this basis and that the district court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Whether a district court has correctly determined that a ease is based on a commercial transaction for the purpose of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Great Plains, </em>136 Idaho at 470, 36 P.3d at 222. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) allows for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a civil action to recover \u201cin any commercial transaction.\u201d A commercial transaction includes all transactions except those for personal or household purposes. I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). In determining whether attorney fees should be awarded under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), the Court has conducted a two-step analysis: \u201c(1) there must be a commercial transaction that is integral to the claim; and (2) the commercial transaction must be the basis upon which recovery is sought.\u201d <em>Great Plains, </em>136 Idaho at 471, 36 P.3d at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe commercial transaction must be an actual basis of the complaint____[T]he lawsuit and the causes of action must be based on a commercial transaction, not simply a situation that can be characterized as a commercial transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the relevant inquiry is whether the commercial transaction constituted \u201cthe gravamen of the lawsuit,\u201d and was the basis on which a party is attempting to recover. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 36 P.3d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Pertinent to the inquiry as to whether allegations contained in a complaint can invoke application of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Magic Lantern Productions, Inc. v. Dolsot, </em>126 Idaho 805, 892 P.2d 480 (1995). In that case we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">In <em>Farmers Nat. Bank v. Shirey, </em>126 Idaho 63, 878 P.2d 762 (1994), the Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">Where a party alleges the existence of a contractual relationship of a type embraced by section 12-120(3) ... that claim triggers the application of [I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) ] and a prevailing party may recover fees even though no liability under a contract was established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 878 P.2d at 772.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">This same principle applies where the action is one to recover in a commercial transaction, regardless of the proof that the commercial transaction alleged did, in fact, occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 808, 892 P.2d at 483. This holding makes eminent sense and we, thus, reaffirm it. It would be anomalous to hold, as we have on a number of occasions, that a prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees under the contract prong of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), where the opposing party has alleged a contract as the basis for recovery, even though no contract was established, and then not allow the prevailing party to recover under the commercial transaction prong of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) where the opposing party has alleged a commercial transaction as the basis of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">The district court, however, citing <em>Great Plains, </em>asserted that the above holding in <em>Magic Lantern </em>had been rejected by this Court, quoting from that opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">There must be a commercial transaction between the parties for attorney fees to be awarded. To the extent that <em>Magic Lantern Productions, Inc. v. Dolsot, </em>126 Idaho 805, 808, 892 P.2d 480, 483 (1995) may be read to mandate an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party when the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>party has claimed fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), that interpretation is disavowed. A prevailing party may rely on I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) if pled by another party for recovery of attorney fees <em>if it is warranted under the statute. </em>\u201c[A] court is not required to award reasonable attorney fees every time a commercial tansaetion is connected with a ease.\u201d <em>Bingham v. Montane Resource Associates, </em>133 Idaho 420, 426, 987 P.2d 1035, 1041 (1999) (citing <em>Ervin Construction Co. v. Van Orden, </em>125 Idaho 695, 704, 874 P.2d 506, 515 (1993)). [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 471, 36 P.3d at 223. The district court misunderstood what statement in <em>Magic Lantern </em>this Court was disavowing in the above <em>Great Plains </em>quote. After the <em>Magic Lantern </em>quote that we have reaffirmed above, the Court went on to say, \u201cMagic Lantern sought to recover on an alleged commercial transaction, as evidenced by Magic Lantern\u2019s request for attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808, 892 P.2d at 483. Magic Lantern\u2019s fee request under I.C. \u00a7 12-120 only implied a commercial transaction. There was no contention that Magic Lantern actually pleaded a commercial transaction. <em>Great Plains </em>thus attempted to clarify that a mere request for attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), without more, is not sufficient to trigger the commercial transaction prong of that section. In other words, neither a claim or request in the prayer of a complaint for fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), nor a request or claim for attorney fees in a memorandum of costs and fees, is sufficient to trigger application of that fee provision. A party seeking fees based on a mere request under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) must show that a commercial transaction was the gravamen of the action before a court may award fees. However, allegations in the complaint that the parties entered into a commercial transaction and that the complaining party is entitled to recover based upon that transaction, are sufficient to trigger the application of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">It is true that a fee award was denied to Northwest Pipeline (NWP), the prevailing party in <em>Great Plains, </em>even though the losing party, Cate-Idaho, had claimed it was entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) with regard to an unjust enrichment claim, upon which it subsequently failed to recover. 136 Idaho at 472, 36 P.3d at 224 (\u201cIn this case, attorney fees were requested for the separate claim of unjust enrichment pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), and the gravamen of that claim was a commercial transaction.\u201d). However, the Court held that attorney fees were not available under that statute because \u201c[t]here was no transaction between the subcontractors and NWP. Consequently, NWT3 as the prevailing party cannot rely on I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) for an award of attorney fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 36 P.3d at 225. Further, there was no contention that Cate-Idaho had alleged in its complaint that there was a commei'cial transaction between it and NWP. The Court simply held that a mere request for fees under \u00a7 12-120(3) is insufficient to establish such a transaction. Thus, <em>Great Plains </em>did not overrule the statement in <em>Magic Lantern </em>that a prevailing defendant can recover attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) if the opposing party\u2019s complaint alleges a claim seeking to recover on a commercial transaction, even though it fails to prove that such transaction occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In this case the Garners alleged in their complaint that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">The wrongful actions of [the Poveys] include plowing over Segment \u201cA\u201d of the Original Access Road to facilitate sale of their property; wrongfully conveying property without confirming the right-of-way now held by Daniel, his wife, Nola and the Nola Trust; warranting against the right-of-way; and by actions herein seeking to have Daniel, his wife, Nola and the Nola Trust lose all fully effective access rights. <em>By performing these wrongful actions, the Poveys breached the warranty contained in the Warranty </em>Deed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">(emphasis added). The Garners\u2019 complaint continued, alleging that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">[brought] and pursue[d] this action to preserve their right-of-way and to recover damages against Defendants Brad Povey and Leiza Povey for their wrongful conduct in seeking to extinguish the right-of-way. ... <em>The purchase of the real estate by Gary and Nola from Povey Defendants </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>was a commercial transaction under Idaho Code Sec. 12-120(3) so Plaintiffs ... should be entitled to recover their reasonable attorney fees </em>from Defendants Brad Povey and Lezia [sie] Povey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Daniel and Nola Garner both affirmed these allegations under oath. The Garners did not simply invoke I.C. \u00a7 12-120 as a <em>potential </em>justification for fees; they pleaded it as the law governing the action and they alleged supporting facts in their verified complaint. A commercial transaction was thus integral to the Garners\u2019 claim and it was the basis upon which they sought to recover. This was not a situation where, after the substantive litigation, a party seeking fees attempted to characterize the action as one based on a commercial transaction. Rather, according to the Garners\u2019 complaint, the gravamen of this action was a commercial transaction of the type embraced by I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In this case, the Garners\u2019 allegations triggered application of the statute. Accordingly, the Poveys, as the prevailing party below, were entitled to fees under \u00a7 12-120(3). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s contrary ruling and remand for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">D. The Poveys are entitled to fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The Poveys also argue that they are entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). As discussed above, the Garners\u2019 alleged that this action was based on a commercial transaction, which triggered \u00a7 12-120(3). The Poveys are the prevailing party in this appeal and, accordingly, they are also entitled to fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">We affirm the district court in granting the Garners\u2019 motion to strike Jeff Neigum\u2019s affidavit and denying fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. We reverse the denial of attorney fees for the Poveys under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) and remand to the district court to determine an appropriate fee award. Finally, we award the Poveys costs and attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-12\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W.
