Because the DNA test results did not establish that petitioner did not commit the offense and the affidavits cannot support a claim for post-conviction relief, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">On February 11, 1988, Zane Jack Fields (Fields) stabbed 69-year-old Mary Katherine Vanderford to death while stealing about $50 from the Wishing Well Gift Shop, the store in which she was working. Ms. Vanderford was alone in the store at the time, and there were no eye witnesses to the murder. She bled to death due to a stab wound in her neck. A jury found Fields guilty of felony murder, and the trial court sentenced him to death. After he was sentenced, Fields filed an application for post-conviction relief on April 18, 1991, which the district court denied following an evidentiary hearing. Fields appealed, and we upheld his conviction and sentence and the denial of his application for post-conviction relief. <em>State v. Fields, </em>127 Idaho 904, 908 P.2d 1211 (1995). We need not address the evidence presented during the trial, but it is summarized in the opinion issued on the first appeal. Fields filed a second application for post-conviction relief. After giving notice of the intent to do so, the district court summarily dismissed the application without an evidentiary hearing. Fields appealed, and we upheld the dismissal. <em>Fields v. State, </em>135 Idaho 286, 17 P.3d 230 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">Fields filed a fourth application for post-conviction relief seeking a retroactive application of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). The district court dismissed that application, and we upheld the dismissal on appeal. <em>Fields v. State, </em>149 Idaho 399, 234 P.3d 723 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">This appeal involves Fields\u2019s third application for post-conviction relief, which he filed on June 27, 2002. In 2001, the legislature had amended the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-4901 through 19-4911, to include a claim for relief if fingerprint or DNA test results showed that the petitioner was innocent of the offense for which he or she had been convicted. Ch. 317, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 3, 2001 Idaho Sess. Laws 1126, 1128-30 (codified at I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-4901 &amp; 19-4902). The amendment provided that a convicted defendant could obtain \u201cfingerprint or forensic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on evidence that was secured in relation to the trial which resulted in his or her conviction but which was not subject to the testing that is now requested because the technology for the testing was not available at the time of trial.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19^1902(b). Fields sought to have nineteen latent fingerprints from the murder scene compared with the Automated Fingerprint Identification System national fingerprint database and to have DNA testing of substances on his coat that had tested positive as some type of blood, of hairs found on the victim\u2019s clothing, and of scrapings taken from her fingernails.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">The district court ordered that the Idaho State Police Forensic Lab DNA test the coat, but the lab found that DNA testing could not be conducted because there was insufficient genetic material. The comparison of the fingerprints produced matches to two individuals, but there was no evidence linking them to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The DNA testing determined that the hairs found on the victim\u2019s clothing did not come from Fields. There was also male DNA found in the scrapings from the victim\u2019s fingernails, but it also did not come from Fields. However, there was no evidence that the hairs or the material scraped from the victim\u2019s fingernails came from her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">On November 5, 2007, the State moved to dismiss Fields\u2019s petition on the ground that neither the fingerprint nor the DNA test results entitled Fields to relief. In response, Fields filed affidavits of Jeffrey L. Acheson, Betty Heaton, and Mari Munk, all of whom had testified during his trial. Mses. Heaton and Munk had been in the gift shop and had left shortly before the murder. They both testified to seeing a man in the store before they left, but at trial they did not identify Fields as being that man. Rather, they gave general descriptions of the man and his clothing, and those descriptions did not match Fields. In their affidavits, they basically recount their trial testimony and state that Fields did not look like the man they saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Acheson was one of four inmates who testified to incriminating statements made by Fields. In his affidavit, he stated that the other three inmates who also testified at the trial regarding incriminating statements by Fields \u201ctold me of how they had made up most of what they were saying, in order to get out of Orofino [a prison facility in north Idaho].\u201d The district court denied Fields\u2019s application for post-conviction relief, and Fields appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">1. Did the district court err in summarily dismissing Fields\u2019s post-conviction claim based upon Idaho Code \u00a7 19 \u2014 4901(a)(6)?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">2. Did the district court err in summarily dismissing Fields\u2019s post-conviction claim in spite of the three witness affidavits?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">In its analysis, the district court began by stating, \u201cWhen an innocence claim arises from new, reliable evidence, \u2018holistic judgment about \u201call the evidence\u201d \u2019 is required.\u201d (Quoting from <em>House v. Bell, 547 </em>U.S. 518, 540, 126 S.Ct. 2064, 2073, 165 L.Ed.2d 1, 23 (2006).) The court then stated, \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has ruled that when considering a claim of innocence based on newly discovered evidence, the court should examine whether \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d (Quoting from <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 867, 130 L.Ed.2d 808, 836 (1995).) The court held, \u201cAfter examining all the admissible evidence in this case, this Court concludes that it is not \u2018more probable than not\u2019 that Petitioner is not guilty of the crime for which he has been convicted.\u201d The court erred in relying upon the <em>House </em>and <em>Schlup </em>cases and in applying the quotations from those opinions to this pi\u2019oceeding because neither of those cases has any application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">Schlup had filed a successive petition in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. He contended that \u201cthe ineffectiveness of his counsel and the withholding of evidence by the prosecution denied him the full panoply of protections afforded to criminal defendants by the Constitution.\u201d 513 U.S. at 314, 115 S.Ct. at 860, 130 L.Ed.2d at 827 (citations omitted). His claim of innocence was procedural, not substantive. <em>Id. </em>It was a gateway through which a federal habeas petitioner must pass in order to have an otherwise procedurally barred constitutional claim considered on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 115 S.Ct. at 861, 130 L.Ed.2d at 828. The Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a petitioner who has been sentenced to death raises a claim of actual innocence to avoid a procedural bar to the consideration of the merits of his constitutional claims[,] ... the habeas petitioner [is required] to show that \u2018a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 115 S.Ct. at 867, 130 L.Ed.2d at 835-36 (quoting from <em>Murray v. Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. 478, 496, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2649-50, 91 L.Ed.2d 397, 413-14 (1986)). The Court then stated, \u201cTo establish the requisite probability, the petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>new evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 115 S.Ct. at 867, 130 L.Ed.2d at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><em>House, </em>like <em>Schlup, </em>simply dealt with the gateway standard for obtaining federal habeas review of a proeedurally defaulted constitutional claim. The Supreme Court concluded, \u201cHouse has satisfied the gateway standard set forth in <em>Schlup </em>and may proceed on remand with proeedurally defaulted constitutional claims.\u201d 547 U.S. at 555, 126 S.Ct. at 2087, 165 L.Ed.2d at 32. The Court\u2019s statement about reviewing all of the evidence referred only to that gateway inquiry. It stated, \u201cYet the <em>Schlup </em>inquiry, we repeat, requires a holistic judgment about \u2018 \u201call the evidence,\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 126 S.Ct. at 2078, 165 L.Ed.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In <em>House, </em>the Court made it clear that it was not addressing a freestanding actual innocence claim. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">House urges the Court to answer the question left open in <em>Herrera [v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993) ] and hold not only that freestanding innocence claims are possible but also that he has established one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">We decline to resolve this issue. We conclude here, much as in <em>Herrera, </em>that whatever burden a hypothetical freestanding innocence claim would require, this petitioner has not satisfied it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 126 S.Ct. at 2086-87, 165 L.Ed.2d at 31-32. Thus, House\u2019s evidence satisfied the gateway standard to have his proeedurally defaulted constitutional claims heard, but it would not have satisfied the burden of establishing a freestanding innocence claim if one existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Schlup </em>and in <em>House </em>was addressing the showing required for a federal habeas petitioner to avoid a procedural bar to the consideration of his constitutional claims. The Court was not setting forth a requirement applicable to state claims for post-conviction relief. Neither ease has any application to these proceedings, and the district court erred in relying upon them. However, \u201c[wjhere the lower court reaches the correct result by an erroneous theory, this Court will affirm the order on the correct theory.\u201d <em>Nampa &amp; Meridian Irr. Dist. v. Mussell, </em>139 Idaho 28, 33, 72 P.3d 868, 873 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">A. Did the District Court Err in Summarily Dismissing Fields\u2019s Post-Conviction Claim Based upon Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4901(a)(6)?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4901(a) lists the types of claims for which post-conviction relief can be granted. Subsection (6) authorizes a limited actual-innocence claim based upon fingerprint or forensic DNA test results that establish innocence. It applies when the petitioner claims, \u201c[sjubjeet to the provisions of section 19-4902(b) through (g), Idaho Code, that the petitioner is innocent of the offense.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19-4901(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">What the petitioner must prove in order to establish that claim is set forth in Idaho Code \u00a7 19 \u2014 4902(f), which pi\u2019ovides, \u201cIn the event the fingerprint or forensic DNA test x\u2019esults demonstrate, in light of all admissible evidence, that the petitioner is not the person who committed the offense, the court shall order the appx\u2019opriate relief.\u201d Under the plain wording of the statute, the forensic DNA test x\u2019esults must demonstrate that the petitioner is not the pei\u2019son who committed the offense. The petitioner has the bux\u2019den of establishing that claim by a pi\u2019eponderance of the evidence. <em>McCoy v. State, </em>129 Idaho 70, 72-73, 921 P.2d 1194, 1196-97 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">The first issue to be addx\u2019essed is what evidence the tidal eoui\u2019t must consider in deciding whether Fields presented sufficient evidence to meet that burden. Fields points to the wording \u201cin light of all admissible evidence\u201d and ax-gues that the distinct court was required to consider the DNA test results together with all of the admissible evidence, including the affidavits submitted in the post-conviction proceedings, even if they contain matters that are cumulative or impeaching. In essence, Fields contends that presenting DNA test results requires the distinct coui\u2019t to review all of the evidence admitted at trial and submitted in post-conviction proceedings and then to determine whether the court believes Fields is probably innocent. That argument is contrary to the provisions of Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719, which also apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Section 19-2719 sets forth special appellate and post-conviction procedures applicable in capital cases. When Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 19^4901 and 19-4902 were amended to provide for a limited actual innocence claim based upon fingerprint or DNA test results, section 19-2719(4) was also amended. Ch. 317, \u00a7 1, 2001 Idaho Sess. Laws 1126, 1127-28. That amendment stated, \u201cThe special procedures for fingerprint or forensic DNA testing set forth in sections 19 \u2014 4901(a)(6) and 19-4902(b) through (f), Idaho Code, are fully applicable in capital eases and <em>are subject to the procedures set forth in this section </em>....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1127 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Those procedures required that within forty-two days after the judgment imposing the punishment of death, \u201cthe defendant must file any legal or factual challenge to the sentence or conviction that is known or reasonably should be known.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(3). If the defendant fails to apply for relief within the applicable time limits, \u201che shall be deemed to have waived such claims for relief as were known, or reasonably should have been known.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5). To have a claim in a successive post-eonvietion petition heard, the defendant must show that he or she did not know and reasonably could not have known of the claim within those time limits. I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5). A successive post-conviction proceeding asserting that exception \u201cshall be deemed facially insufficient to the extent it alleges matters that are cumulative or impeaching or would not, even if the allegations were true, cast doubt on the reliability of the conviction or sentence.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19 \u2014 2719(5)(b). Thus, interpreting the words \u201cin light of all admissible evidence\u201d to include matters that are cumulative or impeaching would conflict with the limitations of section 19-2719(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Fields argues that \u201cSection 19-2719(5) only bars <em>claims, </em>not supporting facts.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) That assertion is contrary to our holding in <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>134 Idaho 793, 797, 10 P.3d 742, 746 (2000) (footnote omitted), where, after quoting Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719(5), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">The elements of evidence which Pizzuto claims were wrongfully withheld are all of an impeaching nature. None of the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence tends to show that Pizzuto was not involved in the crime, but could have been used only to attack the reliability of the testimony given by Pizzuto\u2019s co-defendants. ... the statute governing post-conviction relief procedure states that a successive post-conviction pleading \u201cshall be deemed facially insufficient to the extent it alleges matters that are cumulative or impeaching.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(b). Since the withheld information of which Pizzuto complains in this successive petition would have been used only to impeach the testimony of Rice and Odom, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the third amended petition for post-conviction relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Fields\u2019s argument that all evidence must be considered would also conflict with the requirement in section 19-2719 that claims for relief that were known, or reasonably should have been known, are waived if they are not brought within the time limits set forth in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Because a claim of innocence based upon fingerprint or DNA test results is subject to the procedures set forth in section 19-2719, I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(4), the words \u201cin light of\u2019 cannot reasonably be construed as conflicting with those procedures. If Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4902(f) was intended to be a means of circumventing the restrictions of subsection (5) of Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719, then subsection (4) of that code section would not have been amended to provide that \u201c[t]he special procedures for fingerprint or forensic DNA testing set forth in sections 19-4901(a)(6) and 19-4902(b) through (g), Idaho Code, are fully applicable in capital cases and are subject to the procedures set forth in this section.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">The words \u201cin light of\u2019 simply mean \u201ctaking into account; because of; considering.\u201d <em>Dictionary.com Unabridged. </em>Random House, Inc. <em>http://dictionary.reference.com/ browse/in </em>light of (accessed: May 02, 2011). The reference to \u201cin light of all admissible evidence\u201d does not mean \u201ctogether with all other admissible evidence.\u201d It is simply a realization that the test results by themselves will never show that the petitioner is not the person who committed the offense. For example, in this ease the DNA test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>results do not show who was the source of the biological material tested. In order to prove that the DNA test results demonstrate that the petitioner is not the person who committed the offense, there will have to be admissible evidence showing that the material tested came from the person who committed the crime. Under Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4902(f), it is the fingerprint or DNA test results that must demonstrate that the petitioner is not the person who committed the offense. In this case there would have to be admissible evidence showing that the hairs or fingernail scrapings tested came from the murderer. Without such admissible evidence, the test results could not show that Fields was not the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Fields argues that we should assume that the fingernail scrapings came from the murderer based upon the testimony of the pathologist that the victim had a cut on the top of the ring finger of her left hand that appeared to be a defensive wound. At Fields\u2019s murder trial, the pathologist testified that the victim had a wound \u201con the top of the ring finger of the left hand\u201d; that it was a linear injury, \u201cso it could [have been] caused by a sharp instrument such as a knife\u201d; that he did not recall its dimensions; and that he described it as a \u201cdefense wound\u201d because \u201c[s]ometimes when people are being attacked they put their hands up to defend themselves, and this appeared to be consistent with a defense wound.\u201d However, there is no evidence that the victim scratched or even touched her attacker with her hands. There is not even any evidence that she struggled with her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Fields argues that he is entitled to the inference that the victim scratched her attacker because the attacker was close enough to stab her multiple times, because she apparently raised her hand to ward off the attack, and because she was still alive when she was discovered by a customer coming into the store. He contends that he was entitled to have the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to him because this was a summary dismissal of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">When there is a motion for summary dismissal of an application for post-conviction relief, the court must review the facts in a light most favorable to the petitioner. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>149 Idaho 155, 160, 233 P.3d 86, 91 (2010). However, to prevent summary dismissal the petitioner must present evidence establishing a prima facie case as to each element of the claims upon which the petitioner bears the burden of proof. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>146 Idaho 720, 728, 202 P.3d 642, 650 (2008). A mere scintilla of evidence is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 733, 202 P.3d at 655. \u201cThe application must be supported by written statements from competent witnesses or other verifiable information. Unsubstantiated and conelusory allegations are insufficient to entitle a petitioner to an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>149 Idaho 155, 160, 233 P.3d 86, 91 (2010). (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In this case, there was nothing but speculation supporting the claim that the scrapings from the victim\u2019s fingernails or the hairs from her clothing came from her attacker. We therefore uphold the dismissal of Fields\u2019s claim based upon Idaho Code \u00a7 19 \u2014 4901(a)(6) because the DNA test results, in light of all admissible evidence, do not demonstrate that Fields is not the person who committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">B. Did the District Court Err in Summarily Dismissing Fields\u2019s Claim in Spite of the Three Witness Affidavits?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">In response to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, Fields filed three affidavits. Two of the affidavits were from Betty Heaton and Mari Munk, who had been in the gift shop and had left shortly before the murder. At Fields\u2019s murder trial, they both testified to seeing a man in the store before they left, but they did not identify Fields as being that man. They gave general descriptions of the man and his clothing, and those descriptions did not match Fields. In their affidavits, they basically recount their trial testimony and state that Fields did not look like the man they saw. The only material difference between their trial testimony and the statements in their affidavits is that Fields did not look like the man they saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The third affidavit was from Jeffrey L. Acheson, one of four inmates who testified regarding incriminating statements made by Fields while he was incarcerated pending the murder trial. In his affidavit, he stated, \u201cAlso, the other state witnesses, Howie G., Joe H. and Scott Bianchi [the other three inmates] told me of how they had made up most of what they were saying, in order to get out of Orofino.\u201d In addition, he stated, \u201cI can tell you that I\u2019d not have testified against Zane without the information given to me by the police, prosecutors &amp; other witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19 \u2014 4901(a)(4) provides a claim for post-conviction relief when \u201cthere exists evidence of material facts, not previously presented and heard, that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in the interest of justice.\u201d Fields did not allege in his application for post-conviction relief that he was making a claim based upon newly discovered evidence. Likewise, he did not argue to the district court that he was making a claim under section 19 \u2014 4901(a)(4) based upon newly discovered evidence. Finally, he did not make such claim on appeal. He simply argued that such affidavits and the DNA test results established a claim of innocence under section 19 \u2014 4901(a)(6). Such affidavits are not relevant to prove that the DNA test results demonstrate that Fields is not the person who committed the murder. They do not show that the fingernail scrapings or the hairs came from the murderer. Therefore, those affidavits do not create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Fields\u2019s claim under Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4901(6) that the DNA test results demonstrate that he is not the person who committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In addition, the affidavits could not support a claim for post-conviction relief, based upon the assertion that they contained newly discovered evidence. The judgment imposing Fields\u2019s death sentence was filed in March 1991. Within forty-two days of the filing of the judgment, he was required to file any factual challenge to his conviction that was known or reasonably should have been known. I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(3). There is an exception for claims that were not and could not have been known within that time period, but Fields was required to bring those claims within a reasonable time after they were known or should have been known. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>134 Idaho 793, 798, 10 P.3d 742, 747 (2000). Claims not raised within that reasonable time are deemed waived. <em>Stuart v. State, </em>149 Idaho 35, 41, 232 P.3d 813, 819 (2010). In order for a claim filed after the forty-two-day time limit to be heard, Fields was required to make a prima facie showing that the issues raised in his application for post-conviction relief fit within the exception to the time limit. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>127 Idaho 469, 471, 903 P.2d 58, 60 (1995). To do so, he had the burden of alleging facts showing when his claim was known or reasonably should have been known. <em>Stuart, </em>149 Idaho at 42, 232 P.3d at 820. In addition, \u201c[a] successive post-conviction pleading asserting the exception shall be deemed facially insufficient to the extent it alleges matters that are cumulative or impeaching____\u201d I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">The statements in the affidavits of the two women are merely cumulative, restating their testimony during the murder trial. Although in their affidavits they add the statement that the man they saw in the gift shop was not Fields, that merely summarizes their trial testimony because their descriptions of the man they saw clearly did not match Fields. Fields cannot base a claim of post-conviction relief upon evidence that is merely cumulative. I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">The Acheson affidavit likewise would not support a claim for post-conviction relief. The statements at issue in the affidavit attempt to impeach the testimony of the other three inmates and, inferentially, Acheson\u2019s testimony. Statements that are merely impeaching cannot support a successive application for post-conviction relief. During oral argument, Fields\u2019s counsel asserted that Acheson\u2019s statement was admissible under <em>State v. Harris, </em>132 Idaho 843, 979 P.2d 1201 (1999). That case did not involve an application for post-conviction relief. It was a direct appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a witness\u2019s testimony as a sanction for failing to disclose the witness prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>trial. We held that the trial court had abused its discretion because it had not weighed any prejudice that might be suffered by the State against the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The State argued that the exclusion was harmless because it was merely cumulative. We held it was not cumulative because it went directly to the credibility of the complaining witness and reasonably could have affected the outcome of the case. <em>State v. Harris </em>has no application here. Fields cannot base a successive claim for post-eonviction relief upon evidence that is merely impeaching. <em>Pizzuto v. State, </em>134 Idaho 793, 797, 10 P.3d 742, 746 (2000); I.C. \u00a7 19-2719(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Finally, there is nothing in the record indicating when any new facts in the affidavits supporting his claim were known or reasonably should have been known. It was Fields\u2019s burden to allege facts showing that he fits within the exception to Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2719. <em>Stuart v. State, </em>149 Idaho 35, 42, 232 P.3d 813, 820 (2010); <em>Lankford v. State, </em>127 Idaho 100, 101, 897 P.2d 991, 992 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">IV.
