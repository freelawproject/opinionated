Following plea negotiations in which the court participated with the defendant and the prosecutor, Walker entered a plea of guilty to the indictment. In a delayed appeal, Walker raises two meritorious assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate his plea and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>In his first assignment of error Walker contends the court sentenced him in contravention of the plea agreement. Walker\u2019s second assignment challenges the voluntariness of his plea. Since both arguments raise issues which concern the court\u2019s involvement in the plea negotiations, we will address them concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) prohibits a court, in felony cases, from accepting a guilty plea without personally addressing the defendant and determining whether the plea is voluntarily made with an understanding of the nature of the charges and the maximum penalty involved. In assessing the voluntariness of a plea, we are required to scrutinize carefully any participation by the trial court in the plea bargaining process. <em>State v. Byrd </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 288, 17 O.O.3d 184, 407 N.E.2d 1384, syllabus. If the court\u2019s active conduct \u201ccould lead a defendant to believe he cannot get a fair trial because the judge thinks that a trial is a futile exercise or that the judge would be biased against him at trial, the plea should be held to be involuntary * * *.\u201d <em>Id., </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 293-294, 17 O.O.3d at 188, 407 N.E.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Initially, Walker challenges the sentence imposed by the trial court. A conviction for aggravated burglary, an aggravated felony of the first degree, carries with it possible sentences of five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten years minimum to a maximum of twenty-five years. See R.C. 2911.11(B); R.C. 2929.11(B). Although the trial judge promised Walker the five-year sentence as an inducement for his plea, the court later sentenced Walker to a minimum term of seven years. The trial court\u2019s failure to impose the promised sentence constitutes reversible error. See <em>State v. Simms </em>(Dec. 6, 1984), Cuyahoga App. No. 47796, unreported, 1984 WL 6350.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Had the trial court\u2019s active participation in the plea bargaining process been limited to the sentencing discussions, we would be inclined to remand the case for imposition of the minimum sentence. The record, however, demonstrates the court\u2019s participation was extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The trial court acknowledged talking \u201cat length\u201d in chambers with the defendant, his counsel and the prosecutor. The court explained to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>defendant that in his case a plea to a reduced charge was impossible. The record demonstrates the court then told the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cQ. And you and I know you haven\u2019t got a leg to stand on. You can\u2019t try this case. You can\u2019t get up there and testify and have the Jury know how many convictions you got. I think \u2014 I didn\u2019t count them, \u2014 but there are lots. Let\u2019s leave it at that. Okay?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In response to court queries about the circumstances of the alleged crime, Walker stated he had only \u201cattempted\u201d to break into the house and that he had no intention to commit a theft offense. Walker explained he merely wanted a place to sleep. The court then responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cQ. Mr. Walker, you cannot tell that to a Jury. You would be convicted of aggravated burglary and as I said, if you can sell it to the Jury, and I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I didn\u2019t go into details with you, you know, I have talked to you too much. Too nice, and I want an honest, straight answer, you know. You got a track record a mile long.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Walker later stated he was guilty of the charges. We note that the court detailed the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, including his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Nonetheless, we find that the court\u2019s statements regarding the futility of trial on the merits and the court\u2019s expressed attitude toward the defendant\u2019s guilt undermined the voluntariness of the plea. See <em>Byrd, supra. </em>In light of these facts we are compelled to vacate the conviction and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b803-11\">Patton and Ford, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b803-12\">Robert B.
