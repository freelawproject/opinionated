We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Supreme Court precedent clearly indicates that a police officer\u2019s interrogation relative to one\u2019s identity or request for identification is not a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Florida v. Rodriguez </em>(1984), 469 U.S. 1, 5-6, 105 S.Ct. 308, 310-311, 83 L.Ed.2d 165, 170-171; <em>I.N.S. v. Delgado </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 210, 221-222, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1765-1766, 80 L.Ed.2d 247, 258-259; <em>Florida v. Royer </em>(1983), 460 U.S. 491, 497-498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1323-1324, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 235-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">In <em>Florida v. Royer, supra, </em>a plurality of the court agreed that police may ask for and examine an individual\u2019s identification without violating that person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, as the person so approached need not answer any question and may continue on his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Similarly, in <em>Florida v. Rodriguez, supra, </em>a majority of the court held that police officer\u2019s stopping of an individual and asking him for identification is \u201cclearly the sort of consensual encounter that implicates no Fourth Amendment interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">The court reached a similar result in <em>I.N.S. v. Delgado, supra, </em>where it held that brief questioning of factory workers to determine the workers\u2019 citizenship was not a \u201cseizure\u201d of the workforce within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. For the court observed that such questioning \u201ccould hardly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>result in a reasonable fear that [the workers] were not free to continue working or to move about the factory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In applying the foregoing principles to the instant case, it is clear that Cooper was not under any compulsion to respond to Officer Chura\u2019s request for identification, and that Cooper was free to go until Chura discovered the outstanding warrant. We therefore conclude that a \u201cconsensual encounter\u201d took place and that Cooper was not \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when asked for identification by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The ruling of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-7\">John F. Corrigan, P.J., Pryatel and Wiest, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b378-8\">August Pryatel, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, and Mark K. Wiest, J., of the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
