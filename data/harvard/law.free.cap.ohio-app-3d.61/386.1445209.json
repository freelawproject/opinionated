Neidert and plaintiff-appellee, Robert G. Smith, stipulated to the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">\u201c1. On September 29, 1987, in Summit County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court Case No. CV 84 8 2576, judgment was rendered against Gary J. Neidert (\u2018Neidert\u2019) and in favor of Robert G. Smith (\u2018Smith\u2019) in the sum of $9,274.71 plus interest from the date of judgment at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. Said judgment was docketed and entered in Journal No. 1205, Page 790 of this Court\u2019s records and shall hereafter he referred to as \u2018Judgment A.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>The amount remaining unpaid on Judgment A as of April 13, 1988 was $9,536.02.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201c3. On February 18, 1988 this Court entered an Order for Sale of Goods and Chattels directing the Summit County Sheriff to sell the goods and chattels of Neidert at public auction on execution of Judgment A. Said order was docketed and entered in Journal No. 1226, Page 489.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201c4. Pursuant to said order, the Sheriff duly advertised a sale of Neidert\u2019s goods and chattels, said sale to be held on Neidert\u2019s premises on April 18, 1988. The advertisement stated that the goods and chattels had an aggregated appraised value of $18,435 and that they must be sold for not less than 2/3\u2019s of their appraised value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201c5. On February 17, 1988, in Summit County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court Case No. CV 81 5 1243, judgment was rendered against Neidert and Smith and in favor of Akron First Seventh Day Adventist Church, (the \u2018Church\u2019), in the amount of $24,072.03 plus interest at the rate of $5.94 per day from November 10, 1987 through the date of judgment, plus interest at the legal rate thereafter. Such judgment shall hereafter be referred to as Judgment B. As of April 13, 1988, no amounts had been paid on Judgment B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201c6. On April 5, 1988 this Court, in Case No. CV 81 5 1243, acting upon the affidavit of the Church\u2019s attorney, Michael A. Malyuk, that Neidert was holding money that belonged to Smith as a result of Judgment A, directed Neidert to deliver such money to the Court pending resolution of the issue of whether such money was subject to a garnishment order in favor of the Church against Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\u201c7. On April 13, 1988 Neidert filed an Answer of Garnishee in Case No. CV 81 5 1243, stating that he had $9,536.02 of Smith\u2019s money in his possession which he described as \u2018funds due on judgment to Robert Smith, Case No. CV 84-8-2576.\u2019 On the same day, Neidert delivered a $9,536.02 cashier\u2019s check to the Summit County Clerk of Courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\u201c8. On April 15, 1988, Neidert, through his attorney, J. Curtis Alberti, made an oral motion to this Court that Smith\u2019s judgment against Neidert (Judgment A) be deemed satisfied by virtue of Neidert\u2019s delivery of the $9,536.02 cashier\u2019s check, and that the April 18, 1988 Sheriff\u2019s sale be cancelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\u201c9. The Court refused to grant Neidert\u2019s motion but did enter an Order on April 15, 1988 which stayed all execution proceedings presently pending against Neidert, including the Sheriff\u2019s sale, pending further order of the Court. Said Order further enjoined Neidert from disposing of any of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>property which was subject to the Sheriffs sale pending further order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201c10. Prior to Neidert\u2019s delivering the $9,536.02 cashier\u2019s check to the Clerk of Courts, Neidert secured the agreement of the Church that it would fully release him, Neidert, from his individual liability upon Judgment B if and when said money, less any applicable court costs, was paid over to the Church along with certain other funds to be paid directly from Neidert to the Church, which total amount, including the $9,536.02, would be $10,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The trial court held that the Ohio garnishment statute, R.C. 2716.01(B), does not permit garnishment of a separate debt owed by one judgment co-debtor to another and that the judgment in the instant case had therefore not been satisfied. Neidert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u201cThe court had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the subject garnishment proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Neidert contends that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the garnishment because the church was not afforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue. Neidert used the garnishment by the church on Smith\u2019s judgment as a defense and attempted to satisfy both judgments against him with one payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Jurisdiction of the court continues until satisfaction of the judgment, the final action in a case. 47 American Jurisprudence 2d (1969) 80, Judgments, Section 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Accordingly, Neidert\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">\u201cThe court erred in ruling that the Ohio Garnishment Statute, Ohio Revised Code Section 2716.01(B), precludes garnishment of a judgment co-debtor on a separate debt owed by one co-debtor to the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Neidert asserts that R.C. 2716.01(B) does not preclude garnishment from a judgment co-debtor. R.C. 2716.01(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">\u201cA person who obtains a judgment against another person may garnish the property, other than personal earnings, of the person against whom judgment was obtained, <em>if the property is in the possession of a person other than the person against whom judgment was obtained, </em>only through a proceeding in garnishment and only in accordance with this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">The trial court concluded that the language of the statute meant that the garnishee \u201c * * * would always be a non-party, an innocent stake holder, or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>mere custodian of the sought-after property.\u201d Neidert is a co-judgment debtor and not a neutral stake holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Garnishment is a procedure whereby a creditor can obtain property of his debtor which is in the possession of a third party. <em>Peoples Bank &amp; Savings Co. v. Katz </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 297, 301, 32 O.O. 345, 347, 65 N.E.2d 708, 710; <em>Bank One of Columbus v. Lake States Cartage, Inc. </em>(1985), 30 Ohio Misc.2d 22, 23, 30 OBR 286, 506 N.E.2d 1234, 1235. A co-defendant jointly liable for a judgment cannot properly be named as a garnishee, as the co-defendant is not a third party. See <em>Scogin v. Scogin\u2019s Inc. </em>(Fla.App.1974) 287 So.2d 712. Therefore, garnishment is not a proper means of satisfying the judgment in this case since Neidert is not a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Neidert\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">II. \u201cBy consenting to disbursement of the garnishment proceeds by the court, plaintiff is estopped from objecting to the validity of the garnishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">IV. \u201cThe court erred in finding that the judgment owed by defendant to plaintiff was not satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Neidert asserts that the trial court erred in determining that the judgment Neidert owed Smith was not satisfied. Smith never received any money from Neidert. Therefore, the trial court was correct in determining that Smith\u2019s judgment against Neidert was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Additionally, Neidert contends that Smith is estopped from objecting to the validity of the garnishment because Smith failed to object to the garnishment and consented to the release of the garnishment funds to the church. Smith consented to the disbursement to the church if the funds were considered to be Neidert\u2019s and not Smith\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Equitable estoppel exists when a representation of fact is made to a party, who has a right to rely, and does rely, on such representation. Under these circumstances, the party making the representation cannot deny it, if such denial would result in injury or damage to the relying party. <em>McIntosh v. Micheli Restaurant, Inc. </em>(1984), 22 Ohio Misc.2d 5, 6, 22 OBR 118, 119, 488 N.E.2d 1261, 1263; see, also, <em>First Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Perry\u2019s Landing, Inc. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 135, 144-146, 11 OBR 215, 224-228, 463 N.E.2d 636, 646-649.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">The facts of this case show that Smith did not make any statement upon which Neidert relied. Accordingly, Neidert\u2019s second and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Assignment of Error V</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u201cIf the subject garnishment proceeding was invalid the court erred in not directing that the judgment creditor return the garnishment proceeds to the defendant garnishee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Neidert contends that if the garnishment proceeding was improper, the court should return to Neidert the proceeds which the court paid to the church. The stipulated facts indicate that Neidert secured an agreement with the church that it would fully release Neidert from his individual liability if and when the money was paid over to the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In any appeal, error will not be presumed but must appear affirmatively on the record. The burden is on the appellant to show that error occurred. App.R. 9 and 10. This court, having no indication in this record of any error finds Neidert\u2019s fifth assignment of error not well-taken. This record does not contain any entry reflecting the court\u2019s payment of the money to the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court finding that R.C. 2716.01(B) does not permit garnishment of a separate debt owed by one co-debtor to another, and that the judgment in the instant case was not satisfied, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-9\">Mahoney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b423-10\">Quillin, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
