The record indicates that on August 6, 1990, defendant, Carol Hadinger, was charged with domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25. The complaint provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cComplainant being duly sworn states that Carol Hadinger at Franklin County Ohio, on or about the 6th day of August 1990 did knowing. <em>\\sic </em>] cause physical harm to a household member, to wit, Ellensara Evans, person living as spouse, by means of biting said other person on the right hand * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">On October 1, 1990, the trial court on a half-sheet entry stated that the charge was being dismissed at the request of the prosecutor. A judgment entry was subsequently filed on November 1, 1990, correcting its previous entry of October 1, 1990, by <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>dismissing <em>sua sponte </em>the domestic violence charge against defendant from which plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">On appeal, plaintiff has set forth two assignments of error for this court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in dismissing the charge of domestic violence since the trial court improperly considered the legal sufficiency of the evidence in dismissing the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-11\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in dismissing the charge of domestic violence since the definition of \u2018person living as a spouse\u2019 in R.C. 2919.25(E)(2) includes persons of the same sex who are cohabiting or have cohabited within the past year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">Initially, we note that defendant in her appellate brief agrees with plaintiff that both assignments of error should be sustained and the trial court\u2019s judgment reversed. <em>Amicus curiae </em>briefs have been filed on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., and the Ohio Human Rights Bar Association, all of which are in support of plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">In its first assignment of error, plaintiff has argued that the trial court improperly considered the legal sufficiency of the evidence in dismissing the charge. However, it appears from the trial court\u2019s entry that dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>not due to the sufficiency of evidence but rather upon the trial court\u2019s statutory construction of R.C. 2919.25 and its conclusion that the domestic violence statute could not be applied in the present case. See Crim.R. 48. As the dismissal was not based upon the sufficiency of the evidence, we find plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error to be not well-taken and it is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In its second assignment of error, plaintiff argues that the trial court construed R.C. 2919.25 too narrowly so as to preclude its application to the facts in the present case. R.C. 2919.25 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">\u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">\u201c(D) As used in this section and section 2919.26 of the Revised Code:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">\u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means any of the following, who is residing or has resided with the offender:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">\u201c(a) A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-11\"><em>i&lt; </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-12\">\u201c(2) \u2018Person living as a spouse\u2019 means a person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within one year prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">R.C. 2919.25 specifically includes in its definition of a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d a person who is otherwise cohabiting with the offender. No cases have been cited nor have we discovered any case law which defines the term \u201ccohabit\u201d as used in R.C. 2919.25(E)(2). However, for reference purposes we note that \u201ccohabitation\u201d has been defined in various other domestic relations cases. While these cases are limited by law and by their facts to persons of opposite sex, they do provide an appropriate starting point for our decision in the present case. In <em>Sindel v. Sindel </em>(1975), 7 O.O.3d 223, this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-14\">\u201c * * * The ordinary meaning of cohabitation is, of course, the act of living together. What constitutes living together is a question of fact in each particular case. * * * Ordinarily, isolated acts of sexual intercourse during the two-year period, unaccompanied by other aspects of living together, would not constitute cohabitation. Conversely, cohabitation can be based entirely on acts of living together without sexual relations. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>In <em>Lester v. Lester </em>(May 14, 1981), Franklin App. No. 81AP-84, unreported, 1981 WL 3186, this court quoted from the <em>Sindel </em>decision and reiterated that \u201ccohabitation means the act of living together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">While involving the termination of sustenance alimony, this court held in paragraph two of its syllabus in <em>Fuller v. Fuller </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 253, 10 OBR 366, 461 N.E.2d 1348:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">\u201cCohabitation <em>usually </em>will be manifested by a man and woman living together in the same household and behaving as would a husband and wife, although there need not be an actual assertion of marriage.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">In <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 279, 280-281, 11 OBR 459, 461, 465 N.E.2d 476, 478, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">\u201c * * * Sexual intercourse, in short, is not the <em>sine qua non </em>of the 'cohabitation\u2019 intended * * *. It may be a persuasive indicium of cohabitation, but it is not everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">\u201c * * * [W]e conclude that the cause should be remanded to the trial court for a determination of the issue of cohabitation absent reliance on the <em>conclusive </em>nature of a sexual relationship between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The one factor common among each of the foregoing cases was that the parties were living together. This is also common to the definition of \u201ccohabit\u201d set forth by Random House Dictionary: \u201cto live together as husband and wife, usually without legal or religious sanction * * * to live together in an intimate relationship. * * * \u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2 Ed. 1987) 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Again, none of the cases cited involved two persons of the same sex and we are therefore in the present case faced with a unique factual situation. While the trial court apparently imposed the requirement that persons to be charged pursuant to R.C. 2919.25 have the ability to marry, such does not appear to be the case given the broad language of the statute. Given the language of R.C. 2919.25, this court concludes that the legislature intended that the domestic violence statute provide protection to persons who are cohabiting regardless of their sex. We believe that to read the domestic violence statute otherwise would eviscerate the efforts of the legislature to safeguard, regardless of gender, the rights of victims of domestic violence. We decline to adopt such a restrictive position and therefore conclude that R.C. 2919.25(E)(2) defining a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d as a person \u201cwho otherwise is cohabiting with the offender\u201d does not in and of itself exclude two persons of the same sex. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s second assignment of error is well-taken and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Based upon the foregoing, plaintiffs first assignment of error is not well-taken and is overruled. Plaintiffs second assignment of error is well-taken and is sustained. The judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b856-6\">Petree and Reilly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b856-7\">Archer E.
