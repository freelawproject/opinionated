This case is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>timely appeal from the trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to suppress physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The police officer\u2019s initial investigative stop of appellee\u2019s car based on a police radio broadcast of a robbery suspect was proper under <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, since both the robbery suspect and appellee, Jameel Hakeem, were observed to be wearing a red-hooded sweatshirt. However, we agree with the trial court that the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that appellee was involved in criminal activity dissipated when appellee exited his vehicle and, being 5'6\" tall, did not resemble the 6'2\" tall robbery suspect. See <em>id. </em>Once it was determined that appellee was not a suspect, the officers had no lawful right to conduct a warrantless search of appellee\u2019s vehicle. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">While the officer testified the suspected cocaine was observed in plain view, the appellee\u2019s testimony indicates the suspected cocaine, pager and car phone were only discovered after the police officers opened the car door and had searched the vehicle for several minutes. Thus, competent credible evidence exists to support a finding that the \u201cplain view\u201d exception does not apply here. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 82, 9 O.O.3d 81, 377 N.E.2d 1013. Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Assignments of Error I and II are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-10\">John V.
