Higgins (\u201cdefendant\u201d), from a judgment of the court of common pleas finding defendant guilty of felonious assault and child endangering.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Defendant was baby-sitting the two youngest children of Michael and Linda Allen on Sunday, October 26, 1986. Apparently, defendant had been a close family friend of the Allens for five years and had periodically watched each of the four Allen children, especially two-year-old Amanda and nine-month-old Sean. On the night in question, while baby-sitting Amanda, she suffered extensive bruises and a broken right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The next day, defendant was arrested and charged with felonious assault and child endangering, both of which are second degree felonies. The Franklin County Grand Jury returned indictments on February 12, 1987 against defendant on one count of felonious assault under R.C. 2908.11 and on one count of child endangering pursuant to R.C. 2919.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Although the trial was originally scheduled for June 10, 1987, the matter was continued six times, twice at defendant\u2019s request, and was commenced on June 1, 1988. It was defendant\u2019s testimony that the injuries Amanda suffered were the result of a fall down the stairs which was the result of Amanda being startled while standing on the second step from the top of the flight of stairs. Defendant further testified that he dove forward in an attempt to save Amanda, but was only able to grab a portion of her stomach; that his grip did not hold, and both he and Amanda fell down the rest of the stairs, landing on a hardwood floor; that he applied an ice pack to Amanda\u2019s face to reduce swelling; that he called the emergency squad because he felt her injuries were more serious than he initially suspected; and that he incurred several injuries to the upper portion of his body as a result of the fall. The state\u2019s evidence consisted primarily of the testimony of the examining physician, Dr. Elizabeth Allen, a medical resident in pediatrics who examined Amanda on the night in question, and the child\u2019s hospital records and reports, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>reports of two consulting physicians who also observed Amanda. Based on this evidence, a jury convicted defendant on both the felonious assault and child endangering counts on June 7, 1988. Defendant was then sentenced to two concurrent terms of four to fifteen years on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Defendant now appeals and sets forth the following six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201c1. The trial court committed prejudicial error in denying appellant\u2019s Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The trial court committed prejudicial error when it permitted Elizabeth Allen to give expert testimony concerning the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries when she was not a qualified expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201c3. The court committed prejudicial error when, over objections of appellant, it failed to exclude from evidence prejudicially damaging hearsay contained in portions of the Children\u2019s Hospital medical records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>The court committed prejudicial error by abusing its discretion when, in response to a jury question, it told the jury that \u2018all the hospital records were evidence\u2019 and by failing to allow the jury to rehear the testimony of the medical technician and Elizabeth Allen prior to reaching a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201c5. Appellant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution was violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201c6. The jury\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Under his first assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court committed prejudicial error in denying defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Crim.R. 29(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">\u201cMotion for Judgment of Acquittal. The court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. The court may not reserve ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s evidence, defendant made a motion for a judgment of acquittal under Crim.R. 29(A). Defendant\u2019s motion was overruled by the trial court. A review of the record indicates that defendant then proceeded to present his defense through his own testimony but failed to renew the motion at the close of all of the evidence. Plaintiff asserts that the actions of defendant constituted a waiver of any error by the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>overruling the motion. We agree. As provided in <em>State v. Deboe </em>(1977), 62 Ohio App.2d 192, 194, 16 O.O.3d 467, 468, 406 N.E.2d 536, 538:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201c * * * An accused waives his right to a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case by thereafter introducing evidence and failing to renew the motion at the close of all the evidence. <em>State v. Houser </em>(1942), 73 Ohio App. 115 [28 O.O. 209, 55 N.E.2d 273]; 15A Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 656, Crim.Prac. &amp; Proc., Section 533; 2 Schroeder-Katz, Ohio Criminal Law 235-gg * * * <em>))</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">See, also, <em>State v. Durham </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 231, 236, 3 O.O.3d 280, 283, 360 N.E.2d 743, 747-748 (since defendant elected to proceed with trial and offer evidence on own behalf following close of state\u2019s case, any error in overruling motion for acquittal was waived); <em>State v. Whitmeyer </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 279, 282, 20 OBR 370, 373, 485 N.E.2d 1055, 1058 (\u201c * * * it is well-established that where a defendant, after moving for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, offers evidence on his own behalf, any error which might have occurred in overruling the motion is waived * * * \u201d); <em>State v. Parks </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 276, 279, 7 OBR 357, 360-361, 455 N.E.2d 498, 501-502 (when criminal defendant testifies in his defense after trial court has overruled his motion to dismiss at close of state\u2019s case, he waives his right to claim error in overruling such motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Defendant asserts in his second assignment of error that the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting Dr. Elizabeth Allen to testify concerning the child\u2019s injuries. Defendant argues that Dr. Allen did not possess the knowledge or training required for her to be a properly qualified expert and that at the time of the accident she was not licensed to practice medicine in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Initially, we note that during the trial defendant raised no objection to the testimony of Dr. Allen regarding either her qualifications or her diagnosis of the child. We further note that there is a dispute in memoranda as to Dr. Allen\u2019s status at the time she examined the child. Defendant has attached an exhibit to his brief, not part of the trial record, which would indicate that Dr. Allen was certified to practice medicine on January 29, 1987. Plaintiff contends that the trial record indicates that Dr. Allen was licensed to practice medicine in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">In general, \u201c * * * the ruling of a trial judge as to the qualifications of an expert witness is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion, which is conclusive unless it is clearly shown to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Aszman </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 64, 66, 4 OBR 114, 116, 446 N.E.2d 803, 806. The proper inquiry as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the expert testimony given by this witness is not whether she was a licensed physician. The medical training Dr. Allen received does not change after-she obtains her license. The proper question, rather, is whether this particular witness had sufficient knowledge and experience to testify about the injuries to the child and whether the witness was capable of distinguishing between injuries which would be compatible with a fall down a stairway as opposed to injuries which would be the result of possible child abuse. A review of the trial transcript reveals that the cross-examination of Dr. Allen by defense counsel fails to adequately raise these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">While Dr. Allen\u2019s credentials to testify on these matters may have been subject to dispute, defense counsel\u2019s failure to make an attempt to denigrate the witnesses\u2019 qualifications at trial or to make any objection concerning Dr. Allen\u2019s direct testimony constitutes a waiver of any error by the trial court in admitting her testimony. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, and <em>State, ex rel. Specht, v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 178, 20 O.O.3d 191, 420 N.E.2d 1004. See, also, Evid.R. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Defendant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error are interrelated and will be considered together. Both assignments deal in part with the trial court\u2019s admission of medical records from Children\u2019s Hospital concerning treatment of the child following her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, plaintiff moved to admit into evidence the hospital records in their entirety. Defendant raised a general objection to the admission of the records and the court provisionally admitted the records subject to examination by the court at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Following the close of all the evidence, the subject of the hospital records was raised again. At that time, the following discussion between the court and defense counsel took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * I had indicated, so I want the record make <em>\\sic </em>] clear on this, I had made clear the other day that with respect to one of the State\u2019s exhibits ***[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\"><em>(&lt; </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">\u201c * * * [Wjhich is in effect the record from Children\u2019s Hospital, that because there was some objection by defense that I would look at the record, and I want to make it clear right now that I started to look at the record before lunchtime today. There was a discharge summary that I noted had a reference in it by a doctor, and I have previously indicated in the presence of counsel outside the courtroom that I will sustain the objection to a reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in the discharge summary to the term, I think it was \u2018battered child syndrome.\u2019 Now, that is excluded from the discharge summary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cWhat I want to make clear to counsel is despite what had been my intent, I did not go through the rest of the record, and I am not making any ruling with respect to any other data in the record. The record in general will be admitted as it was provisionally with the exception of the related part in the discharge summary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cI guess in a nutshell for the benefit of counsel for the defendant, I did not look any further. I am not saying anything further about that record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\"><em>\u201cIf there is something specific you want to bring up, now is the time to do it </em>and not later, and we can deal with it. Otherwise, it will go as submitted with the change that has been made in the discharge summary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Anything further, * * * [counsel], that you want to raise about the hospital records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201c* * * [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, I don\u2019t think so, Your Honor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">A review of the transcript reveals that the trial court, following the close of all the evidence, gave defense counsel the opportunity to raise objection to admission of any specific portions of the hospital records which were not already deleted. At that point, no objection was raised by counsel to the admission of the evidence now contested before this court. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise a timely objection amounts to a waiver of any claimed error by the trial court in admitting these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Counsel\u2019s waiver as to admissibility of the records precludes defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred when, in response to a question from the jury concerning whether all of the hospital records were evidence, the court answered \u201cyes.\u201d We further note that when the jury\u2019s question came before the court, defense counsel made no objection to this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Defendant also asserts that the trial court erred in failing to allow the jury to rehear the testimony of the medical technician and Dr. Allen prior to reaching a verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">A review of the transcript indicates that the trial court declined the jury\u2019s request to rehear specific testimony based upon the court\u2019s view that the trial had not involved an inordinate period of time. The court further expressed a desire to avoid reviewing certain testimony, apparently to prevent undue emphasis by the jury on that portion of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>It is a well-established principle that the decision of a trial court, whether or not to permit a jury to rehear testimony, lies within the sound discretion of the court. See <em>State v. Berry </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 255, 54 O.O.2d 374, 267 N.E.2d 775; and <em>State v. Weind </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 224, 4 O.O.3d 413, 364 N.E.2d 224. In the present case, we find defendant has not demonstrated an abuse of discretion as a result of the court\u2019s refusal to allow certain testimony to be reread to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In his fifth assignment of error, defendant contends that the representation provided by his defense counsel so lacked in professional competence and expertise as to deny him his right to counsel and a fair trial. More specifically, defendant argues that his trial counsel was deficient in: failing to object to two ex parte continuances before the grand jury heard the indictment; agreeing to the continuance of this case beyond the statutory speedy trial time without any objection; failing to properly examine the state\u2019s evidence supplied during discovery and to prepare for cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses; failing to obtain his own medical expert and/or opinion that would support the injuries to the child being consistent with a fall down a stairway; failing to object to constant leading of the witnesses by the state; failing to object to portions of Dr. Allen\u2019s testimony and failing to voir dire the witness or question her credentials; failing to renew his motion for a directed verdict at the close of his own case knowing that the state\u2019s case was supported only by circumstantial evidence; failing to call any witnesses other than defendant to support defendant\u2019s position; failing to ask for an in camera inspection of the state\u2019s evidence at the close of the state\u2019s case; and failing to object to the admission of multiple photographs of the same view of the child in her bruised condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We only address one of defendant\u2019s allegations because we hold that a new trial must be granted on the basis of that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 396, 2 O.O.3d 495, 498, 358 N.E.2d 623, 627, the Ohio Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201cWhen considering an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, a two-step process is usually employed. First, there must be a determination as to whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client. Next, and analytically separate from the question of whether the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated, there must be a determination as to whether the defense was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>As the Ohio Supreme Court has recently noted in <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373, 379, the standard set forth in <em>Lytle, supra, </em>\u201cis essentially the same as the one enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674].\u201d Under the court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Strickland, </em>counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until it is proven that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Our focus under this assignment of error is on defense counsel\u2019s conduct in examining the state\u2019s evidence supplied during the discovery process and the effect that counsel\u2019s preparation for this material had during the trial stage. More specifically, this court\u2019s concern deals with counsel\u2019s handling of the hospital records and the subsequent admission of these records at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">As previously noted under the third and fourth assignments of error, during trial the trial court deleted a reference in the hospital records to \u201cbattered child syndrome\u201d contained in a discharge summary prepared by a physician. The court then acknowledged that time constraints had prevented further review by the court of the remaining hospital records. At that time, trial counsel was given the opportunity to object to specific portions of the hospital records. Counsel offered no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">A review of these records indicates that they are replete with similar potentially prejudicial hearsay references to \u201cphysical abuse,\u201d \u201cchild abuse\u201d and \u201cbattered child.\u201d These references come not only from physicians but also through observations from nurses on duty at the time of the child\u2019s admittance. To fail to object to the admission <em>in toto </em>of hearsay opinions and impressions pertaining to ultimate issues to be decided in this case was highly prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Other damaging statements are contained in the hospital records, including a statement by the child\u2019s mother who, in response to a question as to whether defendant had a history of violent behavior, stated, \u201che has some hx [history] of wife abuse.\u201d A one-page physician\u2019s report contains the following statement: \u201cThe mother states that the abuse caused by the baby-sitter that caused this injury is currently being evaluated by the Courts.\u201d While we recognize that under certain circumstances hospital records may be properly admitted into evidence at trial <em>(e.g., </em>Evid.R. 803[4], statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, or Evid.R. 803[6], records of regularly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ducted activity), clearly these statements had no relevance to treatment or diagnosis and were harmful to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">There is absolutely no reasonable basis for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of these records when given the opportunity by the trial court. The trial judge had already determined that a reference in the records to \u201cbattered child syndrome\u201d was unduly prejudicial to defendant and deleted that portion from the records. While we can only speculate as to what effort trial counsel made to examine these records prior to trial, even a cursory examination by counsel would have revealed numerous other potentially prejudicial references throughout these documents. Defense counsel\u2019s conduct in failing to properly investigate the hospital records combined with counsel\u2019s subsequent failure to object to their admission at trial \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d by which effective assistance of counsel is evaluated. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Moreover, we find that counsel\u2019s errors, resulting in the admission of the hospital records at trial, significantly prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.' Under the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the proper inquiry is whether there exists a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Determining whether prejudice resulted to defendant requires some speculation as to how much emphasis the jury may have placed on the numerous hearsay references contained in the hospital records. While it is difficult to predict the effect that counsel\u2019s errors may have had in the jury\u2019s weighing of the evidence, we cannot overlook the fact that the jury, during the deliberation process, sent a note to the court inquiring whether all of the information in the hospital records was to be considered as evidence. The court answered affirmatively to the jury\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">This is a troubling case in which the state\u2019s evidence was largely circumstantial in nature. The evidence at trial consisted primarily of Dr. Allen\u2019s testimony, defendant\u2019s denial and the admission of the hospital records. While the opportunity was available for trial counsel to present a strong defense, counsel\u2019s lack of preparation and errors prevented this. The admission of the hospital records in the form presented to the jury was clearly harmful to defendant\u2019s case, and the numerous hearsay references contained in the records concerning possible abuse in all likelihood reinforced this prejudicial information in the minds of the jurors. The jury\u2019s inquiry to the court during deliberations regarding use of the records raises serious concerns as to the degree of importance the jury placed on the records in weighing the evidence. Even absent trial counsel\u2019s errors, leading to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>admission <em>carte blanche </em>of the hospital records, the evidence in this case was closely balanced. We are persuaded that the outcome of this case might have been different had portions of the hospital records been objected to and properly deleted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In light of the above, our confidence in the outcome is undermined such that we cannot say that defendant received effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 697-698. We sustain defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Having found that defendant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance concerning the examination and handling of the hospital records, we find it unnecessary to assess the individual impact of each of defendant\u2019s remaining allegations of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The sixth and final assignment of error contends that the decision of the jury was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The basis for this assertion is that due to the circumstantial nature of the evidence, no evidence was presented which was wholly inconsistent with a reasonable theory that the child was injured by falling down the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In considering whether a conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences and considers the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 218-219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720-721. While we have previously noted the circumstantial nature of the evidence present in this case, our concern does not involve the manifest weight of the evidence but rather the performance of defense counsel in adequately representing this defendant. Based upon our review of the records, including the testimony of Dr. Allen, we find that there existed sufficient evidence which, if believed by the jury, would have supported the judgment returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Based upon our finding of ineffective assistance of counsel under the fifth assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-12\">Whiteside and Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
