LEMONS.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1, the taking of a person's DNA upon arrest for certain crimes constitutes an unconstitutional seizure. We also consider whether the presentation of DNA evidence in this case violated the defendant's right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings Below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 23, 1991, Laura M. Berry (\"Berry\") was raped, sodomized, and robbed while walking to the school where she worked. After the attack, Berry walked to the school\n   and notified police. Berry was taken to the hospital where Detective Steven G. Milefsky (\"Milefsky\") took her statement. Dr. Val Chapman (\"Dr.Chapman\") examined Berry and used a physical evidence recovery kit (\"PERK\") to collect specimens for evidence. Dr. Chapman then gave the PERK to Milefsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Milefsky took the PERK he received from Dr. Chapman to the Virginia Forensic Laboratory in Fairfax County (the \"laboratory\") and gave the PERK to a clerk at the laboratory. On July 25, 1991, Karen C. Ambrozy (\"Ambrozy\"), a forensic scientist employed by the Commonwealth of Virginia's Division of Forensic Science obtained the PERK. Ambrozy received the PERK from another person working in the laboratory's forensic biology section. Ambrozy analyzed and conducted DNA analysis on vaginal swabs contained in the PERK. On January 9, 1992, Milefsky picked the PERK up from a clerk at the laboratory and returned it to the Fairfax County police property room (the \"police property room\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2001, Milefsky took the PERK to the laboratory and again left it with one of the laboratory clerks. During the time the PERK was at the laboratory in 2001, Ambrozy conducted more DNA analysis. As part of the process, Kari Yoshida (\"Yoshida\"), a laboratory technician, prepared the product gel as part of the process for Ambrozy to determine if she had obtained any amplified DNA. Then, on September 4, 2001, Milefsky picked the PERK up from the laboratory and returned it to the police property room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 1991 to 2003, Berry's case was not investigated. In early 2003, Angel M. Anderson (\"Anderson\") was arrested in Stafford County on unrelated charges of rape and sodomy. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1, a sample of Anderson's DNA was taken upon his arrest and entered into a DNA databank. Upon entry into the DNA databank, a routine analysis resulted in a \"cold hit\" that appeared to match Angel's DNA to that found in Berry's PERK.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December of 2003, Milefsky received a certificate of analysis from the laboratory preliminarily identifying Anderson as a possible suspect in Berry's attack. As a result of the investigative lead provided by the certificate of analysis, on January 6, 2004, Milefsky went to Stafford County to serve Anderson with a search warrant. The search warrant permitted a sample of Anderson's DNA to be obtained \"by means of buccal (cheek) swabs in sufficient quantity to obtain laboratory results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to the search warrant, Milefsky obtained two buccal swabs from Anderson and took them to the laboratory along with Berry's PERK. Ambrozy compared the buccal swabs taken from Anderson with the DNA found in the PERK. Milefsky then received a certificate of analysis prepared by Ambrozy which stated that the sperm fraction from the vaginal swabs taken from Berry were \"consistent with the DNA profile of Angel M. Anderson.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 15, 2004, the case was presented to the grand jury which indicted Anderson for the rape, robbery, and sodomy of Berry. At trial, a jury found Anderson guilty on all counts, and the trial court imposed the recommended two life terms plus ten years. Anderson appealed to the Court of Appeals, where his convictions were affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477715\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/704/#p718\">\n    48 Va.App. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477715\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/704/#p718\">\n    634 S.E.2d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (2006). Anderson appeals to this Court upon two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The Court of Appeals erred when [it] held that it is not a Constitutional violation to seize Mr. Anderson's DNA, pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1, upon arrest for an unrelated felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The Court of Appeals erred by holding that the presenting of DNA evidence did not violate Mr. Anderson's Constitutional right of confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A. The DNA Sample\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Anderson first argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it held that it was not a constitutional violation to seize Anderson's DNA, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1, upon arrest for an unrelated felony. Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1 states in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Every person arrested for the commission or attempted commission of a violent felony as defined in \u00a7 19.2-297.1 or a violation or attempt to commit a violation of \u00a7 18.2-31, 18.2-89, 18.2-90, 18.2-91, or 18.2-92, shall have a sample of his saliva or tissue taken for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis to determine identification characteristics specific to the person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held that Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2, requiring a convicted felon to provide a blood, saliva, or tissue sample for DNA analysis, does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Murray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520781\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/302/#p308\">\n    962 F.2d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308 (4th Cir.1992);\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

While Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1 requires a DNA sample after an arrest for specific offenses, as opposed to a conviction, like Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2, it too does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon arrest, the accused is subjected to a routine booking process, including the taking of fingerprints. A DNA sample of the accused taken upon arrest, while more revealing, is no different in character than acquiring fingerprints upon arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [W]hen a suspect is arrested upon probable cause, his identification becomes a matter of legitimate state interest and he can hardly claim privacy in it. We accept this proposition because the identification of suspects is relevant not only to solving the crime for which the suspect is arrested, but also for maintaining a permanent record to solve other past and future crimes. This becomes readily apparent when we consider the universal approbation of \"booking\" procedures that are followed for every suspect arrested for a felony, whether or not the proof of a particular suspect's crime will involve the use of fingerprint identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520781\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/302/#p308\">\n    962 F.2d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like fingerprinting, the \"Fourth Amendment does not require an additional finding of individualized suspicion\" before a DNA sample can be taken.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520781\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/302/#p308\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520781\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/302/#p308\">\n    at 306-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The analogous treatment of the taking of DNA samples to the taking of fingerprints has been widely accepted. In addition to the Fourth Circuit in the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   case, the Second Circuit held \"[t]he collection and maintenance of DNA information, while effected through relatively more intrusive procedures such as blood draws or buccal check swabs, in our view plays the same role as fingerprinting.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicholas v.

The Third Circuit held that \"[t]he governmental justification for [DNA] identification ... relies on no argument different in kind from that traditionally advanced for taking fingerprints and photographs, but with additional force because of the potentially greater precision of DNA sampling and matching methods.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Ninth Circuit said \"[t]hat the gathering of DNA information requires the drawing of blood rather than inking and rolling a person's fingertips does not elevate the intrusion upon the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment interests to a level beyond minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    Rise v.

However, Ambrozy was the author of the certificate of analysis, appeared at trial in person, testified as to its contents, and Anderson had the opportunity to cross-examine her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A report of analysis duly attested by the person performing such analysis or examination in any laboratory operated by ... the Department of Forensic Science or any of its regional laboratories ...\n   <em>\n    shall be prima facie evidence in a criminal or civil proceeding as to the custody of the material described therein from the time such material is received by an authorized agent of such laboratory until such material is released subsequent to such analysis or examination.\n   </em>\n   Any such certificate of analysis purporting to be signed by any such person shall be admissible as evidence in such hearing or trial without any proof of the seal or signature or of the official character of the person whose name is signed to it. The signature of the person who received the material for the laboratory on the request for laboratory examination form shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the person receiving the material was an authorized agent and that such receipt constitutes proper receipt by the laboratory for purposes of this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 contains a presumption that the Department of Forensic Science maintained a proper chain of custody at all times while the samples were in its possession. Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 states that a \"duly attested\" \"report of analysis\" shall be \"prima facie evidence\" as to the custody of the material while it is in the laboratory. The effect of a prima facie showing under this statute is to create a \"presumption.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g., Martin v. Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204731\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/263/640/#p645\">\n    263 Va. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=561%20S.E.2d%20672\">\n    561 S.E.2d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (2002) (\"This presumption of a grant or adverse right is prima facie only and may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.\").

Such a challenge is to the admissibility of the evidence, and not to the substance of the evidence itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court relied upon the text of an 1828 dictionary to define \"witnesses\" against the accused as those who \"bear testimony,\" and \"testimony\" as \"[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    541 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing 2 N.

Furthermore, Anderson has no Confrontation Clause violation regarding the presumption afforded by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 because the presumption is not testimonial in nature. Simply stated, the evidentiary presumption regarding chain of custody is relevant to the admissibility of the evidence. It is the substance of the evidence, namely the content of the certificate, that is a \"solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\" accusatory to Anderson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The presumption afforded by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 is not testimonial in nature.
