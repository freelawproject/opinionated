LACY.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Terri Hackley McCabe was convicted in 1997 of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. Because of this conviction, she was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the provisions of former Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 (1995 &amp; Supp.1997). In 2001, that Code section was amended reclassifying a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 as a \"sexually violent offense\" and changing the reregistration requirements. McCabe initiated this litigation asserting that application of the changed reregistration requirements to her violated her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that requiring McCabe to comply with the altered reregistration requirements does not violate her substantive due process or procedural due process rights and that her equal protection\n   claim is moot. Therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court dismissing her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 19, 1997, McCabe pled guilty to taking indecent liberties with a minor by a person in a custodial or supervisory relationship in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. At the time of McCabe's conviction, former Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 required her to register with the State Police as a \"sex offender\" and to reregister annually for a period of 10 years. Former Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-298.1, -298.2 (1995 &amp; Supp.1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2001, the General Assembly amended former Code \u00a7 19.2-298.1 and reclassified a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 as a \"sexually violent offense.\" 2001 Acts ch. 840. Because McCabe had been convicted of an offense that the amendment defined as a \"sexually violent offense,\" she was required to reregister as a sex offender every 90 days for the rest of her life. Former Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-298.1 (2000 &amp; Supp.2001), -298.2 (2000).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2006, McCabe filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County asserting that she should not be classified as a \"violent sex offender\" for purposes of the reregistration requirements. McCabe argued that the reclassification of her offense violated her substantive due process, procedural due process, and equal protection rights under the United States Constitution. The Commonwealth filed a demurrer asserting that McCabe failed to state a cause of action because the reclassification did not interfere with any liberty interest or fundamental right, did not violate any due process or equal protection rights, and the legislation was rationally related to legitimate state interests. The circuit court granted the Commonwealth's demurrer and entered an order dismissing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We awarded McCabe an appeal on five assignments of error which collectively raise the same arguments made in the circuit court: that the legislation reclassifying her criminal conviction as a \"sexually violent offense\" and requiring her to register quarterly as a sex offender for life rather than annually for the ten-year period imposed under the prior statute, violated her substantive and procedural due process rights and her right to equal protection granted under the Constitution of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Substantive Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   McCabe contends that the statutory reclassification of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 affected two of her fundamental constitutional rights. First, she claims that the \"compelled personal appearance of registrants constitutes a deprivation of [her] liberty interest.\" Second, she asserts that she has a fundamental right to rely on the statutory registration scheme in existence at the time of her guilty plea, which required only annual registration for a ten-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The principles applicable to claims asserting a denial of substantive due process rights are well established. First, the claimant must clearly describe and establish that the interest asserted is a fundamental right or liberty interest specially protected under the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

From this holding, McCabe derives the principle that \"compelled personal appearance by a registrant before law enforcement personnel . . . is constitutionally defective when incorporated into a criminal sentence,\" and argues that the same rationale should be applied to the civil registration provisions at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first note that nothing in the statute or regulations suggests that a personal appearance is required for the periodic reregistration. In-person registration is specifically required for the initial registration and changes in residence, name, owned vehicle registration, and employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-903. The regulations enacted pursuant to the statute specifically provide a mailing address for the submission of registration and reregistration forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 VAC \u00a7 30-170-15. Code \u00a7 9.1-904(A) defines reregistration as meaning that \"the person has\n   <em>\n    notified\n   </em>\n   the State Police\" and confirmed certain information. (Emphasis added). Therefore, the imposition upon McCabe's claimed liberty interest cannot be defined as an in-person registration requirement. Furthermore, although McCabe asserts that she is now required to reregister in person every 90 days, Code \u00a7 9.1-909(A) allows her to file a petition for relief from the 90-day reregistration requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, in considering McCabe's claimed liberty interest, we limit our consideration to whether a lifetime quarterly reregistration requirement, which can be reduced to an annual reregistration requirement, violates McCabe's substantive due process rights. This is a question of first impression in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Virginia sex offender registration legislation is similar to legislation enacted by all other states in response to the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children &amp; Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014071\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , enacted by Congress in 1994.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Procedural Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   McCabe next argues that her \"automatic\" reclassification violated her procedural due process rights because the focus of the Act is to protect the public against repeat sex offenders and the legislation failed to provide \"any procedures by which a judicial officer could evaluate the likelihood of future recidivist tendencies of sex offenders and there were no statutory guidelines which could be the basis for such a reclassification.\" McCabe asserts that a hearing would have enabled her to establish that \"she was not a repeat sex offender and never exhibited any recidivist tendencies\" and therefore should not be classified as a sexually violent offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Department of Public Safety v. Doe,\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court addressed whether the Connecticut sexual offender registration statute violated procedural due process by failing to allow convicted sex offenders a hearing on current dangerousness before registry information was disclosed to the public. 538 U.S. at 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p8\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the registration requirement was based solely on the fact of a prior conviction, not a determination of current dangerousness, the Court concluded that \"due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State's statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Classification of a crime as a \"sexually violent offense\" under the Virginia statute is based solely on the nature of the crime, not on a determination of current dangerousness. As with the Connecticut sex offender statute, no process is necessary to prove a fact not material to the classification determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030296\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   McCabe also argues that the terms of the Act provide that \"[e]very person\n   <em>\n    convicted of a sexually violent offense\n   </em>\n   . . . shall reregister with the State Police every 90 days from the date of initial registration,\" Code \u00a7 9.1-904(A) (emphasis added), and that she was never\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of a \"sexually violent offense.\" McCabe argues she was merely convicted of a \"sexual offense\" and the General Assembly could not reclassify her conviction absent procedural due process. This claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Code \u00a7 9.1-902 specifically defines the term \"sexually violent offense\" for purposes of the civil registry scheme. Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 does not incorporate the term \"sexually violent offense,\" nor did it incorporate any other descriptive term, such as \"sexual offense,\" before or after 2001. Thus, it is inaccurate for McCabe to claim she was convicted of only a \"sexual offense.\" She was convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 and that conviction is the only fact relevant to the classification determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the change in classification of a prior conviction in a civil registration scheme\n   does not necessitate any additional process for McCabe because, as the trial court properly held, McCabe \"failed to allege that a hearing on the reclassification would have established facts relevant to the legislature's statutory scheme.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Equal Protection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   McCabe claims that the reclassification violated the Equal Protection Clause because she, like others convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 since July 1, 1997, was required to follow the more stringent reregistration obligation imposed upon \"sexually violent\" offenders, while those convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 after July 1, 1994, but prior to July 1, 1997, remained subject to the requirement of annual reregistration for ten years. McCabe asserts that there is no rational basis for the distinction based on the timing of the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although not raised by the Commonwealth or the circuit court, the current statute, Code \u00a7 9.1-901(A), provides that the registration requirements apply to all persons convicted of an offense set out in Code \u00a7 9.1-902 \"on or after July 1, 1994.\" Therefore, the registration distinction based on the timing of the conviction asserted by McCabe does not exist and her equal protection claim based on such a distinction is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In summary, McCabe's substantive due process claim fails because she has not established a fundamental right or liberty interest impacted by the 2001 amendments. McCabe's procedural due process claim fails because a hearing on the reclassification of her offense would not have established any facts relevant to her reclassification, and McCabe's equal protection claim is moot because no distinction is currently made between convictions for violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1 before and after July 1, 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing McCabe's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In 2003, the General Assembly repealed the existing sex offender registration requirements, including Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-298.1 and -298.2, and replaced them with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act (the Act), Code \u00a7 9.1-900 et seq. 2003 Acts ch. 584.
