Those issues are 1) whether a county board of supervisors is a required party defendant in a legal action contesting the board's decision to grant a conditional use permit; and 2) whether neighboring landowners may file a declaratory judgment action contesting a county planning commission's decision that a certain conditional use is in \"substantial accord\" with that county's comprehensive plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2004, Highland New Wind Development, LLC (New Wind) filed an application seeking a conditional use permit (CUP application) to build an electric generation substation in the County on property that is located in an agricultural zoning district, zone \"A-2,\" as provided in the Highland County Zoning Ordinance (zoning ordinance). In addition to the substation, New Wind sought approval to construct 20 wind turbines about 400 feet in height, a height that exceeds the maximum height permitted by the zoning ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The zoning ordinance designates zone \"A-2\" as a district in which construction of an electric generation substation is permitted only after \"the [g]overning body finds, as a fact, that the proposed use is compatible with surrounding uses, is consistent with the intent of this [o]rdinance and of the\n   <em>\n    Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan,\n   </em>\n   is in the\n   public interest, and will comply with all other provisions of law and ordinances of Highland County or the Town of Monterey.\" The Board of Supervisors (the Board) approved an amendment to the zoning ordinance (the height amendment), which authorized the Board to issue conditional use permits allowing structures that exceed the maximum heights provided in the zoning ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After conducting a public hearing on the CUP application, the Board adopted a resolution in July 2005, granting New Wind a conditional use permit (the CUP) for construction of the wind turbine project. In its resolution, the Board made several \"findings,\" including that the CUP was compatible with surrounding uses, was consistent with the intent of the zoning ordinance and the land use element of the comprehensive plan, and would be in compliance with all other statutes and ordinances. Additionally, the Board's resolution stated, \"[t]he authority granted by this [p]ermit shall be conditioned on the receipt of all required state and federal approvals and review pursuant to [] Code \u00a7 15.2-2232.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2006, New Wind filed an application asking that the planning commission review the CUP under the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.2-2232. After conducting a public hearing on New Wind's application, the planning commission determined that the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with the comprehensive plan as required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. MILLER'S PROCEEDINGS IN CIRCUIT COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lucile Swift Miller and several other owners of property adjoining the proposed wind turbine site (collectively, Miller) filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court, alleging that the Board acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and without authority, in approving the height amendment. Miller named \"Highland County, Virginia\" as the sole defendant in the bill of complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pendleton Stokes Goodall, III, and several other landowners adjoining the proposed wind turbine site (collectively, Goodall), filed a separate bill of complaint for declaratory judgment against \"Highland County, Virginia,\" New Wind, and the owners of the wind turbine project site, Tamarack of Highland, LLC, and Red Oak Ranch, LLC (Tamarack and Red Oak). Goodall alleged that the CUP was invalid because the planning commission had not made a determination whether the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with the comprehensive plan before the Board issued the CUP and that, therefore, the CUP did not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 15.2-2232. Goodall also alleged, among other things, that the CUP was inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and was an arbitrary and capricious exercise of the Board's power. The circuit court consolidated Miller's and Goodall's cases for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   New Wind, Red Oak, and Tamarack (collectively, New Wind) filed a demurrer and a plea in bar, asserting that the actions filed by Miller and Goodall (collectively, Miller) were barred because Miller failed to name the Board as a party to the actions. The circuit court overruled the demurrer and plea in bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All parties filed motions for summary judgment. After conducting a hearing, the circuit court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Highland County and New Wind, holding that the height amendment was valid and that the CUP was properly issued even though the planning commission did not make its \"substantial accord\" determination under Code \u00a7 15.2-2232 before the Board issued the CUP. The circuit court denied summary judgment and ordered a bench trial on the separate issues whether the Board made factual findings that complied with the requirements of the ordinance before the Board issued the CUP and whether the Board's actions were arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After a trial in which several witnesses testified concerning the subjects the Board considered when it granted the CUP, the circuit court upheld the Board's decision. The circuit court concluded that the Board made factual findings as required by the ordinance, that the evidence was conflicting whether the Board's decision to issue the CUP was \"reasonable,\" and that, as a result, the Board's decision issuing the CUP was\n   \"fairly debatable.\" The circuit court entered final judgment in favor of New Wind and the County. Miller appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III. MILLER'S APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Miller's appeal, New Wind and Highland County (collectively, New Wind) argue as a matter of cross-error that the circuit court erred in denying New Wind's plea in bar. According to New Wind, Miller's action is barred because she failed to name the Board as a party to the action within 30 days after the Board's decision as required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F). New Wind asserts that we held in\n   <em>\n    Friends of Clark Mountain Found., Inc. v. Board of Supervisors,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2111031\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/242/16/\">\n    242 Va. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20S.E.2d%2019\">\n    406 S.E.2d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), that a local governing body is a required party to an action contesting a decision by that governing body. New Wind further contends that \"Highland County, Virginia\" is not the legal equivalent of the \"Board of Supervisors of Highland County,\" because \"Highland County\" is a \"locality,\" while the Board is a \"governing body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, Miller argues that \"Highland County, Virginia\" is a \"locality\" as defined by Code \u00a7 15.2-102, and that Code \u00a7 15.2-1404 subjects a \"locality\" to being sued in its own name regarding all matters connected with its duties. Miller further asserts that Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F) does not mandate that a local governing body be named in an action challenging one of its decisions, but only requires that such an action be filed within 30 days of the local governing body's decision. Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors v. Board of Zoning Appeals,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632057\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/604/7/\">\n    268 Va. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632057\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/604/7/\">\n    604 S.E.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), Miller contends that a person aggrieved by a local governing body's decision may, pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.2-1404, contest that decision by naming the \"locality\" as the defendant. Finally, Miller also argues that if the Board is a necessary party, this Court may join the Board as a party to the action or, if the Board is a required party, the name of Highland County is a misnomer and may be amended to name the Board. We disagree with Miller's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We resolve these issues by considering the provisions of several statutes, in addition to some of our prior decisions.

Title 15.2 of the Code, which addresses the matters raised in these appeals, provides distinct definitions of the two terms. A \"locality,\" within the meaning of Title 15.2, \"shall be construed to mean a county, city, or town as the context may require.\" Code \u00a7 15.2-102. In contrast, the term \"[b]oard of supervisors\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   refers to the \"governing body of a county.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632279\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/607/103/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Title 15.2 contains several additional statutes that illustrate the General Assembly's intent to recognize governing bodies as entities distinct from their respective localities. These statutes clarify that although localities are given certain powers by statute, those powers may only be exercised through the authority of the governing bodies. For example, Code \u00a7 15.2-1401 provides that, generally, \"all powers granted to localities shall be vested in their respective governing bodies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632279\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/607/103/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   More specific to the subject of Miller's appeal, Code \u00a7 15.2-1425 gives the \"governing body\" of each locality the authority to \"adopt, as appropriate, ordinances, resolutions and motions.\" Thus, while providing that \"[a]ny locality may, by ordinance, classify the territory under its jurisdiction\" for purposes of land use, Code \u00a7 15.2-2280, the General Assembly has vested the actual power to make such decisions in each locality's governing body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1401 and -1425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because we must assume that the General Assembly acted with great deliberation and care in choosing the words establishing this statutory scheme, we conclude that the governing body of a locality is a distinct legal entity authorized in Title 15.2 to exercise the statutory powers of that locality. Thus, we are faced with the question whether this distinct legal entity must be joined as a party defendant in a legal action contesting its legislative exercise of a zoning power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In answering this question, we consider the language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F), under which the present action was filed contesting the Board's decision granting the CUP. This statutory provision states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Every action contesting a decision of the local governing body adopting or failing to adopt a proposed zoning ordinance or amendment thereto or granting or failing to grant a special exception shall be filed within thirty days of the decision with the circuit court having jurisdiction of the land affected by the decision. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create any new right to contest the action of a local governing body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In drafting Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F), the General Assembly employed plain language in providing a right of appeal from various zoning decisions of a local \"governing body.\" The statute fixes a 30-day period from the date of the decision by the local \"governing body\" for filing an action in the circuit court contesting such decision. The complete absence of any language in Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F) referring to a \"locality\" indicates a legislative intent that only the \"governing body,\" the entity that rendered the contested decision, be a required party defendant in an action challenging that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Friends of Clark Mountain\n   </em>\n   directly supports this construction of Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F). There, we were presented with a question under former Code \u00a7 15.1-493(G), the predecessor statute of Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F), regarding which parties were required to be named as defendants within the statutory period of 30 days. We rejected the argument of a board of supervisors that all parties having an interest in the property at issue had to be named as party defendants within the 30-day period. We stated that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [W]hen the action contesting the governing body's decision is filed, the only required parties to a proceeding under [the statute] are the contestant and the local governing body. After the contesting action has been instituted and is pending, however, and the absence of a necessary party is noted of record, the trial court should not adjudicate the controversy until that party has intervened or has been brought into the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2111031\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/242/16/\">\n    242 Va. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20S.E.2d%2019\">\n    406 S.E.2d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord Riverview Farm Assocs. v.

This general provision, however, does not address the issue whether a board of supervisors is a required party defendant in a legal action contesting that board's exercise of its legislative power, but merely states that a locality may be a plaintiff or be named as a defendant in a legal action involving the locality's duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Notably, Code \u00a7 15.2-1404 also provides that in actions brought against a locality, process instituting such actions \"shall be served as provided in [Code] \u00a7 8.01-300.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20S.E.2d%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-300 specify that when an action is filed against a county, service of process generally is made on its county attorney.

In specifying these different methods of service of process, the General Assembly further manifested its intent that a \"locality\" and its \"governing body\" are not interchangeable terms but have separate legal identities that must be observed in initiating an action against either as a party defendant in a legal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, we disagree with Miller's contention that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors v.

Even if we assume, without deciding, that such remedies could in some cases be employed on appeal, they are inappropriate here.

BRODY'S PROCEEDINGS IN CIRCUIT COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tom Brody, Patty Reum, and several other landowners who own property near the wind turbine project site (collectively, Brody) filed a motion for declaratory judgment in the circuit court. Brody named as defendants Highland County, Virginia, the Highland County Planning Commission, and the Highland County Board of Supervisors (collectively, the Highland County Board), and Highland New Wind Development, LLC, Tamarack of Highland, LLC, and Red Oak Ranch, LLC (collectively, New Wind), and sought to invalidate the planning commission's determination that the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with Highland County's comprehensive plan. Brody asked the circuit court to declare that the planning commission did not have jurisdiction or authority to review the CUP after it was issued by the Board. Alternatively, Brody asked the circuit court to declare, among other things, that the planning commission decision was \"not in accord with law,\" was not \"in accord with the existing County comprehensive plan,\" and was \"arbitrary and capricious, and void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Highland County Board filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Code \u00a7 15.2-2232 conferred jurisdiction on the planning commission to review the permit, that the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with the comprehensive plan, and that Code \u00a7 15.2-2232 does not provide to a private third-party a right of action for persons such as Brody to contest the planning commission's decision. New Wind joined in the Highland County Board's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Brody also filed a motion for summary judgment. In his motion, Brody asserted that the planning commission's decision that the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with the comprehensive plan was invalid because it was not supported by factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The circuit court conducted a hearing on the motions and concluded that the planning commission's decision that the CUP was in \"substantial accord\" with the comprehensive plan was sufficiently supported by evidence in the record, despite the fact that the planning commission review pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.2-2232 occurred after the Board issued the permit. The circuit court granted the motions for summary judgment filed by the Highland County Board and New Wind but did not address the Board's argument that Brody had no right of action under Code \u00a7 15.2-2232. Brody appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   V. BRODY'S APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In Brody's appeal, the Highland County Board argues as a matter of cross-error that Brody's action is barred because Code \u00a7 15.2-2232 does not create a private third-party right of action to challenge a planning commission's finding that a proposed use is in \"substantial accord\" with a comprehensive plan. The Highland County Board contends that under Code \u00a7 15.2-2232(B), only a property owner who has been denied a conditional use permit may appeal a planning commission's \"substantial accord\" determination, and that this right of appeal lies only to the local governing body. The Highland County Board also asserts that Brody's attempted use of the declaratory judgment statutes to challenge the planning commission's determination is invalid under this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Shilling v.

However, Brody responds that under these circumstances, a declaratory judgment action provides the only mechanism for review of the planning commission determination at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addressing these arguments, we consider both the general nature of a declaratory judgment action and the particular language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2232. A circuit court has the power to issue declaratory judgments under Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-184 through -191.

Notably, the statute does not provide\n   third parties with a right of appeal from such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We have previously held that the declaratory judgment statutes may not be used to attempt a third-party challenge to a governmental action when such a challenge is not otherwise authorized by statute. In\n   <em>\n    Shilling,\n   </em>\n   a neighboring landowner filed a declaratory judgment action asking a circuit court to declare void the creation of a certain \"family subdivision\" approved under an ordinance permitting conveyances to members of a landowner's immediate family. 268 Va. at 205-06, 597 S.E.2d at 208. The neighboring landowner alleged that the subdivision was \"wrongfully\" approved by local officials based on misrepresentations of fact made by the applicant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205-06, 597 S.E.2d at 208.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendants filed demurrers alleging that the local governing body was the sole entity authorized to enforce the ordinance, and that the complainants could not seek to enforce the ordinance provisions by using the remedy of declaratory judgment. The circuit court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the bill of complaint with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206, 597 S.E.2d at 208. We affirmed the circuit court's judgment, holding that the complainants did not have a third-party right of action to enforce a county's application of its subdivision ordinance in a declaratory judgment suit when there was no specific statutory authorization allowing third parties this right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208, 597 S.E.2d at 209-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The rationale underlying our decision in\n   <em>\n    Shilling\n   </em>\n   applies equally well here. The declaratory judgment statutes are not intended to provide, and do not create, a right of appeal that does not otherwise exist. In attempting to create such a right in his bill of complaint, Brody failed to state a cause of action. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court erred in concluding that Brody had a right to bring an action in the circuit court challenging the planning commission's \"substantial accord\" determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The circuit court, however, reached the correct result in Brody's case by granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, although on grounds incorrectly addressing the merits of the suit.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on our holdings in these appeals, we will reverse the circuit court's final judgment in favor of New Wind and Highland County in Miller's case, and we will dismiss Miller's bill of complaint with prejudice because Miller failed to join the Board as a party to the action within 30 days of the Board's decision. We also will affirm the circuit court's award of summary judgment in favor of New Wind and the Highland County Board, because Brody failed to assert a valid request for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Record No. 062111 -\n   <em>\n    Reversed and dismissed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Record No. 062489 -\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
