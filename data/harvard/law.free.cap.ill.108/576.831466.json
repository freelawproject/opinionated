Fellow-servants\u2014who to he so regarded, within the rule respondeat superior. To constitute servants of the same master \u201cfellow-servants,\u201d within the rule respondeat superior, it is not enough that they are engaged in doing parts of the same work, or in the promotion of the same enterprise carried on by the master, not requiring cooperation, or bringing them together, or in such relations as that they may have an influence upon each other, but it is essential that at the time it is claimed such relation exists, they shall be directly cooperating with each other in the particular business in hand, or that their usual duties shall bring them into habitual consociation, so that they may exercise an influence upon each other promotive of proper caution.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-15\" pgmap=\"576\">2. Same\u2014;former decision. In the case of Chicago and Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Moronda, 93 111. 302, it was not intended to be decided as a matter of law that a section foreman of a gang of track repairers, and the engineer or fireman on an engine drawing a train, all employees of the defendant, were not directly cooperating with each other in their respective labors, and \u2022that their usual duties did not bring them into habitual consociation, so that they might exercise an influence upon each other promotive of proper care, but this was merely assumed as a hypothesis, for the purpose of eliminating from previous decisions the proper rule of law.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-16\" pgmap=\"576\">3. Instruction\u2014should intimate no opinion on the facts. It is essential not only that the rules of law shall be 'given to the jury with substantial accuracy, but also that the jury be left perfectly free to form and declare, from the evidence, their opinion upon the questions of fact. It is not admissible for the court to express any opinion to the jury on questions of fact, even though in conformity to the previously expressed opinion of this court, upon reviewing a question of fact.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-4\" pgmap=\"577\">4. Law and fact\u2014as to who are fellow-servants\u2014as a question of fact. In a suit against a railway corporation to recover for negligence resulting in the death of a section foreman having charge and oversight of repairs upon a certain part of the road track, it is error to instruct the jury that such foreman is not engaged in the same line of duty with an engineer' and fireman running with the defendant\u2019s locomotive engines, and therefore not within the rule which exempts the common employer from liability to one of its employees for damages resulting from the fault, etc., of a fellow-servant. Whether such persons were so operating and consoeiating is a question of fact for the jury, and not of law.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-5\" pgmap=\"577\">5. Evidence\u2014expert testimony\u2014opinions of witnesses. In an action to recover for an injury received from the falling or throwing of a piece of coal or slate from a passing locomotive upon a railroad, it is error to allow a witness to be asked and to testify what he considers a safe distance to retire from the track when the train is passing. Whether the line of danger from a passing train is at one distance rather than another, depends upon facts, and not opinions. This does not fall within the rule as to expert testimony, and the allowance of such opinions to be given is to usurp the functions of the jury.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-6\" pgmap=\"577\">6. Same\u2014as tending, or not tendirtg, to contradict other testimony. In a suit to recover for an injury of the plaintiff's intestate, received from a passing train while he was engaged in repairing the track, the defendant, a railway company, called as a witness one occupying the position of road master of a part of the road at the time of the injury, who testified that he had given the intestate instructions a number of times about getting out of the way of trains, etc. Plaintiff, in rebuttal, called several of the other men who worked with the deceased, and proved by them, severally, that the road master gave them no such instructions: Held, that the latter evidence was improper, as not tending to contradict the road master, he having testified only as to instructions given to the person who was injured.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\" pgmap=\"577\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

It was first before it at its September term, 1879, and a judgment was then rendered reversing that of the circuit court, and remanding the cause for a new trial. The second trial in the circuit court resulted, as the first, in a judgment for the plaintiff. That judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the Second District, and this record is brought here by appeal from that judgment. The action is case, under the statute, to recover damages because of the negligence Of appellant, resulting in the death of appellee\u2019s intestate.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\" pgmap=\"578\">The material facts are: John Moranda, (appellee\u2019s intestate,) while standing by the side of the track of appellant, some five or six feet from the rail, was struck by a heavy piece of coal or slate thrown or falling from the engine or tender of a rapidly passing passenger train of appellant. He was, at the time, foreman of a section gang of track repairers in the employ of appellant, whose duties were to keep in repair a section of appellant\u2019s track.

(Chicago and Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Moranda, 93 Ill. 302.) Although, as the law then was, we reviewed questions of fact as well as of law, this left no question of fact to be passed upon, and it was not intended to then express any opinion that might prejudice a future trial upon any question of fact involved in the case; but in answer to a point made by counsel for appellant, and to eliminate from previous decisions a rule of law for future guidance, we assumed, as a hypothesis sustained by the evidence in the record, that at the time of the alleged injury the intestate, as\u201esection foreman of a gang of track repairers, and the engineer and fireman on an engine drawing one of appellant\u2019s trains, were not directly cooperating with each other in their respective labors, and that their usual duties did not bring them into habitual consociation, so that they might exercise an influence upon each other promotive of proper caution. As a hypothesis presenting the question discussed, the particulars were as well assumed as if actually true,\u2014for the 'governing rule, -not the sufficiency of the proofs, was the thing to be determined. But it was not intended to be asserted, and obviously it could not be asserted, as a universal truth, for numerous cases may be readily conceived in which there would be either direct cooperation or habitual consociation between and with such servants in a single, continuous work or enterprise, and, as a particular truth, it would be a subject of inquiry upon each trial. The circuit court, upon the second trial, however, gave this instruction to the jury:</p> <blockquote id=\"b581-5\" pgmap=\"581\">\u201cThe jury are instructed that a man employed by a railroad company in the capacity of a section foreman, having Oharge and oversight of repairs upon a certain portion of its Q track, is not engaged in the same line of duty with an engineer and fireman running such company\u2019s locomotive engines, and is therefore not within the rule which exempts the common employer from liability to one of its employees for damages resulting from the fault, carelessness or negligence of a fellow-servant or co-employee.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b581-8\" pgmap=\"581(147) 582(22)\">Even if, when the case was here before, we had found, on the facts then before us, that the intestate and fireman and engineer were not so cooperating or eonsociating at the time of the injury as to exempt the common master from liability for injury received by the one in consequence of the negligence of the other, this instruction ought not to have been given. Whether they were so cooperating or eonsociating is a question of fact for the jury, and not of law for the court. (Wabash Ry. Co. v. Elliott, 98 Ill. 481; Pennsylvania Co. v. Conlan, 101 id. 93; Chicago and Alton R. R. Co. v. Bonifield, 104 id. 223; Indianapolis and St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Morgenstern, 106 id. 216.) In the last named case we said: \u201cThe definition of fellow-servants may be a question of law, but it is always a question of fact, to be determined from the evidence, whether the particular case falls within the definition. \u201d</p> <p id=\"Ajs\" pgmap=\"582\">In the former opinion in this case, ubi 'supra, we held that in order to constitute servants of the same master \u201cfellow-servants, \u201d within the rule respondeat superior, it is not enough they are engaged in doing parts of some work, or in the promotion of some enterprise carried on by the master, not requiring cooperation nor bringing the servants together or into such personal relations that they can exercise an influence upon each other promotive of proper caution in respect of their mutual safety, but it is essential that they shall be, at the time of the injury, directly cooperating with each other in the particular business in hand, or that, their usual duties shall bring them into habitual consociation, so that they may exercise an influence upon .each other promotive of proper caution. We feel constrained to adhere to this ruling, notwithstanding the very ingenious and able argument of counsel for appellant in favor of its modification.</p> <p id=\"b582-5\" pgmap=\"582(186) 583(18)\">But it is essential, not only that the rule shall be given to the jury with substantial accuracy, but also that the jurors shall thereupon be left free to form and declare, from the evidence before them, their opinion upon the question of fact. Because the evidence upon a former trial may have justified a particular conclusion of fact, it does not follow that the evidence on this trial justifies the same conclusion, and it is for the jury to determine, and not for the court to assume, what is the conclusion authorized by the evidence. Under our practice it is not admissible for the court to express any opinion to the jury on questions of fact, and it is no less so because the opinion, expressed' may be in conformity with a previously expressed opinion of this court upon reviewing a question of fact. Where there is evidence before a jury upon which it is legally admissible there may be difference of ' opinion, it is error to allow any opinion of judge or court to be obtruded upon the jurors to influence their determination. There was, here, such evidence, in our opinion, and the giving of the instruction was, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b583-6\" pgmap=\"583\">On the trial the appellee was permitted to ask of a witness, and the witness was permitted to answer, over appellant\u2019s objection, what the witness considered a safe distance to retire from the track when the trains are passing. This was error. The matter is not such as requires the opinion of an expert. We can not conceive that it can be better known to a man familiar with the operation of railroads than to one \u25a0who is not, that the safe distance is always beyond, and the unsafe distance is always within, the line of danger, and whether the line of danger is at one distance rather than another, depends upon facts, not upon opinions. If there is danger from passing cars, the questions naturally arise, what is its nature ?\u2014how far does it extend ? And the jury being enlightened in these respects, determine for themselves what is a \u201csafe distance.\u201d The witness is not to be allowed to usurp their functions. Hopkins v. Indianapolis and St. Louis R. R. Co. 78 Ill. 32; Pennsylvania Co. v. Conlan, supra.</p> <p id=\"b583-7\" pgmap=\"583\">A witness occupying the position of road master of a portion of appellant\u2019s road at the time the intestate was injured, being called on behalf of appellant, testified that he had given the intestate instructions a number of times about getting out of the way of trains, etc. Appellee, thereupon, in rebuttal, called the other men, or at least several of them, who worked under the intestate at that time, and was permitted by the court, over appellant\u2019s objection, to prove by them, severally, that the road master gave them no such instructions. This was improper. The road master had not testified that he gave these individuals such instructions, and because he did not do so, or because they did not hear him so instruct the intestate, it does not follow that his testimony is untrue.</p> <p id=\"b583-8\" pgmap=\"583\">For the errors indicated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b583-9\" pgmap=\"583\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
