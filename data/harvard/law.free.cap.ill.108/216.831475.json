Many other fraudulent acts and pretenses on the part of appellees are charged in the bill, which are not necessary to be stated, for if a bill of this kind can be maintained at all on the ground that the debtor has been guilty of fraud, and is seeking to defeat the collection of an honest debt by covering 'up his property or placing it beyond the reach-of his creditors Avith a fraudulent intent, enough is clearly shown to maintain this bill.</p> <p id=\"b218-7\" pgmap=\"218(115) 219(309)\">But it is clear, unless we are prepared to overrule a long line of decisions extending back almost to the time of the organization of this court, a bill of this character can not be maintained upon the ground suggested, and this, of course, we can not consistently do in face of the fact the rule adopted by this court is supported by the decided weight of authority. As Avas said in a recent case, this is no longer an open question in this court, and we should have contented ourselves Avith a simple reference to the previous cases on the subject, but for the fact that counsel have insisted Avith so much earnestness that this case comes within one of the exceptions to the general rule which most of the eases concede to exist. These so-called exceptions, when properly understood, are rather nominal than real, for a bill of this character will not lie in any ease where the claim, as it is here, is a purely legal demand. In all cases where such a bill has been maintained the claim of the complainant has had some equitable element \u25a0 in it,\u2014such as a trust, or the like. But in the absence of some element of this character there is a want of jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the claim at all, and it is upon this fundamental doctrine the rule controlling this class of cases rests. When, however, a judgment has been obtained, and an execution has been returned nulla bona, and it can be showm the defendant has equitable assets which can not be reached by execution, or that he, or others acting in concert with him, have fraudulently placed obstructions in the wray of collecting the claim by execution, a case will then be made out for the interposition of a court of equity. The jurisdiction of the court thus invoked is known as a part of the auxiliary jurisdiction of a court of equity; but as a condition precedent to its exercise, where the demand is purely legal, as it is here, the claim must be reduced to a judgment, and an execution thereon returned nulla bona. Such is the settled law of this State, and it is supported by the general current of authority. Bispham\u2019s Equity, 525-527; Miller et al. v. Davidson, 3 Gilm. 518; Greenway v. Thomas, 14 Ill. 271; Phelps v. Foster, 18 id. 309; Bigelow et al. v. Andress et al. 31 id. 322; Shufeldt v. Boehm, 96 id. 560.</p> <p id=\"b219-6\" pgmap=\"219(80) 220(34)\">In the present case the complainants are seeking to recover a simple contract debt for goods sold and delivered. There is no claim or pretense that the debt itself has any equitable element in it that is not found in any other just debt, or that will give a court of equity jurisdiction to adjudicate upon it. It is just like any oth\u00e9r strict legal claim. All the equitable features of the present case consist of the fraudulent acts of appellees in their efforts to defeat the collection of the claim of appellants. These are not sufficient, as is fully shown by the authorities already cited, to give a court of equity jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b220-4\" pgmap=\"220\">The decree in this case being in conformity with the views here expressed, the judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
