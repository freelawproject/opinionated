John M. Bullock, on the 30th of August, 1877, filed his bill in chancery in the office oi the clerk of the circuit court of Cook county, against Runyan and wife, and Christian Battenhousen, Martha Batteiihousen, and others, alleging therein, among other things, that said pretended release was a forgery, the non-payment of the amount due on the promissory note executed to him by Runyan, after deducting certain admitted payments, and that Battenhousen is a purchaser junior to and subordinate to his rights under the deed of trust, and praying that said pretended release of John R. Bullock be.set aside, etc.; that said deed of trust be foreclosed, and the premises therein described be sold, etc., for the payment of the amount due on the said promissory note, etc. Christian and Martha Battenhousen answered, denying the forgery of the release of John R. Bullock, alleging they were purchasers for full value, and in good faith believing, as Runyan then assured them, that the premises were free of all incumbrances; that they are Germans, unacquainted with the English language, and relied upon what the records disclosed and Runyan assured them,\u2014that the deed of trust to John R. Bullock, trustee, was released.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-10\" pgmap=\"31(22) 32(356) 33(165)\">Replication was filed, and the cause was heard at the March term, 1880, of the circuit court, on bill, answer, and proofs then introduced, and the court thereupon decreed that the pretended release of John R. Bullock be set aside, and that the premises be sold for the payment of the amount due to John M. Bullock on the said promissory note. The Battenhousens appealed from this decree to the Appellate Court for the First District, and that court, at its October term, 1880, reversed \u2022the judgment of the circuit court, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. After the cause was remanded Christian Battenhousen died, and at the October term, 1881, of the circuit court, the d\u00e9ath of Christian Battenhousen was suggested, and leave was given to Martha Battenhousen to file an amended and supplemental answer, which she then proceeded to do. In this answer Martha Battenhousen denied, specifically, all the material allegations of the bill, and charged that the trust deed is of no binding force, validity or effect as a lien upon \u2019the premises, and against the defendant, and that it does not secure -said indebtedness or said note, and that the same is not now, and never has been, a lien upon said premises for any purpose, against said defendant; that in July, 1874, Christian Battenhousen purchased of Bunyan the west half of the north-east quarter of section 33, and the east half of section 28, town 36 north, range 12 east, third principal meridian, for $20,000, and that Bunyan executed to him a warranty deed therefor, \u2022 in which he covenanted that the premises were free from incumbrance; that Battenhousen then paid Bunyan $4100 of the purchase money, and executed notes, and mortgage upon the premises, securing deferred payments in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight years, with eight per cent interest, payable annually, which mortgage was then recorded; that at the time of the purchase Bunyan represented to Battenhousen that the premises were clear of all incumbrances; that Battenhousen had no actual knowledge or notice of the trust deed, and that the record thereof was not constructive notice of the existence of the same for the purposes claimed in the bill, or for any' purpose, and that said trust deed is insufficient to create a lien upon said premises, as against defendant; that Battenhousen, after said release was filed for record, relying thereon, paid off a large amount of said indebtedness; that $20,000 was an adequate price for said premises; that Runyan disposed of said notes, before due, to parties who now hold them; that on the 5th of April, 1881, Battenhousen conveyed the premises t'o defendant. To this there was also replication filed, and the cause was again heard at the March term, 1882, of the circuit court, when a decree was again rendered setting aside the release as a forgery, and foreclosing, etc., the trust deed. An appeal was also prosecuted from this decree to the Appellate Court for the First District, and that court, at its October term, 1882, reversed the decree of the circuit court, and refused to remand the cause, and this appeal is prosecuted to reverse that judgment.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-6\" pgmap=\"33\">Messrs.

On the contrary, we urge that all the description required to be made of the debt in a mortgage is a general one, which will put those interested upon inquiry. 1 Jones on Mortgages, (2d ed.) secs. 343, 70; Youngs v.

If a mortgage is given to secure an ascertained debt, the amount of such debt should be stated. By omitting to so state the debt the widest door is opened for fraud of every description, and to prevent the same the law declares such a mortgage fraudulent and void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers. Metropolitan Bank v. Godfrey, 23 Ill. 603; North v. Belden, 13 Conn. 376; Hart v. Chalker, 14 id. 77; Pearce v. Hall, 12 Ky. 209.</p> <opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b35-9\" pgmap=\"35\">Mr. Justice Scholeield</author> <p id=\"AA\" pgmap=\"35\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b35-10\" pgmap=\"35(31) 36(50)\">We perceive no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment of the Appellate Court. We concur with that court in holding that under our registry laws the record of this trust deed does not charge subsequent bona fide purchasers without actual notice\u00b0with knowledge of the amount of the indebtedness of the promissory note set out in the bill. .We concur, also, in the main, with the reasoning expressed by that court in its opinion, as reported in 11 Bradwell, 665.</p> <p id=\"b36-6\" pgmap=\"36\">It is true, as contended by counsel for appellant, that in Metropolitan Bank v. Godfrey, 23 Ill. 603, therein referred to, the question before the court was not as to the sufficiency of a particular description of indebtedness, as it is here, but as to the effect of an absolute deed referring to no indebtedness; but what was there said may be regarded as a reason equally cogent here. The language there was: \u201cThe spirit of our recording system requires that the record of a mortgage should disclose, with as much certainty as the nature of the ease will admit, the real state of the incumbrance. If a mortgage is given to secure an ascertained debt, the amount of that debt should be stated, and if it is intended to secure a 'debt not ascertained, such data should be given respecting it as will put any one interested in the inquiry upon the track leading to a discovery. If it is given to secure an existing or a future liability, the foundation of such liability should be set forth. North v. Belden, 13 Conn. 376; Hart v. Chalker et al. 14 id. 77.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b36-8\" pgmap=\"36\">This is peculiarly pertinent to the facts of the present case, and one of the authorities quoted in support of the language is literally analogous. In Hart v. Chalker, the condition in the mortgage, which was condemned because of the insufficiency of the description of the debt, ran thus: \u201cThe condition of this deed is, that whereas, said William Chalker has this day executed his note of hand to said Hart, dated 10th of May, 1834, on demand, with interest, if said Chalker shall truly and faithfully pay to said Hart the amount of said note, agreeable to the tenor thereof, then this deed to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b37-5\" pgmap=\"37\">The policy, though not the letter, of our statutes requires, in all cases, a statement upon the record of the amount secured. Thus, in section 11, chapter 30, Rev. Stat. 1874, page 274, the form of mortgage there given requires the mortgage to \u201crecite the nature and amount of indebtedness.\u201d And in section 14, chapter 95, Rev. Stat. 1874, page 713, notices of sales of real estate pursuant to powers are required to state \u201cthe amount of indebtedness the instrument was given to secure,\u201d and \u201cthe amount claimed to be due.\u201d A statement upon the record of the amount claimed to be due informs all what lien is claimed. They know what they must contest, or subject to what they must take, in subsequently dealing with the property. It prevents secret conspiracies between mortgagors and mortgagees as to the fact and amount of indebtedness to the prejudice of subsequent purchasers and creditors, by compelling them to at once make known the real claim. In some instances, subsequent dealers with mortgaged property could not have information from the holders of indebtedness secured by mortgage, because they could not be found,\u2014as in the case of negotiable securities running for a long time, and negotiated many times before maturity; and it might often be, as in the instance before us, perilous to rely on the word of the mortgagor. Undoubtedly, as between mortgagor and mortgagee, and as to persons having actual notice of the facts, both at common law and under our statute, a deed absolute on its face may be held to be a mortgage; but such eases are totally unaffected by our registry laws, and can not therefore have the slightest analogy to the present case.</p> <p id=\"b37-6\" pgmap=\"37(65) 38(105)\">It may also be well to observe that the present case is in nowise analogous to cases wherein the debt is described by reference to another instrument. In those cases there is only the labor of going to the other instrument, where full and reliable information can be attained. It is fixed, and beyond evasion or perversion. But that is not the ease where the reference is to an individual whose interest may be to misrepresent the truth, or who may not, with reasonable efforts, be found. A note for one amount as well as for another will answer the description here, and this note might have been lawfully negotiated and transferred many times before maturity, and its holder then not have been traceable except at a labor and expense beyond any benefit to be derived from the knowledge he could impart. To hold this sufficient would, in cases that may readily and not unreasonably be conceived, practically prohibit subsequent parties from having anything to do with the property.</p> <p id=\"b38-6\" pgmap=\"38\">Babcock v. Lisk, 57 Ill. 327, and Farrar v. Payne, 73 id. 82, cited and relied upon by counsel for appellant, are clearly distinguishable in principle from the present ease. In the first named case it was simply a question of construction whether $500, named as the consideration 'for executing the mortgage, was [a part of the sum secured by the mortgage, and it was held that it was,\u2014that by, proper construction of the language employed the mortgage was expressly to secure the payment of this sum, and also the sum of $70, evidenced by a promissory note. In the other case, the amount of the note ($651) was given, and the only objection was that it was not stated when it would become due, as to which, quite obviously, considerations different from those applicable to a failure to state the amount of indebtedness would be applicable.</p> <p id=\"b38-7\" pgmap=\"38(89) 39(50)\">The burden was upon appellant to prove actual notice of the amount of his claim, if that was relied upon, at the time Battenhousen purchased. Without discussing the question attempted to be raised in argument by counsel for appellant, whether the evidence of Martha Battenhousen was admissible, we are clear no actual notice was proved, and that Battenhousen is shown to have been a purchaser in good faith, for value. And we are also of opinion that the record does not disclose sufficient evidence of subsequent actual knowledge at a time when he could have legally avoided making any of the back payments. There is evidence that there was not actual notice of appellant\u2019s claim until the service of summons in this case, and the proof shows the notes for the deferred payments were assigned before maturity.</p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
