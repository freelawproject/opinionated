The writ of attachment was, on the 21st day of April, 1881, levied npon the barge \u201cG-. W. Duncan, \u201d lying at Quincy, in said county, as the property of the defendant. Samuel C. Clubb, under the provision of section 29 of our Attachment act, \u201cthat any person other than the defendant claiming the property attached may interplead, \u201d etc., interpleaded in the case, claiming the property so attached, under an appointment as receiver of the property and effects of said packet company, by the circuit court of St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, in a certain cause in said court wherein said packet company was defendant. There was judgment in favor of the interpleader, Clubb, which, on appeal, was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the Third District, and the railway company appealed to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\" pgmap=\"318(64) 319(103)\">The plaintiff in .the attachment suit had first filed a replication to the pleas of the interpleader, traversing the same, but afterward, on its motion granted by the court, it withdrew the replication, as having been filed by mistake, and then moved the court to file its plea in abatement, which had been intended to be filed instead of the replication, denying the right to interplead as receiver under the appointment of a foreign court, which motion the court overruled, whereupon said plaintiff company filed the plea in abatement, which plea the court, on motion of said Clubb, ordered to be stricken from the files. The plaintiff company then refiled its said replication, upon which issue was joined and the trial had. The interpleader\u2019s first plea alleges the barge was his own property at the time of the attachment of it; the second, that it was his property as receiver; the third, that at such time it was in his possession as receiver.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319(270) 320(68)\">The facts of the case shown by the evidence are, that at the October term, 1880, of the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, Samuql C. Clubb was duly appointed receiver of the Keokuk Northern Line Packet Company, an insolvent corporation of that State, with power and authority to take possession of all the business and property of the corporation, and to manage the affairs thereof, under the orders of the court, the receiver giving bond in the sum of $200,000 for the faithful discharge of his duties. At the time of such appointment the barge \u201cG-. W. Duncan,\u201d in question, was lying at the landing at St. Louis, within the State of Missouri, and within the jurisdiction of said court. The receiver immediately took possession of the barge, and afterward, on the 6th day of November, 1880, he chartered the barge to the steamer \u201cE. W. Cole,\u201d for a trip up the Mississippi river and return. The barge was taken, under the charter, up the river as far as Quincy, Illinois, where it was detained by the ice, and remained until, the levy of the-writ of attachment in this case upon it on the 21st day of April, 1881. At the request of the captain of the steamer \u201cE. W. Cole, \u201d the receiver released him from the charter, and took possession of the barge at Quincy, and ever since, until the levy of the attachment, retained such possession, having a watchman over and guarding the barge against danger. The receiver made an effort to have the barge removed to St. Louis as soon as the river was clear of ice, having made a contract with a steamboat line for the purpose, but did not succeed in having the removal made before the attachment. The court which appointed the receiver, at its April term, 1881, made an order authorizing the receiver to intervene in the attachment suit, and take the necessary steps to secure possession of the barge.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-4\" pgmap=\"320\">Mr. Geobge W.

But the facts that the property at the time of the appointment of the receiver was within the jurisdiction of the court making the appointment, and was there taken into the actual possession of the receiver, and continued in his possession until it was attached, take the case, as we conceive, out of the range of the foregoing principles. We are of opinion that by the receiver\u2019s taking possession of the barge in question within the jurisdiction of the court that appointed him, he became vested with a special property in the barge, like that which a sheriff acquires by the seizure of goods in execution, and that he was entitled to protect this special property while it continued, by action, in like manner as if he had been the absolute owner. Having taken the property in his possession, he was responsible for it to the court that appointed him, and had given a bond in a large sum to cover his responsibility as receiver, and to meet such liability he might maintain any appropriate proceeding to regain possession of the barge which had been taken from him. (Boyle v. Townes, 9 Leigh, 158; Singerly v. Fox, 75 Pa. 114.) It is well settled that \u2022 a sheriff does, by the seizure of goods in execution, acquire a special property in them, and that he may maintain trespass, trover or replevin for them.</p> <p id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323(77) 324(228)\">It is claimed that there was here an abandonment of the barge by leasing it and suffering it to be taken out of the State,\u2014that the purpose in so doing was an unlawful one, and a gross violation of official duty. We do not so view it. The receiver was, by his appointment, authorized to manage the affairs of the corporation under the orders of the court. The business of the corporation was running boats on the Mississippi river, and chartering the barge for a trip up that river was but continuing the employ of the barge in the business of the corporation, and therefrom making an increase of the assets to\u2019 be distributed among the creditors. Brownell v. Manchester, 1 Pick. 233, decides that a sheriff in- the State of Massachusetts, who had attached property in that State, did not lose his special property by removing the attached property into the State of Rhode Island for a lawful purpose. Dick v. Bailey et al. 2 La. Ann. 9 J\u00e9, holds otherwise in respect to property attached in Mississippi, and sent by the sheriff into Louisiana for an illegal purpose. It is laid down in Drake on Attachment, (5th ed.) sec. 292, that the mere fact of removal by an officer of attached property beyond his bailiwick into a foreign jurisdiction, without regard to the circumstances attending it, will not dissolve the attachment; that if the purpose was lawful, and the possession continued, the attachment would not be dissolved; but if the purpose was unlawful, though the officer\u2019s possession remained, or if lawful and he lost his possession, his special property in the goods would be divested,\u2014citing the two eases above named. We do not consider that there was any unlawful purpose here in the chartering and employing of the barge, as was done.</p> <p id=\"b324-4\" pgmap=\"324(140) 325(40)\">It is insisted the possession of the barge was lost. There was certainly evidence tending to show, possession by the receiver up to the time of the attachment, and in support of the judgment of the Appellate Court we must presume that it found the existence of all the facts necessary to sustain the judgment, where there was evidence tending to show their existence, and that court\u2019s finding of fact is conclusive upon us. By taking the barge into his possession within the jurisdiction of the court that appointed him, a special property in the barge became vested in the receiver, and it is the established rule that wh\u00e9re a legal title to personal property has once passed and become vested in accordance with the law of the State where it is situated, the validity of such title will be recognized everywhere. Caniwell v. Sewell, 5 Hurl. &amp; N. 728; Clark v. Connecticut Peat Co. 35 Conn. 303; Taylor v. Boardman, 25 Vt. 581; Crapo v. Kelly, 16 Wall. 610; Waters v. Barton, 1 Cold. (Tenn.) 450.</p> <p id=\"b325-5\" pgmap=\"325\">Under this rule we hold that where a receiver has once obtained rightful possession of personal property situated within the jurisdiction of his appointment, which he was appointed to take charge of, he will not be deprived of its possession, though he take it, in the performance of his duty, into a foreign jurisdiction; that while there it can not be taken from his possession by creditors of the insolvent debtor who reside within that jurisdiction. Where a receiver of an insolvent manufacturing corporation, appointed by a court in New Jersey, took possession of its assets, and for the purpose of completing a bridge which it had contracted to build in Connecticut, purchased iron with the funds of the estate and sent it to that State, it was decided that the iron was not open to attachment in Connecticut by a creditor residing there. (Pond v. Cooke, 45 Conn. 126.) And where C. was appointed, by a court in Arkansas, receiver of property of T., a defendant in a suit, and ordered to ship it to Memphis for sale, and to hold the proceeds subject to the order of the court, and did so ship it to Memphis, where it was attached by creditors of T., it was held that C. could maintain an action of replevin for the property in. Tennessee. (Cagill v. Wooldridge, 8 Baxter, 580.) Kilmer v. Hobart, 58 How. Pr. 452, decides that receivers appointed in another State, and operating a railway as such, but having property in their hands as receivers in New York, can not there be sued,\u2014that an attachment issued in such suit will be vacated.</p> <p id=\"b325-6\" pgmap=\"325(60) 326(79)\">This is not the ease of the officer of a foreign court seeking, as against the claims of creditors resident here, to remove from this State assets of the debtor situate here at the time of the officer\u2019s appointment, and ever since, and of which he had had no previous possession. It is to such a case as that, as we understand, that the authorities cited by appellant\u2019s counsel apply, and not to a case like the present, where the property was, at the time of the appointment of the foreign receiver, within the jurisdiction of the appointing court, and there taken into the receiver\u2019s possession, and subsequently suffered by him to be brought into this State in the performance of his duty, and his possession here wrongfully invaded, and he seeking but redress for such invasion.</p> <p id=\"b326-6\" pgmap=\"326\">The judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b326-7\" pgmap=\"326\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
