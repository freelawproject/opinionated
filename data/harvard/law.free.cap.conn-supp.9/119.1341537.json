Such confusion and inconsistency as appears in his testimony I attribute to slowness of mind and limited capacity for self-expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">I find the issues for the defendant on the complaint and on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The plaintiff has pleaded a statute of limitation to the counterclaim. In an original process the statute is stayed, not when the complaint is returned to the clerk\u2019s office, but when the proceeding is commenced, by legal service upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In this case the purpose and only justification of a statute of limitation was accomplished when the defendant\u2019s motion to amend was filed, accompanied by the proposed counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Judgment is rendered for the defendant on the complaint; and on the counterclaim to recover of the plaintiff $484.21 damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
