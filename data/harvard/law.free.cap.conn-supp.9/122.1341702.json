It is clear that this latter statute creates no ground for divorce, and adds nothing to section 5174.</p>\n<p id=\"AFIV\">An assault with intent to commit rape is an attempt to commit an offense or act in violation of \u201cconjugal duty.\u201d That being so, the offense does not come under the specified ground for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">The petition for divorce is, therefore, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
