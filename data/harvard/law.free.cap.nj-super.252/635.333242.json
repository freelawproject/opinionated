The orders were entered on December 20, 1990 and January 31,1991. In response to defendant\u2019s successful <em>in limine </em>motion, the initial trial judge ruled in the December 20, 1990 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">This court rules <em>in limine </em>that a premarital period of cohabitation does not extend coverture for equitable distribution purposes, and, any increase in the value of defendant\u2019s stock in Russ Berrie &amp; Company, Inc. during any premarital period of cohabitation is not subject to equitable distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">This court rules <em>in limine </em>that defendant\u2019s stock in Russ Berrie &amp; Company, Inc. is a passive premarital asset and is not subject to equitable distribution. This court further rules that any increase in value of that stock from the date of the marriage until the date of filing of the complaint is not subject to equitable distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">No evaluation of Russ Berrie &amp; Company, Inc. is necessary to this litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The order continued, stating that plaintiff was denied funds to retain an expert to value the corporate stock, and that no court appointed expert would be designated to value the stock.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The judge explained his reasoning in a nine page letter opinion dated October 3, 1990, which he incorporated by reference into the December order. In this opinion the judge traced the origin and growth of defendant\u2019s business. Defendant founded the business in 1963, twenty years prior to the parties\u2019 marriage. It was initially a one-man operation producing \u201cimpulse gift products\u201d (stuffed animals and other small items marketed through card shops). After incorporation in 1966, the business grew and defendant developed his own product line, expanding in personnel and producing more income. By the time the parties met in 1979, while both were married to other individuals, the company, in the trial judge\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACWU\">was a multinational, multimillion dollar corporation. It had decentralized into separate autonomous departments which were located in several areas within this country and also in other areas of the world including the Far East. The various departments included sales, distribution, product development, administration and finance. The company\u2019s basic product line had been fully established and the company had over 1,000 employees and over 100 managers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The parties met by chance on a flight from Hong Kong to Seoul. Plaintiff is Korean by birth, but at that time she was a United States citizen who was separated from her first husband. After sporadic contacts during the initial months of their relationship, defendant requested that plaintiff leave her home and family in Korea and come to United States with him. Plaintiff alleges that there had been premarital promises made to her by defendant. In the words of the amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A16\">defendant promised and declared to plaintiff that he would take care of her and support her for the rest of her life, that he would provide for her future financial security and that she would share in all the assets and property that was accumulated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>At the end of 1979 defendant purchased what was to be the marital home in Englewood. Some time between early 1980 and mid-1981 they lived together in the home. According to plaintiff, defendant insisted that plaintiff seek no financial settlement from her former husband and defendant retained the attorney and supervised the securing of her initial divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Plaintiff was divorced from her former husband on December 3, 1981; defendant was divorced from his former wife on December 10, 1983. The parties were married on December 29, 1983. At that time they already had a daughter who was nearly two years old. Their premarital relationship can be expressed by quoting defendant\u2019s own words, taken from a certification dated April 7, 1983 filed in connection with his divorce from his former wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">The defendant [Kathy Berrie, Russell Berrie\u2019s former wife] refers to my single \u2018girlfriend\u2019. The fact of the matter is that this girlfriend is the woman whom I love, who is the mother of my child, whom I respect and to whom I am married morally and spiritually, and with whom I shall be married legally as soon as the litigation [defendant\u2019s divorce from Kathy Berrie] is terminated. We have lived together for the past three years, and she not only has been emotionally supportive of me, but has helped me in my work. Her assistance in my business has been tremendous, since we import a great deal of our merchandise from Korea, and her understanding of Korean commercial customs, as well as her fluency in that language, have been tremendous assets to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">[M]y present relationship is a significant one, ... in which we are the parents of a lovely child and which brings to us all the joys of honorable married life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">I am, in every sense of the word, happily married to another woman and joyfully engaged in a truly honorable married life____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">[M]y relationship with the woman I love is one which does not depend on material things for joy. We work together, shoulder to shoulder, both in the home and in our business, with a deep and abiding concern in the values of our marriage____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">After March 1980 plaintiff began working for the company as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Korean liaison officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time one-half of the company\u2019s products were manufactured in Korea; by 1989, 94% of the products were manufactured there or elsewhere in Asia.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In a 1981 deposition, defendant described the company\u2019s value in December 1980. Defendant stated: \u201cI would have said to you if somebody came along and would give me $1,000,000, I\u2019d take it and run.\u201d Ten months later, defendant stated that the company was still \u201ctrying to do well,\u201d but that the business could \u201cfall by the wayside\u201d if defendant did not continue his intensive involvement. In fact, he did not know whether he was going to \u201cmeet next months\u2019 bills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">However, the situation improved, and after the birth of the parties\u2019 daughter in March 1982, defendant changed his previously-expressed opposition to taking the company public. According to plaintiff, defendant changed his mind in order to provide their daughter with security. The ground work was performed, and the company elected to go public in the spring of 1984, three months after the parties\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">One problem in this case, discussed in more detail later, is the value of approximately 8,000,000 shares (53.1%) of the corporation\u2019s stock retained by defendant. This stock was not registered in the public offering and is a control block. Between 1984 and 1989 defendant\u2019s ownership of the corporation was reduced from 86% to 53.1%. At the time defendant filed a Preliminary Disclosure Statement on August 29, 1983 in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>prior divorce, he certified that the value of his company was $9,489,143.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The stock actually was first offered to the public on March 29, 1984, at a market price of $14 per share. As noted by the trial judge, the publicly held stock has fluctuated from $13.88 a share to $47.75 a share. When the complaint was filed, the market price of the stock was $18.12 a share, and in December 1989 it was $14.50 a share. At the time of the trial judge\u2019s letter opinion, defendant held the position of Chief Executive Officer of the company which employed 2,300 workers, 800 salespersons and 200 managers, with five subsidiaries, 12 distribution centers and a worldwide market.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The trial judge very properly noted that substantial assets of the parties are available for equitable distribution, such as their jointly-owned marital home valued at $17,000,000 and a condominium in Florida valued at $1,200,000. Also, plaintiff owned $760,000 worth of securities in her own name as well as $500,000 in jewelry and $100,000 in furs. In addition, certifications, including those of her own sister, averred that plaintiff maintained a sizeable cash reserve in at least one safety deposit box. The children are well protected with three <em>inter vivos </em>trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Since we are here reviewing the results of an <em>in limine </em>order made prior to discovery and based upon conflicting allegations of fact, we must assume that the facts presented by plaintiff are accurate or would have been developed by the discovery she has sought. <em>In limine </em>motions have their place where issues can be eliminated as a matter of law prior to trial. <em>See Evid.R. </em>8(1). Where, however, the decision on the <em>in limine </em>motion itself requires an analysis of evidence yet to be presented or credibility determinations, such motions should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ordinarily be denied until a sufficient predicate is established. <em>Bellardini v. Krikorian, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 464, 537 A.2d 700 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Polito, </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 558, 370 A.2d 478 (App.Div.1977). Our analysis here therefore is not too different from a review of a motion for partial summary judgment, <em>see R. </em>4:46-2, but with the claim limited to a matter encompassed in an order rather than a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Defendant sought to have the trial and discovery shortened by eliminating all references to the value of his business, which he considered a premarital asset not subject to equitable distribution. If he were correct, an <em>in limine </em>motion would be the correct procedural vehicle to shorten the trial. In this case, however, there are sufficient unique circumstances and disputed facts that made the granting of this motion inappropriate, or at least premature. This is not a case involving, for example, a party entering into a marriage with a portfolio of marketable securities managed by a brokerage house, and where there is a divorce many years later after the securities had increased tenfold. By statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 (last paragraph), and under case law, <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>196, 214, 320 A.2d 484 (1974), such assets would be exempt. In such a case, extensive discovery concerning the value of the assets, portfolio changes and the like could be obviated by an <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude the assets and to limit discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In this case, however, although the corporation is public, defendant holds approximately 8,000,000 unregistered shares. Defendant has publicly and repeatedly stated that he controls the company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We need not recount the numerous references <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>in public announcements and corporate materials stating that defendant is the force behind the corporation, notwithstanding the abundance of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">New Jersey case law has not differentiated between the corporate and non-corporate form in determining whether a business is subject to equitable distribution. <em>See Scherzer v. Scherzer, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 400, 346 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1975), <em>certif. denied, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>391, 354 A.2d 319 (1976). Yet defendant contends that the fact that the company is a public corporation precludes consideration of whether the unregistered corporate stock held by defendant is other than a passive asset subject only to the vagaries of the stock market. We cannot accept this proposition, especially when based upon such a meager record, devoid of any proof of how a control block of unregistered stock is treated by the financial community.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Defendant further suggests that in no case can one person\u2019s effort be determinative of the value of a public corporation. We reject this thesis. There is no question that a single person\u2019s effort can influence the growth and success of a sole proprietorship, joint venture, partnership or a close corporation. As the organization grows, however, the question becomes more one of fact, depending upon how closely the individual is identified with the business entity. The issue becomes intertwined with the valuation of the entity\u2019s good will, which is itself equitably distributable in an appropriate case. <em>Bowen v. Bowen, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>36, 47, 473 A.2d 73 (1984); <em>Dugan v. Dugan, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>423, 434, 457 A.2d 1 (1983); <em>Stern v. Stern, </em>66 <em>N.J </em>340, 346-347, 331 A.2d 257 (1975). For example, although a junior partner or shareholder in a law firm may share in the firm\u2019s good will, his or her presence or absence in the firm would not materially change the overall value of the good will. Yet, the good will of a law firm operated as a sole proprietorship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>several associates may be completely dependent upon the firm\u2019s principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This is true for a commercial corporation as well; and the fact that such a corporation is publicly held should not change this analysis. The efforts expended by the principal or even his or her mere presence may cause a willing buyer to pay more for the stock. While expert testimony most probably would be necessary to determine the effect of the individual upon the value of the stock, the fact that market forces might combine with such effect to control the price of the stock does not eliminate the factors relating to the individual. Each can be analyzed separately, one as a passive factor, the other as an active factor. As such corporations mature, the influence of the individual may decrease so that the corporation could survive even his passing without a devastating financial effect. Yet until that point is reached, expert analysis is admissible to show the effect the individual may have upon the value of a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The trial court on remand must first determine whether the stock held by defendant is unlike the managed portfolio described earlier, and is in fact, an active asset, the increased value of which would have been subject to distribution from and after the date of the parties\u2019 marriage. If this is so, the central issue in this case will be whether all or any part of the premarital cohabitation period can be considered in determining the base from which any such increase will be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Plaintiff initially sought equitable distribution measured from the date of the commencement of cohabitation. However, in the order of January 31, 1991, also appealed from here, a second judge determined that the complaint should not be amended to add other equitable and contractual causes of action, specifically, a resulting trust; a constructive trust; quantum meruit recovery; unjust enrichment and quasi-contractual recovery; \u201ctransmutation;\u201d implied contract; and express contract. The second judge determined that as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of law \u201cany alleged equitable or contractual rights and obligations the parties may have had arising from their relationship prior to their marriage ended with their marriage contract unless specifically reserved or agreed upon by the parties.\u201d He also viewed the opinion of the judge who determined the <em>in limine </em>motion as effectively removing the corporate stock from consideration and effectively precluding any inclusion of the stock under any new legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Initially, we note this is a case of first impression insofar as the premarital asset sought to be distributed is other than the marital home. <em>See Weiss v. Weiss, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>281, 284-289, 543 A.2d 1062 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>287, 554 A.2d 844 (1988), and the cases there cited. In <em>Weiss, </em>Judge Skillman reviewed the cases acknowledging that a premarital asset such as the marital home might trigger a right of equitable distribution prior to the marriage ceremony. The court started its analysis with <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>196, 320 A.2d 484 (1974), and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 as it focused upon the period between the date of the marriage and the date the divorce complaint is filed. 226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286-287, 543 A.2d 1062. Judge Skillman further noted, however, that the <em>dictum </em>in <em>Painter </em>(that the words \u201cduring the marriage\u201d commenced the period \u201cas soon as the marriage ceremony has taken place,\u201d 65 <em>N.J. </em>at 217, 320 A.2d 484) is tempered by a cautionary footnote. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201cHowever, the Court in <em>Painter </em>further indicated that its comments should not be understood to \u2018provide certain and ready answers to all questions which may arise as to whether particular property is eligible for distribution\u2019 and that \u2018[\u00a1Individual problems must be solved as they arise, within the context of particular cases.\u2019 65 <em>N.J. </em>at 218, n. 7 [320 A.2d 484]. Furthermore, the cases decided since <em>Painter </em>have recognized that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 should be construed, to the extent feasible, to effectuate the public policy underlying the equitable distribution law, which is to recognize that marriage is \u2018a shared enterprise, a joint undertaking, that in many ways ... is akin to a partnership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, supra </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>[350] at 361 [371 A.2d 1] [1977], quoting <em>Rothman v. Rothman, supra </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>[219] at 229 [320 A.2d 496] [1974].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\"><em>Weiss, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 287, 543 A.2d 1062. This court concluded in <em>Weiss </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>a date prior to the marriage ceremony can, in appropriate circumstances, qualify as the date of commencement of the marriage for the purpose of deciding whether property is a marital asset subject to equitable distribution. Just as the <em>Painter </em>line of cases has recognized that the marital partnership may terminate prior to the entry of a judgment of divorce, we believe that for the purpose of triggering a right of equitable distribution a marital partnership may be found to have commenced prior to the marriage ceremony, where the parties have adequately expressed that intention and have acquired assets in specific contemplation of their marriage. This conclusion recognizes that the \u2018shared enterprise\u2019 of marriage may begin even before the actual marriage ceremony through the purchase of a major marital asset such as a house and substantial improvements to that asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 287, 543 <em>A.2d </em>1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">While defendant seeks to confine <em>Weiss </em>and the earlier trial court and out-of-state decisions cited in <em>Weiss, id. </em>at 288, 543 <em>A.</em>2d 1062, to an early purchase of a marital home, we see no such limitation in <em>Weiss, </em>nor would we express the same here. Yet, we do not lose sight of the two requirements expressed in <em>Weiss </em>for there to be such a premarital \u201cpartnership:\u201d First \u201cwhere the parties have adequately expressed that intention,\u201d and second, where the parties \u201chave acquired assets in specific contemplation of their marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 543 A.2d 1062. The \u201cintention\u201d described in <em>Weiss </em>is not an intention to marry, but rather to create \u201ca marital partnership ... prior to the marriage ceremony\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>with respect to the particular property, <em>i.e., </em>the equivalent of a business partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Furthermore, we see no reason on this record to reject as a matter of law the application of <em>Weiss </em>to the purchase of a new asset. If the parties by their combined efforts work as part of this \u201cpartnership\u201d to increase the value of an asset held by one of them, such increase in value under established principles also might be subject to treatment as a partnership interest, which in turn might be subject to equitable distribution. <em>Cf. Weiss, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 290, 543 A.2d 1062, and cases there cited. Plaintiff points to the certification of defendant himself, quoted earlier, as a definitive statement that the parties here had commenced such a marital \u201cpartnership\u201d prior to their marriage ceremony. These facts, however, were not examined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the trial judge since he rejected the legal basis for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">We must also consider the second element noted in <em>Weiss, </em>namely that the assets be \u201cacquired [or, as here, enhanced] in specific contemplation of [the] marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 543 A. 2d 1062. Several sub-issues need to be resolved. If plaintiff were merely employed by defendant, receiving a full salary for her efforts, it might be argued that the enhancement of the company was not a partnership enterprise in contemplation of the marriage, but was merely a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In <em>Coney v. Coney, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 503 A.2d 912 (Ch.Div. 1985), property had been purchased in the wife\u2019s name alone prior to the marriage, since the husband\u2019s divorce was not yet final. The husband physically helped build the house on the property and the couple, together with the wife\u2019s children by a prior marriage, lived in the house for several years after which the parties married. After another seven years of residence, she filed for divorce. Judge Gladden there differentiated between three types of property: nonmarital property brought to the marriage by one party, where only the enhanced value after the date of marriage can be considered; cohabitation property, where the parties never marry, but traditional equitable principles can be applied to effect a division; and premarital property where \u201cone or both marital parties acquired either personal or real property jointly<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and made contribution to the same before marriage.\u201d 207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73, 503 A.2d 912. Judge Gladden determined that the same equitable principles had permitted the enforcement of the \u201cpalimony\u201d contract in <em>Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>378, 384, 391, 403 A.2d 902 (1979), permitting an award to the husband for the premarital increase in value of the property, notwithstanding his lack of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>We cannot on this record determine whether plaintiff is entitled to participate in the increased value of the corporation for all, a portion, or none of the period of cohabitation prior to the marriage. She has presented her view of the case, but discovery, limited by the trial judges\u2019 rulings, has failed to yield a complete picture of the parties\u2019 relationship with respect to the corporation. Defendant\u2019s certification filed at the time of his initial divorce is eloquent in praise of plaintiff, and her role in his life. Other statements establish her worth to the corporation, both as to personal efforts and to her maintaining a family home to which defendant could repair after bouts of working 24 hours per day. If equitable distribution is to be granted for all or any parts of this period in some percentage, defendant must be permitted to state his case (which was unnecessary in view of the courts\u2019 rulings), and plaintiff to augment hers, all after adequate discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Even if some theory of equitable distribution is not viable, we see no reason why plaintiff should be precluded from presenting her various alternative theories of recovery. <em>R. </em>4:9-1 requires that an amendment to pleadings \u201cbe freely given in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Carr v. Carr, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>336, 350-353, 576 <em>A.2d </em>872 (1990), in a different setting, outlines the various theories in addition to equitable distribution which may be available to one spouse seeking distribution of the other\u2019s property. The amended complaint should now be filed so that discovery as it progresses can focus on the bases for such theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">While we have concluded that plaintiff\u2019s claim should not have been precluded as a matter of law on this limited record, we do not by our remand wish to suggest to the trial judge that either plaintiff\u2019s or defendant\u2019s positions need be accepted. Additionally, if plaintiff\u2019s claim to some form of distribution is accepted, we do not wish to suggest to the trial judge what percentage should be accorded her for the marital period or, if a premarital period is added, whether the same percentage should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>be adjudged for all or any portion of the period of cohabitation. In any final decision, the court must make specific findings, especially when faced with such a complex question of financial valuation. <em>See Orgler v. Orgler, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 358, 568 A.2d 67 (App.Div.1989). A decision which is made upon \u201cconflicting affidavits, without consideration of demeanor of witnesses, is contrary to fundamental principles of our legal practice.\" <em>Conforti v. Guliadis, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 565, 586 A.2d 318 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Defendant has suggested that plaintiff need not receive additional distribution, since she has been amply provided for out of other distributable assets. The defendant husband in <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>107, 415 A.2d 1174 (App.Div.1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 432 A.2d 80 (1981), a divorce case involving the great wealth of both parties raised similar arguments to those of Mr. Berrie. Judge Pressler, writing for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">The position taken by the husband is that under the circumstances here equitable distribution should have been limited to, if anything at all, the joint assets. He argues that in view of the amounts of the wife\u2019s separate estate, there is no rational basis justifying her sharing in his separate and larger fortune. It is his contention that she does not need any part of it and did not contribute in any way to its acquisition. In our view these arguments are antithetical to the philosophy of equitable distribution as conceived of by the Legislature in its enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 and as developed and articulated since that enactment by our Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 112, 415 A.2d 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Both parties are entitled to have all issues fully explored. The trial court erred in not allowing discovery and if factual issues remained, a plenary hearing on the distribution of the corporate stock. The decision should not have been based solely upon conflicting factual information and upon the limited information presented to the court through briefs and appendices.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">This matter is remanded to the Family Part for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The second order appealed from, discussed in more detail later, carried out this first order and denied any alternative theories of recovery which would implicate these assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Plaintiff contends that she guided defendant on how to operate in the Korean environment, including working with and obtaining protection from the Korean government. She states that she established liaisons with Korean suppliers and took advantage of her prominent family connections to develop Korean trade. She also travelled with defendant to trade shows seeking new suppliers and customers and participated in design discussions and other decision making within the company. Many extended corporate meetings were held at the parties' home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In opposition to plaintiffs <em>pendente lite </em>application defendant claimed that this value was as of February 1980 when he filed his complaint in his first divorce action. However, we note his sworn testimony on October 19, 1981 that the company was worth only $1,000,000, that its book value was approximately $2,000,000 and that its net annual profits averaged $350,845 between 1975 and 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The SEC filings noted that defendant could elect all of the directors, amend the certificate of incorporation and approve a merger and like corporate actions. Furthermore, defendant receives by far the highest salary in the corporation, comprised of a base salary plus a percentage of net income; he receives rental payments for real estate leased to the company by him personally or by other entities controlled by him and has obtained mortgage guarantees by the company on such leased facilities (three in California, one in Florida, one in Illinois and two in New Jersey); he has been the beneficiary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>corporate loans to him and other entities owned by him in an amount in excess of $3,000,000, approximately $1,400,000 of which is interest free; and he controls the decisions on declarations of dividends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">This sentence probably should have reversed the words \"jointly and,\u201d since one party could not acquire the property \"jointly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
