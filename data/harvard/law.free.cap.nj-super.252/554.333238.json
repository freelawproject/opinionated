A copy of the Convention is attached to the opinion as an appendix. It is also published at 51 Fed.Reg. 10498 (1986). The United States of America deposited its instrument of ratification of the Convention on April 29, 1988. That same year, Congress established procedures to implement the Convention in the United States. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11601 <em>et seq. </em>Appellant, Michelle Duquette (hereafter referred to as the mother) appeals from a December 10, 1990 order awarding custody of her child to her former husband, the respondent Fred Tahan (hereafter referred to as the father). She contends that the court erred when it failed to return the child to her, a resident of Canada, pursuant to the Convention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">It is necessary to present a detailed chronology of the events which led to the order on appeal. On July 1, 1987, the parties, pending a divorce, entered into a consent judgment for joint custody of their child with each party enjoying physical custody on a \u201cfourteen week alternating schedule.\u201d Pursuant to this consent order, the mother was to have physical custody from October 3, 1987 through January 9,1988 at which time the child was to be returned to the father to begin a fourteen week period of custody. This interim arrangement was to be effective until July 23, 1988. If at that time the parties had not come to a permanent agreement regarding the child\u2019s custody, then \u201cthe court shall be notified and a hearing will be held in August, 1988.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In January, 1988, the mother refused to return the child to the United States from her home in Canada. In February, 1988, the father filed an action in a court in the Province of Quebec for exemplification of the July 1, 1987 consent order. On June 24, 1988, a divorce judgment was entered in New Jersey terminating the parties\u2019 marriage and incorporating the July 1, 1987 consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In January, 1989, the action in Quebec was converted into a <em>de novo </em>custody hearing. It appears from a January 27, 1989 record of the Canadian court titled \u201cHearing Report\u201d that the father voluntarily converted the Canadian action for exemplification to a plenary custody action. The translation of the Canadian court record states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Agreement Decided Upon in Chamber:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">There is a withdrawal of the submission upon the request of exemplification. This procedure becomes a request for child custody with accompanying visitation rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">The request is adjourned until April 14, 1989 in Rowyn-Moranda or until any other prior date known or decided upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">During the adjournment, the child Kareem will stay with the father in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">The petitioner [father] promises to return the child to the defendant [mother] the day before the hearing date. Mr. Tahan will pick up the child at the domicile of the Mrs. on January 30, 1989 at 6:00 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">Request is made to the parties to conform to the above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">This record indicates that both parties were represented by counsel. After a trial in which the father participated with counsel, the Canadian court entered a judgment dated May 5, 1989 awarding custody to the mother. The judgment recited that originally the proceedings were for \u201cthe exemplification or enforcement of a judgment of the Superior Court granted in the State of New Jersey.\u201d It noted that the child will be six years old next July and that \u201cit will be in the child\u2019s interest to attend school on a yearly regular basis rather than three month periods. The parties were therefore invited and they accepted to consider the proceedings as a joint petition for custody.\u201d The court granted custody to the mother from September to June, with summer visitation for the father. The father filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>an appeal from this judgment with the appropriate Canadian appellate court. Thereafter, the father abandoned the appeal and his Canadian lawyers petitioned the Canadian appellate court for an order relieving them of their responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On August 9, 1989, while the child was visiting him in New Jersey, pursuant to the Canadian judgment, the father, proceeding by Order to Show Cause, commenced an action in New Jersey for permanent custody of the child. The father\u2019s application was determined in New Jersey on the papers, resulting in an order dated November 30, 1989, awarding sole custody to the father and prohibiting removal of the child from New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In March, 1990, the mother moved for an order directing return of the child to her pursuant to the Convention and implementing federal legislation. That application was argued on April 20, 1990. After extensive colloquy, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">THE COURT: I think the most I can [sic] for you at this time, Mr. Kubit, is tell you that if you want to contest the continuing jurisdiction of the Court you may do so, but on a hearing. I\u2019m not going to do it on the papers. I\u2019m going to require the lady to come down here. You can present any experts you want with regard to Canadian law and the Canadian proceedings. But I\u2019m not satisfied that if I were to, at this time, make a further order and say that the child should go back to Canada because of the Canadian court ruling, I\u2019m not satisfied Mr. Tahan is ever going to see the child again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">But I am going to indicate at this time that this Court does have continuing jurisdiction on the Tahan matter, that the order I made previously stands. I will afford the lady an opportunity to come down here and be heard on any aspect of the proceeding including the issue of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Based on this ruling, the court entered an order dated May 14, 1990:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">1. This court retains continuing jurisdiction of the custody issue with regard to Kareem Tahan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">2. The prior Order of this court dated November 30,1989 shall remain in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">3. This court will reconsider upon hearing and the testimony of the parties any issue raised by the defendant, including a jurisdictional argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Inexplicably, the motion judge\u2019s ruling did not address applicability of the Convention, though the mother expressly relied upon it as the basis for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On October 12,1990, the mother renewed her application for custody, relying on the Convention. On November 15,1990, in a lengthy oral opinion, the court determined that the mother\u2019s application was beyond the one-year limitation period contained in the Convention. The court measured the one-year period from June 24, 1989, which apparently is the date the child commenced summer visitation with his father. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">The child in this instance was present in New Jersey for more than one year prior to the Defendant\u2019s present application. Even if viewed as a continuation of the March 1990 application, Defendant should have filed through additional pleadings, as permitted by court order, not later than June 24, 1990. Alternatively, if Defendant\u2019s present application is a new application and not an extension of the March/April proceedings, Defendant\u2019s proper recourse was to appeal this Court\u2019s decision contained in the order dated May 14, 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Thus, this Court can conclude that consistent with the language of the Federal legislation, this Court is not bound to return Kareem to Canada and relinquish jurisdiction to the Canadian court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The mother\u2019s application under the Convention was first made within a few months of the father\u2019s August 1, 1989 application for custody. She renewed her application in March 1990, still within one year of the child\u2019s return to the United States, and well within one year of the father\u2019s August 9, 1989 expression of his intent to retain custody contrary to the Canadian judgment. The record establishes that the December 10, 1990 order resulted from a continuation of the application filed on March 23, 1990. This is so because on April 20, 1990 the motion judge stated that he did not want to decide the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>on the papers; he wanted a plenary hearing. The judge declared: \u201cI will afford the lady an opportunity to come down here and be heard on any aspect of the proceeding including the issue of jurisdiction.\u201d The May 14, 1990 order reflects the provisional character of the ruling. It did not specifically deny the mother\u2019s application; it ordered that the November 30,1989 order \u201cshall remain in full force and effect\u201d; it retained jurisdiction; and, it provided for reconsideration \u201cupon hearing and the testimony of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Convention was adopted \u201cto secure the prompt return of children wrongfully ... retained in any Contracting State,\u201d and \u201cto ensure that rights of custody ... under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting State.\u201d <em>Convention </em>art. la and b. Retention of a child is wrongful under the Convention \u201cwhere it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person ... under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the ... retention.\u201d <em>Convention </em>art. 3a. In the present case the father\u2019s retention of custody after expiration of his right of summer visitation violated the Canadian custody decree. The father\u2019s contention that the Canadian court lacked jurisdiction to award custody to the mother is without merit. The orders and judgments of the Canadian court recite the father\u2019s voluntary submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The record of the Canadian custody trial and other circumstantial evidence corroborate the father\u2019s voluntary submission of the custody issue to Canada\u2019s jurisdiction. The New Jersey trial judge so found in his November 15, 1990 opinion, and his finding on that issue is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The New York Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in <em>Sheikh v. Cahill, </em>145 Misc.2d 171, 546 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>517 (Sup.Ct. 1989), under facts remarkably similar to the present case. In <em>Sheikh, </em>the mother had taken the child to England in violation of a custody order of a New York court. The father, upon locating the mother and child, went to England where he commenced a wardship proceeding in the High Court of Justice Family Division. Eventually the English court awarded custody to the mother and granted the father visitation rights in the United States. During one of the child\u2019s visits, the father refused to return the child to the mother in London.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Plaintiff argued in New York that the Convention did not apply because the English court\u2019s decree, being contrary to the earlier New York custody decree, was a nullity. This argument was rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">The problem with this analysis is that plaintiff did not take this court\u2019s order to the High Court of Justice to petition for enforcement under the Hague Convention. Rather he commenced a wardship proceeding in the High Court of Justice. He thereby submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the foreign court so that it could make a <em>de novo </em>custody award in part based upon defendant\u2019s actions in New York. Not being satisfied with the results of that strategy, plaintiff cannot now come back to this court to ask it to ignore the custody/visitation decision and order of a court of a Hague convention consignatary nation which was subsequent to the decision and order of this court. Plaintiff\u2019s remedies lie in the appellate procedures of the courts of the United Kingdom not a collateral attack in the New York State courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 175, 546 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 520. The court concluded that the father wrongfully had retained his child after expiration of his visitation period and ordered the child\u2019s return to his mother as required by the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In the present case the child was \u201chabitually resident\u201d in Canada \u201cimmediately before the removal or retention.\u201d <em>Convention </em>art. 3a. The father\u2019s retention of the child in New Jersey violated the Canadian custody order and, therefore, was \u201cin breach of rights of custody attributed to a person [the mother] ... under the law of the State [Canada]\u201d of the child\u2019s habitual residence. <em>Ibid. Cf. Meredith v. Meredith, </em>759 <em>F.Supp. </em>1432 (D.Ariz.1991) (mother had mere physical possession of child in England and no legal rights of custody; Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>land not child\u2019s habitual residence, therefore, Hague Convention not applicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">If a child has been wrongfully retained and \u201ca period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful ... retention\u201d to the commencement of proceedings for the child\u2019s return, \u201cthe authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.\u201d <em>Convention </em>art. 12.

See generally Matter of Mohsen, </em>715 <em>F.Supp. </em>1063 (D.Wyo.1989). The implementation statute grants to state courts and United States district courts \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction of actions arising under the Convention.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11603(a). The statute requires that the court in which an action under the Convention is brought \u201cshall decide the case in accordance with the Convention,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>11603(d). Thus, if a petitioner establishes the prerequisites to invocation of the Convention, its application is mandatory and the child must be returned, subject only to the exceptions contained in Article 13. <em>Sheikh v. Cahill, supra. </em>The statute provides that a person opposing the return of a child \u201chas the burden of establishing\u2014(A) by clear and convincing evidence that one of the exceptions set forth in Article 13b ... of the Convention applies.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>11603(e)(2)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We conclude that the mother timely applied for return of the child under the Convention and that the Convention is applicable because Canada was the child\u2019s habitual residence and the father wrongfully retained the child after his 1989 summer visitation. The case must be remanded to the trial court to determine the applicability of the exceptions contained in Article 13b, particularly the second paragraph of that subarticle.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">The States signatory to the present Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Firmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Desiring to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">CHAPTER I\u2014SCOPE OF THE CONVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"AF_\">\n<em>Article 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The objects of the present Convention are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\"><em>a </em>to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State; and</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\"><em>b </em>to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">\n<em>Article 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Contracting States shall take all appropriate measures to secure within their territories the implementation of the objects of the Convention.
