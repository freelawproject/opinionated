DiMedio, the City Building Inspector, and Walter Richardson, the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Director of Public Works appeal, by leave granted, from an order granting class certification to the named plaintiffs under <em>R. </em>4:32. The named plaintiffs are property owners in the City whose dwellings were damaged or destroyed by fires originating in City-owned, abandoned dwellings. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeks damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for themselves and for \u201cdozens or hundreds of persons ... [who] have been damaged by defendants\u2019 negligence, unconstitutional or unreasonable conduct.\u201d In granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to maintain the class action, the trial judge found that plaintiffs had met the conditions under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(l)(A) and (B) and -1(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On appeal, defendants argue that the conditions under the class action rule were not satisfied because: (1) the purported \u201cclass\u201d is not sufficiently numerous for class certification; (2) its identity is too \u201cill-defined,\u201d and (3) separate issues of liability, causation and damages relating to the property damage of each proposed class member mandate separate trials. We reverse, concluding that plaintiffs have not met the requirements for class certification under <em>R. </em>4:32.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, six of the named plaintiffs owned dwellings on Royden Street which were damaged by a fire occurring on March 17, 1987. Plaintiffs Robledo own property on Garfield Avenue which was destroyed by a fire occurring on July 6, 1988. The gravamen of the complaint is that the City\u2019s failure to maintain or secure its abandoned buildings has permitted vandals to occupy them and set fires which spread to adjoining structures. They claim that the City-owned structures are \u201chazardous and attractive nuisances,\u201d and the City\u2019s failure to maintain the structures constitutes negligence and has caused or will cause an unlawful taking of the property of class members in violation of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In moving for class certification, the named plaintiffs sought to represent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>all homeowners in the City of Camden whose homes have been, or have the potential of being, damaged by fires starting in and spreading from abandoned derelict houses owned and controlled by defendant City of Camden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For purposes of plaintiffs\u2019 motion, defendants were deemed to have admitted that between January 1984 and May 1990, over 80 privately-owned structures in the City had been damaged or destroyed by fires originating in City-owned, abandoned buildings. In most cases the buildings had been acquired by the City through tax foreclosures. According to Camden Fire Department \u201crun reports,\u201d 61 fires during the pertinent time period had spread to and damaged private dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Plaintiffs argued that they had satisfied the prerequisites for a class action because questions of law and fact were common to all members of the class. Specifically, plaintiffs anticipated common questions of fact concerning: (1) the nature of defendants\u2019 efforts, or lack thereof, to secure abandoned properties; (2) the relationship between abandonment and arson; (3) defendants\u2019 knowledge of such relationship, and (4) reasonable standards in securing or demolishing abandoned properties. Plaintiffs argued that common legal questions were raised concerning: (1) defendants\u2019 liability under the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to -12.3; (2) deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 property rights without due process of law in violation of the <em>N.J. Const, of 1947 </em>art. I, para. 1; (3) a taking of plaintiffs\u2019 property without just compensation in violation of <em>N.J. Const, of 1947 </em>art. I, para. 20, and (4) the validity of defendants\u2019 attempts to require plaintiffs to demolish or secure their own property damaged by the fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the trial judge concluded that plaintiffs had satisfied the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation conditions under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a). He also determined that without class certification there was a possibility of inconsistent or varying adjudications and a risk that adjudications respecting individual class members may be dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the litigation. He also found that the questions common to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>members predominate over questions affecting only individual members. However, the judge established two \u201csubclasses\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">1. Class One, composed of individuals who own residential properties located within the City of Camden which have been damaged by fires originating in vacant, city-owned structures; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">2. Class Two, composed of individuals who own residential properties located within the City of Camden and who may potentially suffer damages as a result of fires originating in vacant, city-owned structures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In order to maintain a class action, the threshold requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation must be fulfilled under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a). <em>In re Cadillac V8-6-4 Class Action, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 424-25, 461 A.2d 736 (1983). We agree with the trial judge that plaintiffs satisfied these requirements. The class of 81 property owners seeking money damages is sufficiently large to meet the numerosity requirement. <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a)(l). There is a common theory of liability applicable to the entire class: defendants\u2019 failure to implement or administer a policy regulating abandoned City-owned dwellings caused plaintiffs\u2019 damages. <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a)(2). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Tort Claims Act and the New Jersey Constitution are \u201ctypical\u201d of the claims of all class members. <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a)(3). Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 claims have the essential characteristics common to the claim of the class, and thus plaintiffs will protect the interests of the class. <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a)(4). <em>See also In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 461 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Once the threshold requirements under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(a) have been met, plaintiffs must then satisfy one of three alternative requirements under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b). The judge here certified the class under -1(b)(1)(A); -1(b)(1)(B), and -1(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> Under subpart (A) of 4:32-l(b)(l), a cause of action may be maintained if the prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of \u201cinconsistent or varying adjudications ... which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>opposing the class[.]\u201d Subpart (A) is designed to protect the party <em>opposing </em>the class action, not the party seeking it. <em>See </em>3B Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 23.35[1] at 239 (2d ed. 1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, a defendant may have duties toward numerous persons constituting a class and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cbe so positioned that conflicting or varying adjudications in law suits with individual members of the class might establish incompatible standards to govern his conduct. The class action device can be used effectively to obviate the actual or virtual dilemma which <em>would thus confront the party opposing the class.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 240-41 (quoting Advisory Committee Note, \u00a7 23.01 at 19) (emphasis added). Moreover, in order for subpart (A) to apply, not only must the potential individual adjudications be inconsistent, they must also result in incompatible standards of conduct being imposed on the party opposing the class. <em>R. </em>4:32-1(b)(1)(A). Many courts have gone so far as to hold that subpart (A) should be used only where there is a \u201ctotal absence of individual issues.\u201d 3B Moore, \u00a7 23.35[1] at 245; <em>see also Gallano v. Running, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 249, 353 A.2d 158 (Law Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>600, 384 A.2d 830 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Here, subpart (A) is not applicable because it has not been asserted by defendants, the parties opposing the class action. Moreover, it can hardly be said that there is a \u201ctotal absence of individual issues.\u201d As hereafter stated, unique factual and legal issues respecting the origin of the fire, proximate cause and damage to each property abound. Because of the discrete conditions surrounding the separate fire and consequential damage to each of the residential structures, it is doubtful that an adjudication in a suit by a specific plaintiff or group of plaintiffs will establish incompatible standards of conduct on the part of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We also find no basis for a class action under subpart (B) of <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(l). The focus under subpart (B) is to protect the interests of the class members, since it permits the maintenance of a cause of action if a prosecution of separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">This subpart is intended to embrace situations where a judgment of a nonclass action by a class member, while not technically including the other members, might do so \u201cas a practical matter.\u201d This would be the case, for example, when claims by numerous persons are made against a fund which is insufficient to satisfy all claims, <em>see In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>880 F.2d 709, 741 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Anderson v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>959, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>377, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>362 (1989), or if injunctive relief in favor of one class member may disable the party opposing the class action from performing its duties toward the other class members. 3B Moore, \u00a7 23.35[2] at 251-52. Moreover, most authorities conclude that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">mere <em>stare decisis </em>effect of an individual adjudication is not ordinarily enough as a practical matter to be dispositive of other members\u2019 interest, and that a dispositive impact more in the nature of a legal necessity traceable to a joint or common right, such as disposition of a property interest, ... is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 254. <em>See also In re Dennis Greenman Sec. Litig., </em>829 F.2d 1539, 1546 (11th Cir.1987); <em>but see In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>880 F.2d at 741 (mass Daikon Shield tort litigation involving over 300,000 claims is \u201cclassic type\u201d of \u201climited fund\u201d embraced within (b)(1)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Based on the record as presently constituted, we cannot say that this is a \u201climited fund\u201d case. No one has demonstrated or even suggested that the City or its liability carrier have limited resources to cover potential future claims. Moreover, there is no showing that an adjudication in an individual case will, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>practical matter, dispose of the claims of other class members. Because of the discrete factual circumstances surrounding each fire, <em>stare decisis </em>should have little import on future claims. For example, an adjudication in favor of defendants in an individual case where their liability was remote, should not discourage another plaintiff or group of plaintiffs from filing separate actions if defendants\u2019 liability is apparent. Finally, absent here is the probability that a single adjudication will have a \u201cdispositive impact\u201d involving a \u201cjoint or common right.\u201d 3B Moore, \u00a7 23.35[2] at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The question then becomes whether the trial judge was correct in certifying the class under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(3), which permits maintenance of a class action if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The factors pertinent to the findings include: first, the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; second, the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; third, the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Thus, under 4:32-l(b)(3), the movant must demonstrate both the predominance of the common issues and the \u201csuperiority\u201d of a cause of action over other available trial techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\"> In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s grant of class certification, we are mindful that the class action rule should be liberally construed and a class action should be permitted unless there is a clear showing that it is inappropriate or improper. <em>Lusky v. Capasso Bros., </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 373, 287 A.2d 736 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>466, 291 A.2d 16 (1972). We also acknowledge that certification of a class action should not be denied because of the underlying theory in which the action is predicated. <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 426, 461 A.2d 736. <em>See also Wagner v. Taylor, </em>836 F.2d 566, 587 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1987). However, identification of the issues to determine if class certification is suitable requires \u201csome preliminary analysis\u201d of the underlying theories of liability and predictable defenses. <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 426, 461 A. 2d 736. We must therefore examine plaintiffs\u2019 theories of liability and the predictable defenses in deciding whether a class action under subsection -1(b)(3) is merited.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In considering the issue of predominance under 4:32-1(b)(3), the goal is to \u201csave time and money for the parties and the public and to promote consistent decisions for people with similar claims.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 430, 461 A.2d 736. Also, all issues need not be identical among all members of the class; common questions must simply predominate. <em>Fiore v. Hudson Cty. Employees Pension Comm\u2019n, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 528, 377 A.2d 702 (App.Div.1977). \u201cIf a \u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019 is present, predominance may be found.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 461 A.2d 736 (quoting 7A Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1778 at 54 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">As we have stated, the centerpiece of plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is that the properties of prospective class members were damaged or destroyed by fire caused by defendants\u2019 failure to implement or administer a policy concerning City-owned structures. This theory is clearly common to all class members. However, commonality becomes obscured when the probable unique issues of liability, causation and damages in each case are considered, requiring individualized treatment at trial. It is alleged that over 80 privately-owned dwellings were damaged by 61 separate fires over a six-year period. Some were caused by arson; some had undetermined origins. The cause of each fire, and whether the absence of a City protective or maintenance policy contributed to it will, no doubt, be fact-sensitive issues resolved by fact-specific proofs. Resolution of the issue of proximate cause in each case as well will depend on the unique circumstances of each case, such as the presence or absence of intervening causes or factors over which defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>had no control. <em>See Bieneman v. City of Chicago, </em>864 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied sub nom., City of Chicago v. Bieneman, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>1080, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2099, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>661 (1989) (class action not allowed on behalf of 3,000 residents adversely affected by airport noise in view of different effect on each owner depending on topography, flight patterns, and many other variables). <em>See also Raye v. Medtronic Corp., </em>696 <em>F.Supp. </em>1273, 1275 (D.Minn.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim is made under the Tort Claims Act. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-3d, the public entity is not liable for the exercise of discretion when, in the face of competing demands, it determines how to utilize existing resources, unless its determination is palpably unreasonable. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-2 (public entity\u2019s failure to protect against dangerous condition on public property is not actionable if its conduct was not palpably unreasonable). According to defendants, the City decides whether or not to expend available resources for maintenance of City property on a building-by-building basis. Thus, whether or not its failure to expend its resources in boarding up a particular building was \u201cpalpably unreasonable\u201d will depend upon circumstances peculiar to that building.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">For example, the record establishes that the duration of time the City owned abandoned buildings prior to each fire varied to a substantial degree. One property was owned for seven years; another for only four months. Thus, the duration of ownership, whether the City had notice of vandals occupying each structure and other pertinent factors must be scrutinized on a case-by-case basis in resolving the \u201cpalpably unreasonable\u201d issue. We note also that according to the record, some of the proposed class members have filed Notices of Claim pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8 and some have not. Assertion of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>defense will also require individualized treatment at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Raye, </em>696 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1275 (class action involving injuries caused by pacemaker not allowed because many issues, including application of statute of limitation defenses, will vary with respect to each member of the suggested class). For these reasons, the case is distinguishable from <em>In re Cadillac, </em>where the core of the dispute involved a specific design defect in a single model and year Cadillac, which raised common questions of law and fact concerning the defect, General Motors\u2019 knowledge of the defect and the terms of General Motors\u2019 express warranty. 93 <em>N.J. </em>at 434-35, 461 A. 2d 736. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the \u201cpredominance\u201d prong under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The second prong under <em>R. </em>4:32-l(b)(3) is that the class action be \u201csuperior\u201d to other available means of adjudicating the controversy. The word \u201csuperior\u201d implies a \"comparison with alternative procedures such as a test case or joinder of claims.\u201d <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 461 A.2d 736. <em>See also Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., </em>496 <em>F.</em>2d 747, 757 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>885, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>152, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>125 (1974). That comparison requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(1) an informed consideration of alternative available methods of adjudication of each issue, (2) a comparison of the fairness to all whose interests may be involved between such alternative methods and a class action, and (3) a comparison of the efficiency of adjudication of each method.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 461 A.2d 736 (quoting <em>Katz, </em>496 F.2d at 757).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We recognize that the lack of financial wherewithal on the part of potential class members has been an important factor in causing the named plaintiffs to move for class action. Such an action would permit plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to pool available resources and present their proofs, expert or otherwise, in a single case. Counsels\u2019 motive is both practical and laudable. However, in the circumstances present here, we cannot conclude that the interest of economy makes the class action \u201csuperior\u201d to other available means of adjudicating the controversy. This is not a case where, because the individual claims are too small to warrant recourse to case-by-case litigation, the \u201cwrongs would go without redress\u201d if class action certification is not granted. <em>See In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 461 A.2d 736. Each class member asserts substantial damage or total destruction to his or her dwelling, a virtual \u201ctaking\u201d of property, and thus has a sufficient stake to prosecute his or her claim individually or with a group of other plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Also, to the extent that the trial judge may identify a single common issue of law or fact, that issue may be adjudicated by way of a \u201ctest case\u201d involving one or more plaintiffs. <em>See id. </em>at 436-37, 461 A.2d 736; <em>Kronisch, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 428-30, 363 A.2d 376; <em>Katz, </em>496 F.2d at 760-61. Defendants would be collaterally estopped by the adverse findings of fact against them. <em>Kronisch, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 429, 363 A.2d 376. On the other hand, members of the prospective class \u201cwould not be bound by a judgment in favor of [defendants] in the test case[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such an approach may well achieve the economies of time, effort and litigation expense sought by all parties. For these reasons, we cannot say that the class action approach is \u201csuperior\u201d to other means available for a proper adjudication of the rights and claims of the class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The class designated as \u201cClass Two\u201d by the trial judge includes property owners \u201cwho may <em>potentially </em>suffer dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ages as a result of fires originating in vacant, city-owned structures.\u201d (Emphasis added). For the reasons above expressed, we are satisfied that this class as well should not have been certified. Also, although not specified in the rule, establishment of a class action implicitly requires both that there be an identifiable class and that plaintiff be a member of the class. <em>In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>880 F.2d at 728. This class is so ill-defined that it is impossible to determine its parameters. <em>See Fiore, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 527, 377 A.2d 702 (potential class members must possess the right to make a claim, whether they choose to or not). According to defendants, the City owns over 1,500 structures, and this figure is fluid because the City is continuously acquiring new property through tax foreclosure and selling other properties at tax sales. As defendants persuasively argue, it is therefore virtually impossible presently to define which of the 26,626 residential properties in the City are at future risk of being damaged by fires originating from City-owned dwellings. In our view, classification of such a nebulous class would complicate, rather than aid in the prompt and economic resolution of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Moreover, to the extent that \u201cClass Two\u201d members seek an injunctive or mandamus remedy, such relief can be granted to the named plaintiffs and inure to the benefit of all owners of residential structures in the City. <em>See Dionne v.
