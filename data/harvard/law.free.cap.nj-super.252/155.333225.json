Moreover, even if the court had erred in refusing to submit reckless manslaughter to the jury, we would conclude, as set forth in section II of this opinion, that the error was harmless, because the court instructed the jury regarding the lesser included offense of aggravated manslaughter and the jury nonetheless found defendant guilty of purposeful or knowing murder. Defendant\u2019s other arguments relating to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, defense counsel\u2019s representation of the defendant and the conduct of the trial are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). Although these arguments do not require extended discussion, we note that the objections now made by defendant to the court\u2019s instructions were not raised at trial. While those instructions could have been refined in the manner suggested by defendant\u2019s appellate arguments, we believe that the instructions, considered in their entirety, adequately conveyed the applicable law and could not have misled the jury. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction. However, we also conclude for the reasons expressed in section III of this opinion that the court failed to follow the sentencing criteria set forth in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986), in imposing consecutive sentences upon defendant. Therefore, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8(e) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.\u201d This \u201crational-basis\u201d test establishes a \u201clow threshold ... for permitting a charge on a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Crisantos, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A.2d 167 (1986). However, a court should not submit a lesser included offense which invites the jury to engage in sheer speculation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 479-85, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988); <em>State v. Davis, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>16, 28, 231 A.2d 793 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>1054, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>805, 19 L.Ed.2d 852 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Defendant was indicted for purposeful or knowing murder, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(l) or (2). Under the Code, conduct is \u201cpurposeful\u201d if it is the person\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d to cause a result, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(l), and conduct is \u201cknowing\u201d if the person is aware that \u201cit is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2). Defendant claims that the court should have submitted reckless manslaughter, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4b(l), as a lesser included offense of purposeful or knowing murder. A person acts \u201crecklessly,\u201d justifying a conviction for reckless manslaughter, if he \u201cconsciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that [death] will result from his conduct.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3). Therefore, the question is whether there was a rational basis for the jury to find that defendant \u201crecklessly\u201d caused the victim\u2019s death by consciously disregarding the substantial risk that death would result from his conduct or whether defendant was necessarily aware that it was practically certain his conduct would cause death or serious bodily injury. <em>State v. Rose, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 548 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The State presented evidence that defendant and the victim became involved in some form of argument on a Newark street corner around 11:30 p.m. on September 28, 1988. Defendant went into a building, from which he re-emerged a few minutes later with an Uzi machine gun. Defendant then opened fire into a group of people which included the victim, who was killed by one of the shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Defendant did not testify at trial. However, the State introduced a pretrial statement defendant gave to the police, which included the following account of the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">I saw Marisol Baez walking down the street with a bag in her hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">Then I saw my cousin, Juanchi [Juan Rivera Mendieta], walk over to her, grab the bag and pull a machine gun out of the bag and start shooting at the building across from 69 North 9th at the black guys in front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The black guys started running all different ways and then I walked over to my cousin and took the gun off him. Then I saw another group of black guys just standing on the corner by my building and they started walking towards me. I told them to back off and then I fired some rounds in the air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">After I fired the rounds, the black guys that were coming to me backed off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The State also presented the testimony of Marisol Baez, mentioned in defendant\u2019s statement, who gave yet another account of the shooting. She stated that an unknown Hispanic male handed the gun to codefendant Mendieta, who handed the gun to defendant, who then fired a series of shots at the crowd. According to Baez, defendant subsequently handed the gun back to Mendieta, who fired another series of shots at the crowd. Defendant\u2019s girlfriend corroborated portions of this account of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Thus, both the State\u2019s witnesses and defendant agreed that the victim was killed by a person firing multiple shots into a crowd with a machine gun. The only salient difference between the State\u2019s and defendant\u2019s version of the offense was the identity of the shooter, with the State\u2019s witnesses identifying defendant as the shooter and defendant identifying Mendie-ta. Furthermore, although defendant stated that he fired the gun into the air after Mendieta fired it into the crowd, there is no evidence even suggesting that the victim was killed by a bullet which ricocheted off some other object. Consequently, the only version of the offense for which there is any support in the record is that the victim was killed by one of the bullets which either defendant or Mendieta fired directly into the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">We believe that a person who fires a machine gun into a crowd is necessarily aware that \u201cit is practically certain\u201d this conduct will cause death or serious bodily injury, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(2). This conclusion is supported by <em>State v. Rose, supra, </em>in which the defendant was convicted of murder for shooting a police officer in the stomach with a shotgun. In arguing that the court erred in refusing to submit aggravated manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense, defendant relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>his pretrial statement that \u201cwhen he pulled [the shotgun] out of the sack it apparently had cocked and when it came out of the sack the gun went off striking the police officer in [the] abdomen.\u201d 112 <em>N.J. </em>at 480, 548 A.2d 1058. However, the Court concluded that defendant\u2019s statement, considered in the context of all the evidence presented at trial, \u201creflected an acknowledgement of [his] responsibility for the shooting without any explanation of how it occurred\u201d and therefore \u201cconstituted far too speculative and unsubstantial a basis for a manslaughter verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 548 A. 2d 1058. The Court further noted that \u201cin the absence of insanity or diminished capacity, a person firing a sawed-off shotgun into the abdomen of another at point-blank range necessarily is aware that \u2018it is practically certain\u2019 that such conduct will cause the victim\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 548 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Similarly, we believe that absent some form of mental derangement, of which no evidence was presented, a person firing a machine gun into a crowd necessarily would be aware that it is practically certain his conduct will cause death. Indeed, even if the jury could find that defendant was only aware it was \u201cpractically certain\u201d his conduct would cause \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d it still would be required to find him guilty of purposeful or knowing murder rather than manslaughter. As the Court held in <em>State v. Gerald, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>40, 82, 549 A.2d 792 (1988), \u201can actor may be convicted of murder both (1) when he or she acted with the purpose or knowledge that the victim\u2019s death would follow, and (2) when he or she acted with the purpose or knowledge to inflict only serious bodily injury, but the injury resulted in the victim\u2019s death.\u201d Therefore, there was no rational basis for submitting reckless manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense of purposeful or knowing murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Even if the trial court had erred in failing to submit reckless manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense, that error would not require a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction because the jury considered the lesser included offense of aggravated manslaughter and nevertheless found defendant guilty of purposeful or knowing murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">To establish guilt of either aggravated manslaughter or reckless manslaughter, the State must prove that the defendant recklessly caused the death of another human being. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a and b(l). Aggravated manslaughter requires proof of the additional element that defendant acted \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a. In <em>State v. Curtis, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 363, 479 A.2d 425 (App.Div.1984), <em>certif. denied, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>212, 491 A.2d 708 (1984), we held that the only difference between aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter is \u201cthe difference in the degree of the risk that death will result from defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d The degree of risk required for reckless manslaughter is \u201ca mere possibility of death\u201d while the \u201cadditional element\u201d in aggravated manslaughter that \u201cdeath be caused \u2018under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life\u2019 elevates the risk level from a mere possibility to a probability.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>State v. Grunow, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>133, 506 A.2d 708 (1988), the Supreme Court adopted this view of the difference between aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter, citing <em>Curtis </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]he Legislature recognized a single concept of reckless homicide that constituted manslaughter, with the gradation of punishment based upon the degree of risk of death.\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 143, 506 A.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The trial court instructed the jury regarding the elements of aggravated manslaughter in conformity with <em>Curtis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">[S]hould you find the defendant not guilty of murder under count 1, then ... you should consider the crime of aggravated manslaughter. Now, a person is guilty of aggravated manslaughter if he recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">With respect to the first element, that the defendant caused Orlandez Corbett\u2019s death, you must find that Orlandez Corbett would not have died but for the defendant\u2019s conduct. With respect to the second element, in order to find that the defendant recklessly caused Orlandez Corbett\u2019s death, you must find that the defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result from his conduct. And the risk must be of such a nature and degree that considering the nature and purpose of the defendant\u2019s conduct and circumstances known to the defendant, his disregard of that risk that the material element would result, death, or was practically certain to result, his disregard of that risk is a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation or in the same situation____ [T]o find the third element, you must find that the defendant acted under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Now, the phrase under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, does not focus on the defendant\u2019s state of mind but rather under circumstances which you find that he acted. The State must prove that the defendant acted in a way that showed the defendant was indifferent to whether Orlandez Corbett lived or died. That is, that the defendant acted in a way that showed that he did not care that someone was killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Now, the defendant must have acted in a way under the circumstances that involved a probability of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">I remind you, however, that you are not to consider aggravated manslaughter unless you find the defendant not guilty on the charge of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Although the jury was properly instructed regarding the elements of the lesser included offense of aggravated manslaughter, it nevertheless found defendant guilty of purposeful or knowing murder. This jury verdict constituted a clear rejection of defendant\u2019s claim that his conduct was not purposeful or knowing, but only reckless, which is an essential element of both aggravated and reckless manslaughter. Consequently, there is no reasonable possibility the trial court\u2019s failure to submit the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter to the jury could have contributed to its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>This conclusion is supported by <em>State v. Vujosevic, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 444-46, 487 <em>A.</em>2d 751 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>247, 501 A.2d 920 (1985), in which we concluded that the trial court erred in not submitting aggravated assault to the jury as a lesser included offense of murder, but that the error was harmless, because the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter even though it was given the alternative of finding him guilty of the lesser offense of reckless manslaughter: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Here it is dear that the jury was not in reasonable doubt as to the proof of any of the elements of aggravated manslaughter because surely if it had been but had not desired completely to acquit defendant it would have returned a verdict of guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter. We cannot believe that if the jury thought defendant was not responsible for Baron\u2019s death it would have convicted him of an offense more serious than the least severe homicide charge available to it. [198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 445-46, 487 A.2d 751].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Similarly, the courts in other jurisdictions have held that a jury, by finding the defendant guilty of a higher offense to the exclusion of the immediately lesser-included offense, may be found to have necessarily rejected all other lesser included offenses of the same character, even if the court failed to instruct the jury on the additional lesser offenses. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Campbell, </em>597 <em>F.</em>2d 628, 631 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>852, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>106, 62 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>69 (1979); <em>Ex Parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Jordan, </em>486 So.2d 485 (Ala.1986); <em>Ridgely v.

The reasoning in <em>Sede\u00f1o </em>is illustrative of these cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">[I]n some circumstances it is possible to determine that although an instruction on a lesser included offense was erroneously omitted, the factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions. In such cases the issue should not be deemed to have been removed from the jury\u2019s consideration since it has been resolved in another context, and there can be no prejudice to the defendant since the evidence that would support a finding that only the lesser offense was committed has been rejected by the jury____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">In the instant case, the jury necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s evidence that his diminished capacity negated intent to kill when it found the shooting to be first degree rather than second degree murder. Thus, the failure to give an instruction on involuntary manslaughter could not have been prejudicial to defendant since the offense could have been no less than voluntary manslaughter. [518 P.2d at 924-25, 112 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 12-13].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Similarly, in <em>Abreau </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">[I]f a defendant is charged with offense \u201cA\u201d of which \u201cB\u201d is the next immediate lesser-included offense (one step removed) and \u201cC\u201d is the next below \u201cB\u201d (two steps removed), then when the jury is instructed on \u201cB\u201d yet still convicts the accused of \u201cA\u201d it is logical to assume that the panel would not have found him guilty only of \u201cC\u201d (that is, would have passed over \u201cB\u201d), so that the failure to instruct on \u201cC\" is harmless. [363 So.2d at 1064],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">This case is fundamentally different from <em>State v. Grunow, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Crisantos, supra, </em>which defendant relies upon in arguing that the asserted error in not submitting reckless manslaughter to the jury requires a new trial. In <em>Grunow, </em>the Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>court\u2019s erroneous instruction regarding the lesser included offense of passion/provocation manslaughter was harmless, because the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter, which is an offense that cannot be mitigated by passion/provocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">[The State\u2019s harmless error] argument ... assumes one major premise that we cannot accept: it assumes that the jury inevitably proceeded on a step-by-step basis to consider murder first, and then aggravated manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Unlike the verdict in <em>State v. Vujosevic, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. 435 </em>[487 A.2d 751] (App.Div.1985), this verdict does not leave us with an abiding certainty that the error was harmless. In <em>Vujosevic </em>the jury\u2019s conviction of the defendant on aggravated manslaughter, the greater of the two available verdicts, convinced the court that had the jury entertained any doubt about the offense, it would have found the lesser verdict. Hence, failure to charge on aggravated assault was harmless on \u201cthe unusual facts here.\u201d [102 <em>N.J. </em>at 146-47, 506 A.2d 708].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Thus, the essential rationale of <em>Grunow </em>is that even though theoretically the jury should not have considered defendant\u2019s guilt of aggravated manslaughter without first concluding that he had not acted purposefully or knowingly and that he therefore could not be guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter, in actuality the jury may have found defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter due to mitigating circumstances which could have resulted in a verdict for the lesser degree offense of passion/provocation manslaughter if the jury had been properly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In <em>Crisantos, </em>the defendant was charged with felony murder and purposeful or knowing murder. The trial court instructed the jury to consider defendant\u2019s guilt of purposeful or knowing murder only if it acquitted him of felony murder and refused to submit passion/provocation manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense of purposeful or knowing murder. The jury found defendant guilty of felony murder and did not consider purposeful or knowing murder. We held that the court\u2019s failure to submit passion/provocation manslaughter to the jury was harmless error, because the jury had convicted defendant of felony murder, a crime not amenable to mitigation based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>passion/provocation. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">A jury may acquit or convict on a lesser charge although satisfied that the State has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Accordingly, the fact that the jury in this case convicted appellant of felony murder does not necessarily mean that it would have returned the same verdict if manslaughter had also been charged. It had the power, for example, to return arguably inconsistent verdicts of robbery and manslaughter or to have acquitted for robbery and convicted for manslaughter alone. [102 <em>N.J. </em>at 272-73, 508 A.2d 167].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Thus, as in <em>Grunow, </em>the Court\u2019s essential rationale in <em>Crisan-tos </em>was that even though theoretically the jury should not have reached the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt of passion/provocation manslaughter in view of its finding that he was guilty of felony murder, in actuality the jury may have found defendant guilty of felony murder only because it was convinced that he was guilty of some form of murder. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s failure to submit passion/provocation manslaughter deprived the jury of the opportunity of returning a verdict for a lesser degree offense based on considerations of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In contrast, the jury in this case was instructed regarding aggravated manslaughter and thereby given the opportunity to return a verdict for this lesser included homicide offense. Moreover, the offense of aggravated manslaughter includes all the elements of reckless manslaughter, but requires the additional element of acting \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d Therefore, there is no realistic possibility that the jury, having rejected the alternative of finding defendant guilty of aggravated manslaughter, would have found him guilty of reckless manslaughter if it had been presented with that additional alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We turn finally to the sentence, particularly its consecutive features, which consist of consecutive terms of life imprisonment, with thirty years parole ineligibility, for murder, five years imprisonment for possession of a handgun without a permit, and ten years imprisonment, with five years parole ineligibility, for possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The criteria for determining whether consecutive sentences should be imposed were set forth in <em>State v. Yarbough, supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(1) there can be no free crimes in a system for which the punishment shall fit the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(2) the reasons for imposing either a consecutive or concurrent sentence should be separately stated in the sentencing decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">(3) some reasons to be considered by the sentencing court should include facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">(a) the crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">(b) the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">(c) the crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">(d) any of the crimes involved multiple victims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">(e) the convictions for which the sentences are to be imposed are numerous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-19\">(4) there should be no double counting of aggravated factors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-20\">(5) successive terms for the same offense should not ordinarily be equal to the punishment for the first offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-21\">(6) there should be an overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest terms (including an extended term, if eligible) that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses. <em>[100 N.J. </em>at 643-44, 498 <em>A.</em>2d 1239],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-22\">In imposing three consecutive terms of imprisonment, the trial court failed to give explicit consideration to the sentencing criteria set forth in <em>Yarbough. </em>Furthermore, the sentence clearly violates <em>Yarbough </em>criteria six, because the aggregate term exceeds that sum of the longest terms that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses of which defendant was convicted. Therefore, the matter must be remanded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>resentencing in conformity with <em>Yarbough. </em>In addition, the trial court should reconsider whether defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose should merge with his conviction for murder in light of the principles set forth in <em>State v. Williams, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 35-37, 516 A.2d 265 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>104, 526 A.2d 177 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\">The indictment charging defendant also charged Juan Rivera Mendieta with the same offenses. Mendieta was tried separately and acquitted of all charges. The State called defendant as a witness at Mendieta\u2019s trial, which was held subsequent to defendant\u2019s trial, and, after he had been granted immunity, attempted to question him. However, defendant refused to testify, which resulted in his being found guilty of contempt and sentenced to a six month term of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his sentence in this case. We affirmed that conviction and sentence in <em>In re Mendez, </em>A-6231-89T4 (decided July 29, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">For similar reasons, there does not appear to have been any basis for the trial court to submit aggravated manslaughter to the jury as a lesser included offense. See the discussion in section II of this opinion regarding the relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ship between the offenses of aggravated and reckless manslaughter. However, any error in submitting aggravated manslaughter to the jury could only have benefitted defendant and hence there is no need to decide the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The United States Court of Appeals subsequently held that we erred in concluding that the failure to submit aggravated assault to the jury as a lesser included offense was harmless error and directed that Vujosevic be granted a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Vujosevic v. Rafferty, </em>844 F.2d 1023, 1027-28 (3d Cir.1988). The Third Circuit held that the failure to instruct the jury regarding aggravated assault unfairly deprived Vujosevic of the opportunity to have the jury consider his primary defense, noting that \u201c[t]he factual question placed in issue by Vujosevic\u2019s defense was not the level of culpability, but rather the causation of [the victim\u2019s] death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1028. But compare <em>Schad v. Arizona, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2491, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>555 (1991). Although we express no view on the disagreement between this court and the Third Circuit in <em>Vujosevic, </em>we are satisfied that any error in refusing to submit reckless manslaughter to the jury in this case would be harmless even under the Third Circuit\u2019s approach, because the only difference between aggravated and reckless manslaughter is the level of culpability of the accused. <em>State v. Grunow, supra; State v. Curtis, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The Court in <em>Crisantos </em>ultimately sustained defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that there was no rational basis for submitting the lesser included offense of passion/provocation manslaughter to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 508 A2d 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
