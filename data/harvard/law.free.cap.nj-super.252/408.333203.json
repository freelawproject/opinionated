(Shoreview), Hubert P. Schreurs and Joseph Strzalka, to recover on two promissory notes given by Shoreview to City Federal Savings Bank (City Federal), and guaranteed by the individual defendants. The RTC appeals, by leave granted, from the denial of its motion to dismiss defendants\u2019 counterclaim which seeks money damages against the RTC for City Federal\u2019s purported unfair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty owed to defendants. The RTC argues that the Law Division had no subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaim because defendants did not exhaust their administrative remedies provided for under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d) (West 1989). We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In November 1987, Shoreview executed and delivered to City Federal two notes in the principal amounts of $385,500 and $2,111,880. In January 1989, City Federal gave Shoreview a line of credit in the amount of $250,000 as evidenced by a third note executed by Shoreview. All three notes were guaranteed by Schreurs and Strzalka.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On December 8, 1989, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) declared City Federal insolvent and appointed the RTC as receiver. The RTC then assigned its right to defendants\u2019 notes \u2022to City Savings Bank, F.S.B., which was in conservatorship under the RTC. In September 1990, the OTS closed City Savings Bank and appointed the RTC as receiver, and on the same day the RTC assigned the notes to City Savings, F.S.B., a newly-created federal mutual association.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Because defendants had defaulted on the note payments, on November 9, 1990, the RTC, as conservator for City Savings, F.S.B., filed a complaint in the Law Division against defendants to recover the amounts advanced by City Federal to defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>On January 11, 1991, City Savings, F.S.B. was placed in receivership under the RTC. On March 13, 1991, defendants filed an answer and counterclaim asserting that City Federal and City Savings Bank, F.S.B., as predecessors to City Savings, F.S.B., had breached their obligation to fund fully defendants\u2019 building project. Specifically, defendants claimed that City Federal had advanced only $1,950,321.20 on the $2,111,880 note, and the RTC\u2019s and its predecessors\u2019 refusal to disburse the remaining balance of the loan prevented Shoreview from paying contractors and continuing the sale of residential units. Defendants sought \u201cactual damages, punitive damages, costs of suit, attorney\u2019s fees and such other relief as the court may deem just and equitable on this counterclaim.\u201d On March 7, 1991, the RTC amended its complaint to reflect that it had been appointed receiver for City Savings, F.S.B. as of January 11, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The RTC moved to dismiss defendants\u2019 counterclaim arguing that the Law Division lacked subject matter jurisdiction, <em>see R. </em>4:6-2(a), because defendants had failed to comply with the comprehensive federal administrative claims procedure under FIRREA. The trial judge denied the motion, reasoning that defendants\u2019 counterclaim was in reality an affirmative defense which was not a \u201cclaim\u201d subject to the administrative procedure under FIRREA. In denying the RTC\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the judge found it significant that the RTC had in the first instance filed an action in the state court against defendants. As a consequence, the judge reasoned, defendants should not be precluded from raising what he deemed a \u201cdefense\u201d in a \u201ccollection action\u201d in the state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Congress\u2019s passage in 1989 of FIRREA was intended to address the recent savings and loan crisis. H.R.Rep. No. 54(1), 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 302-12, <em>reprinted in </em>1989 2 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>86, 98-108. The act provides a detailed regulatory framework so as to \u201crestore the financial integrity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>thrift industry\u2019s deposit insurance fund and to \u2018provide funds from public and private sources to deal expeditiously with failed depository institutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Circle Indus. v. City Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>447, 451 (E.D.N.Y.1990), (quoting <em>P.L. </em>101-73, 103 Stat. 183, \u00a7 101[8]), <em>affd o.b., </em>931 <em>FM </em>7 (2nd Cir.1991). Thus, the RTC was established \u201cto contain, manage and resolve failed savings associations^]\u201d acting in a capacity of conservator or receiver of the failed depository institution. <em>Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 451 (quoting \u00a7 101[7]); <em>see also </em>12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(c). The RTC was given authority to determine claims against a failed institution, 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(3), as well as the power to liquidate the institution\u2019s assets in order to pay depositors and other claimants. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">FIRREA carefully circumscribes the scope and form of judicial review of the agency\u2019s disallowance of a claim asserted against the RTC in its capacity as receiver. The act creates a comprehensive administrative procedure for adjudicating claims asserted against a failed depository institution. As receiver, the RTC initiates the process by giving prompt notice to creditors of the failed institution by advising them they have (at least) 90 days from publication of notice to present their claims against the assets of the institution. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(3). The RTC then has 180 days from the date the claim is filed to allow or disallow the claim. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1821(d)(5)(A), (B) and (D). If the claim is disallowed, the claimant may either seek administrative review or file suit in the federal district court. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A). The judicial proceeding in the federal district court is a <em>de novo </em>determination of the claim, not a review of the administrative disallowance of the claim. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(5)(E). <em>See also Bank of New England, N.A. v. Callahan, </em>758 <em>F.Supp. </em>61, 63 (D.N.H.1991). This claims determination procedure enables the RTC to dispose of the bulk of claims against failed institutions expeditiously and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>fairly without unduly burdening the judicial process. <em>Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Section 1821(d)(13)(D) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, <em>no court shall have jurisdiction </em>over\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(i) <em>any claim </em>or action for payment from, <em>or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to, the assets of any depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed receiver, </em>including assets which the Corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(ii) any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the Corporation as receiver. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Thus, \u201cno court\u201d shall have jurisdiction over \u201cany claim\u201d against the RTC or the failed institution except as provided by FIRREA. That the administrative remedy under the act is exclusive is also apparent from FIRREA\u2019s legislative history. The Report of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee reported on FIRREA that a judicial <em>de novo </em>review will be available only \u201c[ajfter exhaustion of streamlined administrative procedures,\u201d and the House Judiciary Committee reported that the act provides for judicial involvement in the resolution of claims only as the act \u201citself provides.\u201d <em>Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 453-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Further, the federal decisions under the act have uniformly held that Congress intended to vest the RTC with primary jurisdiction to determine a \u201cclaim\u201d against a failed institution before judicial intervention. <em>Praxis Properties, Inc. v. Colonial Sav. Bank, S.L.A., </em>947 F.2d 49 (3rd Cir.1991). Once the RTC has been appointed receiver, a claimant must comply with FIRREA\u2019s statutory procedures as a prerequisite to federal jurisdiction. <em>Id.; Rosa v. RTC, </em>938 F.2d 383, 392- 93 (3rd Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>582, 116 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>608 (1991); <em>Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 454. By enacting FIRREA, \u201cCongress expressly withdrew jurisdiction from <em>all courts </em>over any claim to a failed bank\u2019s assets that are made outside the procedure set forth in section 1821.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Shain, Schaffer &amp; Rafanello, </em>944 F.2d 129, 131 (3rd Cir.1991) (emphasis added); <em>see also Rosa, </em>938 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>F.</em>2d at 391. In short, the administrative claims procedure under the act is exclusive. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Elman, </em>761 <em>F.Supp. </em>245, 247 (S.D.N.Y.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>949 <em>F.2d </em>624 (2nd Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In view of FIRREA\u2019s pervasive regulatory scheme, we are satisfied that if defendants\u2019 counterclaim is deemed a \u201cclaim\u201d under the act, the Law Division had no subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide it. It is undisputed before us that the RTC published notice pursuant to 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(3); defendants received actual notice of their obligation to file an administrative claim pursuant to FIRREA, and defendants did not file a claim pursuant to 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(3)(B)(i). Thus, if defendants are asserting a \u201cclaim\u201d covered by FIRREA, their exclusive remedy was to proceed through the act\u2019s administrative process and, if the claim was disallowed, to seek a <em>de novo </em>review in the federal district court. 12 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(6)(A). Although the federal cases refer to the federal district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction under these circumstances, the preclusion applies to the state courts as well, since 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D) provides that <em>\u201cno court </em>shall have jurisdiction over\u201d such claims except as provided under the act. (Emphasis added). Moreover, allowing the prosecution of \u201cclaims,\u201d whether in federal or state courts, would frustrate the achievement of FIRREA\u2019s stated goal to deal expeditiously and fairly with claims against failed savings and loan institutions. <em>See Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The question then becomes whether defendants\u2019 counterclaim is a \u201cclaim\u201d under FIRREA. We do not agree with the trial judge\u2019s observation that the counterclaim was nothing more than a \u201cdefense\u201d to the RTC\u2019s \u201ccollection action.\u201d The gravamen of the counterclaim is that as a result of City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Federal\u2019s and the RTC\u2019s failure to disburse the entire $2,111,-880 loan given to Shoreview, it was unable to pay contractors and continue sales of their homes, thereby sustaining \u201cnumerous and substantial damages.\u201d As stated, defendants demand judgment awarding compensatory and punitive damages against the RTC. This affirmative demand for monetary relief cannot be described simply as a \u201cdefense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D)(i) refers to any claim <em>\u201cfor payment from\u201d </em>or actions \u201cseeking a determination of rights with respect to, the <em>assets </em>of any depository institution for which [the RTC] has been appointed receiver[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). The emphasis on \u201cassets\u201d plainly suggests that clause (i) is intended to bar actions seeking to recover monetary payment from the assets of the depository institution. <em>See Rosa, </em>938 F.2d at 393. This is so because any recovery against the institution will be satisfied from its assets garnered by the RTC. <em>Id. </em>Since any compensatory or punitive damage award recovered by defendants against the RTC will of necessity be paid from the assets of the failed institution, it must be deemed a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Indeed, it has been held that a \u201clender\u2019s liability\u201d action similar to defendants\u2019 counterclaim, bottomed on a failed bank\u2019s refusal to advance promised funds, constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d under FIRREA. In <em>Circle Indus., </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 447-455, City Federal and a consortium of banks had provided $158,000,000 in financing for the construction of \u201cPort Liberte,\u201d a 1,690 luxury apartment complex in Jersey City. The owner defaulted on the loan. Circle Industries, a subcontractor, alleged that City Federal had promised to provide sufficient funding to complete Phase I of the project and, in reliance on the promise, Circle Industries and other subcontractors completed Phase I. <em>Id. </em>at 450. When the RTC was named receiver for City Federal, Circle Industries filed suit against City Federal and the other banks seeking compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that the defendant banks had breached their covenant to deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>fairly and in good faith with Circle Industries and had breached their fiduciary duty to notify Circle Industries that they were unable to provide the financing. <em>Id. </em>at 451. After an exhaustive discussion regarding the provisions and legislative history of FIRREA, the district court concluded that since Circle Industries did not file a claim with the RTC, the court had no subject matter jurisdiction to hear and decide Circle Industries\u2019 claim under its amended complaint against City Federal. <em>Id. </em>at 455. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">In enacting FIRREA, Congress intended litigants like Circle Industries to first submit their claims against failed savings and loan institutions to the RTC or FDIC before commencing an action in the district court____ \u201cTherefore, this court has no jurisdiction over the claims [for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent misrepresentation] raised in plaintiffs complaint.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>(quoting <em>Frawley Assocs. v. City Federal Sav. Bank, </em>No. CIV. A. 90-2060, 1990 WL 63546, at *7 (E.D.Pa. May 9, 1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">In denying the RTC\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial judge distinguished a direct claim asserted against a failed institution from a claim asserted in response to an action commenced in the state court by the RTC on behalf of the institution. The judge suggested that when a claim is asserted as part of a counterclaim in response to the RTC\u2019s suit in a state court, the counterclaim does not fall within FIRREA\u2019s reach. However, 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D) refers to \u201cany claim or action\u201d; it contains no exceptions for counterclaims. <em>Cf. United States v. Altman, </em>762 <em>F.Supp. </em>139, 144 (S.D.Miss.1991) (\u201chad Congress intended that third-party claims against RTC be exempt from the exhaustion requirement of FIRREA, it would have provided such an exception in the Act as it did in [the Federal Tort Claims Act]\u201d). Furthermore, the federal courts have held that the section applies to counterclaims as well as to direct claims. <em>See id.; Bank of New England, </em>758 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 64; <em>United Bank of Waco v. First Republic Bank Waco, N.A., </em>758 <em>F.Supp. </em>1166, 1168 (W.D.Tex.1991). Finally, whether the claim is asserted in the first instance against the RTC, or made as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>counterclaim in the RTC\u2019s suit, if it seeks a monetary recovery from the assets of the failed institution, the underlying purposes of FIRREA are implicated, and thus the claimant must pursue the administrative remedy under the act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Defendants\u2019 counterclaim not only seeks money damages, but may fairly be read to include a claim of equitable recoupment. Recoupment is the \u201cright of the defendant, in the same action, to cut down ... plaintiff\u2019s demand[.]\u201d <em>Superior Air Products Int'l, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>463, 470 (Tax Ct.), (quoting 20 AmJur.2d <em>Counterclaim, Recoupment, and Setoff, </em>\u00a7 1 at 228 (1965)), <em>affd o.b., </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>238 (App.Div.1988). Recoupment is in the nature of a counterclaim against plaintiff\u2019s demand for a money judgment and is an efficient procedure for settling all the demands of all of the parties in one suit. <em>Superior Air Products Int'l, Inc., </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 470. Recoupment is distinguishable from setoff in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">the latter involves an affirmative recovery on a claim that may be independent of the transaction upon which the plaintiffs claim is based. While recoupment may be utilized only to reduce or extinguish the plaintiffs recovery, setoff may be awarded for any amount to which the defendant is entitled. <em>[Beneficial Fin. Co. of Atlantic City v. Swaggerty, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>602, 609, 432 <em>A.</em>2d 512 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">It may be argued that a claim for a setoff, being an affirmative claim, is barred by FIRREA, but a recoupment is not because it may be \u201cutilized only to reduce or extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s recovery[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the distinction between a setoff and recoupment becomes blurred and of little consequence when the provisions under FIRREA and its underlying purpose are considered. Recoupment clearly is a claim which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>results in \u201ca determination of rights with respect to, the assets of\u201d the failed institution. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D)(i). Additionally, a recoupment would reduce or extinguish an asset held by the receiver and, as persuasively argued by the RTC, would elevate defendants\u2019 claim above other creditors and claimants who have submitted to FIRREA\u2019s administrative procedure. We hesitate to apply an equitable principle, such as recoupment, when its application clashes with the orderly and fair administration of the affairs of a failed institution as detailed by the federal statutory scheme. The counterclaim for recoupment must therefore, at least in the context before us, be deemed a \u201cclaim\u201d subject to the federal administrative procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of an order dismissing defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The RTC's motion to dismiss was addressed only to defendants\u2019 counterclaim. It did not seek to strike defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses, such as equitable fraud and estoppel. During oral argument before us, counsel for the RTC conceded that FIRREA would not bar such affirmative defenses. In view of that concession, we do not address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
