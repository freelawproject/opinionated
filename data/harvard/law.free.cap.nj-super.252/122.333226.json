Vuinovich. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Plaintiff alleged that in 1977 he became a member of the New Jersey National Guard (Guard), and that he re-enlisted several times, ultimately extending his service through November of 1990. In 1987 or 1988, plaintiff was ordered by the Guard to undergo a blood test for antibodies to HIV as part of a mandatory testing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>On March 25, 1988, plaintiff reported for duty at the Teaneck Armory with Company C, 104th Engineer Battalion, and was transported to West Point, New York, for weekend exercises. Late that evening, at West Point, defendant, Sergeant Vuino-vich, called roll during Company formation, but did not call plaintiffs name. When plaintiff inquired why his name had not been called, the sergeant allegedly responded in front of the assembled company members \u201cyou have AIDS and you are discharged.\u201d The mandatory testing had revealed that plaintiffs blood was positive for HIV antibodies. He, however, maintained he was not ill and was able to perform all of his Guard duties. Plaintiff alleged he had received no prior notice of his discharge, although the Guard contends that it forwarded a letter notifying him that he would be transferred to reserve status effective March 8, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Plaintiff alleged that as a result of Vuinovich\u2019s statement, plaintiff spent the night in a tent isolated and shunned, until transported back to New York City the next day. He alleges he has since been excluded from all Guard activities, avoided by friends, and that because of Vuinovich\u2019s statement he believed that he had AIDS and was in imminent danger of death. He maintained that after his return home he continued in fear of imminent death and attempted suicide. Subsequently, plaintiff sought and received advice in a public clinic regarding his health and his HIV antibody status.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Although he cannot satisfy the $1,000 medical expense threshold requirement, plaintiff seeks recovery under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (NJTCA) for damages for emotional distress only. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2; <em>see Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 577, 525 A.2d 287 (1987). Plaintiff urges that under the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 the willful nature of Vuinovich\u2019s conduct and the fact that his statements were outside the scope of his official duties require that his damages claim not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>be barred by the NJTCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0D\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">a. Nothing in this act shall exonerate a public employee from liability if it is established that his conduct was outside the scope of his employment or constituted a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">b. Nothing in this act shall exonerate a public employee from the full measure of recovery applicable to a person in the private sector if it is established that his conduct was outside the scope of his employment or constituted a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">To support his position, plaintiff relies upon <em>Palmentieri v. Atlantic City, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 555 A.2d 752 (Law Div. 1988). In <em>Palmentieri, </em>an Atlantic City councilman helped organize a \u201cBlack Unity\u201d rally, which was sponsored by a private group of citizens. \u201cApproximately 10 to 15 minutes after the rally, [the councilman] was interviewed by ... a reporter[,]\u201d and criticized an Afro-American casino executive stating \u201cwe feel [he] is as racist as the most bigoted white man walking on the face of the earth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. The court held that these comments were not performed within the scope of the councilman\u2019s public duties, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">This statement, however, was a purely personal vilification of a private individual. A public official is generally liable for defamatory statements unless made in discharging his official duties. <em>McQuillan, Municipal Corporations </em>(3 ed.), \u00a7 12.211d. Dorn\u2019s words may have been sought out by the Press only because he was a city councilman, but it stretches the imagination to believe that his statement about [the casino executive] in any way expressed a policy or rationale, fulfilled or discharged a duty, or furthered an interest of the City of Atlantic City. <em>[Id. </em>at 438-39, 555 A.2d 752],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Accordingly, the Law Division judge concluded that the city was not permitted to indemnify or defend the councilman in the defamation action. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 555 A.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In this case, plaintiff argues that the way in which Sergeant Vuinovich informed him that he had been discharged because of his HIV status demonstrates it was a malicious act, clearly outside the scope of his employment. However, based upon our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>careful review of the facts, we conclude that the sergeant was acting within the scope of his employment when he informed the plaintiff of his military status. Sergeant Vuinovich did not himself discharge plaintiff; rather, an official Guard order, dated March 1, 1988, listed plaintiffs name as a member of the Guard who had been \u201cdischarged from the Army National Guard and assigned to component indicated on day following effective date.\u201d When plaintiff asked the sergeant why plaintiff\u2019s name had not been called at roll call during a Company formation at West Point, the sergeant, while in uniform and acting in his official capacity, responded to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The sergeant\u2019s statements may have been unwise; however, it is clear that he was answering a question of a subordinate military person while engaged in his duties as a Guard officer. The public official in <em>Palmentieri </em>made defamatory statements to the press while he was engaged in a rally sponsored by a private organization. The councilman also made statements to further the interests of a private organization, whereas Sergeant Vuinovich was on duty and furthering Guard business when he answered plaintiff\u2019s direct inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiff mistakenly relies upon <em>Marion v. Borough of Manasquan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 329, 555 A.2d 699 (App.Div.1989) for the proposition that damages may be awarded to plaintiff under the NJTCA. In <em>Marion, </em>plaintiffs brought an action against the municipality and individual officers for unlawfully arresting and detaining them. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 555 A.2d 699. There, we concluded that the individual officers could be held liable for unlawful detention even though a claim against the borough would fail. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 555 A.2d 699. However, this result was compelled by the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3, which specifically denies immunity to public employees for false arrest or false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Plaintiff argues that Sergeant Vuinovich\u2019s willful public disclosure of plaintiff\u2019s HIV status is an actionable cause of action for: (1) defamation, (2) public disclosure of private facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>or (3) intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress. Relying on <em>Doe v. Borough of Barrington, </em>729 <em>F.Supp. </em>376 (D.N.J.1990), plaintiff argues that HIV-related information must be held in confidence as part of a citizen\u2019s right to privacy absent a compelling governmental interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, plaintiff quotes <em>Woods v. White, </em>689 <em>F.Supp. </em>874, 877 (W.D.Wis.1988), <em>affd, </em>899 F.2d 17 (7 th Cir.1990), for the proposition that \u201cit would have been clear to a competent public official in 1986 that individuals had a constitutional right to privacy in information relating to AIDS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff argues that Sergeant Vuinovich acknowledged that HIV-related information was supposed to be held in confidence and, therefore, asserts that Vuinovich\u2019s statement could \u201conly be interpreted as a wanton and malicious comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Jorden v. National Guard Bur., </em>799 F.2d 99 (3d Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, Sajer v. Jorden, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>815, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>66, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>30 (1987), the court examined whether National Guard officers enjoyed immunity from liability for civil damages. <em>Id. </em>at 100-01. The plaintiff had \u201cbrought a civil rights suit ... alleging that his various supervisors had engaged in a conspiracy to harass him and to discharge him on the basis of race____ Specifically, he asserted claims for damages under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983, \u00a7 1985 and \u00a7 1986 against ... both his military officers and his civilian supervisors, [including] a pendent state common law claim of defamation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. The <em>Jorden </em>court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">The clear implication of <em>Chappell [Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>296, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983)] is that <em>while some non-damage constitutional claims involving the military remain viable, damage claims do not. </em>The <em>Stanley [Stanley v. United States, </em>574 <em>F.Supp. </em>474 (S.D.Fla.1983), <em>affd, </em>786 <em>F.2d </em>1490 (11th Cir.1986)] court\u2019s approach would frequently require courts to make difficult and hair-splitting distinctions as to whether a particular claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>was the sort that, if legally actionable, would threaten military discipline. This approach seems questionable as a matter of policy. In any event, we simply do not read <em>Chappell as sanctioning this kind of case-by-case approach.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">We thus believe that the Supreme Court was <em>laying down a general rule barring damages actions by military personnel against superior officers for constitutional violations, rather than authorizing a fact-specific inquiry. [Id. </em>at 107-08 (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In <em>Egloffv. New Jersey Air Nat. Guard, </em>684 <em>F.Supp. </em>1275, 1282 (D.N.J.1988), the court concluded that <em>Jorden </em>applies to state claims, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">They argue that the legal and logical underpinnings of <em>Jorden </em>suggest its application to suits for damages brought under state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">We are inclined to agree. In addition to bringing federal civil rights actions against his superiors in the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, the plaintiff in <em>Jorden </em>also asserted \u201ca pendant state common law claim of defamation.\u201d 799 \u00cd12d at 102. The Third Circuit dismissed this cause of action, \"in light of the recent decisions of the [Supreme] Court restricting the availability of damage actions against the military.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, n. 12. Specifically, the <em>Jorden </em>court was referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>296, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2362, 76 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>586 (1983). There, the Supreme Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxL\">The special nature of military life\u2014the need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel\u2014would be undermined by a judicially created remedy exposing officers to personal liability at the hands of those they are charged to command. Here, ... we must be \u201ceoncern[ed] with the disruption of \u2018[t]he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors\u2019 that might result if the solder were allowed to hale his superiors into Court\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">462 <em>U.S. </em>at 304, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2367, <em>quoting Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>666, 676, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2054, 2060, 52 L.Ed.2d 665 (1977). Additionally, the court in <em>Jorden </em>was aware, as are we, of an earlier Third Circuit case, <em>Jaffee v. United States, </em>663 <em>F.2d </em>1226 (3d Cir.1981) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>972, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2234, 72 L.Ed.2d 845 (1982), which held that the established doctrine of military immunity precluded state causes of action against federal military officers, because \u201c[s]uits founded on state law have the same potential for undermining military discipline as federal tort claims.\u201d 663 <em>F.2d </em>at 1239.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">Consistency with these authorities, we believe, requires the court to hold that plaintiffs\u2019 damages claims against their Air National Guard founded upon state law for actions which allegedly transpired while plaintiffs were participants in military training pursuant to Title 32 of the United States Code are barred by the military immunity doctrine. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 outstanding pendant state law actions against the individual defendants are dismissed. <em>[Id. </em>at 1282-83],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">We are convinced that the reasoning of the federal courts upholding the doctrine of military immunity has impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>tant application here. <em>Accord Phillips v. State Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>235, 248, 486 A.2d 318 (1985) (\u201cAs a general proposition officers who, within the scope of their duty, direct soldiers are not liable to them for resultant injuries.\u201d) The statements of a superior officer uttered during the course of exercising official functions or duties should not be subjected to review and imposition of liability based upon mere inferences that might suggest ill-will or intentional violations of privacy rights. <em>Cf id. </em>To permit such official activities to be subjected to civilian scrutiny and claims for damages on a case-by-case basis would threaten military discipline and place in jeopardy the public\u2019s right to be adequately protected by its militia. <em>Accord Jorden, </em>799 F.2d at 107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Plaintiff also argues that his complaint stated valid \u00a7 1983 claims against all defendants that should not have been dismissed. He urges that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that because the Guard only implemented United States Army regulations it did not violate either state law or the State or Federal Constitutions was erroneous. Plaintiff urges that even if the Guard is an alter ego of the State for the purpose of immunizing the Guard from damage claims, claims for injunctive relief remain viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We first note that Counts VI and VII, which concern \u00a7 1983 violations of constitutional rights, address only the \u201cGuard.\u201d Although those counts specifically incorporate \u201cparagraphs 2 through 6, inclusive, and, 9 through 13, inclusive, and 24\u201d of the complaint, these enumerated paragraphs do not include allegations against defendant Vuinovich, but only allege violations by \u201cthe Guard, operating under color of state law[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1983, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">Every <em>person </em>who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceedings for redress. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia. [42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983 (1976) (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 <em>U.S. 58, </em>109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2304, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>45 (1989), the United States Supreme Court examined the issue of \u201cwhether a State, [specifically the Department of State Police] or an official of the State while acting in his or her official capacity <em>is a \u2018person\u2019 </em>within the meaning of ... 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2305, 105 L.Ed.2d at 50-51 (Emphasis added). The Supreme Court held that a state and its officials are not persons for purposes of imposing liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 71,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2311-12, 105 L.Ed.2d at 58. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">[T]he intent of Congress to provide a remedy for unconstitutional state action does not without more include the sovereign States among those persons against whom \u00a7 1983 actions would lie. Construing \u00a7 1983 as a remedy for \u201cofficial violation of federally protected rights\u201d does no more than confirm that the section is directed against state action\u2014action \u201cunder color of\u201d state law. It does not suggest that the State itself was a person that Congress intended to be subject to liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">... We find nothing substantial in the legislative history that leads us to believe that Congress intended that the word \u201cperson\u201d in \u00a7 1983 included the States of the Union. And surely nothing in the debates rises to the clearly expressed legislative intent necessary to permit that construction. <em>[Id. </em>at 68-69, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2310, 105 L.Ed.2d at 56],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">We conclude that neither the State of New Jersey nor the Guard can be sued for damages in a \u00a7 1983 action as the Guard is an alter ego of the State and both must be deemed <em>not </em>to be \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>Id.; see Hilliard v. New Jersey Army Nat\u2019l Guard, </em>527 <em>F.Supp. </em>405, 409 (D.N.J. 1981). In <em>Will, </em>the Court concluded that the Michigan State Police and the State of Michigan were <em>not </em>\u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>Will, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 71, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2311-12, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 58. <em>Will, </em>therefore, \u201cestablishes that the State and <em>arms of the State, </em>which have traditionally enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, are not subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 in either federal court or state court.\u201d <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>356,-, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2430, 2437, 110 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>332, 346 (1990) (Emphasis added). Federal courts have traditionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>afforded eleventh amendment immunity to state national guard units and national guard officers. <em>Meadows v. State of Ind., </em>854 <em>F.2d </em>1068 (7th Cir.1988) (holding that \u00a7 1983 suit by former members of Indiana National Guard barred by eleventh amendment); <em>Hefley v.

We recognize that eleventh amendment protection has no applicability to actions brought in state courts; however, the relationship between a state and its agencies remains the same. <em>See Hefley, </em>713 F.2d at 1493 (specifically holding that the Kansas National Guard \u201cis an arm of the state____\u201d). <em>Accord Henry v.

However, even if plaintiff is considered handicapped within the definition of \u201cphysically handicapped\u201d under the NJLAD, and even if Guard members are \u201cemployees\u201d under the NJLAD, we nonetheless are convinced that plaintiffs claim under the NJLAD must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Plaintiffs discharge and transfer from active duty to the standby reserve was compelled by Department of the Army Regulation 600-110. The Guard, as part of the United States Military, was required to take the very action complained of by plaintiff. <em>See </em>10 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 811; <em>Perpich v.

Further, not only the Guard, but also the courts of this State would be powerless to prevent the defendants from acting in accordance with the federal regulation concerning HIV testing as such state court action would violate the Supremacy Clause of the <em>U.S. Const. </em>art.
