The trial court then merged defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault upon George Brown and Darren Burgess under the Fifth Count with his conviction for aggravated assault by pointing a firearm at or in the direction of George Brown and Darren Burgess under the Sixth Count and committed defendant to the custody of the Commissioner for a term of 18 months with an 18-month period of parole ineligibility, which sentence was to run concurrently with the sentences imposed under the Third and Fourth Counts, and assessed a $30 VCCB penalty for both the Fifth Count and Sixth Count. Finally, the trial court committed defendant to a concurrent term of four years with a three-year period of parole ineligibility and as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>sessed a $30 VCCB penalty for unlawful possession of a weapon without first having obtained a permit to carry the same under the Twelfth Count. The aggregate sentence imposed upon defendant, therefore, was seven years with a three-year period of parole ineligibility and a total VCCB penalty of $150.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Thereafter, the trial court, apparently concluding that the sentence was illegal under <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>308 (1986), resentenced defendant separately with respect to each of the persons assaulted under the Third and Fifth Counts. The same terms that had previously been imposed were imposed as to each victim and the aggregate term of the amended sentence was still seven years with a three-year period of parole ineligibility and a total VCCB penalty of $150. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his convictions or, alternatively, a modification of his sentences on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">I. THE COURT SHOULD HAVE CHARGED THE JURY ON SELF-DEFENSE AND ITS FAILURE TO DO SO WAS HARMFUL ERROR MANDATING THAT THE CONVICTION BE REVERSED AND THE CASE BE REMANDED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">A.

The Trial Court\u2019s Failure To Charge The Jury On Self-Defense Constitutes Harmful Error Requiring That The Convictions Be Reversed And The Case Be Remanded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>II.

Further comment, however, is appropriate with respect to some of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">A review of the record convinces us that the trial court properly refused to charge self-defense because the facts do no indicate even the possibility that defendant shot the victims in self-defense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">Use of force justifiable for protection of the person. Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 2C:3-9, the use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-17\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-l(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cjustification is an affirmative defense.\u201d To justify the use of force, the actor must reasonably believe that force is necessary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4(a). <em>See State v. Hipplewith, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>300, 316, 164 <em>A.</em>2d 481 (1960). The affirmative defense of self-defense will not lie unless defendant possesses an actual, honest belief in the necessity of using force. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178,198, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). <em>See State v. Burks, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 604, 506 A.2d 779 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-18\">Honesty alone, however, does not suffice. A defendant claiming the privilege of self-defense must also establish that her belief in the necessity to use force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>was reasonable. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mellillo, </em>77 <em>N.J.L. </em>505 [71 <em>A. </em>671] (E. &amp; A.1908); <em>State v. Mark Len, </em>108 <em>N.J.L. </em>439, 440 [158 <em>A. </em>749] (Sup.Ct.1932). <em>[Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 478 A.2d 364],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> It is not imperative that actual necessity exist to act in self-defense. But, \u201cthe privilege of self-defense does not exist where the defendant\u2019s action is not prompted by a belief in its necessity.\u201d <em>Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 478 A.2d 364. What is reasonable is not measured by what defendant found reasonable, but rather it is measured by an objective standard. <em>State v. Bess, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>10, 16-17, 247 A.2d 669 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In considering a request to charge a jury on self-defense, the court must examine both the defendant\u2019s and the State\u2019s case to determine if any evidence supporting a claim of self-defense was provided during the trial. <em>State v. Abbott, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>63, 72, 174 A.2d 881 (1961). As the Supreme Court in <em>Abbott </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">There has been some uncertainty in the language of our cases upon the burden of proof with respect to self-defense. The decisions are treated in <em>State v. Chiarello, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479 [174 A.2d 506] (1961), where the Appellate Division correctly said that although the burden is upon a defendant to adduce evidence to support the defense, yet if such evidence appears either in the State\u2019s case or upon the defendant\u2019s case, the issue must be left to the jury with this instruction: that the burden is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is untrue, and hence there must be an acquittal if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant did act in self-defense within the definition of that defense, [/d],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">It is generally accepted that one who provokes or initiates an assault cannot escape criminal liability by invoking self-defense as a defense to a prosecution arising from the injury done to another. The right to self-defense is only available to one who is without fault. <em>State v. Agnesi, </em>92 <em>N.J.L. </em>53, 104 A. 299 (Sup.Ct.1918), <em>affd, </em>92 <em>N.J.L. </em>638, 106 A. 893 (E. &amp; A.1919). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(2) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this section unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm; nor is it justifiable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(a) <em>The actor, </em>with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, provoked <em>the use of force against himself in the same </em>encounter____ [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>But, if after commencing the assault, the aggressor withdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces in some way to his adversary his intention to retire, he is restored to his right of self-defense. Thus, the aggressor must abandon the fight, withdraw and give notice to his adversary. 2 C. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 193 (14th ed. 1979); 6A C.J.S. <em>Assault &amp; Battery </em>\u00a7 91 (1975). As our Supreme Court stated in <em>State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 628, 532 A.2d 215 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\"><em>Generally, \"in order for a killer to have a perfect self-defense to homicide, he or she must: (1) be free from fault in bringing on the conflict with his or her adversary; </em>and (2) reasonably, though not necessarily correctly, believe (a) that his adversary will, unless forcibly prevented, immediately inflict upon him or her a fatal or serious bodily injury, and (b) that the deadly force must be used upon the adversary to prevent him or her from inflicting such an injury.\u201d [quoting W. LaPave and A. Scott, Jr., <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>583 (1972) (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Here, the evidence did not warrant a charge of self-defense. First, under defendant\u2019s alibi, a self-defense charge is not warranted by the facts. Defendant testified that he did not have a gun the night that Brown, Burgess and Bolden were shot. Furthermore, defendant testified that after his encounter with Peart, he left the area and went to a girlfriend\u2019s home. While standing outside of the girlfriend\u2019s house, defendant contends that he saw a group of people, none of whom he could identify, and heard a gun shot. Defendant testified that he did not see anyone with a gun and that he did not know he had been shot until he arrived home. Defendant\u2019s alibi testimony clearly states that defendant did not use any force that evening. Therefore, the first prong of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4(a), \u201cthe actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary,\u201d is not met, and thus, the trial court properly refused to charge self-defense on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Second, George Brown\u2019s testimony indicates that if anything, defendant was the aggressor in this incident. Brown testified that defendant pulled a gun on Peart and \u201cshot it towards the ground____almost near [Burgess] and [Peart].\u201d Clearly, such force was not immediately necessary to protect defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the verbal argument that he and Peart were engaged in. Thus, at this point, self-defense is not a viable defense for defendant. Defendant then left the scene. Brown testified that the group then walked down Bayview Avenue after defendant. Brown did not indicate how they happened upon defendant, Brown testified only that he was shot by defendant. However, Burgess testified that defendant jumped out of an alleyway with the gun drawn demanding to know if they were looking for him. Brown stated that neither he nor Burgess had a gun and that he did not see Bolden with a gun. Thus, at this point, defendant was the aggressor, and there was still no reasonable need for defendant to use force.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Despite defendant\u2019s urging that Brown\u2019s testimony sets forth a viable claim of self-defense, just the opposite is true. Brown testified that defendant had a gun in his hand pointing down at the ground near Brown. Clearly defendant was the aggressor. Further, Brown testified that at first, when defendant pointed the gun in his direction, he thought defendant was going to kill him. So, Brown put his hand in his jacket to scare defendant, and then, defendant shot him. Brown\u2019s testimony demonstrates that defendant was the aggressor in this encounter, thereby negating the defense of self-defense. As our Supreme Court said in <em>State v. Bowens, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 628, 532 A.2d 215, to have a claim of self-defense, the aggressor must be free from fault. Here, defendant was not free from fault. Defendant precipitated the incident by carrying a gun and pointing it at the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Piecing together all of the evidence in this case, it still depicts defendant as the aggressor. Burgess testified that after the group started to walk down Bayview, defendant jumped out of a dark alleyway pointing a gun at them. It appears that defendant retreated so that he could lie in wait and ambush the victims. Brown never saw any of the victims with a gun. Brown did not testify that he or the other victims tried to strike or injure defendant prior to or during the period that defendant shot the victims. Defendant, not the victims, initiated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>conflict. Brown testified that he put his hand in his jacket pocket because at first, he was afraid that defendant would kill him. This testimony indicates that at the time of the shooting, Brown feared for his life and that only in retrospect did he think that defendant did not want to kill him. Furthermore, because the only person with a gun was defendant, any belief that defendant may have had that he was in immediate danger was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Based on the proofs, no reasonable jury could find that defendant was not the aggressor or that defendant reasonably believed that he had to shoot three people to protect himself from unlawful force. As Brown\u2019s testimony shows, defendant shot three people so that they would \u201cback off,\u201d not because the victims, used unlawful force against him. Thus, the claim of self-defense is not available to defendant, and, consequently, the trial court properly refused to charge self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Defendant also challenges his sentence. He contends that the sentence is manifestly excessive and that the trial court erred in its application and findings with respect to the aggravating factors and its assessment of the mitigating factors. He claims essentially that the trial court should have sentenced him to a term appropriate to a crime one degree lower than that of the crimes for which he was convicted, or alternatively, should have found that a preponderance of the mitigating factors existed and imposed a minimum sentence allowable under the law for a second degree offense. He urges us to modify the sentence downward to a term of between three and five years. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Technically, in finding an aggravating factor under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(2), reference to \u201cthe serious consequences of the injuries, both serious and permanent, which were inflicted upon the victims here\u201d could be considered double counting of aggravating factors. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(2) deals with the gravi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ty and seriousness of the harm inflicted on the victim. Clearly, the seriousness of bodily injury was an element of the offense of second degree aggravated assault under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l) and could not properly have been counted as an aggravating factor. Nonetheless, the sentence complied with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice and resulted from the trial court\u2019s otherwise correct analysis and weighing of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. For example, the trial court properly found <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(l) as an aggravating factor. This finding is amply supported by the proofs at the trial. According to the proofs defendant pointed the gun at Victor Peart and defendant shot Burgess and Brown. The jury convicted defendant of recklessly shooting one victim and knowingly and purposely shooting the other victim. Defendant must have contemplated that his conduct would cause serious harm to the victims. The evidence indicated that defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional in at least one of the shootings. Furthermore, defendant shot and threatened to shoot unarmed individuals. Therefore, there is evidential support for the aggravating factor that the crime \u201cwas committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Similarly, the trial court properly found <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(9) as an aggravating factor. The trial court properly determined that \u201cthere was a need to deter or discourage the defendant and others from violating the law.\u201d There is substantial evidential support for that determination. Defendant, even at sentencing, denied any involvement in the three shootings. However, in his presentence report statement to the case supervisor, defendant stated that \u201c[t]he shooting wasn\u2019t what it seemed to be. It wasn\u2019t because of a drug deal or anything. As a matter of fact, the guys wanted me to buy drugs from them, but I didn\u2019t want [to] so we had an argument. The argument got out of hand and then I got the gun. I realize that having the argument didn\u2019t give me the right to shoot anyone.\u201d Further, a jury convicted defendant of a number of crimes all involving a gun. Defendant\u2019s consistent denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>involvement and his lack of remorse indicate that a prison sentence is necessary to deter defendant from similar conduct in the future, and therefore, the trial court properly found aggravating factor <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(9). Finally, of course, the trial court properly found <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44~la(3) as an aggravating factor because there is a risk that defendant will commit another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On the other hand, the trial court found only one mitigating factor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(7), based on defendant\u2019s not having a history of prior delinquency or criminal activity. The trial court was not compelled to find other mitigating factors even though it was made aware that defendant \u201cdid not contemplate that his conduct would cause serious harm\u201d, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(2); that \u201cdefendant acted under strong provocation\u201d, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(3); that \u201cthere were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant\u2019s conduct, though failing to establish a defense\u201d, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(4); that the \u201cvictim of the defendant\u2019s conduct induced or facilitated its commission\u201d, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(5); that the \u201ccharacter and attitude of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another offense\u201d, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(9); and that \u201c[t]he imprisonment of the defendant would entail excessive hardship to himself or his dependents.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(ll). The trial court determined that these other mitigating factors did not exist, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The trial court\u2019s analysis and weighing of the relevant aggravating factors and the one mitigating factor are supported by the record. The aggravating factors substantially outweighed the one mitigating factor and, therefore, the trial court properly imposed the seven-year term with a three-year period of parole ineligibility. Moreover, a parole ineligibility term was mandated by the <em>Graves </em>Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c. In sum, the sentence imposed upon defendant was neither manifestly excessive nor unduly punitive. It does not represent a miscarriage of justice or shock the judicial conscience. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400-01, 555 A.2d 559 (1989); <em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 387-88, 393-94, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and order for commitment under review are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The sentencing transcript reveals that the trial court assessed a $30 Violent Crimes Compensation Board (VCCB) penalty for each of the five counts for which defendant was convicted, for a total VCCB penalty of $150. However, the judgment of conviction and order for commitment sets forth that defendant was assessed a total VCCB penalty of $180. Where there is a discrepancy between the trial court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the sentence described in the judgment of conviction, the transcript of the trial judge\u2019s remarks controls. This discrepancy should be corrected by the trial court and an appropriate amendatory judgment entered. <em>State v.
