Fane, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>528, 362 A.2d 1 (1976), <em>overruled 87 N.J. </em>146, 432 A.2d 881 (1981), in which a divided court had upheld the old rule that an abutting landowner was not liable for pedestrian injuries sustained by reason of the poor condition of a sidewalk. The new <em>Stewart </em>rule, however, was limited to commercial landowners. The Court expressly reserved the question whether the same duty and public considerations apply to residential abutting owners. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 159, n. 6, 432 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In <em>Hambright v. Yglesias, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 395, 491 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1985), we recognized that under <em>Stewart, </em>\u201c[C]om-monly accepted definitions of \u2018commercial\u2019 and \u2018residential\u2019 property should apply,\u201d and that \u201c[f]or example, apartment buildings would be \u2018commercial\u2019 properties covered by the rule.\u201d <em>Stewart, supra, 87 N.J. </em>at 160, n. 7, 432 A.2d 881. We held in <em>Hambright </em>that a two-family residential dwelling operated by an off-premises owner solely as a business venture was a commercial property within the meaning of <em>Stewart. </em>We expressed no opinion as to the result where an owner occupied part of a similar two-family house.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In <em>Borges v. Hamed, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 589 A.2d 169 (App.Div.1991), we affirmed a Law Division judgment which declined to extend the <em>Stewart </em>rule to a three-family residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>building in which the owners occupied one apartment, and other members of the same family occupied the remaining apartments. <em>See Borges v. Hamed, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358, 589 A.2d 199 (Law Div.1990), <em>affd, Borges v. Hamed, supra. </em>We expressed no view on the result had defendants lived in one apartment and rented the other two at market rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Since <em>Stewart, </em>the Supreme Court has further defined and restricted the limited scope of its residential exception by holding that a non-profit charitable and religious organization was not exempted from the duty owed to non-beneficiary pedestrians to maintain abutting sidewalks. <em>Brown v. St. Venantius School, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>325, 544 A.2d 842 (1988). Later, in <em>Gilhooly v. Zeta Psi Fraternity, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 578 A.2d 1264 (Law Div.1990), a sidewalk case in which the defendant fraternity\u2019s property was used both as a residence and as a social club for all members (resident, non-resident and alumni), the Law Division judge interpreted <em>Brown </em>to hold that \u201cwhere property is partially commercial and partially non-commercial the former will take precedence in the application of the rule in <em>Stewart.\u201d Id. </em>at 205, 578 A.2d 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We believe that the <em>Gilhooly </em>approach to hybrid residential/non-residential properties partially misinterprets the <em>Brown </em>rationale. As we read <em>Brown, </em>its weighing of policy considerations was ultimately resolved entirely on the grounds that there simply was no residential use of the property, and that its charitable use was not crucial in balancing the interests of the injured party against that of the abutting owner except as to a beneficiary of the charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Thus, in the hybrid case here presented, it is necessary for us to address the issue expressly reserved in <em>Hambright </em>and <em>Borges: </em>what should be the result where the owner resides in a two- or three-family residence which abuts the sidewalk in question? The policy considerations which are set forth at length in <em>Stewart, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 154-157, 432 A. 2d 881 and <em>Brown, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 330-335, 544 A.2d 842, were substantially linked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>with a balancing approach which resulted in the Court\u2019s conclusion that commercial and other non-residential entities are more readily able to pass on to their users the added costs associated with sidewalk liability. This rationale includes owners of apartment houses and of non-owner-occupied smaller residential buildings operated for revenue purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Until and unless the Legislature or the Supreme Court abolishes the residential exception, however, we hold that the same applicable considerations of balance and ability to pass along cost require that the residential sidewalk exception be continued for owner-occupants whose residency is established to be the predominant use. Some clear-cut examples may better illustrate this holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">(1) The owner of a residence lives only during the summer months in a small apartment on the third floor of a ten room house otherwise entirely leased year-round to an unrelated tenant paying market rent. Such an arrangement is predominantly for commercial benefit of the owner, and would fall within <em>Stewart, </em>as interpreted in <em>Hambright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">(2) The owner-occupant lives year-round in a residence, but supplements income by leasing a small guest apartment to summer residents or to students. The area leased is a small portion of the total area, and the income, while at market levels, similarly offsets only a small portion of the annual carrying costs of the house. Such an arrangement would be predominantly residential, and the house would thus fall within the exception recognized in <em>Stewart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Closer cases than those set forth in these extreme examples will, of course, arise. However, consideration of the factors of extent of income and extent of non-owner occupancy in terms of time and space, should enable a trial judge to determine whether the owner\u2019s residential occupancy preponderates. Where there are factual disputes respecting these factors, or where their weight is unclear, these will require resolution by a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the judgment below must be reversed and remanded in order to permit exploration of the predominance of use issue by motion or trial, as deemed appropriate by the trial judge under the above guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">There appears to be some dispute respecting whether the portions of the premises available for lease were occupied at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
