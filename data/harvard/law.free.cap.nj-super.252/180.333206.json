Defendant appeals the award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">On September 5, 1984, plaintiff, Specialized Medical Systems, and defendant, Doctor Luc J. Lemmerling, entered into an agreement whereby plaintiff sold a computer and related hardware and software to defendant to expedite billing, accounting and patient treatment. Subsequently, in May and June of 1985, the parties entered into maintenance agreements for hardware and software respectively. The total purchase price of the package was $35,533.00, with separate monthly payments to be made on each maintenance contract. The Hardware Maintenance Agreement contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">In the event of litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend any term or provision of this agreement, the losing party shall pay to the prevailing parly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>all costs and expenses of such litigation or proceedings including attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">As time passed the relationship between plaintiff and defendant deteriorated. Defendant claimed that plaintiff had failed to fulfill its obligations to service the equipment, which did not perform to defendant\u2019s satisfaction. Unable to resolve their differences, defendant stopped all payment on the contracts and plaintiff instituted a collection action. Defendant counterclaimed, alleging fraud, breach of warranties and violations of the New Jersey consumer fraud law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>and the Magnuson-Moss Act, 15 <em>U.S.C. </em>2301 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Plaintiff brought suit claiming $9,600.00 in damages. Defendant\u2019s counterclaim was dismissed. The judge concluded that the defense was \u201cabsolutely unjustified.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff which was embodied in a judgment on May 30, 1990 for $4,422.26 plus pre-judgment interest aggregating the $5,776.99. Only $750.00 of the verdict related to the breach of the Hardware Maintenance Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">On September 28, 1990 plaintiff applied to the court for attorney's fees as authorized in the Hardware Maintenance Agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taking into account that the award \u201cshould be discounted\u201d because of \u201cexpenditures not involving the Hardware Maintenance Agreement,\u201d plaintiff asked for an award of $15,000, noting that the bulk of the work was directed to plaintiffs defense against the counterclaim (which if defendant prevailed could have resulted in treble damages). Plaintiff acknowledged that the provision for attorney's fees was embodied only in the Hardware Maintenance Agreement and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>other two agreements had no similar provision. However, plaintiff noted that the alleged breach of the Hardware Maintenance Agreement constituted a significant part of defendant\u2019s entire counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Defendant argued that any award had to be limited to the services directed exclusively to the claim and defense related to the Hardware Maintenance Agreement since only that agreement contained the attorney fee provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant further claimed plaintiff\u2019s attorney took the case on a contingency and therefore counsel fees had to be limited to the agreed percentage of recovery. Defendant also contended that the efforts of plaintiff\u2019s counsel directed to the counterclaim were irrelevant because plaintiff\u2019s attorney had told defendant\u2019s counsel that plaintiff would not be charged a fee on the counterclaim, since plaintiff\u2019s president was \u201ca personal friend of mine.\u201d Defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cIt is undisputed ... that [plaintiffs president] individually or his company ... did not have an agreement to pay hourly rates to the attorney, did not have any expectation to pay an hourly rate to its attorney and, in fact, if your Honor does not award attorney\u2019s fees in this case, these firms will not pursue Specialized Medical Systems or [its president] for those attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, while not disputing those facts or the \u201ccontingency basis\u201d, responded that his adversary was \u201cdisplac[ing] the contractual intent of the parties which is clear in this where they agree that in enforcing or defending a claim that arises under their particular contract they would pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d He further said \u201c[t]here was always an expectation as we pled from Day-I in this case that we would be seeking reasonable attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the contract.\u201d Judge Leo Yanoff, the trial judge, held that the terms of the contract regarding attorney\u2019s fees were clear in that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>referred to \u201cthe costs of litigation\u201d, including \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d and that there was an understanding or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">agreement between the lawyer and the plaintiff [for payment of] a percentage of collection plus: \u2018We won\u2019t charge you if we have to defend on the counterclaim\u2019 but implicit in that was: If we can get some payment for our services under the contract, we get that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Further, he found an agreement not to charge plaintiff but an understanding that \u201cif I can collect some other way,\u201d such as under the contract, he would. Furthermore, the judge found that trying to separate the original agreements made by the parties or the costs attached to prosecuting or defending each claim was not possible. Judge Yanoff therefore awarded plaintiff $7,500.00 in counsel fees based on the Hardware Maintenance Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Before us, defendant contends that the plaintiff may only recover attorney\u2019s fees that it has paid or is obligated to pay. Defendant claims that an award of attorney\u2019s fees should \u201creflect the plaintiff's actual obligation\u201d and that therefore the maximum award is only one-third of the plaintiff\u2019s actual recovery under the Hardware Maintenance Agreement because that was all plaintiff was obligated to pay its counsel. Defendant also argues that the contractual obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees may only be enforced if the plaintiff actually contracted to pay for an attorney. Defendant claims that since counsel for plaintiff was a personal friend of its president, and as counsel did not intend to accept payment from plaintiff except for the one-third contingency in the event of recovery, plaintiff\u2019s award should be limited to that amount. While these arguments do have some appeal, we agree with Judge Yanoff's conclusions in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">We agree with plaintiff that generally an award of counsel fees cannot be based exclusively on the services and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>expenses related to only one contract when the litigation involves multiple agreements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly the services rendered on a claim can rarely be isolated from those involved in defending a counterclaim. Recently, in <em>Thomas v. Saijwani, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 592 A.2d 247 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. den. </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>390, 599 A.2d 166 (1991), we upheld the award of counsel fees in an action to obtain repayment of a security deposit notwithstanding that most of the costs dealt with plaintiffs defense of a counterclaim. The fee was premised on the statutory right to fees with respect to the claim seeking the return of the security deposit. <em>Thomas </em>dealt with a statutory right to collect counsel fees, whereas here we are dealing with a contractual right. However, that cannot control unless the contract is more specific or narrow than the one with which we deal. The Hardware Maintenance Agreement provided for counsel fees \u201cin the event of litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend any term or provision of [the] agreement\u201d, and this litigation involved enforcement and defense of a term of the agreement. <em>See also Cohen v. Fair Lawn Dairies, Inc. </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 215, 206 A.2d 585 (App.Div.1965), <em>mod. in part o.g., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>450, 210 A.2d 73 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The fact that <em>R. </em>4:42-9 does not expressly provide for counsel fees when authorized by contract does not control. It is true, as defendant suggests, that our Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cbasic approach and philosophy regarding the allowance of counsel fees [is] \u2018that the sound administration of justice is best advanced if litigants bear their own counsel fees,\u2019 \u201d <em>Satellite Gateway Com. v. Musi Dining Car Co., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>280, 285, 540 A.2d 1267 (1988), quoting <em>State, Dept. of Environ. Protect v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 504, 468 A.2d 150 (1983). However, they are recoverable, independent of the Rule, if authorized by a contract or agreement between the parties, <em>Satellite </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Gateway Com. v. Musi Dining Car Co., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 285, 540 A.2d 1267. <em>See also Central Motor Parts v. DuPont, supra </em>(indemnification). Hence, the Court has said that <em>\u201cunless </em>legal fees are authorized by statute, court Rule <em>or contract, </em>they are not recoverable,\u201d <em>Satellite Gateway Com. supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 285, 540 A.2d 1267. (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We must now decide, apparently for the first time in New Jersey, whether the award of counsel fees under the Rule or the contract can be for fees that a party is not obligated to pay his counsel. Here, there is no contest that counsel agreed to represent plaintiff on a contingency of one-third of plaintiff\u2019s recovery under the complaint and to defend the counterclaim without charge. Plaintiff relies on <em>Alcoa Edgewater No. 1 Fed. Credit Union v. Carroll, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>442, 210 A.2d 68 (1965), which held that recovery from defendant of an amount equal to 20% of a note payable as counsel fees was enforceable because of the note provision authorizing same, even though a Rule or statute did not; and this was so even if the plaintiff may have expected to pay its counsel more than 20% for counsel fees. While defendant could only challenge the reasonableness of the fees based on the 20% figure, here the issue does not relate to the contract between the parties but to the agreement between \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d and its counsel. <em>Cf. Cohen v. Fair Lawn Dairies, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216-17, 206 A.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We hold that where the retainer agreement contemplates the possibility of recovery of counsel fees in lieu of payment from the client, counsel may endeavor to collect them even though the client may not be obligated for the entire amount. Our judicial policy has always been to promote representation by not discouraging individuals from \u201cbringing meri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>torious causes of action,\u201d S. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, R. </em>4:42-9 Comment (1991), and we believe that our holding supports that policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Our decision does not promote frivolous litigation because the party who promotes truly frivolous litigation will not prevail. Nor should we promote sham retainer agreements under which the attorney charges an hourly rate or other fee which his client understands he will not be obligated to pay. <em>See R.P. C. </em>1.5. <em>See also R. </em>1:21-7, -7A regarding specific retainer agreements, and note that while <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(l) permits counsel fees in matrimonial actions, <em>R. </em>1:21-7A regarding retainer agreements in such cases expressly provides that no agreement is required \u201cin those cases where no fee is charged for services rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Accordingly, we hold that a prevailing party can collect reasonable counsel fees even though he is not otherwise obligated to pay them to his counsel, at least if the attorney and client understand their retainer agreement to so permit. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-16\">No transcripts of the trial were produced and we must rely upon the trial judge\u2019s findings at the time of the motion, together with the documents in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\">No issue of timeliness of the request has been raised. Defendant claims, however, that counsel fees could not be awarded because they were not included as damages in plaintiffs answers to interrogatories. Defendant's claim would have merit if the counsel fees were themselves sought as an element of damages. <em>Cf. Montefusco Excavating &amp; Contracting Co. v. Middlesex Cty., </em>82 <em>N.J. 519, </em>527-28, 414 A.2d 961 (1980); <em>Penway Property Co., Inc. v. Landau, </em>76 <em>N.J. 595, </em>598, 388 A.2d 1265 (1978); <em>Central Motor Parts v. DuPont, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. 5, </em>596 A.2d 759 (App.Div.1991); S. <em>Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment <em>R. </em>4:42-9 (1991) at 977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Defense counsel said \"I think the limit of the. affirmative claim and in defense of the claim for breach of contract on the hardware maintenance agreement itself is in the range of $6390.00 on the defendant's counterclaim and $750.00 on the plaintiffs affirmative claim.\" Defendant also claimed that plaintiff\u2019s president indicated only $5400.00 damages in his answers to interrogatories. <em>See </em>n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The entire controversy doctrine would prohibit separate actions between the same parties in circumstances like this. <em>See R. </em>4:27-1; 4:30A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The Rule expressly authorizes counsel fees where \"permitted by statute,\" <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(8), but not where provided by contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We recognize that the issue in this case is different than where counsel fees are awarded under a statute which promotes law suits to vindicate public policy. <em>See e.g., Torres v. Attorney General, </em>391 <em>Mass. </em>1, 460 N.E.2d 1032, 1039-40 (1984). Here no statutory authorization for the award of counsel fees was involved. The award was not based on the \u201cfrivolous\u201d nature of the defense or counterclaim, and we do not address that subject. <em>But see R. </em>4:42-9(a)(8); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 15-59.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
