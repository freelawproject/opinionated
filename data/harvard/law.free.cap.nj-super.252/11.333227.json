Defendant, J.Q., who was convicted of a series of sex crimes against his young daughters, N.Q. and C.Q., claims that he was denied a fair trial because of the improper admission of expert testimony which bolstered the credibility of the children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue is the admission of testimony as to the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS), other so-called syndrome evidence and expert opinion that the children\u2019s statements that they had been sexually abused were truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We hold that CSAAS evidence is generally reliable to explain secrecy, belated disclosure and recantation by a child sex abuse victim; that syndrome evidence, including CSAAS, is not reliable to prove the occurrence of sexual abuse, and that absent a question of capacity, a social science expert lacks the qualifications to render an opinion as to the truthfulness of a statement by another witness. Because the expert in this case testified before the jury as to syndrome evidence to prove that sex abuse occurred; opined as to the truthfulness of the children (and their mother), and rendered the opinion that the children were abused based in great measure upon these two interdicted classes of evidence, we are satisfied that the admission of her testimony was error clearly capable of producing an unjust result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus reverse and remand the case for a new trial. In this opinion, we will attempt to distinguish between admissible and inadmissible expert behavioral science evidence in a child sexual abuse case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted on count one of Essex County Indictment No. 3069-7-87 of first-degree aggravated sexual assault upon his daughter, C.Q., then seven years of age,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by vaginal penetration, contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l). On count two, defendant was convicted of fellatio upon C.Q.\u2014also first-degree aggravated assault\u2014 contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l), and on count three, of sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of C.Q., while defendant had a legal duty of caring for her, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4. On counts four, five, six and seven, defendant was convicted of having committed aggravated sexual assault upon his daughter, N.Q., then six years of age,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by vaginal penetration, anal penetration, fellatio and cunnilingus, all contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l). On count eight, defendant was convicted of engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of N.Q., while he had a legal duty of caring for her, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4. Defendant received an aggregate custodial term of 30 years with ten years of parole ineligibility. An appropriate Violent Crimes Compensation Board Penalty was also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Defendant lived with C.W. for approximately nine years. Although they never married, they had two daughters: C.Q. born in 1977, and N.Q., born in 1979. Throughout 1984, the time period covered in the indictment, defendant and C.W. lived with their two daughters in an apartment in Newark, New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Jersey. The parties separated in late 1985 or early 1986. C.W. married \u201cCarlos\u201d in 1985, and defendant has also married since the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Like their separation, the parties\u2019 relationship was acrimonious and even violent\u2014both parties testified that defendant frequently hit C.W. In 1977, defendant had an affair, and C.W. surprised defendant and his paramour in the family apartment. C.W. beat up the woman friend, hit defendant, and according to him, told him she would \u201cmake him pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Defendant and C.W. apparently separated one or more times before the final breakup\u2014in December 1984\u2014according to C.W. because defendant was \u201cfooling around.\u201d Defendant went to Puerto Rico to visit his family. When he returned, C.W. was pregnant, and they argued about whether the child was his. Defendant\u2019s suspicions were confirmed when C.W. testified at trial that J., born in 1985, was not defendant\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The parties finally separated at the end of 1985 or the beginning of 1986, after defendant found C.W. in their apartment with another man. Defendant and C.W. battled until the end. For example, N.Q. and defendant both described an incident where defendant returned to the apartment and hit C.W. in the stomach with a hammer. When he dropped the tool, C.W. retrieved it, and hit him on the head with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Despite the stormy relationship between defendant and C.W., defendant continued to see his daughters from the time of the separation until \u201csometime in 1987\u201d when allegations about sexual misconduct came to light. For a while, defendant took the girls to his apartment in New York every weekend, although the frequency of these visits eventually dropped off and according to C.W., defendant came only \u201cwhen he felt like it.\u201d C.W. explained that she never wanted to keep her daughters away from their father because she had never known her father and did not want the same to happen to N.Q. and C.Q. Indeed, there was some testimony that C.W. insisted that defendant assume some responsibility for N.Q. and C.Q. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>fendant stated that once C.W. came to his apartment to ask why he did not visit the girls. He said she insisted that he take them for the weekends because she was young and needed to go out.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">These visits came to an end when N.Q. and C.Q. disclosed that defendant had committed sexual acts with them. These allegations surfaced \u201csometime in 1987.\u201d C.W. was in her bedroom watching television, and her three daughters were in their bedroom playing, when she heard a loud slap. Her youngest daughter had slapped N.Q. and left a mark on her face. N.Q. was on her knees kneeling over J., and while C.W. at first thought they were just playing \u201chorsey back riding,\u201d J.Q. was crying and said N.Q. tried to pull down her panties and touch her \u201cbutt.\u201d C.W. asked N.Q.: \u201cwho told you to pull someones <em>[sic </em>] panties [?].\u201d At first N.Q. did not want to say but then she stated that \u201cit starts with d,\u201d and finally she said it was d-a-d. C.W. asked her if she meant her stepfather or her real father, and N.Q. replied her father. C.Q. then added that her father did things to her too but they did not want to tell because he threatened to hurt C.W. C.W. told the girls that it was important not to lie and they denied that they were lying. C.W. asked them to use a baby doll to show what had happened to them, and after this she was convinced that they had been sexually abused. C.W. eventually took the children to her doctor, and then to the Division of Youth &amp; Family Services. C.W. also testified that before these disclosures she had noticed that N.Q. had a vaginal discharge, but had attributed it to the child not changing her panties.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">N.Q. and C.Q. both testified at trial, in the judge\u2019s chambers, via closed-circuit television broadcast into the courtroom. N.Q. was eight years old and in second grade when she testified in May 1988. She responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question as to whether she was four or five years old back in 1984, and also replied \u201cyes\u201d when questioned whether there \u201ccame a point in time where your daddy did things that you didn\u2019t like?\u201d She then related that \u201c[h]e put his d-i-c-k in my vagina.\u201d By \u201cd-i-c-k\u201d she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>said she meant his \u201cprivate parts.\u201d She said that this hurt a \u201clittle bit.\u201d He put his \u201cd-i-c-k\u201d in her mouth also, and \u201cmilk\u201d came out of it. In response to whether he ever put anything on his d-i-c-k, she replied that when he was living with her mother he put some kind of chocolate syrup on it and made her lick it off. She also stated that he \u201cfrench kissed\u201d her, which she described as \u201cwhen the guy puts the tongue into a woman\u2019s mouth.\u201d He also put his mouth on her vagina and licked her and put his d-i-c-k in her butt, which hurt her. He also put his finger in her vagina and moved it around. N.Q. stated that he did these things to C.Q. also, and that C.Q. saw him when he did them to her. The incidents occurred while defendant lived with them and their mother, but when her mother was out of the apartment. (At one point, N.Q. also stated that these incidents occurred when she and C.Q. visited defendant in Brooklyn.) She explained that she was not allowed to tell her mother about what was happening because she was afraid her father would hit her and C.Q. and her mother. N.Q. said that she would never lie and that, while she was mad at her father, she had loved him very much before he started doing these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">C.Q., age ten at the time of trial and in fourth grade, also stated that defendant did things to her and her sister N.Q. which they did not like. \u201cHe put his hot dog in our private place.\u201d He put it in \u201ca lot\u201d and it hurt \u201ca little bit.\u201d He also put his penis in her \u201cback part\u201d and this hurt. He put chocolate syrup on his penis and put it in N.Q.\u2019s mouth. Sometimes he would tell one of them to put her mouth on his penis, and he would put his mouth on the vagina of the other. She and N.Q. never told their mother about these acts because they were afraid they would get in trouble and that defendant would hit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">C.Q. stated that after defendant left their apartment to live in Brooklyn, she and N.Q. would go to visit him. They wanted to see him because they loved him, but sometimes he made them go and would give them an \u201cevil look\u201d when he picked them up. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>She insisted, in the face of cross-examination, that her mother did not force her to tell this \u201cstory\u201d about her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">During cross-examination of N.Q. and C.Q., the defense tried to establish that they might have been exposed to sexual activity other than through defendant. For example, N.Q. acknowledged that she sometimes saw the boys in her apartment do \u201cnasty\u201d things to girls in the hallways, and she once saw a boy kissing C.Q. in the basement. C.Q. explained that once her mother sent her out of the room when a movie came on with \u201cnasty things\u201d in it. The movie showed a man putting his penis in a woman\u2019s vagina. She remarked that Carlos usually put an \u201cx\u201d on some movies when he brought them home, but this time he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Dr. Karen Bresnahan, a pediatric resident at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, testified that she had examined N.Q. Bresnahan stated that she had previously examined between 80 and 50 child abuse victims. Bresnahan reported that N.Q.\u2019s hymenal opening was stretched, but there were no lacerations and no evidence of blood or puss. She reported that it was not normal for a child to have a stretched hymen, and explained that the hymenal opening is usually about four millimeters. While she did not record how much N.Q\u2019s. hymen was stretched beyond this, she opined that her finding \u201cmakes one suspicious\u201d that there had been some type of manipulation consistent with sexual abuse. The stretching she observed could result from penetration by penis or finger, although it is possible that a girl could be born either without a hymen or with one with a larger opening than average. The condition could not result from strenuous activity. On the other hand, Bresnahan opined that it is possible that a stretched hymen would be the only physical evidence of penetration by an adult male on a six or seven-year-old girl. Bresnahan concluded that N.Q. had been sexually abused, both because of the physical examination and because N.Q. had told her she had been abused. No medical testimony was presented with respect to C.Q. The parties stipulated that a Dr. Haratounian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>had examined C.Q. and found that she also had a stretched hymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Dr. Madeline Milchman, a Ph.D in clinical psychology, interviewed both C.Q. and N.Q. each for a period of approximately an hour and one-half. She was trained in child sex abuse, has taught psychology at Rutgers, and has published articles on how to determine whether child abuse has occurred. She chairs a subcommittee of the New Jersey Psychological Association which is devoted to conducting research into objective criteria for assessing whether or not a child is making a valid allegation of child sexual abuse. According to Milchman, such objective criteria is being tested in \u201cpilot\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Milchman stated that approximately one-third of her practice \u201cconsists of children who have [been] alleged to have been sexually abused.\u201d In the course of her training, Milchman became familiar with CSAAS, a pattern of behavior \u201cfound to occur again and again in children who are victims of incest.\u201d According to Milchman, it has five components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">[A] pattern of behavior that is found to occur again and again in children who are victims of incest and there are five parts to that. The first part of the pattern is that the children tend to keep the incest a secret. Most people would expect that a child would tell if they had been sexually assaulted but in fact they tell very rarely. Usually the child will keep it a secret and will keep it a secret for a very long period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">The second part of the pattern is helplessness and that has to do with why the child keeps it a secret The third part is entrapment and accommodation and what that means is that the child gets trapped, the child feels helpless, the child is told to keep it a secret. They have been threatened they are afraid that the parent would not love them any more. The parent has more power than the child____ And for that reason they will go along for years and years and years without ever making any disclosure to anybody. What the child does is to accommodate the abuse. That means they adjust to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-13\">A disclosure is usually very delayed and it comes because of something external that has revealed the pattern. That\u2019s the fourth part, the delayed disclosure. And the last part, the fifth part of the pattern is that sometimes the child can go back on it, they will say no I made it up and that\u2019s not true and they will give up____ And those are the five parts of the Sex Abuse Accommodation Syndrome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Milchman concluded that N.Q. suffered from the first four symptoms of CSAAS\u2014secrecy, helplessness, accommodation and delayed disclosure and was a withdrawn child. The only symptom she did not show, according to Milchman, was recantation. Milchman stated that C.Q. also exhibited the first four symptoms of CSAAS although her overt reactions were more outgoing and brash than those of N.Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Milchman stated that some child sex victims become withdrawn while others are more aggressive and that other outward signs of sexual abuse are \u201cbehavior syndromes of trauma, nightmares, falling grades in school, fights with other children, aggression, withdrawal, crying episodes for no apparent reason or for flimsy reasons, any kind of sign of stress, such as anxiety.\u201d She related that N.Q. experienced crying, nightmares and falling grades.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Milchman testified that the childrens\u2019 recitation of the events was consistent with sexual abuse because of its detail. She explained that descriptions of their \u201cfather\u2019s\u201d acts of moving his finger in N.Q.\u2019s vagina, and \u201cfrench kissing,\u201d cannot be learned from watching an X-rated movie or from the \u201cgeneral culture\u201d and that the chocolate syrup story was the type of \u201cconcrete, realistic detail\u201d that supported the truthfulness of the allegation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">As to the method she uses to assess the credibility of child witnesses, Milchman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">One of the things that is very important to look at, in order to tell whether a child has been sexually abused or not when they are saying it is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>child is lying. It\u2019s not real hard to tell whether a child is lying. Anybody who has raised a child has some knowledge about what cues them to whether a child is lying or not. You might look at whether the child appears sincere emotionally. You might look at whether what they are feeling is what they are saying, if they are telling you something frightening happening and they are giggling you are not going to believe them and if they are telling you something frightening happened and they are having a hard time telling you and maybe they are crying and shaking at the same time you are going to be more prone to believe them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">She recapped what she looks for in determining the truthfulness of an alleged child sex victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">Okay, I look for\u2014I look for many different things. I look for whether the child appears to be sincere. I look for whether or not the feeling that they have at the time goes with what they are saying or whether it contradicts what they are saying. I go for whether there are a lot of different behaviors that all point to the same conclusion. For example, is what the child saying, does that match the demonstrations that they give when they try to explain it with their hands or with dolls, does it match the pictures that they draw for me? Does it match what they told the mother; does it match what they told the DYFS worker; does it match what they told the prosecutor or investigator; or does it match what they told me? I look for consistency across a lot of different kinds of behaviors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">In a child who is telling the truth you don\u2019t get every detail the same because that\u2019s the nature of human memory that sometimes we forget one detail or another but you get a broad consistency. A lot of different behaviors all back each other up, they all say the same thing. A child who is lying or being programmed will be the opposite. You will tend to get a consistent verbal statement but if you then say well draw a picture for me they don\u2019t know what they are talking about, they can\u2019t draw a picture that will back it up or you say show it to me on the doll, they don\u2019t know what to do or they do something that looks like something you would see on television, very romantic, very general not specific, concrete details. That\u2019s another thing I look for are there realistic, concrete, specific kinds of details that are not the kinds of things that you would tend to see on a television so that any kid could pick up or any cable t.v. or movie that any kid could just pick up, that what I look for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Milchman was then asked this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">Q. Doctor, based on your examinations of the girls, can you give this jury your expert opinion as to whether or not both C.Q. and N.Q. were sexually abused?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">She answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">A. I believe that they were sexually abused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">On cross-examination, Milchman acknowledged that C.Q. had reported to her that she had once observed defendant and her mother engage in sexual intercourse and that C.Q. told her that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the boys in her apartment building stand around in the hallways and try to \u201cget\u201d girls with \u201cbig breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Milchman acknowledged that other \u201cstressors\u201d in a child\u2019s life could account for helplessness and secrecy she observed in C.Q. and N.Q. Among them were poverty, the jailing of a family member and difficult living conditions. On redirect, Milchman offered her view that C.W. was not forcing the children to make these reports. She thought that, if anything, C.W. under-reacted; she noticed that the children had a vaginal discharge, but never had them examined. N.Q. experienced crying, nightmares, and falling grades, but her mother did not respond to these cues that N.Q. might be experiencing some problems. Further, when Milchman met with C.W., C.W. asked her if children ever made up stories of sex abuse. Milchman did not think this was a woman who was \u201cjumping on\u201d the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s final question to Milchman was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">Defense counsel has gone through a litany of other possible reasons why the children behaved the way they did in terms of being withdrawn or how they could have come up with this other sexual knowledge, despite the possible stresses of living in a poor neighborhood and a poor environment with a lot of people around, despite the fact that they may have seen [C.Q.], may have seen her mother and [J.Q.] copulating once, or may have seen things on TV, is it still your expert opinion that these children were sexually abused?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">She answered \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Defendant testified on his own behalf and denied having any sexual contact with his daughters. He insisted that he loved them very much, and that anyone who would have sex with a child is very sick. Defendant\u2019s brother, his present wife and some of his neighbors testified briefly. The brother stated that he saw C.W. once at defendant\u2019s apartment after they had separated, and that she was asking defendant for money. A neighbor testified that she became acquainted with C.Q. and N.Q. when they began spending weekends at defendant\u2019s apartment, and they seemed happy and glad to be with their father. In his closing statements, defense counsel suggested that the charges here were an outgrowth of C.W.\u2019s vindictive plan to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>take revenge on a man who had betrayed and beat her. Based on the foregoing evidence, defendant was convicted of each count charged in the indictment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Evid.R. </em>56(2) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">(2) A witness, qualified pursuant to Rule 19 as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify in the form of opinion or otherwise as to matters requiring scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge if such testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">After being qualified as an expert, the witness is limited to testimony which is squarely within the area of expertise. <em>State v. Zola, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>384, 423, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988). The proponent of expert testimony must demonstrate that it would \u201cenhance the knowledge and understanding of lay jurors with respect to other testimony of a special nature normally outside of the usual lay sphere.\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 209, 478 A.2d 364 (1984) (quoting <em>State v. Griffin, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 20, 293 A.2d 217 (App.Div.1972)). In addition, the proponent must demonstrate that the expert\u2019s testimony would be reliable. <em>Id. </em>In a new field this can be established in one of three ways: (1) by expert testimony that the scientific premises of the proposed testimony are generally accepted in the appropriate profession; (2) by authoritative scientific and legal writings indicating that the scientific community accepts the premises underlying the proffered testimony; or (3) by judicial opinions that indicate that the expert\u2019s premises have gained general acceptance. <em>Id. </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 478 A.2d 364.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also Ryan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>276, 579 A.2d 1241 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Defendant contends that Milchman\u2019s testimony incorporated an entirely new field of psychological endeavor (CSAAS) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that no effort was made by the prosecutor to demonstrate its reliability pursuant to <em>Kelly. </em>According to defendant, the erroneous admission of this evidence meets the plain error standard of <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The State counters that any error in the procedure pursuant to which Milchman\u2019s testimony was admitted was harmless. While conceding that no record was created to undergird a finding that either of the first two scientific reliability tests of <em>Kelly </em>were met, the State contends that \u201cthe courts of foreign jurisdictions are nearly unanimous in their acceptance of expert testimony on CSAAS in order to explain delayed disclosure or recantation on the part of a complaining witness\u201d thus satisfying the third <em>Kelly </em>test. Neither of these positions is entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The obligation of the proponent of expert evidence to meet the requirements of <em>Evid.R. </em>56(2) and <em>Kelly, </em>exists whether or not an objection to the proffer is advanced and it is the duty of the trial judge to make a preliminary determination that the testimony would indeed enhance the understanding of the lay jurors; that the witness is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training or eduction to render the proffered scientific opinion, and that the expert\u2019s scientific premises are reliable. As defendant correctly points out, that did not occur in this case. However, contrary to defendant\u2019s view, this procedural defect does not, in itself, compel reversal. The issue is whether the evidence, although not established at trial to be so, was, in fact, reliable. According to the State, it can be demonstrated that CSAAS is reliable under the third prong of <em>Kelly </em>thus obviating the possibility that the procedural error in its admission was anything more than harmless. We agree that a portion of Milchman\u2019s CSAAS testimony meets the third prong of <em>Kelly </em>but not all of it. Neither party seems to have recognized that Milchman\u2019s testimony was not a single seamless garment. Rather, it was made up of a number of entirely disparate elements, each subject to distinct analysis resulting in varying conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Because child sexual abuse cases are often difficult to prove, investigators, lawyers and judges have \u201cwith increasing frequency [been] turning to the behavioral and clinical sciences for guidance on issues relevant to the reliability of children\u2019s eyewitness testimony.\u201d Doris, <em>The Suggestibility of Children\u2019s Recollections </em>at xi (J. Doris ed. 1991). Overall, six categories of social science expert testimony have developed and have regularly been proffered by the state to support child witnesses in sexual abuse cases. Bulkley, <em>Social Science Expert Testimony for the Prosecution Regarding Behaviors of Sexually Abused Children: National Trends and Recommendations, </em>American Bar Association Center on Children and the Law, Washington, D.C. (in preparation) [hereinafter Bulkley, <em>Social Science Expert Testimony </em>].</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The first category is \u201crehabilitative\u201d testimony offered to explain puzzling conduct of the child victim (such as delayed reporting, minimization and recantation) to meet a defense attack on the child\u2019s credibility. (One psychiatrist has termed these behaviors as CSAAS. Summit, <em>The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, </em>7 Child Abuse &amp; Neglect 177 (1983) [hereinafter Summit].) The second category is syndrome evidence, including CSAAS evidence, of supposed typical child victim behaviors (for example, depression, anxiety, bedwetting) proffered, not to explain unusual conduct of the child, but to prove affirmatively that sexual abuse has occurred. The third category is a spin-off of the second with the expert testifying to typical behaviors of a child victim specifically related to the child victim in the case. The fourth is expert testimony that the child <em>has </em>been abused and the fifth is testimony that the child is credible. (The sixth category, which has no relevance here, involves profile testimony on the sex offender.) Bulkley, <em>Social Science Expert Testimony, supra, </em>at 3-4. The first five of these categories are involved in this case to one extent or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Milchman testified that CSAAS explained the childrens\u2019 secrecy and delayed reporting; that each child exhibited four out of the five behaviors \u201cfound to occur again and again in children who are victims of incest;\u201d that N.Q. exhibited other outward signs of sexual abuse including crying, nightmares and failing grades; that it was her belief that the children had, in fact, been abused; and, that she believed the children (and C.W.) to be credible. We will address these matters serially.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">CSAAS is a theory of relatively recent vintage. It was first enunciated in 1983. <em>See </em>Summit, <em>supra. </em>In the article, Summit described five characteristics commonly observed in sexually abused children: secrecy, helplessness, accommodation, delayed and unconvincing disclosure and recantation. CSAAS was not intended as a diagnostic device or a test for sexual abuse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is an example of a class of rehabilitative testimony generally viewed as admissible, not to prove that the child has been abused, but to explain certain behaviors of the child victim and to \u201crebut an implied or express assertion by the defense that such behaviors indicate the child is lying.\u201d Bulkley, <em>Social Science Expert Testimony, supra </em>at 4. Its basic purpose is to dispel the idea that secrecy, belated disclosure and/or recantation have the same negative implications in a child abuse case as they would where an offense against an adult is concerned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">If a complaining witness in a burglary trial, after making the initial report, denied several times before testifying at trial that the crime had happened, the jury would have good reason to doubt seriously her credibility at any time. However, in this instance we are concerned with a child who states she has been the victim of sexual abuse by a member of her family. The experts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>testified that in this situation the young victim often feels guilty about testifying against someone she loves and wonders if she is doing the right thing in so testifying. It would be useful to the jury to know that not just this victim but many child victims are ambivalent about the forcefulness with which they want to pursue the complaint, and it is not uncommon for them to deny the act ever happened. Explaining this superficially bizarre behavior by identifying its emotional antecedents could help the jury better assess the witness\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\"><em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 <em>Or. </em>427, 657 P.2d 1215, 1219-20 (1983) (Campbell, J.). In addition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">While jurors may be capable of personalizing the emotions of victims of physical assault generally, and of assessing witness credibility accordingly, tensions unique to the trauma experienced by a child sexually abused by a family member have remained largely unknown to the public. As the expert\u2019s testimony demonstrates the routine indicia of witness reliability\u2014consistency, willingness to aid the prosection, straight-forward rendition of the facts\u2014may, for good reason, be lacking. As a result jurors may impose standards of normalcy on child victim/witnesses who consistently respond in distinctly abnormal fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\"><em>Middleton, </em>294 <em>Or. </em>at 440, 657 P.2d at 1222 (Roberts, J., concurring) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The Supreme Court of Arizona in <em>State v. Moran, </em>151 <em>Ariz. </em>378, 728 P.2d 248, 251-52 (1986) adopted the concurring view expressed by Justice Roberts in <em>Middleton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">We agree with Justice Roberts\u2019s analysis. \u201cJurors, most of whom are unfamiliar with the behavioral sciences, may benefit from expert testimony\u201d explaining behavior they might otherwise \u201cattribute to inaccuracy or prevarication.\u201d <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Lindsey, </em>149 <em>Ariz. </em>[472] at 474, 720 <em>P.2d </em>[73] at 75 [(1986)]; <em>accord State v. Myers, </em>359 <em>N.W.2d </em>604, 610 (Minn.1984) (allowing expert testimony explaining \u201cpuzzling aspects of the child\u2019s conduct and demeanor which the jury could not otherwise bring to its evaluation of [the victim\u2019s] credibility\u201d). Such evidence may harm defendant\u2019s interests, but we cannot say it is <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial; it merely informs jurors that commonly held assumptions are not necessarily accurate and allows them to fairly judge credibility. <em>See State v. Chaple [Chapple], supra </em>[135 Ariz. 281, 291, 660 P.2d 1208, 1218] (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Put another way, CSAAS is evidence designed to disabuse a jury of false assumptions. As noted by the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Wheat v. State, </em>527 A.2d 269, 273 (Del.1987), \u201cwhere a complainant\u2019s behavior or testimony is, to the average lay person, superficially inconsistent with the occurrence of a rape ... expert testimony can assist a jury in this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Indeed, this testimony is similar to battered woman syndrome evidence which, according to <em>Kelly, </em>helps a jury to understand why a woman, subjected to beatings by her husband, does not simply leave him. <em>State v. Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, 478 <em>A.</em>2d 364. In neither case is the evidence offered as probative of the question of whether abuse has occurred. Rather, the evidence is only offered to explain reactions to abuse. This is to prevent jurors from viewing these reactions as inconsistent with the happening of abuse and to avert the commonsense conclusion in a battered wife case that if the wife really had been battered she would have moved out, and in a child sex abuse case, that if the child really had been abused, he or she would have told someone immediately or would not have recanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">This shielding use of CSAAS testimony has been approved by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. R.W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>14, 26, 514 A.2d 1287 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Understandably, when such testing has a reasonable probative bearing upon an infant witness\u2019s competency or credibility, it may be sought, and its results proffered, on an adequate showing, by the proponent of the child\u2019s testimony, as well as by the defendant. In <em>State v. Myers, </em>359 N.W.2d 604 (Minn.1984), the Minnesota Supreme Court reviewed an incest prosecution in which a doctor had testified concerning the characteristics of abused children, including testimony that sexually abused children often will not report the abusive incidents. The court affirmed the use of the testimony, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">With respect to most crimes the credibility of a witness is peculiarly within the competence of the jury, whose common experience affords sufficient basis for the assessment of credibility. In most cases, even though an expert\u2019s testimony may arguably provide the jury with potentially useful information, the possibility that the jury may be unduly influenced by an expert\u2019s opinion mitigates against admission. Nor should the credibility of witnesses in criminal trials turn on the outcome of a battle among experts. The nature, however, of the sexual abuse of children places lay jurors at a disadvantage. Incest is prohibited in all or almost all cultures, and the common experience of the jury may represent a less than adequate foundation for assessing the credibility of a young child who complains of sexual abuse. If the victim of a burglary failed to report the crime promptly, a jury would have good reason to doubt that person\u2019s credibility. A young child subjected to sexual abuse, however, may for some time be either unaware or uncertain of the criminality of the abuser\u2019s conduct____ By explaining the emotional antecedents of the victim\u2019s conduct and the peculiar impact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>crime on other members of the family, an expert can assist the jury in evaluating the credibility of the complainant. <em>[Id. </em>at 609, 610.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">It has also received nearly universal judicial approval in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Ex parte Hill, </em>553 So.2d 1138 (Ala. 1989); <em>Nelson v.

Thus, to the extent that Milchman presented the CSAAS testimony for the purpose of explaining N.Q. and C.Q.\u2019s secrecy and delayed reporting of the abuse, we think it met the third reliability test established in <em>State v.

Instead, she stated without qualification that N.Q. and C.Q. each exhibited four of the five symptoms of CSAAS which she described as a pattern of behavior found to \u201coccur again and again in children who are victims of incest.\u201d She also testified that N.Q. exhibited other \u201cbehavior syndromes of trauma,\u201d including \u201ccrying, nightmares and falling grades.\u201d This testimony left the jury with the impression that syndrome evidence is somehow diagnostic of sexual abuse and that because the girls evidenced four of the five symptoms exhibited by \u201cvictims of incest\u201d and other \u201cbehavior syndromes of trauma\u201d this was affirmative evidence that sexual abuse occurred.

The syndrome does not detect sexual abuse. Rather, it assumes the presence of abuse, and explains the child\u2019s reactions to it. Thus, child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome is not the sexual abuse analogue of battered child syndrome, which is diagnostic of physical abuse. With battered child syndrome, one reasons from type of injury to cause of injury. Thus, battered child syndrome is probative of physical abuse. With child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome, by contrast, one reasons from presence of sexual abuse to reactions to sexual abuse. Thus, the accommodation syndrome is not probative of abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Unfortunately, a number of mental health professionals, lawyers, and commentators drew unwarranted comparisons between battered child syndrome and child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome. This error led to considerable confusion. First, some professionals misinterpreted Summit\u2019s article, believing Summit had discovered a \u201csyndrome\u201d that could diagnose sexual abuse. This mistake is understandable, if not forgivable. Mental health and legal professionals working in the child abuse area had long been accustomed to thinking in terms of syndrome evidence to prove physical abuse. Battered child syndrome was an accepted diagnosis by the time Summit\u2019s accommodation syndrome came along in 1983. It was natural for professionals to transfer their understanding of battered child syndrome to this new syndrome, and to conclude that the accommodation syndrome, like battered child syndrome, could be used to detect abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">If the first error was erroneously equating child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome with a diagnostic device, the second mistake was hardly less serious. Some professionals conflated the reactions described by Summit, which are not probative of abuse, with behaviors that are probative of abuse. This combination of behaviors was then denominated a syndrome, the presence of which was supposedly probative of abuse. The defect of this \u201csyndrome\u201d is that some of its components are probative of abuse and others are not. Opinions based on such a \u201csyndrome\u201d are of dubious reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">Widespread misunderstanding of child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome had unfortunate consequences. Expert testimony based in whole or in part on the syndrome led some courts to believe the accommodation syndrome was designed to diagnose child sexual abuse. So viewed, the syndrome is doomed to fail because it simply does not diagnose. Little wonder courts became suspicious of professional ability to detect sexual abuse. Unlike battered child syndrome, which is highly probative of nonaccidental injury, the accommodation syndrome appeared anything but reliable. Courts were not informed that the accommodation syndrome was being asked to perform a task it could not accomplish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">The accommodation syndrome has a place in the courtroom. The syndrome helps explain why many sexually abused children delay reporting their abuse, and why many children recant allegations of abuse and deny that anything occurred. If use of the syndrome is confined to these rehabilitative functions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the confusion clears, and the accommodation syndrome serves a useful forensic function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Myers, <em>Expert Testimony, supra, </em>at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We have concluded that syndrome evidence proffered either generally or as related to a particular child to prove affirmatively that abuse occurred is scientifically unreliable. \u2018\u2018Whether described in terms of \u2018indicators/ \u2018syndromes/ \u2018patterns\u2019 or \u2018clinical features/ the objective of such evidence is to establish on the basis of present conduct that in the past someone has been subjected to a specific trauma.\u201d <em>State v. Black, supra, </em>537 <em>A.</em>2d at 1157 (Me.1988). Under ideal circumstances, such a nexus is problematic. These circumstances are far from ideal. This record and our independent research evidence no general scientific approbation of such an analysis and a sharp difference of opinion among jurisdictions as to its reliability, thus obviating the conclusion that the affirmative use of syndrome evidence has gained \u201cgeneral\u201d acceptance. We therefore hold that Milchman\u2019s unrestricted testimony that C.Q. and N.Q. exhibited four out of five elements of CSAAS and that N.Q. showed other trauma syndrome behaviors should not have been admitted to prove to the jury that abuse occurred because the reliability of that evidence to prove an occurrence of abuse has not as yet been established. <em>See State v. Kelly, supra. </em>This is not to suggest that such evidence is intrinsically flawed. We are in no position to make such an absolute judgment. Rather, we hold that as social science and jurisprudence are presently constituted, we can have no faith in its reliability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Equally important in our determination is Milchman\u2019s testimony before the jury that she believed the stories told by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the children (and C.W.) and her reasons for that belief. She stated on several occasions that it was her \u201cexpert opinion\u201d that the children had been sexually abused. In addition to relying on the syndrome evidence she observed, Milehman\u2019s expert opinion was based in great measure on her conclusions as to the credibility of the children\u2019s recitation of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">There is no basis in our law for the expression of an expert opinion as to the truthfulness of a statement by another witness. Such a statement does not fall within any of the methods provided in the Rules of Evidence for supporting the credibility of a witness. <em>See </em>R. Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>Comments to <em>R. </em>20, 22, 47 (1991). Such testimony is quite distinct from character evidence relating to the traits of honesty and veracity which is permissible under <em>Evid.R. </em>22. On the contrary, in this case, the character of the child witnesses for truthfulness was never addressed by the expert. What was said was that the expert believed that particular statements of the witnesses were true. Our rules do not allow such bolstering.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Moreover credibility is an issue which is peculiarly within the jury\u2019s ken and with respect to which ordinarily jurors require no expert assistance. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lindsey, supra, </em>149 <em>Ariz. </em>at 75, 720 P.2d at 76; <em>Townsend v. State, supra, </em>734 P.2d at 709; <em>State v. Holloway, </em>82 <em>N.C.App. </em>586, 347 S.E.2d 72, 73 (Ct.App.1986); <em>State v. Friedrich, </em>135 <em>Wis.</em>2d 1, 398 <em>N.W.2d </em>763, 770 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">The question of whether a particular witness is testifying in a truthful manner is one that must be answered in reliance upon inferences drawn from the ordinary experiences of life and common knowledge as to the natural tendencies of human nature, as well as upon observations of the demeanor and character of the witness. The phenomenon of lying, and situations in which prevarications might be expected to occur, have traditionally been regarded as within the ordinary facility of jurors to assess. For this reason, the question of a witness\u2019 credibility has routinely been regarded as a decision reserved exclusively for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">It is an encroachment upon the province of the jury to permit admission of expert testimony on the issue of a witness\u2019 credibility. <em>(Commonwealth v. Seese, </em>512 <em>Pa. </em>439, 517 <em>A.2d </em>920, 922 (1986) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>See Commonwealth v. Davis, </em>518 <em>Pa. </em>77, 541 <em>A.</em>2d 315 (1988). Our cases are replete with references to the nature of a credibility evaluation; it involves a judgment by people of \u201creason and fairness,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 92, 477 <em>A.</em>2d 1246 (1984), exercising the \u201crational process of an ordinarily intelligent mind,\u201d <em>Ferdinand v. Agricultural Ins. Co. of Watertown, N.Y., </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>482, 494, 126 A.2d 323 (1956), applying \u201cgeneral knowledge and common experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We believe that it is an incursion on one of the jury\u2019s most important functions to allow an expert witness to evaluate the statements of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">By far the most dangerous aspect of opinion testimony as to whether a witness is telling the truth is that it is scientifically unreliable. There is simply no scientific foundation for an expert\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of a witness or for the conclusion that a psychologist or other social scientist has some particular ability to ferret out truthful from deceitful testimony. Absent a question of capacity, an expert is no better qualified than a lay person to assess the credibility of a witness. <em>See Biro v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 401, 265 A.2d 830 (App.Div.1970), <em>rev\u2019d on dissent, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>204, 271 A.2d 1 (1970). Indeed, one commentator has characterized such Pseudo-Scientism as an ethical violation by the expert witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">The ethical violation occurs because of the implicit misrepresentation of a commonsense moral and legal judgment as a clinical or scientific decision. Whether a child is telling the truth is not a judgment based on specialized knowledge. Indeed, the counterexamples that are often given (i.e., cases in which children have given graphic descriptions of sexual acts) prove the point. The inference that such descriptions are credible is a matter of common sense. Even if the expert is correct in his or her judgment, the presentation of the judgment as based on specialized knowledge is deceptive, and the result is usurpation of the role of the trier of fact with concomitant diminution of the appearance of justice. (Limber &amp; Melton, <em>supra </em>at 1230).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We are in agreement with this analysis as is nearly every other jurisdiction which has faced this issue. <em>See, e.g., Nelson v.

Kim, </em>64 <em>Haw. </em>598, 645 P.2d 1330 (1982), was recently overruled in <em>State v.

Milchman\u2019s opinion was based, in its entirety, on the affirmative use of syndrome evidence which we have ruled does not meet the reliability standard and upon her evaluation of the children\u2019s truthfulness, for which there is neither warrant nor scientific foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We cannot say that this testimony was not influential in the jury\u2019s weighing of N.Q. and C.Q.\u2019s testimony against defendant\u2019s denials. The evidence in this case was subject to varying interpretations. While Dr. Bresnahan stated that a stretched hymen was not normal and was consistent with sexual abuse, she also acknowledged that a girl could be born with a larger than usual hymenal opening. In our view, the improper admission of the expert evidence could have tipped the balance and created a real possibility of injustice, \u201cone sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18-19, 319 A.2d 450 (1974) (quoting <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335-36, 273 A.2d 1 (1971)). We thus reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The retrial makes it unnecessary for us to deal with the other issues raised by defendant. We note' only that the judge will have to decide at the time of the retrial whether the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 are applicable and whether the testimony of the victim witnesses who will, by then, be more than three years older than they were at the original trial, should be received by closed circuit television. <em>Maryland v.

It may be that during the pendency of this case, conclusions, as yet unpublished and unavailable to us, have been reached regarding the use of syndrome evidence including CSAAS in child sex abuse cases. We thus do not foreclose the presentation of such evidence to the trial judge on the retrial nor do we preclude the judge from reaching different conclusions than ours based upon the new evidence which might develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In light of the state of social science research and case law as of this writing, we hold that CSAAS evidence is generally reliable to explain secrecy, belated disclosure and recantation by a child sex abuse victim; that syndrome evidence including CSAAS is not reliable to prove that sex abuse, in fact, occurred; and that an expert social science witness has neither the legal authority nor the scientific qualifications to opine as to the truthfulness of the statement of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">He also contends that the trial judge denied him his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by allowing N.Q. and C.Q. to testify on closed circuit television; that a stipulation as to the expert testimony was improperly related to the jury; that one of the experts, Dr. Bresnahan lacked qualifications to give expert testimony in any field; that the sentence imposed was improper; that the record of the case was not adequately preserved, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Because defendant did not object to the expert testimony at trial, this is the applicable standard. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\">While the indictment stated that C.Q. was seven at the time of the crime, her trial testimony and the statements of the prosecutor at trial indicate that she was six during at least part of 1984.

But they cannot always be expected to offer evidence they believe in good faith to be reliable and admissible and to simultaneously request <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearings to determine those very questions. Our rules and cases require them to request <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ings, and suggest that they do so, only in certain situations. <em>See e.g., State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 270-272, 294 <em>A.</em>2d 23 (1972); <em>R. </em>3:13\u20141(b); <em>Evid.R. </em>8. It is fundamental that the defense has an obligation to object to inadmissible evidence. Yet the majority reverses this conviction based on its technical determinations in the absence of any objection by the defense at trial to the witness\u2019 qualifications \u201cas an expert in child sexual abuse\u201d or to the evidence offered and in the absence of any contest to its admissibility or probative value. I cannot agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Doctors can offer their opinions as to causation based on reasonable medical certainty and without belief beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 57-58, 509 A.2d 206 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>582, 523 A.2d 210 (1986). Further, psychiatrists and psychologists treat patients based on their assessment of the cause of an apparent psychological problem. This frequently turns on their assessment of the patient\u2019s credibility. I cannot, therefore, understand why a psychologist, qualified as an expert without objection, cannot tell the jury what he or she believes to be the cause of an individual\u2019s problem. <em>See, e.g., Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>421, 593 A.2d 733 (1991); <em>Evid.R. </em>56(2), 57. <em>See also R.S. v. Knighton, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>79, 86-91, 592 A.2d 1157 (1991) (regarding admissibility of statements to physicians relevant to diagnosis and treatment). Similarly, I do not understand why an expert, qualified without objection, cannot explain to a jury why the expert believes, based on observations and interviews of an individual, that that individual suffers from a particular syndrome and the scientific basis therefor. No one would think it unreasonable or inappropriate for Dr. Milchman or any other similarly qualified clinical psychologist to treat the Q. children for child abuse syndrome; yet the majority concludes that the doctors cannot tell a jury that those children have the syndrome. To me this puts technicalities above reason at a time our Supreme Court continues to enlarge the admissibility of expert testimony, subject to examination of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>pert\u2019s credibility which may turn on the details of his or her experience and qualifications. <em>See Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., supra; Ryan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>276, 579 A.2d 1241 (1991). As recently said in <em>Lanzet v. Greenberg, </em>126 <em>N.J </em>168, 186, 594 A.2d 1309 (1991),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">[i]n our recently-decided <em>Ryan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>276, 579 A.2d 1241 (1990), we noted that the primary function of courts is to determine the admissibility of evidence, not its reliability. <em>See James v. City of East Orange, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 588 A.2d 412 (App.Div.1991) (once competency of medical expert has been established, the jury is 'to determine the credibility, weight and probative value of the expert\u2019s testimony\u2019).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">I completely concur in the majority\u2019s thorough analysis that \u201crehabilitative\u201d testimony concerning the impact of child sexual abuse syndrome is admissible. In fact, as the majority details, our Supreme Court has quoted with favor out-of-state authority to the effect that \u201c[b]y explaining the emotional antecedent of the victim\u2019s conduct and the peculiar impact of the crime on other members of the family, an expert can assist the jury in evaluating the credibility of the complainant.\u201d <em>State v. R.W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>14, 26, 514 A.2d 1287 (1986), quoting <em>State v. Myers, </em>359 N.W.2d 604, 610 (Minn.1984). Hence, my colleagues and I agree that the testimony of Dr. Milchman concerning the characteristics and attitude of child abuse victims, including the possibility of initial false statements and delayed truthfulness, was admissible, even in the absence of an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing. I therefore join the court in holding \u201cthat CSAAS evidence is generally reliable to explain secrecy, belated disclosure and recantation by a child sex abuse victim,\u201d at 43, 599 A.2d at 189, and was so admissible here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The majority, however, holds that Dr. Milchman\u2019s testimony went beyond permissible bounds because she \u201cdid not limit her CSAAS testimony to the rehabilitative task of explaining the girls\u2019 secrecy and delayed reporting.\u201d At 38, 599 A.2d at 184. Rather, she detailed the symptoms of sexual abuse which N.Q. and C.Q. exhibited, indicating that those symptoms were the types exhibited by \u201cvictims of incest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But if an expert can testify as to certain characteristics and impact of child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>sexual abuse, there is no reason why the expert cannot also testify as to what he or she observed with respect to the victim, as Dr. Milchman did. Nor should the expert be prevented from stating (as Dr. Milchman did here by direct and hypothetical questions) his or her beliefs in terms of the impact of child abuse if there is other evidence which reflects that the individual, in fact, suffered from those symptoms. My colleagues conclude, however, that \u201c[t]he consensus among scholars is that there are as yet no scientifically reliable indicators of child sexual abuse,\u201d at 33, 599 A.2d at 184, and that many, if not most, jurisdictions have concluded that \u201caffirmative\u201d \u201csyndrome evidence\u201d is not admissible because it is \u201cwithout scientific basis.\u201d At 33, 599 A.2d at 185. Yet, the majority also recognizes the existence of cases which \u201chave accepted the affirmative use of syndrome evidence.\u201d At 36, 599 A.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The major problem with my colleagues\u2019 analysis is that it summarily rejects the contrary precedent, <em>but cf. Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Co., supra </em>(referring in the toxic tort setting to admissibility when expert evidence is deemed reliable by a substantial minority of the scientific community), and substitutes its judgment for that of some experts because of a split of authority \u201cand a sharp difference of opinion among jurisdictions as to its reliability, thus obviating the conclusion that the affirmative use of syndrome evidence has gained \u2018general\u2019 acceptance.\u201d At 38, 599 A.2d at 187. Nevertheless, my colleagues might remand for an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing \u201con the reliability of syndrome evidence as affirmative proof of sex abuse\u201d if a retrial were not \u201cotherwise necessary.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 10. And the majority does not \u201cforeclose the presentation of such evidence ... on the retrial\u201d or \u201cpreclude the judge from reaching different conclusions than ours based on the new evidence which might develop.\u201d At 43, 599 A.2d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">My disagreement with the majority is on a relatively narrow ground: I would conduct the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing\u2014and permit both parties to develop the proofs regarding the scientific reliability of the affirmative CSAAS testimony\u2014before, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>after, reversing the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>283, 294-295, 294 A.2d 41 (1972); <em>State v. Crandall, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 134, 555 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1989), <em>rev\u2019d o.g. </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>649, 577 A.2d 483 (1990); <em>State v.

I would do so because in my view the other basis which the majority finds to make \u201ca retrial ... otherwise necessary\u201d\u2014the expert\u2019s references to the credibility of the witnesses, even assuming it error in context\u2014might well be harmless, if the \u201caffirmative\u201d CSAAS syndrome evidence is deemed admissible. If an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing can be conducted next week or next month before <em>(see R. </em>3:13\u20141(b)) or during the retrial mandated by the reversal, why cannot it be conducted next week or next month before the reversal is ordered? The hearing should be conducted now because the evidence may well be reliable and, therefore, admissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">What constitutes reasonable reliability depends in part on the context of the proceedings involved. The policy underlying Rule 56 is to exclude expert evidence when the danger it poses of prejudice, confusion and diversion of attention exceeds its helpfulness to the factfinder because the expertise is not sufficiently reliable. In part, the Rule entails a weighing of reliability against prejudice in light of the context in which the evidence is offered. Expert evidence that poses too great a danger of prejudice in some situations, and for some purposes, may be admissible in other circumstances where it will be more helpful and less prejudicial. <em>[State v. Cavallo, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>508, 520, 443 A.2d 1020 (1982) (interpreting <em>Evid.R. </em>56 as it then read)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">I recognize the independent obligation of the trial judge to assure a fair trial and to prevent \u201cthe danger of prejudice through the introduction of unreliable evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 443 A.2d 1020. But evidence can be shown to be sufficiently reliable by expert testimony, scientific writings or judicial precedent, <em>id. </em>at 521, 443 A.2d 1020; <em>see also e.g., Windmere Inc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>373, 379, 522 A.2d 405 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>(1987),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201c[although the proponent of an expert opinion must demonstrate that the data or information used were soundly and reliably generated and are of a type reasonably relied on by comparable experts in the particular field, our rule <em>[Evid.R. </em>56(2)] does not insist on a demonstration of the objective reliability of the opinions reached or the inferences drawn from such data or information.\u201d <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 447, 593 <em>A.2d </em>733.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\"><em>Evid.R. </em>56 was amended on September 15, 1981 effective July 1, \u00cd982. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-33 <em>et seq. </em>In <em>Ryan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., supra, </em>the Supreme Court considered the obligation of a trial judge in determining the admissibility of expert testimony under the Rule, as amended. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">We interpret <em>Evidence Rule </em>56(2) to require that a court make an inquiry into and a finding on whether experts in the given field rely on certain information. If such reliance be found, then it is presumed to be reasonable. That interpretation of the <em>Rule </em>strikes a fair balance between the intent of the amended language and the \u201cspirit\u201d of the prior <em>Rule, </em>which has been interpreted to require the court to make a determination on the reliability of the testimony. The amendment was made explicitly to expand the data on which an expert can rely in forming an opinion. The focus should be on what the experts in fact rely on, not on whether the court thinks they should so rely. Requiring the trial court to make a finding on whether experts in the field actually rely on certain information satisfies the intent of the new language. Allowing the court to overrule that presumption of reliability will result in the exclusion of evidence only under unusual or extreme circumstances, thus satisfying the \u201cspirit\u201d of the former <em>Rule. </em>[121 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 579 A. 2d 1241].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The victims of battered women syndrome appear to exhibit some characteristics similar to victims of child sexual abuse syndrome, as developed in the majority opinion; <em>see also State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178,190-197, 478 A.2d 364 (1984), and in <em>Kelly, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the battered-woman\u2019s syndrome is an appropriate subject for expert testimony; that the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>perts\u2019 conclusions, despite the relative newness of the field, are sufficiently reliable under New Jersey\u2019s standards for scientific testimony; and that defendant\u2019s expert was sufficiently qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 478 A.2d 364. Hence, the Court remanded for a retrial at which, based on the same proofs, \u201cthe expert\u2019s testimony on the battered-woman\u2019s syndrome shall be admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I recognize that there the victim was defending against a homicide charge and desired to use the evidence in support of her self-defense claim, whereas here the State seeks to use the expert proofs to show that a child was the victim of abuse. But <em>Evid.R. </em>56 is party neutral even in a criminal case. <em>See e.g., State v. Cavallo, supra; State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>343, 230 A.2d 384 (1967). <em>See, generally Annot., </em>\u201cAdmissibility, at Criminal Prosecution, of Expert Testimony on Rape Trauma Syndrome,\u201d 42 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 879 (1985 and 1991 supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">My colleagues appear to reverse the conviction now, in the absence of proofs or sufficient evidence in the literature or case precedent of scientific reliability, notwithstanding some judicial precedent they reject, because they also conclude that Dr. Milchman conveyed to the jury her belief that the victims were credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Dr. Milchman, the expert in child abuse syndrome, testified that she believed the victims, but she explained why, based on her observations and her scientific training and professional expertise. Her testimony related to her expertise and observations in reaching her ultimate conclusion. Dr. Milchman on direct was, in essence, discounting the contemplated defense. She said, \u201c[i]f the children give concrete, realistic details ... that are plausible that is very suggestive that they have experienced\u201d what they described. She explained how an expert can tell if a child is \u201cprogrammed.\u201d When the judge interrupted this testimony\u2014still in the absence of objection\u2014and stated that credibility was for the jury to decide, the prosecutor responded by saying, \u201cI am talking about what the doctor\u2019s experience is and what she looks for.\u201d The judge immediately instructed the jury, \u201c[i]t is your ultimate responsibility as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>credibility for that matter or even reliability as to the testimony that is being presented to you. That\u2019s from everybody including, of course, the infant witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">If a prosecutor\u2019s investigator can tell the jury that he or she believes that controlled dangerous substances are packaged with intent to distribute, the critical issue in a case involving possession with intent to distribute, <em>see State v. Odom, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>65, 560 A.2d 1198 (1989), I do not see why experts cannot tell the jury that an individual is the victim of child sexual abuse syndrome in a case where the victim is alleged to have been sexually assaulted as a child. <em>See Evid.B. </em>56(2), 57. Certainly the investigator in the <em>Odom </em>case is not directly commenting on the credibility of a state\u2019s witness but the distinction may be more semantic than real in these circumstances. In any event, Dr. Milchman did not testify that defendant committed the crime or was guilty. The testimony was only that the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>were victims of child sexual abuse, the \u201cultimate issue ... to be decided by the trier of the fact.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>56(3). Thus, if on remand it is determined that the expert can testify that C.Q. and N.Q. were the victims of child sexual abuse, I can find no harm flowing from the expert\u2019s testimony, stated in the absence of objection, to the extent it indicated that she believed the victims. The victims themselves testified that they were abused; the expert\u2019s opinion was consistent, similarly concluding that they were victims of child sexual abuse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In these circumstances the expert\u2019s express statement of credibility offers little more than the obvious acceptance of their stories. I would therefore find it harmless that the expert may have been understood to say that she believed the children. Stated differently, <em>if </em>the \u201caffirmative\u201d CSAAS opinion evidence is found reliable and admissible at an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing, the fact that the expert also indicated that she found the children to have been credible would be harmless in my judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>To reverse this conviction in the absence of a determination of scientific reliability and without a remand to determine that issue, because an expert witness concluded based on her expertise that the children were victims of sexual abuse, is, in my judgment, inappropriate in the absence of the slightest objection or contest when the testimony was taken.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Had there been an objection to Dr. Milchman\u2019s qualifications or testimony, she could have endeavored to develop its reliability at trial. Dr. Milchman has taught and written articles on the subject. <em>Cf. Rubanick v. Witco Chemical Corp., supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">I do not suggest that the scientific literature or out-of-State precedent is so authoritative and persuasive as to render the affirmative CSAAS testimony admissible without full exploration of the relevant issues at an <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing. <em>Compare, State v. Cathcart, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 589 A.2d 193 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Later, after developed on relevant cross-examination, Dr. Milchman also testified that C.W. did not \"present to me as a programming mother.\" I emphasize that the testimony should be limited to the general characteristics of child sexual abuse syndrome and, if admissible, a conclusion that a particular person had those symptoms or characteristics. I do not want to be understood as approving direct expert testimony on the victim's credibility, and agree with the majority that such testimony is generally inadmissible. <em>See, generally, Annot. </em>\"Experts-Rape Trauma Syndrome,\u201d <em>supra, </em>42 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th at 879-917; <em>see also Annot. </em>\"Necessity and Admissibility of Expert Testimony as to Credibility of Witness,\" 20 <em>A.L.R.3d </em>684 (1968 and 1991 supp.). But to the extent Dr. Milchman\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it went beyond what was admissible in explaining the syndrome and the factors she observed, it may be deemed harmless in context, in the absence of objection and with the above quoted instruction. The judge also instructed the jury regarding \"fresh complaint\u201d evidence and as to its duty to determine credibility, including credibility of the experts who testified, and that they were not bound by the expert testimony. In the absence of an objection to the jury instructions, I need not discuss them further and cannot conclude that any deficiency constitutes plain error. <em>See State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 148-149, 578 A.2d 364 (1990). Further, this direct appeal is not the occasion to consider the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see State v. Dixon, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>223, 262, 593 A.2d 266 (1991); <em>State v. Sparano, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 592 A.2d 608 (App.Div.1991), notwithstanding his failure to object to the questions regarding credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Dr. Bresnahan testified that N.Q. had a stretched or enlarged hymen. It was stipulated that C.Q. also had a stretched hymen, something which Dr. Bresna-han stated was \"consistent with sexual abuse.\u201d There was no challenge to the physical evidence. The doctor stated that \"[biased on the history that [N.Q.] gave me and the physical examination I would say it was consistent with sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">It is true that defense counsel harped on the credibility of N.Q. and C.Q. who also identified their father as the assailant. Counsel emphasized in summation that C.W. wanted to get even with defendant for his other relationships, for his years of abuse and then for having left her after she commenced a relationship with another man and had his child. The prosecutor, on the other hand, emphasized the children\u2019s credibility by reference to their reaction to the suggestion they lied and why defendant\u2019s theory was incredible. Defense counsel never mentioned Dr. Bresnahan or Dr. Milchman in summation. The prosecutor referred to Dr. Bresnahan\u2019s testimony about a stretched hymen. As to the CSAAS testimony, he said \u201d[y]ou heard Dr. Milchman testify as to the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation syndrome which some of you may look at well that\u2019s a psychiatrist, you know these people are crazy anyway. I don\u2019t believe in any of that garbage. Well, ladies and gentlemen it\u2019s up to you how you weigh an expert\u2019s opinion. And the judge will instruct you on that.\u201d The prosecutor briefly referred to the syndrome evidence, stating \u201d[t]he Accommodation Syndrome deals with secrecy and helplessness and entrapment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>accommodation and delayed disclosure. And every single one of those factors was present here.\u201d The children's credibility was therefore a critical issue in the case, but essentially related to whether there had been sexual abuse or a manufactured story. The prosecutor made no reference in his summation to Dr. Milchman's assessment of their credibility or to her belief that C.W. did not manufacture or teach the story. Rather, he addressed the children's credibility in terms of what they said about the suggestion they might lie, about the facts themselves and about the events on which the defense built its case. The doctor's assessment of their credibility, mentioned without objection during her testimony and not mentioned or highlighted in summation, was simply not capable of producing an unjust result or a result the jury would not have otherwise reached. <em>State v.
