SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Amberto Garcia appeals the dismissal, for want of jurisdiction, of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. The respondents, Attorney General Janet Reno and Richard Cravener, Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cgovernment\u201d), raise substantive and procedural objections to the appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Garcia is a national of Mexico who married a U.S. citizen in 1978 and consequently attained lawful permanent residency in the United States. After he received at least his third conviction of driving while intoxicated (\u201cDWI\u201d) under Texas law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the INS instituted deportation proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which renders deportable any resident alien convicted of an aggravated felony. After a removal hearing, an immigration judge found Garcia removable and ordered his removal to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Garcia reserved appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \u201cBIA\u201d) but ultimately failed to perfect the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did not file an appeal to this court for direct review of the removal order but, instead, filed a habeas petition in district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court dismissed the petition, concluding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 restricts jurisdiction over such appeals to direct review in the court of appeals. Alternatively, the court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Garcia had failed to exhaust his statutory and administrative remedies, is not in the custody of the government for habeas corpus purposes, and failed to file the petition timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">Garcia argues on appeal, as he did before the district court, that the BIA improperly interpreted the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include DWI, resulting in the removal order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government argues that the proper forum for such a challenge is not via habeas petition under \u00a7 2241, but instead by petition for direct review, as specified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9). We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">This matter is controlled by <em>Max-George v. Reno, </em>205 F.3d 194 (5th Cir.2000), in which we held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152(b)(9) denies all federal habeas jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 for certain criminal aliens, including those removed under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as Garcia was. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>at 201. We further held that any habeas jurisdiction remaining under the Constitution was insufficient to encompass the petitioner\u2019s claim in that case, \u201c \u2018because the Supreme Court long ago made it clear that this writ does not offer what [petitioner] desire[s]: review of a discretionary decision[ ] by the political branches of government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id </em>at 202 (citing <em>Yang v. INS, </em>109 F.3d 1185 1195 (7th Cir.1997)) (modifications in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">At first glance, \u00a7 1252(b)(9) might raise concerns under the Suspension Clause, given that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) prohibits direct review of any final removal order under \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii). As we noted, however, in <em>Max-George, </em>205 F.3d at 199, even under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), a court of appeals has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. When confronted with a petition for review from a criminal alien, a court of appeals must make three specific inquiries before dismissing the petition as barred by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C): (1) whether specific conditions act to bar jurisdiction over the petition for review; (2) whether the conditions that bar jurisdiction \u2014 for example, as in this case, deportation for an aggravated felony \u2014 have been \u201cconstitutionally applied\u201d; and (3) if the jurisdictional bar applies, whether the remaining quantum of judicial review satisfies the Constitution. <em>See Max-George, </em>205 F.3d at 199-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Garcia\u2019s challenge \u2014 whether his crime is a ground for removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) \u2014 would properly be heard on direct review. In that posture, this court, in determining whether \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies to deny us jurisdiction to review the removal order, necessarily would inquire into whether DWI is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Unfortunately, Garcia failed to petition for judicial review of his removal order; instead, he merely filed a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. Unless his claim falls within the scope of the constitutionally-protected writ, the district court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Garcia\u2019s claim is different from Max-George\u2019s, because he challenges the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d while Max-George challenged \u2014 on due process grounds \u2014 the retroactive application of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) to cover a crime committed before the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. <em>See id </em>at 195. The difference in the challenges does not present a valid basis on which to distinguish <em>Max-George, </em>however. The provision that barred habeas jurisdiction in <em>Max-George </em>applies to \u201c[j]udicial review of all law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this sub-chapter. ...\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Thus, \u00a7 1252(b)(9) plainly applies to Garcia\u2019s habeas challenge, which deals with the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. For this reason, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain Garcia\u2019s appeal, so that court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\">. The record is murky with respect to Garcia's conviction record. While he admits, in his habeas petition, to only three convictions, the government's motion to dismiss references nine separate DWI convictions between 1984 and 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\">. In reference to the failure to appeal, Garcia's habeas petition describes the \"negligence and malpractice\u201d of his former counsel. The petition raises no issues regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, however, and we will not raise the issue <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-13\">. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), an alien who commits an aggravated felony is rendered deportable. Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) defines \"aggravated felony\u201d to include a \"crime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, which defines \"crime of violence\u201d as \"a felony ... that, by its nature, involves substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d Because we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s interpretation in a habeas posture, <em>see infra, </em>we express no view on whether DWI can reasonably be termed a \"crime of violence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
