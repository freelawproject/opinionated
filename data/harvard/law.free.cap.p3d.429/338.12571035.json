Taking into consideration both the plain language of the statute and the UPA's remedial purpose as a consumer protection statute, we hold that a business may sue a competitor under the UPA only if the conduct alleged involves consumer protection concerns or trade practices addressed to the market generally. Because Plaintiff's claims against its business competitor do address such concerns, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Plaintiff Gandydancer, LLC and Defendant Rock House CGM, LLC are both construction companies providing railroad contracting services to BNSF Railway Company (BNSF). In the spring of 2015, Plaintiff submitted a complaint to the New Mexico Construction Industries Division (CID), alleging Defendant had performed unlicensed construction work in violation of the Construction Industries Licensing Act (CILA), NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 60-13-1 to -59 (1967, as amended through 2013). Following an investigation, Defendant entered into a stipulated settlement agreement with CID agreeing to pay administrative penalties. A week before the stipulated settlement agreement was approved by CID's supervisory commission, Plaintiff sued Defendant in district court raising several claims, including a UPA claim. Plaintiff's complaint alleged that Defendant operated its business without satisfying the mandatory licensing requirements, induced Plaintiff's former employees to divulge confidential trade secrets, and used those trade secrets to convince BNSF to hire Defendant instead of Plaintiff without disclosing to BNSF that it was unlicensed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, asserting Plaintiff had no standing to bring the UPA claim and failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted. Following a hearing, the district court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's UPA claim and certified the question of \"whether the [UPA] affords private-party standing to business competitors who are both sellers of services, or only to buyers of goods and services\" to this Court for interlocutory review. Defendant then filed an application for interlocutory appeal, which this Court granted pursuant to Rule 12-203 NMRA and NMSA 1978, Section 39-3-4(B) (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} Defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, Defendant contends that our prior decisions and the legislative intent of the UPA to protect consumers limits its grant of standing to \"a person who purchased goods or services[,]\" notwithstanding the broad language of Section 57-12-10(B) allowing \"[a]ny person who suffers any loss of money or property\" to bring a claim. Next, Defendant claims Plaintiff has failed to state a viable UPA claim, requiring dismissal with prejudice of its complaint. Finally, Defendant argues that to allow Plaintiff to bring a UPA claim against a competitor for failing to obtain a license would result in an improper usurpation of the government's regulatory\n   authority. We are not persuaded by Defendant's arguments and affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {5} A business competitor's standing to bring a private right of action under the provisions of the UPA is an issue of first impression in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bancorp Inc. v.

Plaintiff's Standing to Bring a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {6} Defendant effectively makes two arguments as to why Plaintiff cannot bring a claim under the plain language of the UPA. First, Defendant argues that the provision in Section 57-10-12(B) allowing \"[a]ny person who suffers any loss\" to bring a claim is tempered by the legislative intent of the UPA and our prior case law limiting standing to buyers of goods and services. Second, Defendant contends that, while the UPA precludes \"unfair or deceptive trade practice[s,]\" it makes no mention of unfair competition practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Rules Governing Statutory Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {7} When interpreting a statute, a court's primary goal is to facilitate and promote the Legislature's purpose.\n   <em>\n    United Rentals Nw., Inc. v.

An \"unfair or deceptive trade practice\" is a \"false or misleading oral or written statement ... or other representation of any kind knowingly made in connection with the sale ... of goods or services ... in the regular course of the person's trade or commerce\n   that may, tends to or does deceive or mislead any person\" and includes, among other things, \"causing confusion or misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval or certification of goods or services\" and \"failing to state a material fact if doing so deceives or tends to deceive[.]\" Section 57-12-2(D)(2), (14). \"\n   <em>\n    Any person\n   </em>\n   who suffers any loss of money or property ... as a result of any employment by another person of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by the [UPA] may bring an action to recover actual damages.\" Section 57-12-10(B) (emphasis added).

Plaintiff, by contrast, urges us to look exclusively to the plain language of the Act. We agree with Defendant that, notwithstanding that the plain language of the UPA appears to confer standing to Plaintiff and other similarly situated business competitors, we must consider whether our literal interpretation of the statute is contrary to its obvious intent or renders it absurd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994-NMSC-023\">\n    1994-NMSC-023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552772\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/346/\">\n    117 N.M. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552772\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/346/\">\n    871 P.2d 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff alleges in its complaint that Defendant's unfair competition practices consist of its knowingly making false and misleading statements when it sold its services to BNSF by failing to disclose that it lacked licenses required under CILA to perform the work that was the subject of the BNSF contracts, that Defendant was awarded BNSF contracts as a result of its intentional omissions regarding licensure, and that Plaintiff sustained\n   business losses as a result of Defendant's conduct. Because trade practices prohibited by the UPA include representations that \"fail[ ] to state a material fact if doing so deceives or tends to deceive[,]\" Section 57-12-2(D)(14), we conclude that despite Section 57-12-2(D) 's silence regarding unfair competition practices, the language of the UPA defining unfair and deceptive trade practices is broad enough to encompass the wrongful conduct of which Plaintiff complains.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dollens v.

Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242256\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/451/\">\n    2009-NMCA-003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242256\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/451/\">\n    145 N.M. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242256\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/451/\">\n    200 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We will not search the record for facts, arguments, and rulings in order to support generalized arguments.\"). Further, to allow CILA enforcement to infringe upon claims under the UPA is contrary to New Mexico policy favoring the resolution of consumer claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002330\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/144/464/\">\n    2008-NMSC-046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002330\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/144/464/\">\n    144 N.M. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002330\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/144/464/\">\n    188 P.3d 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that UPA represents \"[t]he fundamental New Mexico policy of providing consumers a mechanism for dispute resolution\"). Absent authority providing for CILA's displacement of the provisions of the UPA, we will not interfere with the authority of either statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {27} Finally, Defendant seeks dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiff's UPA claim based on a failure to plead facts sufficient to meet all the required elements. Defendant did not, however, request such relief or present this issue in its application for interlocutory appeal. Defendant therefore has not satisfied the requirements of Rule 12-203, and although we recognize that our scope of review may extend beyond the question presented for interlocutory review, we decline to do so here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Begay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988-NMCA-081\">\n    1988-NMCA-081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1597143\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/107/810/\">\n    107 N.M. 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1597143\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/107/810/\">\n    765 P.2d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to reach the issue where such a ruling \"could only be hypothetical or speculative\"). As an order denying a motion to dismiss alone is generally not appealable and does not tend to dispose of the merits of the action, we see little wisdom in proceeding to consider the merits of the order with regard to Plaintiff's UPA claim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.
