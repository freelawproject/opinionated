Although Cozy Creek and River Glider contend that (1) the tender was ineffective because it imposed conditions, (2) Wells Fargo was required to keep the tender good, (3) Wells Fargo was required to record evidence of the tender, and (4) Cozy Creek and River Glider are protected as bona fide purchasers, we recently rejected similar arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n<em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n</em>\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/\">\n    at 118-121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
