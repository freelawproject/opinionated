He's a homeless man who, apparently, went into Sears seeking shelter ... [He] is a homeless man that is clearly taking a tent for whatever purpose he would -- a homeless person would take a tent.\" From this portrayal of Means as a homeless man seeking shelter and in need of a tent, it is apparent that counsel adduced the fact that Means was homeless as a trial strategy to evoke sympathy from the jury or to depict Means as someone who was attempting to satisfy a basic human need for shelter and who would not, therefore, have considered or known the price or value of the tent he was taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, this court will not second-guess defense counsel's apparent trial strategy of apprising the jury that defendant was homeless and unemployed and was in apparent need of shelter and a tent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poaipuni,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264093\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/98/387/#p392\">\n    98 Hawai'i at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264093\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/98/387/#p392\">\n    49 P.3d at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Specific actions or omissions alleged to be error but which had an obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendants case will not be subject to further scrutiny.\" (emphasis omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Richie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258541\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/88/19/#p39\">\n    88 Hawai'i at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258541\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/88/19/#p39\">\n    960 P.2d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[M]atters presumably within the judgment of counsel, like\n   <em>\n    trial strategy,\n   </em>\n   will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. June 20, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Therefore, Means was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on the basis of defense counsel's soliciting testimony and later commenting in closing that Means was homeless and unemployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) In his second point of error, Means alleges that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in allowing Wake to testify to the value of the stolen merchandise, both as reflected on the tags on the shelves and on the Receipt, and in receiving the Receipt into evidence, where the State failed to lay the requisite foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In theft cases, HRS section 708-830(8) (2014) authorizes that proof of \"[t]he unaltered price or name tag or other marking on goods or merchandise, duly identified photographs or photocopies thereof, or\n   <em>\n    printed register receipts\n   </em>\n   shall be prima facie evidence of value and ownership of such goods or merchandise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20708-830\">\n    Haw.

Wake was present when the stolen merchandise was scanned and the Receipt was generated, had personal knowledge of the pricing system as a former \"consumer electronics associate\" for Sears, and had been trained in the same procedure used to generate the Receipt. Wake testified that, per protocol, a manager, whom he could identify by \"associate number,\" produced the Receipt with an \"office register\" which is used in complex returns and in generating receipts for theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Means asserts that the State failed to lay the requisite foundation to admit the Receipt under HRS section 708-830(8). To this end, Means appears to equate the analysis for a purported-\"printed register receipt\" with the analysis for the business records exception to hearsay. Means, however, fails to establish that the Receipt's admissibility as a \"printed register receipt\" is contingent upon its admissibility under the business records exception, and does not argue on appeal that the Receipt itself is hearsay. Moreover, neither the parties nor the Circuit Court discussed whether the Receipt was a \"business record\" in the proceedings below. Accordingly, Means fails to show that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in receiving the Receipt into evidence as a \"printed register receipt\" under HRS section 708-830(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) In his final point of error, Means alleges that the Circuit Court erred in sentencing him as a repeat offender because the State failed to prove his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Auld,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/\">\n    136 Hawai'i 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311164\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/244/\">\n    361 P.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Means argues that the prospective holding in\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   applies to the instant case because his sentencing proceeding was the \"triggering 'event' \" and therefore the Circuit Court's failure to require that the State prove Means' prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his due process rights under the Hawai'i Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Means misidentifies the triggering event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, \"Hopu's Felony Information was filed on February 4, 2014, and the\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   decision was filed on November 24, 2015. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   does not apply to Hopu's case.\"). Means' Felony Information was filed on September 8, 2015, more than two months before\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   was issued. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Auld\n   </em>\n   does not apply to this case.
