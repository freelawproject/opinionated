In 2018, the Arizona Superior Court learned that, in 2016, an Alabama state court had issued a valid child custody order for S.B. that remained in place. After learning Alabama retained exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over S.B., the Arizona Superior Court vacated the dependency, termination and adoption orders for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners, S.B.'s paternal grandparents Monique and Donald B., seek special action relief from the ruling vacating those orders. For the following reasons, this court accepts jurisdiction but denies relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 S.B. was born in Alabama in March 2013 to Cathy L. (Mother) and Jacob B. (Father). In 2014, Mother filed a custody petition in Alabama state court. Also in 2014, Father and S.B. moved to Arizona to live with Petitioners. In August 2016, the Alabama court awarded Father sole custody of S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In January 2017, Father died in a traffic accident. That same month, the Department of Child Safety (DCS) filed a dependency petition in Arizona Superior Court, alleging abandonment by Mother. S.B. was placed with Petitioners, where she has remained ever since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Attempts to locate Mother were unsuccessful. DCS reported that \"in March 2017, she relocated to ... Tennessee\" but could not be found. Also in March 2017, S.B.'s Guardian Ad Litem filed a petition to terminate Mother's parental rights alleging abandonment. After service by publication, S.B. was found dependent as to Mother in April 2017 and Mother's parental rights to S.B. were terminated in June 2017. Petitioners then filed a petition to adopt S.B. In November 2017, the Arizona Superior Court granted\n   the adoption petition and dismissed the dependency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Meanwhile, in November 2017, Mother filed a petition with the Alabama court seeking to modify that court's August 2016 custody order, noting she \"recently learned that the Father is deceased.\" In December 2017, the Alabama court awarded Mother sole custody of S.B. At about this same time, Mother also contacted the Arizona Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 In January 2018, the Arizona Superior Court made a factual finding that Mother \"is a resident of Tennessee,\" but was not asked to address and did not address the Alabama court's exclusive, continuing jurisdiction based on the August 2016 custody order. Later in January 2018, Mother asked the Arizona Superior Court to set aside the order granting the adoption and the order terminating her parental rights, asserting that the Alabama court \"retained jurisdiction over this matter.\" Numerous filings and hearings followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mother asked the Arizona Superior Court to confer with the Alabama court regarding jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

As a result, and concluding it lacked jurisdiction to enter the adoption, termination and dependency orders issued in 2017 (the 2017 Orders), the Arizona Superior Court vacated the 2017 Orders and directed that S.B. be returned to Mother. Petitioners then promptly filed this special action in mid-May 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 This court granted Petitioners' motion for stay pending resolution of this special action. In late May 2018, after further consideration, the Alabama court relinquished exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, having determined that Alabama is an inconvenient forum and that Arizona is a more appropriate forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030\">\n    Ala.

For the Arizona Superior Court to have jurisdiction to issue the 2017 Orders, the January or late May 2018 order would have to apply retroactively. Both factually and legally, however, those 2018 orders apply prospectively only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 Factually, as DCS and Mother note, neither the Alabama court's late May 2018 order, nor the Arizona Superior Court's January 2018 order, state that they apply retroactively. Moreover, in context, those orders did not apply retroactively. The late May 2018 Alabama court order was issued just weeks after that same court declined to relinquish exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, negating any suggestion that the order was to apply retroactively. Similarly, at about this same time, the Arizona Superior Court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to issue the 2017 Orders, negating any suggestion that it viewed the January 2018 order as applying retroactively. Factually, on this record, the January and late May 2018 orders did not apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 Legally, Petitioners have cited, and this court has found, no case holding that an order relinquishing or recognizing the loss of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under the UCCJEA properly could apply retroactively. \"[T]he best and most reliable index of a statute's meaning is its language and, when the language is clear and unequivocal, it is determinative of the statute's construction.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Indeed, Petitioners have not shown how custody or visitation orders (as opposed to orders regarding monetary obligations) could apply retroactively. This further demonstrates that the UCCJEA does not contemplate retroactivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 Finally, cases from other jurisdictions recognize this prospective nature of the UCCJEA. Even after the parties move away from the original state, a determination by the original state that it no longer is exercising exclusive, continuing jurisdiction applies prospectively and does so only after an express judicial determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Nurie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741236\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/176/478/\">\n    176 Cal.App.4th 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20200\">\n    98 Cal.Rptr.3d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (2009) (\"It is not the parties' departure itself that terminates the decree state's exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
