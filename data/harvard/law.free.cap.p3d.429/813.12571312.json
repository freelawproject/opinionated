American Family is an insurance company that sells and underwrites automobile insurance policies in Washington. Insurance policies sold or underwritten by American Family included personal injury protection (PIP) covering medical expenses incurred by a covered person arising from a covered automobile accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On July 8, 2016, Folweiler filed a class action complaint against American Family on behalf of a class of at least 900 similarly situated medical providers. Folweiler's complaint alleged: (1) between July 2012 and July 2016 Folweiler treated patients who had PIP coverage under an automobile insurance policy issued or underwritten by American Family, (2) American Family, as part of its general policy and practice in Washington, directed Folweiler to bill American Family directly for treatment rather than the patient, (3) American Family accepted Folweiler's bills as claims for payment of reasonable and necessary medical expenses under the patient's PIP coverage, (4) American Family had a policy and practice of relying on a computer database to determine payment of all medical expense bills submitted by Washington providers, (5) the computer database was created by Fair Health and was utilized to compare the amount billed by the provider for each procedure with the amount represented by the 80th percentile of charges in the Fair Health database for the same procedure in the same zip code defined geographical area, (6) when the computer review found the provider's bill amount was greater than the 80th percentile amount, the computer would limit the \"payment amount\" to the 80th percentile and would show the reason for the reduction as an explanatory code P0041,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (7) The computer created an Explanation of Review (EOR) that set out the original \"charged amount\" and the reduced \"payment amount,\" and provided the following explanation for the reduction from the amount charged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   For Dates of Service 5/31/11 and prior, the amount allowed is based on benchmark data provided by Ingenix. For Dates of Service 6/1/11 and greater, the amount allowed was reviewed using the FH (Fair Health) RV Benchmark Database. Medical providers are asked to accept the reasonable amount as full payment for health care services and not bill the patient for additional charges. We require supporting documentation to reconsider charges for additional payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Folweiler alleged that based on the P0041 reduction, American Family paid Folweiler's claims between July 2012 and July 2016 at the reduced payment amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Folweiler's complaint alleged further that: (1) no one at American Family determined that a provider's billed amount was a reasonable amount for that provider in that provider's geographic area, (2) no one at American Family investigated or knew the identity, background, credentials, experience or any personal characteristics of the individual providers used as comparators in arriving at the 80th percentile amount, (3) no one at American Family independently investigated whether the amount billed was a reasonable amount for that provider to charge for that procedure in that provider's city, and (4) no one at American Family knew whether the amount billed was a reasonable amount for that provider to charge based on the provider's background, credentials, usual and customary fee, the amount paid by other auto insurers, or any other individualized characteristics or factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Folweiler's complaint alleged that American Family's practice violated the PIP statute, RCW 48.22.005(7) and RCW 48.22.095, and the regulations defining unfair claims settlement practices in WAC 284-30-330. Folweiler also alleged that American Family's claims settlement practice was an unfair practice that violated the CPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 American Family moved to dismiss Folweiler's complaint under CR 12(b)(6). It argued that its practices complied with WAC 284-30-330 and chapter 48.22 RCW. The trial court granted American Family's motion to dismiss. The trial court denied Folweiler's motion for reconsideration.

RCW 48.22.095 establishes minimum PIP coverage limits for automobile insurers. Relevant here, RCW 48.22.095(1)(a) requires insurers to offer automobile insurance policies that provide minimum PIP coverage of $10,000 for \"medical and hospital benefits.\" \"Medical and hospital benefits\" are defined by RCW 48.22.005(7) as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-33\">\n   payments for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the insured for injuries sustained as a result of an automobile accident for health care services provided by persons licensed under Title 18 RCW, including pharmaceuticals, prosthetic devices and eyeglasses, and necessary ambulance, hospital, and professional nursing service. Medical and hospital benefits are payable for expenses incurred within three years from the date of the automobile accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 On its face, RCW 48.22.095(1)(a) and RCW 48.22.005(7) require payment of \"all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the insured.\" The statutes necessarily impose a duty to look at each claim individually in order to determine the reasonable and necessary expenses for the\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   . The law requires an individualized assessment rather than substituting a formulaic approach that pays only 80 percent of the average charge for a large geographic area. Folweiler's complaint alleged American Family's claim settlement process violates the duty to conduct an individualize assessment by failing to consider and independently evaluate the identity, background, credentials, experience or any personal characteristic of the individual provider or whether the amount charged was reasonable for the individual treatment provided. The allegations in Folweiler's complaint are sufficient to establish an unfair act in violation of the CPA based on a violation of the public interest embodied in RCW 48.22.095(1)(a) and RCW 48.22.005(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 Folweiler's complaint also alleged that American Family's claim settlement process is an unfair and contrary to WAC 284-30-330. Chapter 284-30 WAC defines \"certain minimum standards which, if violated with such frequency as to indicate a general business\n   practice, will be deemed to constitute unfair claims settlement practices.\" WAC 284-30-300. WAC 284-30-330 identifies specific unfair claims settlement practices and includes: \"[f]lailing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies,\" and \"[r]efusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation.\" WAC 284-30-330(3) and (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Consistent with the statutory duty discussed above, reading WAC 284-30-330(3) and (4) together unequivocally establishes a duty to actually investigate and conduct a reasonable investigation of claims. Again, this requires an individualized assessment and not simply applying a geographic based formula to each claim regardless of the individual circumstances.
