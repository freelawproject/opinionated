During jury selection, Carroll challenged for cause the seating of Prospective Juror 35 (\n   <strong>\n    Juror 35\n   </strong>\n   ) and Prospective Juror 48 (\n   <strong>\n    Juror 48\n   </strong>\n   ). Carroll alleged that the voir dire examination had revealed preconceived biases of Juror 35 and Juror 48 that threatened their ability to sit as impartial jurors in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Carroll's challenges were largely based on both jurors' exposure to pre-trial media coverage that had discussed the incident involving the statue, and their somewhat ambiguous responses regarding their ability to be impartial should they be selected as jurors. Carroll also questioned Juror 48's ability to be impartial based on her disclosure of prior discussions about the incident with her children awhile back, who had expressed their displeasure about the incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court allowed for separate questioning of prospective Jurors 35 and 48, respectively, to investigate whether they could be fair and impartial. Ultimately, the Circuit Court was satisfied with both jurors' overall responses, noting that each had expressed that they were fairly certain that they could disregard any prior information regarding the case, or any preliminary decisions concerning Carroll's alleged involvement. As such, Carroll's challenges to Juror 35 and Juror 48 for cause were denied. At the conclusion of jury selection, Carroll elected to use all three of his allotted peremptory challenges, two of which were used to excuse Juror 35 and Juror 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During trial, the State presented testimony by Robert \"Bobby\" Yamada (\n   <strong>\n    Yamada\n   </strong>\n   ) about the Kamehameha I statue. Yamada, who is a construction manager by trade and licensed general contractor, testified that he was part of the Kamehameha Statue Committee that installed the statue in its current place. As general contractor for the project, Yamada was familiar with the bronze statue and the attached bronze spear, which were the subject property in Counts 1 and 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   After examination by both parties, the Circuit Court qualified Yamada to render an opinion as an estimator and general contractor over Carroll's objection. Yamada proceeded to offer testimony regarding his opinion of the replacement cost of the piece of the statue that was stolen, and the approximate cost to repair the portions of the statue damaged in the alleged incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State also offered the testimony of Patrick Ehrenlechner (\n   <strong>\n    Ehrenlechner\n   </strong>\n   ) to testify about the property involved in Count 3\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the instant case. Ehrenlechner testified that as Manager of Bayfront Motors, he was familiar with the pipe and chain that were allegedly taken from Bayfront Motors' property, and estimated its value at approximately $135.00. Ehrenlechner based his estimate on the original price he paid to purchase the pipe and chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the conclusion of the State's case in chief, Carroll made a motion for judgment of acquittal, asserting that the State had failed to prove the necessary elements of each charge, specifically the requisite costs or value of the items allegedly damaged and stolen. The Circuit Court denied Carroll's motion, finding that the testimony elicited from the State regarding the valuation of the property was sufficient for the jury to consider in determining whether the elements of the charges were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury subsequently found Carroll guilty of all charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 26, 2016, the Circuit Court sentenced Carroll to an indeterminate term of incarceration of five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Challenges to Jurors.\n   </strong>\n   We review the Circuit Court's decision to pass a juror for cause under the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As to Carroll's first point of error, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carroll's motion to excuse Juror 35 and Juror 48 for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Generally, the trial court's exercise of its discretion to excuse or retain a prospective juror is governed by HRS \u00a7 612-7 (2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   which includes excusing a prospective juror for \"good cause.\" HRS \u00a7 612-7. Here, Carroll contends that good cause existed to excuse Juror 35 and Juror 48 because both had been exposed to adverse pre-trial media coverage and outside information that impaired their ability to serve as impartial jurors in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The constitutional guarantee of a right to a trial by an impartial jury requires the jury to be \"substantially free from the biasing effects of inflammatory pre-trial publicity\".\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such media coverage is primarily factual, as opposed to being a \"barrage of inflammatory publicity immediately prior to trial amounting to a huge ... wave of public passion\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n    at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n    276 P.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Juror 48's disclosure of her prior conversations of the case with her children is of similar character. Juror 48 had indicated that her children were very upset that the statue had been damaged, however as articulated by the Circuit Court, such sentiment was not different from how most members of the public may have felt about the incident. Accordingly, none of the outside influences on Jurors 35 and 48 rose to the level of presumed prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record also does not show that Jurors 35 and 48 had exhibited \"actual partiality or hostility that could not be laid aside\" such that actual prejudice existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312288\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/91/#p101\">\n    276 P.3d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although both jurors had offered ambiguous, and at times contradictory, responses regarding their ability to act impartially, both eventually, and to the Circuit Court's satisfaction, expressed a degree of certainty that they were able to perform as competent jurors. Juror 48 had indicated to the Circuit Court that she was ninety percent certain that she could set aside any identified bias that she may have if she were selected. Juror 35 similarly expressed that she was eighty percent certain that she could do the same. Also, in the State's examination of Juror 48, she had expressly indicated that she would find the defendant innocent if she were asked to decide the case prior to any presentation of evidence. In response to the same inquiry by defense counsel, Juror 35 also explicitly stated that she would find Carroll innocent in such circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carroll's challenges to Juror 35 and Juror 48 for cause. Additionally, because we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion, we need not reach the inquiry of whether Carroll's right to exercise a peremptory challenge was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Carroll contends that the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion for Judgment of Acquittal because the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the monetary value element for each charge, specifically the value of the properties stolen and/or damaged in the instant offenses. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the Theft in the Second Degree charge, the State had to prove the value of the stolen portion of the bronze spear exceeded $300.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 708-831(1)(b). \"[V]alue means the market value of the property or services at the time and place of the offense,\n   <em>\n    or the replacement cost\n   </em>\n   if the market value of the property or services cannot be determined.\" HRS \u00a7 708-801(1) (2014) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the State offered the testimony of Yamada, who was familiar with the materials and costs of the statue, and was involved in both its installation and repair. The Circuit Court allowed Yamada to render an opinion as a licensed general contractor and estimator, and he accordingly offered testimony of his opinion of the replacement cost and repair cost of the portion of the bronze spear that was allegedly stolen, both of which exceeded the statutory minimum value required to find Carroll guilty of Theft in the Second Degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Yamada was not qualified as an expert in the field of fine arts or sculptures, expert testimony is not required to establish the value of stolen property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, Yamada's testimony of both the replacement cost and repair cost of the stolen bronze spear was sufficient evidence to support Carroll's conviction of Theft in the Second Degree in Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although Count 2 eventually merged with Count 1, we similarly conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support Carroll's conviction of Criminal Property Damage in the Second Degree. For this offense, the State was required to establish that, by means other than fire, Carroll had intentionally or knowingly damaged the property of another, without the other's consent, in an amount exceeding $1,500.00. HRS \u00a7 708-821(1)(b). We have previously held that evidence of the cost of reasonable repairs is an appropriate means to establish the amount of damages as an element of the crime of criminal property damage.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, Yamada estimated the repair cost for the damages inflicted to the body of the statue at $3,500.00.

For this offense, the State was required to establish that the value of the stolen pipe and chain exceeded $100.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 708-832(1)(a). At trial, the State offered the testimony of Ehrenlechner, the Manager of Bayfront Motors, to testify about the approximate market value of the stolen property. Ehrenlechner estimated the aggregate value of the stolen pipe and chain at approximately $135.00 based on the price that he had originally paid for the materials in 2010 or 2011. Although Ehrenlechner's estimate of the pipe and chain was not based on the current market price, it was still adequate evidence for the trier of fact to determine whether the stolen property's value exceeded $100.00 at the time of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kahele-Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20430844\">\n    2017 WL 430844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5-6 (holding that complainant's testimony that the contents of stolen bag were purchased for more than $300 was sufficient to prove the value element in Theft in the Second Degree).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial on the value of the stolen portion of the bronze spear, the damage inflicted to the statue, and the value of the stolen pipe and chain, taken in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude Carroll's guilt as to all three counts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juhn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262760\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/83/472/#p481\">\n    83 Hawai'i at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262760\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/83/472/#p481\">\n    927 P.2d at 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Sentencing.\n   </strong>\n   Finally, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Carroll to the indeterminate five-year term of incarceration.

The \"Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint\" charged Carroll in Count 3 with Theft in the Third Degree under HRS \u00a7 708-832(1)(a). The Judgment, however, incorrectly references \"HRS \u00a7 708-831(1)\" for Count 3, Theft in the Third Degree, in the list of original charges and the charges under which Carroll was convicted. In turn, the Mittimus incorrectly references Count 3 by referring to \"HRS \u00a7 708-832(a)(a)\". The parties do not dispute that Carroll was convicted for Theft in the Third Degree under HRS \u00a7 708-832(1)(a). As set forth\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , we will remand this case for correction of these typographic errors in the Judgment and Mittimus.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    HRS \u00a7 708-821(1)(b) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     \u00a7 708-821 Criminal property damage in the second degree.\n    </strong>\n    (1) A person commits the offense of criminal property damage in the second degree if by means other than fire:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    (b) The person intentionally or knowingly damages the property of another, without the other's consent, in an amount exceeding $1,500;....\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    During voir dire examination Juror 48 indicated that her daughter and son-in-law work at the Hawaiian language immersion school Nawahiokalani'opu'uiki, where her grandchildren attend as well.

Accordingly, Count 1 and Count 2 were merged, and the State proceeded to sentence Carroll under Count 1, Theft in the Second Degree, and Count 3, Theft in the Third Degree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    HRS \u00a7 612-7 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     \u00a7 612-7 Excused when, for cause.\n    </strong>\n    A prospective juror shall not be excused by a court for slight or trivial cause, but only when it appears that jury duty would entail a serious personal hardship, or that for other good cause the prospective juror should be excused either temporarily or otherwise.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    HRS \u00a7 708-801(1) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     \u00a7 708-801 Valuation of property or services.\n    </strong>\n    Whenever the value of property or services is determinative of the class or grade of an offense, or otherwise relevant to a prosecution, the following shall apply:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value of the property or services at the time and place of the offense, or the replacement cost if the market value of the property or services cannot be determined.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We note that the actual replacement and repair costs to both the spear and the statue could not be ascertained at trial because the services and materials used to restore the statue were volunteered and donated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    HRS \u00a7 706-606 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     \u00a7 706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.\n    </strong>\n    The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    (1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    (2) The need for the sentence imposed:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    (a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    (b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    (c) To protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    (d) To provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    (3) The kinds of sentences available; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    (4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
