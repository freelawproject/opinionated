Trial Proceedings and Relevant Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b63] Jesus Manzanares, M.D.T., J.T., and M.M.T. are the biological children of Mrs. Larkins' sister, Laura Trujillo, who lives in Colorado. Authorities in Colorado removed the minor children from Ms. Trujillo and placed them with Mrs. Larkins (M.D.T. in 1998; M.M.T. and J.T. in 2007). Jesus Manzanares moved in with the Larkins in 2011. He turned 18 on January 25, 2012. Another child, J.K., and his mother, lived with the Larkins for approximately six months in 2010 and 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Mental and Physical Injuries to J.T.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b64] When they lived on 10th Street, Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins would punish J.T. by requiring him to hold onto the washer and dryer while Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins spanked him. They would either use a \"brown belt or the black belt.\" Mrs. Larkins would use both belts to spank J.T., while Mr. Larkins would \"sometimes\" use the black belt. When Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins used the belts to spank J.T., it would leave bruises on J.T.'s bottom, back, and legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b65] Occasionally, Mrs. Larkins would wet the belt with water before hitting J.T. with it. Mrs. Larkins would also wrap the belt around J.T.'s neck and lift him off the ground by the belt. Mrs. Larkins would tighten the belt around J.T.'s neck so that he could not breathe or talk, leaving red marks on J.T.'s neck. At other times, both Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins would hit J.T. with a wooden backscratcher as punishment. As with the belts, the backscratcher would cause \"dark bruises\" on J.T.'s bottom and legs. In addition to the beatings, both Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins would tell J.T. that they \"didn't want to see his face again, that he was worthless, and that he wasn't part of the family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b66] In late April 2015, M.D.T. showed her school psychologist some pictures of bruises on J.T.'s bottom that Mrs. Larkins had inflicted with a belt the day before, at the 10th Street address. The psychologist reported the abuse to authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b67] Jennifer Stowers, J.T.'s counselor, began seeing him in September 2015 after he was removed from the Larkins' home. As part of her examination, Ms. Stowers was \"made aware that there was some past trauma in his history,\" which included \"physical abuse.\" J.T. talked with her about \"getting hit with a belt ... [and] being yelled at.\" Ms. Stowers diagnosed J.T. with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on J.T.'s \"hypervigilance,\" \"hyperalertness,\" and \"dissociation.\" This caused J.T. to have \"tantrums\" where \"he would go into his room [at the foster home] and ... start yelling out things, like he wasn't feeling like he was loved and stuff like that.\" The PTSD also caused J.T. to have a \"diminished interest in participation in significant activities.\" During their sessions, J.T. would \"emotionally almost shut down\" when Ms. Stowers would try to discuss the abuse. During one session, J.T. became upset because a mask he saw in the office's playroom looked like Mr. Larkins. Ms. Stowers testified that, notwithstanding J.T.'s PTSD, he generally \"functions normally,\" but that he was \"emotionally ... very flat,\" and \"not very good at expressing his emotions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Mental Injuries to M.D.T.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b68] M.D.T. testified about witnessing Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins physically abuse her younger siblings and Jesus. Most of the beatings M.D.T. witnessed occurred at the 10th Street address. She recalled how they would beat J.T. on \"almost ... a daily basis.\" She watched Mrs. Larkins use a wet belt to whip J.T., and saw her use a belt to choke J.T. She witnessed both Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins beat J.T. with the wooden backscratcher. M.D.T. saw the bruises and welts these beatings left on J.T.'s bottom and lower back. She remembered one occasion when she watched Mr. Larkins beat J.T. with the backscratcher as J.T. screamed for help. She characterized these episodes as \"very traumatizing.\" On one occasion, at the Merritt Road house, M.D.T. tried to intervene while Mrs. Larkins was choking J.T. with the belt, but Mrs. Larkins pushed M.D.T. into a wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b69] At the West Winds address, M.D.T. also watched the Larkins spank her younger sister, M.M.T., and later saw the bruises the beatings left on M.M.T. She also saw Mr. Larkins, at the West Winds address, whip J.K. with a belt while he called for help, leaving marks and bruises on J.K.'s back and behind his ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b610] M.D.T. testified that once Mrs. Larkins choked her with her hand. Both Mr. and Mrs. Larkins would also call her \"stupid\" and \"fat.\" These verbal attacks made her feel \"lonely,\" \"worthless,\" and \"alone\" to the\n   point that she wanted to die. M.D.T. lived with these feelings every day. Sometimes she would cope by cutting herself or making herself throw up. Despite the abuse she witnessed, M.D.T. was reluctant to tell anyone for fear of losing the only family she had known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b611] After M.D.T. was removed from the Larkins' home, she lived at the Cathedral Home in Laramie. Stacey Scholl, the therapist at Cathedral Home, diagnosed M.D.T. with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Ms. Scholl relied on the reports of the abuse M.D.T. witnessed to diagnose her with PTSD. Because of her mental illnesses, M.D.T. had a difficult time \"processing her emotions[,] ... connecting with others, ... [and] function[ing] at times within her [social environment].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Abuse of Jesus Manzanares\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b612] Jesus was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. He has a hole in his spine and water on his brain. When he was younger, he had to have his right foot amputated. He has a shunt from his brain to his stomach and uses a wheelchair to get around. He also suffers from anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b613] In approximately 2011, when he was 17 years old, Jesus went to live with the Larkins in Cheyenne. Because of his disabilities, when Jesus would have particularly bad bowel movements, he would need help cleaning up, but did not ask Mr. Larkins or Mrs. Larkins for help because he \"already knew what [the] answer was going to be.\" Jesus' grandmother testified that Jesus \"has a hard time ... doing things for himself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b614] M.D.T. testified that she would help Jesus clean himself. The Larkins, however, refused to help Jesus clean himself. Instead, they would get \"extremely angry\" at Jesus and call him \"worthless\" and \"crippled.\" While in the basement at the Merritt Road house, M.D.T. saw Mrs. Larkins pull Jesus out of his wheelchair and beat him with her hands. Later that day, after Mr. Larkins returned home, he told Jesus that he was \"worthless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b615] On another occasion in the basement, Mrs. Larkins pushed Jesus to the ground for having a bowel movement on the couch. Jesus had another bowel movement in the garage and Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins made him wash his clothes in the garage sink by hand without any gloves, while they berated him and told him that he was \"sickening.\" Mr. Larkins also \"knocked\" him on his head because of his occasional incontinence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Physical Abuse of J.K.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b616] J.K. and his mother lived with the Larkins at the West Winds address for approximately six months in 2010 and 2011. J.K.'s mother gave Mr. Larkins permission to discipline J.K. while she was at work. Mr. Larkins obliged and would punish J.K. for not doing his chores or for being disrespectful to Mrs. Larkins. As punishment, Mr. Larkins would require J.K. to get in the \"front-lean rest position,\" a push-up position J.K. was required to hold with his arms extended until Mr. Larkins allowed him to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b617] In January 2011, while being punished this way, J.K. could not hold the position because of an unrelated shoulder injury. As further punishment, Mr. Larkins used a belt to whip J.K. on his back and punched him on the side of the head. The belt left bruises on J.K.'s back and Mr. Larkins' hand left a mark on the side of J.K.'s head. The next day at school, J.K. reported the abuse to the school nurse and to Deputy Michael Poteet of the Laramie County Sheriff's Office. Deputy Poteet took pictures of J.K.'s injuries. Mr. Larkins was arrested shortly after, but the Laramie County District Attorney's Office dismissed the charges for insufficient evidence. The State refiled this charge against Mr. Larkins after the other children came forward with their accounts of abuse in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Recordings of Mr. Larkins' and Mrs. Larkins' Interviews with Detective Johnson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b618] Detective Zach Johnson of the Cheyenne Police Department interviewed separately Mrs. Larkins and Mr. Larkins during his investigation of the abuse allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Those interviews were played, without objection, to the jury. Mr. Larkins' interview, conducted at the Cheyenne Police Department, was a video recording, while Mrs. Larkins' interview was conducted at her home and was an audio recording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b619] The State played Mr. Larkins' interview first. In it, Detective Johnson repeatedly asked Mr. Larkins if he thought the children were lying. Mr. Larkins said that he did. He also told Detective Johnson, \"Have I thought of beating their a** until bloody? Yes, I have. ... Have I? No.\" When the conversation turned to the phrase \"reasonable corporal punishment,\" Detective Johnson told Mr. Larkins that it meant \"legal punishment,\" \"physical, spanking, things like that,\" to which Mr. Larkins responded: \"We'll beat their a**, yeah .... We'll spank their a**, we'll beat their a**, yeah.\" Mr. Larkins clarified, however, that he meant only with their hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b620] During the interview, Detective Johnson stated that \"I don't have a dog in this fight,\" and that he was only \"the finder of fact.\" He also stated that he did not \"want to have to tell [the people he has to report to] ... we have this evidence, but [Mr. Larkins] and [Mrs. Larkins] said no, that never happened.\" At the end of the interview, when Detective Johnson discussed the backscratcher and some earlier statements Mr. Larkins had made regarding the backscratcher, Mr. Larkins stated, \"We have a lawyer for that,\" and ended the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b621] In both interviews, Detective Johnson discussed how all the children were forensically interviewed. He asserted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I'm also trained in forensic interview[s]. I didn't do these forensic interviews ... but I'm actually trained in them too. And you can tell when the kids have been coached as opposed to when they actually have contextual details [inaudible] to things that have happened, because they'll be able to say, yes, this happened but they won't be able to describe it. They won't be able to give things around it. So there's no signs of coaching or anything like that. So that's why -- they're credible statements from the children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   There's 20 some thousand research articles by psychiatrists and people like that, people way smarter than I'll ever be, that research forensic interviewing of children that actually show forensic interview of a child is more credible than a statement from you or me as an adult because of how the information is gathered.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b622] In addition, during her interview, Mrs. Larkins referenced \"the whole civil stuff with the DA's office\" and that she had a separate attorney for that matter. Towards the middle of the interview, Mrs. Larkins also stated, \"this is where I'd like my lawyer.\" However, she then immediately told Detective Johnson that they could keep talking, and the interview continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b623] After the State played Mr. Larkins' interview, and while it was playing Mrs. Larkins' interview, the district court, outside the presence of the jury, voiced its concerns about some of the statements contained in the interviews. The court observed that, in both interviews, Detective Johnson appeared to be vouching for the children's credibility, and that, in Mr. Larkins' interview, the jury heard him request counsel and \"invoke[ ] ... his right to remain silent.\" Both Mr. Larkins' and Mrs. Larkins' counsel told the court that they had reviewed the recordings, identified those issues, and had decided that they would not object to playing the recordings. Mr. Larkins' counsel stated that she \"thought there were a lot of good things that came out for us on that video.\" Similarly, Mrs. Larkins' counsel told the court that she wanted the recording played because it helped establish that Mrs. Larkins' defense-that these incidents did not happen-had been consistent from the beginning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b624] The district court then asked each defense counsel if they wished to have the court issue a limiting instruction about some of the objectionable material in the recordings. Neither counsel requested a limiting instruction because they did not want to draw further attention to the objectionable material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Charges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b625] In fall 2015, after M.D.T. had reported the abuse of J.T. in late April 2015, the State charged Mr. Larkins with one count of causing physical injury to J.K, in Docket No. 32-780. Then, in Docket No. 32-782, the State charged Mr. Larkins with two counts of physical injury to J.T., one count of mental injury to J.T., one count of physical injury to M.M.T., one count of mental injury to M.M.T., one count of mental injury to M.D.T., and one count of abuse of a vulnerable adult regarding Jesus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Docket No. 32-781, the State charged Mrs. Larkins with three counts of physical injury to J.T., one count of mental injury to J.T., one count of physical injury to M.M.T., one count of mental injury to M.M.T., one count of mental injury to M.D.T., and one count of abuse of a vulnerable adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b626] The State moved, without objection, to join all three dockets for trial. The district court granted the State's motion, all three dockets were joined, and they proceeded to trial together. Towards the close of the evidence at trial, with no objection, the State moved to amend the Information to clarify the specific acts that it alleged constituted the physical injury to J.T. The district court granted the request. Thus, the charges, as they were submitted to the jury, other than those regarding M.M.T.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    J.T.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Larkins\n   </em>\n   : two counts of physical injury caused between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014: with the black belt and with the backscratcher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Mrs. Larkins\n   </em>\n   : three counts of physical injury: one with the belt and one of choking him with the belt between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014; and one unspecified count for injuries inflicted on April 19, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Both\n   </em>\n   : one count of mental injury caused between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    J.K.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Larkins\n   </em>\n   : one count of physical injury caused on January 13, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    M.D.T.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Both\n   </em>\n   : one count of mental injury caused between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Jesus\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Both\n   </em>\n   : one count of abuse of a vulnerable adult caused between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additional information regarding the charges and testimony relevant to these charges is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Verdict and Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b627] The jury convicted Mr. Larkins of two counts of physical abuse of J.T., one count of mental abuse of J.T., one count of mental abuse of M.D.T., one count of abuse of a vulnerable adult, and one count of physical abuse of J.K. The jury convicted Mrs. Larkins of three counts of physical abuse of J.T., one count of mental abuse of J.T., one count of mental abuse of M.D.T., and one count of abuse of a vulnerable adult. The district court sentenced Mr. Larkins to between three and five years in prison on each count. It ordered three counts to run concurrently, and ordered the remainder to also run concurrently, but suspended the remainder in favor of five years of probation to start after he served his imposed sentence. Thus, Mr. Larkins received an imposed sentence of three to five years in prison, with a consecutive term of probation for five years. The district court sentenced Mrs. Larkins to three concurrent sentences of between 18 and 36 months in prison, and three concurrent sentences of three to five years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The former sentences were imposed, while the latter were suspended in favor of five years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b628] Both Larkins timely appealed the district court's judgments and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Rule 21 Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b629] After the initial appeals in this case were docketed, Mr. Larkins filed a motion for a new trial with the district court under Rule 21 of the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure. He argued that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for three reasons: (1) failing to redact portions of Detective Johnson's interviews; (2) failing to request a bill of particulars; and (3) failing to object to the joinder of Mr. Larkins' two cases, Docket Nos. 32-780 and 32-782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b630] Mrs. Larkins' Rule 21 motion contended that her trial counsel was deficient for two reasons: (1) allowing the unredacted interviews to be played to the jury without objection; and (2) failing to object to the joinder of Mrs. Larkins' case with Mr. Larkins' two cases. On December 20, 2017, the district court conducted a hearing on both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Larkins' Trial Attorney\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b631] Mr. Larkins' attorney testified that she did not object to joinder, in part, because she believed that it was unlikely that the district court would deny the motion. Moreover, joining the case regarding J.K. with the other cases would help her create a picture that the State was \"in hysteria\" because it had initially dismissed the charge regarding J.K. and only decided to bring the case when the other children made reports. She also testified that she concluded that Mr. Larkins \"needed\" Mrs. Larkins' testimony about the family dynamics and history. She shared Mrs. Larkins' theory of defense that M.D.T. had encouraged her siblings to lie. She weighed Mr. Larkins' desire to join the cases and made a \"strategic decision\" to allow joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b632] As to the interview recordings, counsel again made a strategic decision to \"let it all play,\" and \"couldn't believe our luck that they were playing it.\" Mr. Larkins' counsel concluded that the recording's beneficial content outweighed its objectionable material. For example, in the recording Mr. Larkins discussed his belief that the children were lying. Mr. Larkins' counsel also made a strategic decision not to request a limiting instruction from the court because it might call the jury's attention to the objectionable material. Finally, she did not attempt to redact the recordings to remove the vouching and other objectionable material because she was afraid it would cause confusion regarding Mr. Larkins' answers to particular questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b633] As to her decision not to request a bill of particulars, counsel testified that \"We always knew what the counts were -- or what the allegations were. The only confusion was which allegation went with which count. ... It was very clear from the preliminary hearing on what was what.\" Even at the time of the Rule 21 hearing, she believed she \"had everything [ ] needed to prepare for trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mrs. Larkins' Trial Attorney\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b634] Mrs. Larkins' trial counsel discussed her similar theory of defense that the children were lying, and that the children's biological mother had \"put up\" M.D.T. to make up the allegations. Counsel recalled that she, Mr. Larkins, Mrs. Larkins, and Mr. Larkins' trial counsel, all agreed to join the three pending cases for trial. She stated that, by joining the case, she was able to have witnesses, who would otherwise only pertain to Mr. Larkins (e.g., his boss and co-workers), testify about the family dynamics that she believed were beneficial to Mrs. Larkins' case. But she also considered how J.K.'s accusations, against only Mr. Larkins, might negatively impact her case. In the end, however, counsel concluded that the joinder was appropriate and, thus, did not object to the State's motion to join the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [\u00b635] As to the recordings of the interviews, counsel testified that their introduction allowed her to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence which she believed supported Mrs. Larkins' defense. For example, in the interviews both Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins discussed their personal theories that the children were lying and that M.D.T. had concocted the whole story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Despite her knowledge of the vouching in the video, she made a \"strategic decision\" to allow the video into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b636] The district court concluded that both trial counsel had \"strategic reasons to join the cases for trial.\" The Larkins had similar theories of defense and joinder permitted them to use evidence that might otherwise have been inadmissible. The court also stated that \"if the [Larkins] had objected to joinder, th[e] court would likely have overruled their objections\" because Rules 8 and 13 of the Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure\" 'favor joint trials' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Earley v.

In both interviews, the [Larkins] asserted their innocence and denied that they had physically abused any of the children. Furthermore, by offering the statements, counsel could argue that the positions of their clients had always been consistent, from the beginning of the investigation to time of trial. The interviews further allowed the [Larkins] to advance their theory of defense that the oldest daughter, [M.D.T.], had recently been grounded (for wrecking their car), thus establishing that she had a potential motive to leave the home and to encourage her younger siblings to fabricate the allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b638] The district court did not address whether trial counsels' strategic decisions amounted to deficient performance on the part of either counsel. Rather, it concluded that neither Mr. Larkins nor Mrs. Larkins suffered material prejudice because of their counsels' decisions to let the recordings play. The court concluded that, even without the recordings, \"the State ... presented strong evidence of the [Larkins'] guilt to the jury.\" The court referenced the victims' \"credible and detailed testimony of the abuse they suffered,\" the physical evidence presented, and corroboration of the victims' testimony by other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b639] Finally, the district court concluded that Mr. Larkins' argument regarding his attorney's failure to request a bill of particulars could \"be disposed of easily.\" The court cited Mr. Larkins' attorney's testimony at the Rule 21 hearing that \"she was fully informed of the nature of the charges that the State filed against her client.\" The court found neither counsel was ineffective and denied the motions for a new trial. Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins timely appealed, and this Court consolidated the appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

The jury instructions incorporated these essential elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b643] Mr. Larkins argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he used a black belt or backscratcher to cause physical injury to J.T. In addition, he asserts that, even if there was, there is a lack of evidence tying a particular incident to a particular injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b644] J.T. testified that Mr. Larkins would \"sometimes\" use the black belt as punishment if J.T. did not complete his chores. J.T. recalled that the belt would leave bruises on his bottom, back, and legs. Although J.T. said that only Mrs. Larkins would use the backscratcher, his three other siblings all recalled seeing Mr. Larkins use the backscratcher on J.T. Jesus and M.D.T. recalled seeing bruises and welts on J.T.'s bottom and legs after J.T. was hit with the backscratcher. M.D.T. remembered that the beating with the backscratcher \"started\" while they were living at the 10th Street house, where they lived beginning in November 2014.

Given the verdict rendered, it is obvious that the jury believed J.T.'s siblings regarding whether Mr. Larkins used the backscratcher on J.T. On appeal, we do not second-guess that decision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Villarreal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342665\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/512/\">\n    2017 WY 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342665\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/512/\">\n    398 P.3d at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   [\u00b645] When J.T. and his siblings discussed the effects of the beatings with the belt and backscratcher, they discussed the injuries as occurring every time the Larkins used the belt and backscratcher to beat J.T. A reasonable person could conclude that the bruises and welts J.T. and his siblings saw on J.T.'s body were the \"natural and probable consequence\" of the use of a belt and a wooden backscratcher to punish J.T. Based on the testimony and evidence, a reasonable person could conclude that Mr. Larkins caused physical injury to J.T. by beating him with the belt and backscratcher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b646] With respect to the abuse of J.K., Mr. Larkins' briefly argues that the State had previously declined to prosecute the allegations when they arose in 2011, and that the only \"witnesses ... [were] Mr. and [Mrs.] Larkins and J.K.\" A review of the relevant testimony establishes that there was sufficient evidence. J.K. testified that, on January 13, 2011, he was punished for being disrespectful towards Mrs. Larkins. He then recounted how his then existing shoulder injury made it difficult to hold the \"position\" demanded by Mr. Larkins. When he could not hold the position and fell to the floor, Mr. Larkins whipped him with a belt and\n   punched him on the side of the head. J.K. remembered the pain and the bruises on his back and head. Those injuries were documented and corroborated by two other witnesses-the school nurse and Deputy Poteet. We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence that Mr. Larkins intentionally caused physical injury to J.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Larkins' and Mrs. Larkins' Mental Abuse of J.T. and M.D.T.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   [\u00b647] The jury convicted Mr. Larkins of one count of child abuse causing mental injury to J.T. and one count of child abuse causing mental injury to M.D.T. It convicted Mrs. Larkins of the same. All four counts were found to have occurred between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015. This time frame encompassed the period when the Larkins lived at the Merritt Road and 10th Street addresses. The State had to prove that Mr. Larkins' and Mrs. Larkins' conduct was the proximate cause of J.T.'s and M.D.T.'s mental injury between January 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976959\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/304/972/\">\n    2013 WY 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976959\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/304/972/\">\n    304 P.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   [\u00b648] The Larkins do not dispute that the children have mental injuries. Rather, they assert that J.T. and M.D.T. were experiencing mental illnesses before the charged abuse in this case and that those illnesses were substantially similar to those diagnosed after they were removed from the home. Thus, they argue, the evidence was insufficient to establish that their conduct caused J.T.'s and M.D.T.'s mental injuries. In support of their argument, they cite extensively to the testimony of Dr. Mary Ellen Sternitzke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   [\u00b649] Dr. Sternitzke, a licensed psychologist, evaluated M.D.T. in January 2014 and evaluated J.T. in June 2014, at the request of the children's therapist at the time. Dr. Sternitzke noted that M.D.T. \"has a lot of difficulty inhibiting or controlling her behavior\" and \"emotional control problems.\" She diagnosed M.D.T. with depression and PTSD. Dr. Sternitzke opined that M.D.T.'s problems likely stemmed from being exposed to alcohol or drugs as a fetus, as well as having a \"bad experience with a 19-year-old boy.\" At the time of M.D.T.'s evaluation, M.D.T. did not divulge that the Larkins were abusing her or her siblings. M.D.T. also claimed that she had been self-harming since she was twelve- or thirteen-years old (prior to the alleged mental abuse in this case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [\u00b650] Dr. Sternitzke diagnosed J.T. with autism, depression, PTSD, and ADHD. Again, she tied these illnesses to likely fetal alcohol exposure. Dr. Sternitzke recognized that the diagnoses she made in 2014 were substantially similar to those made in 2015 by Ms. Stowers (for J.T.) and Ms. Scholl (for M.D.T.). She also agreed that it is difficult to say, \"with any degree of certainty,\" what causes PTSD in a child. \"Mental injury\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   [A]n injury to the psychological capacity or emotional stability of a child as evidenced by an observable or substantial impairment in [their] ability to function within a normal range of performance and behavior with due regard to [their] culture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-3-202\">\n    Wyo.

She also testified that Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins called her \"fat\" and \"stupid\" and made her want to die. To cope, she resorted to self-harm. M.D.T.'s therapist, Ms. Scholl, diagnosed her with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, caused by the abuse she witnessed.

Both testified that they considered the pro and cons of joinder, and believed, for strategic reasons, that joinder was the better option. For example, Mrs. Larkins' trial counsel testified that, by having Mr. Larkins' cases joined with her case, she could use the testimony of witnesses pertinent to only Mr. Larkins to paint a picture of the family dynamics that she believed was beneficial to Mrs. Larkins. Similarly, Mr. Larkins' trial counsel testified that having the case regarding J.K. joined with his other case would help her create a picture that the State was \"in hysteria\" because it had initially dismissed the charge regarding J.K. and only decided to bring the case when the other children made reports of abuse. In addition, she testified that Mr. Larkins \"needed\" Mrs. Larkins' testimony about the family dynamics and history, since four of the five victims were the biological children of Mrs. Larkins' sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   [\u00b666] The district court relied on this testimony to conclude that both trial counsel made a valid strategic decision to not object to joinder.

Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins employed different methods of injuring J.T., but the jury instructions properly informed the jury of those distinctions. More importantly, the distinctions were not so complex that a jury could not be expected to understand and appropriately \"compartmentalize\" the evidence as it pertained to each defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497953\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/28/17/\">\n    28 P.3d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   [\u00b669] In support of his argument, Mr. Larkins cites to J.K.'s mother's testimony that Mrs. Larkins had \"family in the Mexican biker gang.\" He contends that \"[t]his type of testimony would not have been admissible against Mr. Larkins ....\" We agree that this testimony regarding either Mr. Larkins or Mrs. Larkins was inadmissible. Indeed, when this occurred, the district court sustained an objection from Mr. Larkins' counsel and ordered that the jury not consider it. Nevertheless, in the context of Mr. Larkins' ineffective assistance claim, to establish that counsel was ineffective, a defendant must demonstrate deficient performance at the time it was rendered.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gist v.

The Larkins argue that J.K.'s case was completely different from the other cases. While J.K.'s case only involved him and only involved the abuse inflicted by Mr. Larkins, that, standing alone, is not sufficient to defeat joinder. The allegation regarding Mr. Larkins' abuse of J.K. was not so complex that the jury could not be expected to compartmentalize that evidence and appropriately consider it only against Mr. Larkins, and not be influenced by the other counts against Mr. Larkins and Mrs. Larkins regarding the other children.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dobbins v.

In\n   <em>\n    Hathaway\n   </em>\n   , the detective interviewed the defendant before trial and \"repeatedly stated that he believed [the victim] and did not believe Mr. Hathaway,\" and that \"the evidence showed that the sexual abuse had occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344527\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/399/1240/\">\n    399 P.3d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sweet\n   </em>\n   , whose outcome depended on whether the jury believed the victim (who the Detective vouched for) or the defendant, the evidence against Mr. Hathaway included not only the compelling, consistent testimony of the victim, but also other witnesses who corroborated the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 399 P.3d at 635. Also unlike\n   <em>\n    Sweet\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor in\n   <em>\n    Hathaway\n   </em>\n   did not rely on the impermissible vouching in closing arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38, 399 P.3d at 636.

A search of the [Larkins'] residence resulted in the seizure of the belts and backscratcher which were introduced by the State as evidence. The State also introduced photographs that confirmed the bruising and injuries suffered by [J.T.] in the April 2015 incident, as well as photographs of the bruising and injuries inflicted by [Mr.] Larkins on [J.K.] in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Moreover, the State did not \"rely upon Detective Johnson's vouching comments in either its opening or closing arguments to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   [\u00b677] After reviewing the entire record, we agree with the district court's conclusion. This was not a case, like\n   <em>\n    Sweet\n   </em>\n   , that came down to a credibility determination between the victim and the defendant. Rather, several victims gave credible and detailed testimony about what happened, and numerous witnesses who lived with the Larkins at different times corroborated the abuse. This case also had physical evidence: the devices of abuse, and pictures of J.T.'s and J.K.'s injuries. The children's therapists testified about the mental injuries the children have suffered because of the chronic abuse the Larkins inflicted. The prosecutor did not rely on the vouching in opening or closing, and the recordings did not go back to the jury room during deliberations. And, finally, the district court instructed the jury at least twice that it was the sole decider of a witness's credibility. There is not a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had the vouching been redacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   [\u00b678] It is true that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hathaway\n   </em>\n   , neither trial counsel nor the State asked Detective Johnson to explain on the stand about whether his vouching was an interview technique.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hathaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343329\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/399/625/\">\n    2017 WY 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37, 399 P.3d at 635-36.

Because Mrs. Larkins' appellate counsel did not include any argument regarding the lack of a bill of particulars\n   in her Rule 21 motion, there is no testimony from her trial counsel about her thoughts on the need, or lack thereof, for a bill of particulars. In any event, at the close of the evidence, the district court permitted the State, with defense counsels' agreement, to amend the information to include more specific allegations as it related to the two charges against Mr. Larkins regarding physical injury to J.T., and to two of the three charges against Mrs. Larkins as it related to physical injury to J.T.

A review of the charging documents, after the State amended the physical injury counts regarding J.T., establishes that the Larkins were on adequate notice as to what charges they were required to defend against.

Mrs. Larkins contends on appeal that the following argument in the State's closing made it necessary for counsel to request an instruction that defined mental disability :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   And the question is: Is Jesus Manzanares a vulnerable adult? ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   ...

Mrs. Larkins argues that the reference to Jesus' \"severe anxiety\" made his mental disabilities an issue as it pertained to his status as a vulnerable adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   [\u00b687] However, Mrs. Larkins has never disputed that Jesus was disabled. She admits in her brief that: \"It is inarguable, Mr. Manzanares has a disability and is handicapped[,]\" a reasonable position considering his multiple physical and mental diagnoses. A review of the record establishes that Mrs. Larkins' trial counsel's focus, as it pertained to Jesus' status as a vulnerable adult, was on whether he was unable to attend to his affairs without assistance, not whether he was disabled because of a mental or physical disability. Thus, we cannot conclude that the failure to request an instruction that defined mental disability was deficient performance or sufficiently prejudiced Mrs. Larkins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

We concluded that the comments were meant to directly contradict the arguments propounded by the defense and not a \"personal attack\" on defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342132\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/396/1009/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Carroll v.

The State's attempt to apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   beyond the particular facts of that case is unavailing. It does not stand for the proposition that statements in rebuttal closing, which would otherwise be prosecutorial misconduct, are acceptable if they are in response to statements in defendant's closing. After all, the victim's credibility will often be challenged by the defendant, and such a challenge does not open the door for prosecutorial vouching or sympathy seeking. The argument that the prosecutor made may have been a response to the Larkins' closing arguments, but only served to gain sympathy for the children. This is not to say that a prosecutor cannot respond to the theories propounded by the defense. But a proper response to a defendant's theory of the case is to turn back to the evidence and those reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it that rebut that theory. Couching argument as a \"response\" to the defense does not give the prosecutor license to forgo our rules by retreating to argument calculated to gain sympathy for a victim. Here, the prosecutor did not argue that the defense's theory was unpersuasive because the evidence contradicted it; she argued that the defense's theory was unpersuasive because it \"cheapened and degraded\" the children's experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   [\u00b6104] Finally, the prosecutor's argument that she was speaking for the children because no one else could was also improper. It is axiomatic that the prosecutor does not speak for the victim, but for the community.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346152\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/1045/\">\n    2017 WY 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346152\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/1045/\">\n    405 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1060-61 (citing\n   <em>\n    Berger v.

Again, a prosecutor's obligation in closing argument is to confine their argument to the evidence presented. This obligation is disregarded when the prosecutor resorts to first-person rhetorical devices that seek to elevate their position as a representative of the state to a personal representative for the victim.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   The first person singular rhetorical device had the dual effect of placing the prosecutor in the victim's shoes and turning the prosecutor into [the victim's] personal representative. A prosecutor may no more represent the victim in this fashion than he may urge the jurors to place themselves in the victim's shoes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    Hawthorne v.

Here, the prosecutor attempted to bolster her position with the jury by placing herself, not as a representative of the State, but as a person who is appearing on behalf of the victim. This is not the prosecutor's role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Did Mr. Larkins or Mrs. Larkins Suffer Material Prejudice?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   [\u00b6105] Having determined that the prosecutor committed misconduct in multiple ways when she vouched for M.D.T.'s credibility and when she sought a conviction by appealing to the jury's passions and prejudices, we must now determine whether there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had these errors not occurred. After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the result would not have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   [\u00b6106] The evidence against the Larkins, as the district court recognized in its Rule 21 order, was strong. The State presented, over six days of trial, five victims who gave compelling testimony of the abuse they suffered. The victims' recollections were filled with discrete details of the abuse. The jury saw pictures of some of the abuse inflicted on J.K. and J.T. Moreover, other individuals who lived with the Larkins at various times corroborated the abuse. Comparing this evidence against the misconduct that occurred in closing argument, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had the prosecutor not engaged in misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   [\u00b6107] For the reasons discussed above, the evidence was sufficient, the district court did not err when it denied the Larkins' Rule 21 motions, and, although some of the prosecutor's closing argument amounted to misconduct, it did not materially prejudice either Mr. Larkins or Mrs. Larkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   [\u00b6108] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    In 2010, the Larkins lived at the West Winds trailer park on Williams Street in Cheyenne. Sometime in 2013 or early 2014, they moved to a house on Merritt Road. Finally, from November 2014 through April 30, 2015, they lived on 10th Street. These dates and locations are important because the children sometimes testified that specific abuse occurred at a particular address rather than by date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    It appears from the record that the State played Mr. Larkins' entire interview.
