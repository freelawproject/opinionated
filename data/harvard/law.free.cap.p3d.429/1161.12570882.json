For the following reasons, we conclude that the statute's prevailing-party determination is controlled by whomever prevails on the quiet title claims, and that non-quiet title claims are relevant only for purposes of deciding whether, in the court's discretion, attorneys' fees should be awarded and in what amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Gregory Cook and Cynthia Grebe are neighboring property owners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cook filed a complaint in superior court alleging he adversely possessed Grebe's property by using and maintaining it for more than 15 years. Cook also alleged that Grebe's failure to maintain and secure the property created a private nuisance. Grebe filed counterclaims alleging quiet title, conversion, unjust enrichment, and trespass. After considering competing motions for summary judgment, the superior court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Cook on Grebe's conversion counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Near the end of the jury trial on the remaining claims, the superior court struck Grebe's unjust enrichment claim. The jury found in Grebe's favor on her quiet title counterclaim and Cook's adverse possession claim, and in Cook's favor on his private nuisance claim and Grebe's trespass counterclaim. The court then determined that Grebe was \"the prevailing party for purposes of the adverse possession and quiet title claims\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   and stated she could file an application for attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Grebe requested attorneys' fees in the amount of $82,726.75, which Cook opposed, asserting Grebe was not entitled to recover fees for claims on which she did not prevail. In its ruling, the court explained that Grebe was \"deemed the prevailing party in this matter for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103\" and entered a fee award of $50,000. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Generally, a court may award attorneys' fees only when authorized by statute or by agreement of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

He contends the litigation was, at best, a draw. But Cook's position fails to acknowledge the legislature's word choices in describing the circumstances in which a party may recover attorneys' fees in litigation involving quiet title disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B) (explaining the prerequisites for recovery of attorneys' fees in an \"\n   <em>\n    action to quiet title to real property\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). The word \"action,\" by itself, has a broad meaning that may encompass any court matter or proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 1-215(1) (\" 'Action' includes any matter or proceeding in a court, civil or criminal.\"). However, \u00a7 12-1103(B) refers to an \"action to quiet title to real property,\" indicating it is limited to that specific kind of proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See Action to Quiet Title,\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"[A] proceeding to establish a plaintiff's title to land by compelling the adverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever estopped from asserting it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Section 12-1101(A) supports this conclusion because it limits a quiet title action to parties who wish to assert their interest in a property's title against those with an adverse interest in the title, thereby resolving or quieting the competing interests. Therefore, under \u00a7 12-1103(B), the determination of who is the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorneys' fees turns on whether a party successfully quieted title, regardless of whether claims that do not involve quieting title are included in the same lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCleary v. Tripodi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20197\">\n    243 Ariz. 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202, \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%201191\">\n    403 P.3d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1196-97 (App. 2017) (explaining that \"[a] party successfully quieting title may recover attorney fees if\" he or she complies with the requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 It is undisputed that the jury found in Grebe's favor on the competing quiet title claims. Accordingly, the superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding she was the prevailing party with regard to the attorneys' fee provision of \u00a7 12-1103(B). Contrary to Cook's assertion, the court had no reason to look further than the quiet title and adverse possession claims because they are the only claims in this lawsuit that involved quieting title to the property. Cook's private nuisance claim and Grebe's conversion, unjust enrichment, and trespass counterclaims are not claims affecting title; they are relevant only in determining whether the court should award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, and if so, in what amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Mem'l Health Sys., Inc. v.

As the prevailing party on appeal, we award taxable costs to Grebe; we also grant Grebe's request for reasonable attorneys' fees incurred on appeal under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B), subject to compliance with Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Grebe's husband, John Meadows, is also a party to the litigation, but the property is titled only in Grebe's name. For ease of reference, and because this opinion centers on the quiet title claims, we refer only to Grebe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Both parties cite cases involving awards of attorneys' fees made pursuant to contractual provisions or A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01(A), arguing they prevailed under the tests employed in those contexts (e.g., based on \"percentage of success\" and \"totality of the litigation\"). But such cases are not helpful for determining which party prevailed under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1103(B) because its language, applicable only to \"action[s] to quiet title,\" is much more restrictive than A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01(A), which authorizes fee awards in \"any action arising out of a contract.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
