On January 10, 2015, Carter engaged in a crime spree that included carjacking a sport utility vehicle (SUV) belonging to C.L., burglarizing a home and barn owned by J.S. and R.S. and stealing\n   some of their property, and taking a tractor belonging to E.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 With respect to the SUV carjacking, C.L. was sitting in the vehicle's passenger seat in a store's parking lot, waiting for her husband, when Carter entered the driver's side door, told C.L. to get out, and quickly drove away, causing C.L. to fall out of the vehicle and break her leg. Carter subsequently crashed the SUV, valued at $18,000, causing its total loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Sometime after Carter crashed the SUV, United States Border Patrol agents assisting in the investigation found him sitting on E.A.'s tractor, valued at more than $25,000. Carter made eye contact with one of the agents and drove away. The agent followed with his emergency lights activated, and Carter eventually stopped in the middle of a field where he was taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 That day, J.S. and R.S. had been in the mountains but returned between 4 and 5 p.m. to find both their home and barn had been burglarized.

For the crimes committed against E.A., Carter was charged with and convicted of burglary, vehicle theft, and theft of property valued at more than $25,000.

Instead, the legislature clearly intended to provide an alternative penalty for vehicle theft-from one that varied based on value, under \u00a7 13-1802, to a standardized, class three felony under \u00a7 13-1814-and not to impose cumulative penalties under both statutes for a single offense.
