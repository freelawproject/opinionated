It is undisputed that everyone involved-Patricelli, Patricelli's family and friends, and DOC-knew that Miller had physically abused Patricelli in the past and would likely do so again if they resumed their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 They did resume that relationship. But Patricelli hid the renewed relationship from her friends, family members, and DOC. In fact, Patricelli explicitly assured DOC that she was not in a relationship with Miller, that she was moving to a place where he could not find her, and that she would call the police if she saw him. Miller's mother also verified in writing that he was sleeping at her home, though it turns out that he was actually living with Patricelli.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The question here is whether DOC is liable for Patricelli's death, despite Patricelli's, Miller's, and his mother's active and successful efforts to prevent DOC from knowing that Miller was in contact with Patricelli. The parties agree that DOC had a duty to supervise Miller while he was on probation and that DOC is not liable unless its supervision constitutes \"gross negligence.\" RCW 9.95.204(4) ; RCW 72.09.320. But the parties disagree on whether DOC's actions rose to the level of gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The trial court dismissed on summary judgment.

It ruled that DOC's failure to take additional steps to verify Patricelli's statements or Miller's housing arrangements could qualify as gross negligence.

At the time of the murder, DOC was supervising Miller pursuant to two misdemeanor convictions; one of the convictions included an order barring Miller from contacting Patricelli\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    A. King County Superior Court, No. 10-1-03032-4 KNT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Miller had a lengthy criminal history. In 2010, the superior court sentenced Miller to 12 months in jail for a misdemeanor violation of a court order barring him from contacting Patricelli. CP at 80, 980. The superior court suspended that sentence on condition that Miller serve 180 days in jail and submit to 24 months of DOC-supervised probation. CP at 80-81. In addition to probation, the superior court imposed various conditions, ordering Miller to (1) \"enter into, make reasonable progress and successfully complete a state certified domestic violence treatment program,\" (2) \"commit no criminal offenses,\" and (3) \"comply with the standard rules and regulations of supervision.\" CP at 81-82.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 DOC imposed numerous additional conditions, including that Miller (1) remain within King County, (2) obtain written permission before leaving King County or Washington State, (3) notify DOC before changing residences or employment, (4) abide by written or verbal instructions issued by his community corrections officer, (5) inform DOC of any prescribed medications, (6) not operate a vehicle without a license, (7) not possess or consume alcohol or controlled substances, (8) not frequent places where liquor is sold, (9) submit to breath alcohol concentration and urinalysis testing, (10) complete requested chemical dependency evaluations, (11) complete a mental health evaluation and enter into treatment as directed, (12) not change treatment providers without prior DOC approval, and (13) consent to home visits. CP at 576.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Because the probation period \"tolled during any period of confinement,\" CP at 81, it remained in effect at the time of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    B. King County Superior Court, No. 12-1-00643-8 KNT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 In 2011, during an argument about Miller's infidelity, Miller pushed Patricelli, punched her in the eye, and threatened to kill her. CP at 1051-52. Miller pleaded guilty to felony harassment and misdemeanor assault. CP at 84 (felony harassment), 93 (misdemeanor assault).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 For the felony harassment, the superior court gave Miller a special drug offender sentencing alternative (DOSA). CP at 88. That DOSA required Miller to undergo residential chemical dependency treatment for 3 to 6 months, followed by 24 months of community custody supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The superior court memorialized the sentence in a felony judgment and sentence (J&amp;S). CP at 84-89. But that court subsequently revoked Miller's DOSA, resentenced him to 366 days of confinement, and rescinded the terms of community custody. CP at 97-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 For the misdemeanor assault, the superior court sentenced Miller to 364 days in jail but suspended it all on condition that Miller serve only a few days in jail and submit to 24 months of DOC-supervised probation. CP at 93-95. The superior court ordered the following probation conditions: (1) \"\n   <em>\n    have no contact with\n   </em>\n   [ ]\n   <em>\n    Tricia Patricelli per the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    separate no-contact order\n   </em>\n   ],\" (2) \"comply with the standard rules and regulations of supervision,\" (3) \"commit no criminal offenses,\" and (4) \"abide by conditions on [the DOSA].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The cross-referenced DOSA conditions were to (1) \"not use illegal controlled substances,\" (2) \"not use any alcohol or controlled substances without prescription,\" (3) \"report as directed to a community corrections officer,\" (4) \"[p]ay all court ordered legal financial obligations,\" and again, (5) \"\n   <em>\n    have no contact with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tricia Patricelli per the separate\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    no-contact order\n   </em>\n   ].\" CP at 88-89 (emphasis added). The superior court memorialized the sentence in a separate misdemeanor J&amp;S under the same cause number as the felony. CP at 93-95. The 2012 conviction's probation period, like the 2010 conviction's probation period, was \"tolled during any period of confinement.\" CP at 93-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The separate no-contact order barred Miller from contacting Patricelli for five years, although it gave Miller permission to call and visit with her while he was in custody and enrolled in treatment. CP at 101. As mentioned above, the superior court directly incorporated by reference this no-contact order as a sentence condition in the misdemeanor J&amp;S. CP at 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 The no-contact order says that Miller (1) \"shall not cause, attempt, or threaten to cause bodily injury to, assault, sexually assault, harass, stalk, or keep under surveillance [Tricia Patricelli],\" (2) \"shall not contact the protected person, directly, indirectly, in person or through others, by phone, mail or electronic means, except for mailing or service of process of court documents through a third party, or contact by the defendant's lawyers,\" and (3) \"shall not knowingly enter, remain, or come within 1000 feet ... of the [protected person or that] person's residence, school, [or] workplace, ... [e]xcept the defendant may have telephonic contact with the protected person and may be visited by the protected person while in custody and in treatment after the [b]lack out [p]eriod.\" CP at 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 In addition to the court-ordered conditions, DOC required Miller to (1) \"[w]ork at a DOC approved education, employment, and/or community restitution,\" (2) \"[n]ot possess or consume controlled substances except pursuant to lawfully issued prescriptions,\" (3) \"[p]ay supervision fees as determined by the DOC,\" (4) \"[r]eceive prior approval for living arrangements and residence location,\" (5) \"[n]ot own, use, or possess a firearm or ammunition,\" (6) \"[n]otify [his community custody supervisor] of any change in address or employment,\" (7) \"[u]pon request of the DOC, notify [it] of court-ordered treatment,\" and (8) \"not consume any alcohol.\" CP at 577.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 On October 15, 2012, Miller completed his felony sentence and was released. CP at 1125. Fifteen days later, he killed Patricelli. CP at 575. As outlined above and discussed below, the record shows that during those 15 days, DOC was actively supervising Miller on both the 2010 misdemeanor probation, which had very few conditions, and the 2012 misdemeanor probation, which included a no-contact order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2. DOC communicated with Patricelli several times prior to Miller's release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Before Miller was released on the balance of his 2010 and 2012 misdemeanor probation terms, Angella Coker, a victim services liaison from DOC, contacted Patricelli four times to inform her of Miller's impending release and to help her develop a safety plan. CP at 138-39. Patricelli assured Coker that she did not intend to resume her relationship with Miller and that she planned to move without informing Miller of her new address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Coker also wrote a letter, which Patricelli had requested, confirming Patricelli's status as a domestic violence victim so that she could relocate without a penalty for terminating her lease. CP at 139, 162. Although Coker knew Patricelli planned to move, she did not ask Patricelli for her new address because \"people frequently tell [her] they are moving, but do not do so\" and because she \"did not want to create a record of that new location.\" CP at 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Patricelli did not relocate immediately. On October 17, two days after Miller was released, Patricelli told Coker that she was in the \" 'process of moving.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Patricelli reassured Coker that there were \" 'no problems' \" and that she was \" 'prepared to call police if needed.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Coker believed Patricelli, stating that \"[i]t was [her] clear impression from [her] communications with Ms. Patricelli that [Patricelli] was not in contact with Mr. Miller and had no intention of resuming contact with him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed below, both Patricelli's mother, CP at 208, and Patricelli's best friend, CP at 163-64, also believed this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3. DOC supervised Miller after his release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 On October 16, one day after he was released on DOC supervision, Miller reported\n   to Rhonda Freeland, his DOC supervisor. CP at 33. Miller took a urinalysis test, which came back negative for drugs and alcohol. Miller and Freeland made arrangements to enroll Miller in domestic violence treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 During their first meeting, Miller informed Freeland that \"he was homeless and was 'couch surfing' with relatives,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   even though he was released to an Auburn address connected with the Sober Solutions program, CP at 737, 1125. According to Freeland, DOC did not require misdemeanor probationers like Miller to establish an approved residence upon release from prison, CP at 33-34, although he was supposed to obtain prior approval of address changes from DOC, CP at 576. So Freeland told Miller to maintain a weekly shelter log documenting where he stayed each night, with signature verification by someone at each location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 33. Freeland did not discipline Miller for changing addresses without prior approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Freeland also called one of the phone numbers she had for Patricelli but received no answer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Freeland did not call the other phone number that DOC had listed for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 On October 17, Freeland verified that Miller had initiated the process for entering domestic violence treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Freeland also contacted Coker, Patricelli's victim liaison, who informed Freeland that Patricelli had moved to a new residence (though Patricelli was still in the process of moving at that time) and would call the police if Miller contacted her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 On October 23, Miller reported to Freeland for his second check-in.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He again tested negative for drugs and alcohol.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Miller recounted the steps he had taken during the past week to enroll in domestic violence treatment, including scheduling a psychological assessment. CP at 34. Miller also submitted a completed shelter log showing that he had stayed with his mother each night in Burien. CP at 33, 107-08. Miller's mother signed each entry. CP at 104, 107-08. No one disputes that she signed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 On October 29, the day before Miller was scheduled to report a third time, Freeland called Miller's mother to verify his living arrangements. CP at 34. Miller's mother confirmed that he \"could live\" with her in Burien, though she did not specifically verify that he had been living with her already. CP at 34, 104. Freeland then vetted the Burien address through Coker, the victim liaison, who said she had no known concerns about the address at that time. CP at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 The next morning, Miller stabbed Patricelli to death in the shower. CP at 659. Her mother, Cathy Harper, was one of the first people to discover the bloody crime scene. CP at 225-27. Miller appears to have murdered Patricelli over accusations that she was seeing someone else.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 325. The day before the murder, Miller posted a cryptic message on his Facebook account: \"Well I just got got out na it'z tyme tha go bacc to prison fo bout 10 or 15.\" CP at 1133.

CP at 800-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   4. Miller and Patricelli renewed their relationship but hid it from others\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 It turns out that Miller, his mother, and Patricelli herself lied to DOC about Miller's living arrangements while he was on probation. In fact, Patricelli had seen Miller, even though she said she had not. And Miller was not staying with his mother, despite his mother saying, in a signed document, that he was. Miller was actually living with Patricelli. CP at 324.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the only people who knew\n   that fact were Patricelli, her daughters, their roommate, and Miller. CP at 325-26. And all of them were actively hiding the relationship from DOC and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 Patricelli even hid the relationship from her best friend, Breanna Capener. CP at 164. Patricelli told Capener the same things she told Coker, her DOC victim liaison: \"Miller did not know the address of the Auburn apartment and ... she did not want to see him or for him to know her new address\" and \"she would call law enforcement if he showed up at her Auburn apartment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Like Coker, Capener believed Patricelli despite Miller and Patricelli's long history of getting back together.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567776,12567777\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 Patricelli also hid the fact that she and Miller were living together from her mother, Cathy Harper, even though the two were very close. CP at 208-09. Patricelli kept it secret even when she and her daughters slept over at Harper's house to get away from Miller the night before the murder. CP at 237-38. Like Coker and Capener, Harper believed Patricelli was no longer with Miller and had not seen him while he was on probation. CP at 208-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   5. Harper sued DOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 Harper sued DOC, alleging that DOC was grossly negligent in its supervision of Miller. CP at 11-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argues that DOC should have monitored Miller's whereabouts more closely because of his long history of committing domestic violence crimes, breaking no-contact orders, and threatening to kill Patricelli. CP at 2. She notes that DOC was aware of Miller's history of domestic violence against Patricelli, including the death threats he made to her in the past, CP at 1131, and that DOC employees believed Miller would eventually try to contact Patricelli after his release as he had done previously, CP at 1123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 Specifically, Harper argues that DOC should have (1) imposed GPS (global positioning system) monitoring and geographical restrictions on Miller, (2) required Miller to take a polygraph test, (3) conducted field supervision, such as home visits, (4) monitored Miller's social media accounts, (5) verbally verified with Miller's mother that he was living with her rather than rely solely on her signature, (6) arrested Miller for changing addresses without having first notified DOC, in violation of one of his probation conditions, and (7) not authorized him to live in sober housing in the city (Auburn) to which Patricelli eventually moved (though DOC may not have known that Patricelli moved to Auburn).

It did not consider what DOC did to prevent Miller from contacting Patricelli. As discussed above, prior to Miller's release, a DOC victim services liaison contacted Patricelli about his impending release and helped her move. DOC supervisor Freeland then called Coker, the DOC liaison, who verified that she was in contact with Patricelli, that Patricelli had relocated to a new address unknown to Miller, that Patricelli had not seen Miller, and that Patricelli intended to call the police if she saw him. Freeland also required Miller to submit a weekly shelter log showing where he stayed each night and required another person to verify each entry with a signature. Miller's mother acknowledges that she signed the entries stating that Miller was staying with her each night. Freeland even called Miller's mother to verify the living arrangements (although Freeland did not specifically confirm that Miller had been staying with his mother since his release). Freeland then checked with Coker, who said she had no known concerns about the address of Miller's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 52 As it turns out, Miller, his mother, and Patricelli herself lied to DOC throughout the 15 days that Miller was out on probation.
