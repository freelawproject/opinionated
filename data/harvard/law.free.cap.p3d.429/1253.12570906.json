Specifically, the district court entered the judgment of conviction on May 22, 2018. Appellant did not file the notice of appeal, however, until October 29, 2018, well after the expiration of the 30-day appeal period prescribed by NRAP 4(b). \"[A]n untimely notice of appeal fails to vest jurisdiction in this court,\"\n     <em>\n      Lozada v.
