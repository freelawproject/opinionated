The District Court affirmed the Human Rights Commission's decision granting Costco Wholesale Corporation summary\n   judgment and dismissing Jackson's claim of unlawful discrimination in employment on the basis of a disability and failure to make reasonable accommodation. Jackson argues that Costco terminated him for conduct resulting from a disability, which cannot qualify as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for termination. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Jackson began his employment with Costco in its Missoula warehouse store in 1997. Throughout the course of his employment, Jackson requested various accommodations due to his prescribed medication causing sleep interference, and Costco granted him intermittent Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave and excused tardiness. Jackson at no time notified Costco that he had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On October 5, 2015, Jackson's psychologist, Dr. Linda Frey, completed an FMLA form requesting excused intermittent tardiness. The description of the relevant medical facts for which he sought this accommodation stated that he \"experiences symptoms including fatigue and hypersomnia. Medication prescribed him exacerbates sleep problems in making it very difficult to rouse/awaken.\" Dr. Frey stated that the need for intermittent tardiness began on October 5, 2015, and was estimated to end in April 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Jackson testified that on October 22, 2015, Austin Crowley, a manager at Costco, asked him how he was feeling. Crowley was not Jackson's supervisor, but he did know him on a personal basis. Jackson informed Crowley that he \"was not emotionally and mentally feeling well.\" Crowley asked if Jackson needed to be excused from work to go home, and Jackson advised that he did. Jackson thinks that he may have mentioned his depression to Crowley \"in passing\" prior to October 2015, but he has no specific recollection of doing so. On October 31, 2015, Jackson provided a Costco Human Resources officer with a\n   return-to-work letter from Dr. Frey that stated: \"Mr. Jackson experienced difficulties associated with his medical condition and medications this past week. He sought emergency medical treatment on Thursday, October 22[,] 2015. This situation resulted in him missing work from then through October 30, 2015.\" Dr. Frey also wrote another letter with identical language, except she changed the return date to October 26, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On October 31, 2015, Jackson returned to work. Denise Parrott, a Costco manager, noticed that he was wearing a \"Griz\" stocking hat while working in the front of the store as a cashier. Because Costco has a store policy prohibiting employees from wearing hats while working at the cash registers, Parrott asked Jackson to remove the hat. Jackson became agitated and angry and insisted that he could wear a hat when he was cold. Eventually, Jackson took the \"Griz\" stocking hat back to his locker. He returned to the cash register wearing a \"Costco\" logo stocking hat. At Parrott's request, another supervisor informed Jackson that he needed to report to the front-end office to speak with Parrott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 When Parrott began to speak with Jackson about wearing a hat, he became angry. She tried to talk to him about the store policy, but Jackson yelled at her, refused to sit down, and used profanity. Jackson claims that he did not \"yell\" at Parrott but admits that his voice was \"elevated.\" Parrott radioed Wayne Rhoades, Assistant Warehouse Manager, for assistance because she was frightened by Jackson's behavior. Jackson was leaving as Rhoades arrived, and the two physically bumped into one another. Rhoades stated that Jackson was extremely agitated and upset. Rhoades had to ask Jackson several times to return to the office so that they could discuss the issue, and Jackson eventually agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Back in the front-end office, Rhoades asked Jackson several times to sit down. Rhoades told him that he was being disruptive and insubordinate, and Jackson ultimately sat down. When Rhoades asked Parrott to tell him what had occurred, she started to speak but Jackson interrupted, pointed at Parrott, and again began yelling. Rhoades managed to get Jackson to calm down; when Parrott began to speak again, however, Jackson\n   began yelling at her and pointing his finger at her. Eventually, Rhoades concluded the meeting because Jackson could not compose himself appropriately to continue the discussion. Rhoades directed him to retrieve shopping carts in the parking lot for the remainder of his shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 After the incident, Rhoades consulted with Assistant General Manager Dan Walsh about what had occurred. Rhoades and Walsh\n   then met with General Manager Stacey Jimenez to review the incident. Rhoades, Walsh, and Jimenez concluded that Jackson needed to be placed on a three-day suspension while Costco decided whether to terminate his employment for insubordination. Costco's Employee Agreement, which Jackson signed and acknowledged that he received, describes employee conduct that may result in termination. It lists, among other behaviors, \"Insubordinate conduct including, but not limited to: a. Refusal to comply with the direct instructions or directions of your Supervisor.\" At the end of Jackson's October 31 shift, Rhoades and Walsh met with Jackson to advise him of his suspension. Rhoades stated that Jackson became extremely angry, used profanity, walked out of the office, and slammed the office door so hard that he knocked a cork board off the wall. Jackson does not recall using profanity but concedes that he slammed the door hard enough to knock the cork board off the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 Before Costco will terminate an employee who has worked with the company for more than five years, the circumstances must be reviewed with an Executive Vice President or above. After Jackson's suspension, three senior management members reviewed whether to terminate his employment: Michael Hayes, Vice President of Northwest Operations II; Mario Omoss, Senior Vice President, Northwest Region; and John McKay, Chief Operating Officer of the Northern Division. They agreed that Jackson's conduct was unacceptable, insubordinate, and violated the Employee Agreement. On November 6, 2015, McKay decided to terminate Jackson's employment and informed the others of his decision via an e-mail the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 On November 8, 2015, Jimenez and Rhoades met with Jackson to inform him of his termination. At the outset of the meeting, Jackson apologized for his behavior during the October 31 meetings and stated that his conduct was a result of his depression and anxiety disorders. The November 8 meeting was the first time that Jackson had told Costco about his depression and anxiety. Jimenez and Rhoades advised Jackson that he was being terminated. They met again on November 12, 2015, to sign a termination notice. After the November 8 meeting, Jackson provided Costco with a letter from his psychiatrist, Dr. John Willoughby, stating that when Jackson had discontinued his medications it resulted in a \"mental health decompensation\" and that, if Jackson continued to be compliant with medications, \"the likelihood of future confrontations and decompensation is be [sic] small.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 After his termination, Jackson filed a complaint with the Montana Human Rights Bureau alleging that Costco discriminated against him\n   by terminating him from employment because of his disability. He stated that he has a disability as defined in the Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Jackson further alleged that Costco discriminated against him by failing to make reasonable accommodations for his disability. The reasonable accommodation that Jackson sought was for Costco to allow him to keep his job after reviewing his medical records. Costco moved for summary judgment, claiming it had a legitimate business reason for discharging Jackson. Jackson opposed the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 The matter came before a Hearing Officer, who held that Costco established a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Jackson and that Jackson did not present evidence raising an inference that Costco's reason for termination was a pretext. Concluding that Jackson \"did not establish a material and substantial genuine fact issue,\" the Hearing Officer granted summary judgment in favor of Costco. Jackson appealed to the Commission. After review of the complete record, the Commission determined that viewing the facts in the light most favorable\n   to Jackson supported the conclusion that discrimination did not occur. The Commission affirmed the Hearing Officer's order and adopted the order granting Costco's motion for summary judgment as part of its final agency decision. Jackson appealed to the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 Following briefing and oral argument, the District Court affirmed the Final Agency Decision of the Commission and adopted the order granting Costco's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 A court reviews a final decision of the Human Rights Commission to determine whether the agency's findings are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law are correct.\n   <em>\n    Denke v.

And Jackson does not argue that Costco's reason was a pretext for discrimination. The only issue in contention is thus whether Costco has come forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 Jackson relies on\n   <em>\n    Dark v.

Costco counters in part that\n   <em>\n    Dark\n   </em>\n   and the other cases Jackson cites all involve an employer who had knowledge of the employee's disability prior to termination.

The policy advised employees with a disability that affects job performance to \"let [Costco] know as soon as possible\" to begin the interactive process. When Costco made the decision to terminate Jackson, it was unaware that he had been diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Jackson had never requested a reasonable accommodation for such a condition. Jackson's previous intermittent FMLA leave and Costco's express permission for his occasional tardiness were for diagnosed sleep problems. There was nothing, in plain language or otherwise, to notify Costco that Jackson had depression and anxiety and was requesting reasonable accommodation for those conditions. Jackson argues that Costco should have known that he had a disability and required reasonable accommodation when he had been granted FMLA leave in the past. But Jackson's psychologist, Dr. Frey, had just written two letters to Costco that gave no indication of a need for accommodation. Dr. Frey advised that Jackson had difficulties from a medical condition the week prior to his October 31 return. Her letters did not state that Jackson needed a reasonable accommodation when he returned to work. What's more, during the Human Rights proceedings, Dr. Frey testified that Jackson was able to return to work without the need of any assistance or accommodation\n   from Costco; she, in fact, \"absolutely\" encouraged him to get back to work and into his regular schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 The Hearing Examiner did not err in concluding that Jackson failed to raise an issue of material fact with evidence of his October 22 conversation with Crowley, a Costco manager. When Crowley asked Jackson how he was feeling, Jackson responded that he was \"emotionally and mentally not feeling well,\" and he decided to go home for the day. A general expression of feeling \"unwell\" is not plain language of a medical disability that would put an employer on notice that the employee needs a reasonable accommodation. Jackson testified at his deposition that he was \"emotionally distraught, very depressed, and couldn't control [his] emotions,\" but the words he acknowledged using with Crowley were \"not feeling well.\" Dr. Frey's return-to-work letters immediately followed Jackson's absence. Until the November 8 meeting, when Jackson told his supervisors his depression and anxiety caused his behavior on October 31, Costco did\n   not know that Jackson had a disability. Costco had accommodated Jackson's sleep troubles, but it had no reason to associate those issues with his explosive behavior on October 31. The Hearing Officer and Commission properly concluded that Costco could not have discriminated against Jackson for his disability because the company was not aware of it when the decision to terminate him occurred.\n   <em>\n    Dark\n   </em>\n   and its progeny therefore do not supply persuasive authority; those cases all involved employers with actual knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3270945\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1078/#p1084\">\n    451 F.3d at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 Jackson was suspended on October 31, and Costco management decided to terminate his employment on November 6. Jackson did not mention his depression and anxiety until the November 8 meeting. If an employee mentions a disability and/or the need for an accommodation for the first time in response to discipline for unacceptable conduct and the appropriate disciplinary action is termination, the employer need not further discuss the employee's disability or request for reasonable accommodation. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    The Americans with Disabilities Act: Applying Performance and Conduct Standards to Employees with Disabilities\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 20, 2017),\n   <em>\n    https://perma.cc/8PLE-KWAU\n   </em>\n   . Jackson argues that he was not terminated by Costco until November 12, 2015, when he met with Jimenez and Rhoades and signed his termination notice, and that his termination occurred four days after the meeting during which he discussed how his disability had caused his behavior. The record reflects, however, that McKay notified other members of Costco's senior management of his decision to terminate Jackson on November 6. And Jackson mentioned his disability for the first time on November 8 when his supervisors met to tell him he was being terminated. The Hearing Officer properly concluded that the decision to terminate Jackson was reached without knowledge of his mental condition or disability, and Costco was not under any obligation to revisit that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 As the employer seeking summary judgment, Costco presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination. Jackson does not appear to contest the Hearing Officer's conclusion that, absent discrimination, Costco had a legitimate business reason for terminating his employment. A legitimate business reason is one that is \"neither false, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, and [it] must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\"\n   <em>\n    Baumgart v.
