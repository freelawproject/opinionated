(Mother) appeals an order of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, terminating her parental rights to her children, L.A.G. and N.L. Mother argues (1) that the District Court failed to follow the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) when it proceeded through termination without a conclusive determination on the children's status in all Indian Tribes with which the children may have been affiliated, (2) that the District Court failed to address whether the Department of Public Health and Human Services made \"active efforts\" to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of an Indian family, and (3) that the Department wrongfully relied on a new theory of abandonment in its closing arguments at the termination hearing. We reverse and remand with instructions regarding ICWA compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Two-year-old L.A.G. and newborn N.L. were removed from their mother's care and placed into emergency protective custody in June 2016, the day after N.L.'s birth, due to Mother's admitted methamphetamine use in early pregnancy, lack of prenatal care, positive drug test at the birth of N.L., and the children's exposure to domestic violence. On\n   June 9, 2016, the Department filed a Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority and Emergency Protective Services for each child. The petitions indicated that the Department believed both L.A.G. and N.L. were Indian children and subject to ICWA. In the petition, the Department stated that it had requested verification of the enrollment eligibility of L.A.G. and N.L. from the Blackfeet Tribe. The Department also stated it had sought verification regarding N.L. from the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians and the Chippewa Cree Tribe. The record shows that notice of involuntary child custody\n   proceedings was sent to the Blackfeet Tribe with respect to L.A.G. and to the Blackfeet Tribe, Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Chippewa Cree Tribe with respect to N.L. The Department filed signed Certified Return Receipts from the Blackfeet Tribe and the Little Shell Tribe confirming their receipt of the notification. No Certified Return Receipt was filed confirming the Chippewa Cree Tribe's receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 The Blackfeet Tribe wrote letters to the Department stating that L.A.G. and N.L. were not eligible for enrollment and did not qualify as Indian children. Initially, the Little Shell Tribe sent a letter stating that the children were not enrolled members or eligible for enrollment; that letter, however, contained incorrect names for the children's birth parents and an incorrect birthdate for N.L. Five months later, the Little Shell Tribe notified the court that Mother was in the final stages of enrolling. The Department never filed verification concerning either child's status in the Chippewa Cree Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 On June 24, 2016, Mother met with Child Protective Specialist Micaela Stroop and reported that she was working with the Indian Health Center (IHC) on chemical dependency issues. Mother signed a release for the Department to request records from IHC but refused to allow the Department to give IHC collateral information or to sign any other releases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 In early July 2016, the Department filed a supplemental affidavit stating that L.A.G.'s tribal affiliations were Chippewa Cree and Blackfeet and that notices had been sent to both tribes. Yet, the record reflects that it did not send notice to the Chippewa Cree Tribe regarding L.A.G. The only notice of hearing to the Chippewa Cree Tribe filed in L.A.G.'s case register had N.L.'s name on it with L.A.G.'s case number. The Department did not submit proof of notice to the Chippewa Cree Tribe that had L.A.G.'s name on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 On July 29, 2016, the District Court held a show cause hearing. Mother was present and stipulated to temporary investigative authority, which the court granted. In the beginning of August 2016, Mother relocated from Great Falls to Missoula. On October 14, 2016, the Department filed its petition to adjudicate both children as youths in need of care and for temporary legal custody. Between the time the Department received temporary investigative authority and the petition for temporary legal custody, Mother had four positive urinalysis (UA) results, one for methamphetamine and amphetamine and three for opiates. Mother also had missed three UA call-ins and a scheduled meeting with child protection specialists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 After three continuances, the adjudicatory hearing was set for January 20, 2017. A week before the scheduled hearing and without\n   the aid of her court-appointed counsel, Mother petitioned the District Court to transfer the case to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201911\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Mother also claimed that she was \"a direct descendant of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa Indians, as are [her] daughters, and qualify but have not yet sought enrollment in that tribe.\" Mother stated that she \"retain[ed] [her] right to petition for transfer to [the Chippewa Cree] tribe as a second option.\" Mother served the petition on Child Protection Specialist Kayla Moodie, the children's placement, and the Little Shell Tribe of Indians; she failed, however, to serve the birth fathers or the other Tribes. The Little Shell Chairman then wrote a letter to the District Court requesting that the children be placed with family members or within the Little Shell Tribe. The Department filed its response, arguing that the Little Shell Tribe did not have the \"appropriate powers and authorities to assume jurisdiction in this case\" because it is not a federally recognized tribe. The Department also acknowledged\n   that the Chippewa Cree Tribe may have an interest in the welfare of the children and that it \"ought to receive notice of these proceedings.\" The Department sent copies of this response to both the Little Shell Tribe and the Chippewa Cree Tribe, but there was not a certificate of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 In September 2017, the Department filed a petition for termination of rights. Notice of the petition was sent to the Blackfeet Tribe, Chippewa Cree Tribe, and the Little Shell Tribe for both children. A signed Certified Mail Return Receipt was filed for all three Tribes in both case registers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 The District Court held a termination hearing on January 17, 2018. The court issued its order approximately a week later, terminating Mother's parental rights. The District Court concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Mother had failed to complete her treatment plan or maintain substantial relationships with the children. It also concluded that Mother did not intend to resume care of the children in the future, and thus had abandoned L.A.G. and N.L. pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(b), MCA. The court found that returning the children to Mother's custody likely would result in serious emotional and/or physical harm. The District Court did not make any specific findings addressing the testimony of ICWA expert Anna Fisher. Nor did it make any findings or conclusions regarding active efforts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Whether a district court has complied with ICWA's substantive and procedural requirements presents a question of law,\n   which we review to determine whether the court's application of the law is correct.\n   <em>\n    In re M.S.\n   </em>\n   , 2014 MT 265A, \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308883\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/376/394/\">\n    376 Mont. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=336%20P.3d%20930\">\n    336 P.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761393\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/370/254/\">\n    2013 MT 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761393\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/370/254/\">\n    370 Mont. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761393\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/370/254/\">\n    301 P.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611\n   <em>\n    1.

The District Court had reason to believe that both children may be eligible for enrollment in the Chippewa Cree Tribe, because Mother claimed in her Petition to Transfer Jurisdiction that she and her daughters were \"direct descendant[s] of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa Indians,\" and they qualified for enrollment. The Department also stated that L.A.G. was affiliated with the Chippewa Cree Tribe and that a verification request had been sent, even though the record reflects that it had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 The Department sent notice to the Chippewa Cree Tribe regarding the involuntary child custody proceeding of N.L., but not regarding L.A.G. There was no proof in the record that the Chippewa Cree Tribe received notice of the involuntary child custody proceedings for either child. Although it filed notice in L.A.G.'s case register with N.L.'s name on it stating that the notice was sent via certified mail, there was never any Certified Return Receipt filed. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Department ever received verification of enrollment status from the Chippewa Cree Tribe. The District Court failed to confirm that due diligence was used to work with the Chippewa Cree Tribe when it did not confirm that the Chippewa Cree Tribe received notice of the proceedings or that verification of L.A.G.'s status had been requested. Thus, it failed to satisfy the threshold requirement to verify L.A.G.'s and N.L.'s eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Although the court applied ICWA standards throughout the proceedings, we reject the Department's argument that ICWA did not\n   also require determination of the children's affiliated Tribe. It is insufficient merely to treat the children as Indian children; the Chippewa Cree Tribe must have been notified by certified mail with return receipt requested and given the opportunity, if applicable, to participate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25.

Did the District Court err when it did not address whether the Department provided \"active efforts\" to Mother?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 Mother next argues that ICWA's minimum federal standards require the District Court to conclude that the Department provided \"active efforts\" to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts were unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

There's no indication that the condition bringing the parents into court is unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time.

The court did not address the issue at all. The lack of findings or a conclusion that active efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts have been unsuccessful fails to comply with ICWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re K.B.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. We reverse and remand for the District Court to enter a new order addressing whether the Department made \"active efforts\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

Were Mother's due process rights violated when the Department raised the issue of abandonment during the closing arguments of the termination hearing and her counsel failed to object?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b628 In argument at the close of the termination hearing, the Department maintained that when an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parent's legal or physical custody, then the breakup of the family already has occurred and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) is inapplicable. The Department did not develop the argument, but did contend that the principle \"specifically applies to [N.L.] and her parents,\" because the Department removed N.L. from her parents' custody at birth. Mother challenges the Department's argument that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) does not apply in this case, as well as her counsel's failure to object to that argument. Mother contends that the Department misconstrued the holding of\n   <em>\n    Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698479\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/637/\">\n    570 U.S. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7342721,12698479\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/133/2552/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698479\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/637/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). We agree with Mother that the Department's apparent reference in the District Court to the application of\n   <em>\n    Baby Girl\n   </em>\n   was not an apt application of that case. The District Court's decision was not based on this argument, and the Department does not pursue it on appeal. Thus, it is unnecessary to discuss this issue further. Because the District Court did not rely on this theory of abandonment, Mother's due process rights were not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 We reverse and remand for further action in accordance with this Opinion. If the District Court receives a conclusive tribal determination that L.A.G. and N.L. are affiliated with the Chippewa Cree Tribe, it shall conduct any further proceedings that may be\n   necessary to meet the requirements of Title 41, chapter 3, MCA, and applicable ICWA standards. If no further proceedings are needed, then the court shall determine whether the Department complied with ICWA's \"active efforts\" requirement. If the District Court determines that active efforts were made, it may re-enter judgment against Mother on the merits of its prior findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DIRK M.
