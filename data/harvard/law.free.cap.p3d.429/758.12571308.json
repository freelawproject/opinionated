Rowley (collectively, Plaintiffs) appeal the district court's order dismissing their complaint against Appellee JPMorgan Chase Bank NA (Chase Bank) on the ground that their claims were barred by the statute of limitations. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 National Title, formed by Rowley in 2006, was a licensed escrow and title agent that closed real estate transactions in Utah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a licensed escrow agent, National Title held funds in escrow for its clients in trust accounts at several banks, including a trust account at Chase Bank (the Trust Account).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Two unrelated suits were brought against National Title in 2010, and because it failed to appear in either suit, the district court entered default judgments against it. Shortly after the default judgments, the district court issued two writs of garnishment to Chase Bank, which, National Title alleges, mindlessly complied with the writs, releasing over $600,000 belonging to National Title's clients from the Trust Account to National Title's judgment creditors. The last such release was in September 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 National Title periodically received statements from Chase Bank regarding the Trust Account. Somehow, National Title did not notice the substantial shortfall in the Trust Account until October 2013. It then alerted its underwriter, First American Title Insurance Company (First American), that it would need assistance in compensating clients for their escrowed funds that were lost as a result of the Trust Account's garnishments. First American promptly sent a written demand and then filed suit in November 2013 in federal court, demanding that National Title reimburse First American for any payments it would have to make to cover the shortfall. First American then terminated its relationship with National Title, resulting in National Title's closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In September 2015, Plaintiffs filed a third-party complaint against Chase Bank-in the federal case First American brought against Plaintiffs-alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and negligence per se. But the federal court, citing principles of federal abstention, dismissed the suit without prejudice. When Plaintiffs filed those same claims in state district court, Chase Bank moved to dismiss under rule 12(b)(6) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure on the ground that the suit was barred by the general four-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-2-307(3) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017) (specifying that a four-year statute of limitations applies to claims \"for relief not otherwise provided for by law\"). Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that the statute of limitations began to run in 2013 when First American sued National Title-not in 2010 when the Trust Account was garnished. They also sought to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Concluding that the statute of limitations began to run in 2010, the district court determined that the breach of contract claim was subject to a two-year contractual limitation and that the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence per se were subject to the general four-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And because Plaintiffs sued in 2015, the district court held that the claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. As a result, it granted Chase Bank's motion, dismissed the suit, and denied Plaintiffs' motion to amend. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint, on the rationale that all three claims were time-barred. \"When reviewing a rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, we accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and interpret those facts, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in a light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Russell Packard Dev., Inc. v.

And a plaintiff who has sustained a financial loss has standing to immediately bring an action to recover its damages once that loss has occurred. Although Plaintiffs assert that Chase Bank's improper release of funds from the Trust Account did not initially harm them, the garnishing of escrowed funds from the Trust Account to satisfy a judgment against National Title is the breach and the proximate cause of the alleged injuries underlying Plaintiffs' claims. Had Chase Bank not released the funds, or had it immediately restored them upon National Title's timely demand, the Trust Account would not have experienced a shortfall and the events of 2013 would not have unfolded. As soon as the improper garnishment occurred, National Title remained on the hook for those amounts, vis-a-vis its clients to whom the funds belonged, and it immediately had standing, as trustee of the account, to demand restoration of the amounts misappropriated by Chase Bank. Like the district court, we conclude that damages accrued and the statutes of limitations began running on Plaintiffs' claims in 2010 when Chase Bank garnished funds in the Trust Account to satisfy unrelated judgments against National Title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Plaintiffs insist that what they seek in this action is not recovery of the garnished funds but rather special or consequential damages for harms that the loss of those funds eventually caused.

Quite extraordinarily, in our judgment, the substantial shortfall in the Trust Account went unnoticed by Plaintiffs for almost three years, and upon learning that it would have to reimburse the garnished funds, First American demanded that National Title transfer all escrowed funds in National Title's possession. It also subsequently terminated its relationship with National Title and brought suit. The unnoticed loss of a significant amount of money, the failure to monitor and diligently superintend those funds, National Title's inability to reimburse First American, and First American filing suit and terminating its relationship with National Title all did eventually happen in this case. But these were not typical results of an improper garnishment, and it is unlikely that these same events would occur in every circumstance where a bank improperly garnishes a trust account.
