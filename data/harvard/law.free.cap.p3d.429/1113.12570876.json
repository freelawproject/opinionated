The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Anderson. The court also awarded Anderson attorney fees under RCW 7.28.083(3), which gives the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in \"an action asserting title to real property by adverse possession.\" McColl appeals only the trial court's attorney fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees because McColl's action seeking a declaration that he had prescriptive easements on Anderson's property was not \"an action asserting title to real property\" as required under RCW 7.28.083(3). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's award of attorney fees to Anderson under RCW 7.28.083(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In March 2017, McColl filed a lawsuit against Anderson entitled, \"Complaint for Declaratory Judgment for an Easement and Injunction.\" Clerk's Papers at 28-33. The complaint alleged that (1) McColl owned property in Port Angeles and that Anderson owned adjoining property; (2) the potable water supply for McColl's property had come from a water distribution system located on Anderson's property for over 10 years, (3) water lines run from the water distribution system to McColl's property, and (4) the water distribution system and water lines had been in place for over 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 McColl's complaint further asserted that he had prescriptive easements to the water distribution system and water lines and a maintenance prescriptive easement to cross Anderson's property and access the water distribution system and lines. In his prayer for relief, McColl requested a declaration establishing the claimed prescriptive easements. He also requested an injunction to prevent Anderson from having any involvement with the water distribution system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Anderson filed a summary judgment motion, arguing that McColl's complaint should be dismissed because state law prohibited the acquisition of water rights by prescriptive easement and because McColl could not establish all the requirements for a prescriptive easement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Anderson, dismissed McColl's complaint, and denied McColl's motion for reconsideration. The court also awarded Anderson $35,610 in attorney fees under RCW 7.28.083(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 McColl appeals the trial court's attorney fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Whether the trial court properly awarded attorney fees to Anderson requires us to interpret the language of RCW 7.28.083(3).

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 RCW 7.28.083(3) gives the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to the prevailing party \"in an action asserting title to real property by adverse possession.\" The question here is whether McColl's lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that he had prescriptive easements relating to the water distribution system and the water lines on Anderson's property constituted \"an action asserting title to real property.\" RCW 7.28.083(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1. Prescriptive Easement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 A prescriptive easement arises when one person uses a portion of another person's land for a period of 10 years and that use was (1) open and notorious, (2) continuous or uninterrupted, (3) occurred over a uniform route, (4) was adverse to the property owner, and (5) occurred with the owner's knowledge at a time when the owner was able to assert and enforce his or her rights.\n   <em>\n    Gamboa v.

Easement Claim as Action Asserting Title\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 An easement is an interest in real property.\n   <em>\n    Zonnebloem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20Wash.%20App.%20178\">\n    200 Wash.

However, that interest involves the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of property and\n   does not grant\n   <em>\n    title\n   </em>\n   to the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiely v.

But again that burden does not provide\n   <em>\n    title\n   </em>\n   to the property.
