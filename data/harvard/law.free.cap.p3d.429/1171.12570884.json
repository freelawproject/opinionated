R. Civ. P. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Ferrara was injured in an auto accident in the course of her employment. As of the date of the accident, she was a covered person and beneficiary of an auto insurance policy provided by the defendant/appellee 21st Century North America Insurance Company. As a result of her injuries, Ferrara incurred $3,981.59 in medical bills. She was eligible to receive, and in fact did receive workers' compensation benefits covering those expenses, though her employer's workers' compensation carrier was able to pay off the treatment costs at a reduced rate of $2,053.91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Following a $6,812.59 settlement on her third-party claim against the responsible driver, Ferrara's workers' compensation carrier issued a lien on, and was repaid $2,053.91 from, her third-party settlement, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1023(D). Ferrara subsequently submitted the medical bills she had incurred to 21st Century, along with documents establishing that she had reimbursed the workers' compensation carrier, seeking coverage pursuant to the medical payments (\"medpay\") provision of her policy in the amount of $3,981.59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 21st Century denied her claim, citing an exclusion in the policy which the parties agree states: \"We do not provide Medical Payments Coverage for any\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   for\n   <em>\n    bodily injury\n   </em>\n   ... [o]ccurring during the course of employment if workers' compensation benefits are required or available for the\n   <em>\n    bodily injury\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Ferrara subsequently filed the instant action for breach of contract and declaratory relief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sought class action certification pursuant to Rule 23. The proposed class, of which Ferrara is the sole named plaintiff, was to consist of all persons or assignees who were covered by 21st Century auto policies or their affiliated underwriting entities, who had made a claim for medpay benefits that was denied on the basis of the workers' compensation exclusion notwithstanding such claimant's legal obligation to repay the workers' compensation benefits from a third-party recovery during the period of October 22, 2007 through the date of the class notice, with a geographic scope to include all thirty-three states in which 21st Century issues policies containing the exclusion. Following\n   extensive discovery and argument, the trial court found that Ferrara had failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a), and denied class certification. This interlocutory appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1873(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Plaintiffs seeking class certification must meet all the requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b). \"One seeking to maintain a class action has the burden of showing that the prerequisites are satisfied-merely calling it a class action does not make it one.\"\n   <em>\n    Carpinteiro v.

In its response opposing certification, 21st Century provided its own matrix addressing the laws of the various states, which pointed out variances in the states' laws regarding the admissibility and application of extrinsic evidence in issues of contractual ambiguity and the rights of an insurer to seek medpay reimbursement/subrogation from third-party-at-fault recoveries. This matrix showed that of the thirty-three states in Ferrara's proposed geographic scope, the laws of twenty-seven appear to differ substantively from Arizona on whether an insurer has a right to recover medpay benefits from a third-party-at-fault recovery. Ferrara did not meaningfully address these variances, except to say that \"such individual\n   issues do not defeat certification where the core issue is common\" and that 21st Century failed to explain \"how Defendant's subrogation rights would absolve it from or be a defense to the obligation to pay medpay benefits to the insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Additionally, after extensive discovery, which included the retention of an independent information technology expert to aide in reviewing 21st Century's claim logs, Ferrara was able to identify only thirty to forty potential claimants. However, as the trial court noted in its ruling, after excluding potential class members with their own individual litigation pending, who have settled or released their claims, or had their claims denied on statutory grounds applicable in their states, Ferrara \"identified,\n   <em>\n    at most\n   </em>\n   , 20 potential class members,\" with Ferrara the sole potential member from Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 We are persuaded that in the instant case, a confluence of factors, including the potentially small number of class members and the variances in state law on a core issue, could create issues sufficient to preclude class certification on the grounds of numerosity, commonality, and typicality.
