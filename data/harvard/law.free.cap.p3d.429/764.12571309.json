Sometime after midnight Victim decided to go to bed, and she returned to her apartment while Boyfriend continued to socialize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Victim and Boyfriend lived in a studio apartment in a building with four apartments. Victim left her keys in her front door lock-which automatically locked whenever the key was removed-so that Boyfriend could enter the apartment after she was asleep. She undressed and eventually fell asleep with her back to the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Somewhere between \"deep sleep and still aware,\" Victim felt someone rubbing her buttocks and stroking her vagina. She initially thought Boyfriend was touching her, but realized it was someone else when she heard Boyfriend say, \"Who the fuck are you?\" over and over. Victim sat up and saw Boyfriend confronting another man in the apartment. She told Boyfriend the man had touched her and Boyfriend pushed the man against the dresser and told Victim to summon their neighbors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The man tried to escape, apologized, and said that he had been looking for a\n   bathroom. Boyfriend and the man wrestled into the hallway where Boyfriend tried to pin him against the wall. The man made it out the door of the apartment building and tried to run toward the street, but Boyfriend caught him and, with the help of two other men, pinned him down on the front lawn until the police arrived and arrested him. The man was Argueta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 According to Argueta's testimony at trial, he met Victim and her previous boyfriend at a bar eighteen months before the incident. They talked and drank until the bar was about to close. Argueta gave them a ride home to the same apartment building involved in this case, and he loaned the boyfriend twenty dollars. The boyfriend told Argueta he could come collect the money whenever he wanted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Argueta testified he tried to collect the money five or six times over the next year and a half. He stated that on the night of this incident, he was in the area and decided to try again to collect his twenty dollars. He went to Victim's apartment and saw that the door was slightly open and the keys were in the lock. He decided to put the keys inside the apartment as a \"good deed.\" Argueta testified he put the keys on the dresser and as he was turning back toward the door, Boyfriend entered the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 After Argueta's arrest, a police officer (Officer) gave Argueta his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and had him sit on the curb while Officer questioned Victim. Though Officer had not asked Argueta any questions, Argueta overheard Victim saying he had touched her, and Argueta volunteered that she was \"lying,\" that he met her at a bar, and that he merely left the keys in the apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 At a pretrial hearing in this case, the State, under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence, sought to admit evidence of several of Argueta's prior acts. The district court ruled that although the acts were not admissible in the State's case in chief, two of them would be admissible in rebuttal if Argueta testified during trial \"as to his intent with regard to his entry, if any, into [Victim's] residence.\" The evidence involved a 2010 incident in which Argueta was found trespassing near another woman's house (the trespassing incident) and a 2014 incident in which Victim saw Argueta looking in the window of her apartment (the peeping incident).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 After a two-day trial, a jury convicted Argueta of burglary and forcible sexual abuse, and the court sentenced Argueta to two concurrent terms of one to fifteen years in prison. Argueta appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Argueta raises several issues on appeal. First, he contends the prosecutor violated his constitutional right to remain silent. \"Though underlying factual matters are within the discretion of the [district] court, whether a given set of facts gives rise to a constitutional violation is a matter of law,\" which we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We review the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Whether trial counsel was ineffective presents a question of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Alleged Doyle Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 First, Argueta contends the prosecutor violated his constitutional right to remain silent by using his silence to impeach his testimony at trial, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Doyle v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181032\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/610/\">\n    426 U.S. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181032\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/610/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181032\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/610/\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). Argueta argues the prosecutor improperly questioned him \"about his post-arrest silence\" and then drew \"negative inferences from that silence throughout the remainder of the trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 During trial, the prosecutor asked Argueta about his interaction with the police and had the following exchange with him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: Mr. Argueta, you said that the officer said, \"What happened?\" and you tried to explain. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: But everything you've just told us for the last 25 minutes you did not tell the officer, did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: I told him about the keys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: You told him that you put the keys inside the apartment, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: Didn't tell him about meeting the boyfriend?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: He never asked.

That's all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: Just the one statement, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Because he did not want to hear any more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q: The officer stopped you from talking?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A: He told me that he could read my rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b617 Later, the prosecutor continued questioning Argueta:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: So, Mr. Argueta, you said the officer asked you to explain what happened and you told him two things, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: You told him you left the keys in the apartment; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: I told him to go check where I had left the keys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q: And you said that you met [Victim] at a bar?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q: You did not say anything else that you've testified to today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A: I just told him that I had met her at a bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q: So the answer is \"yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A: Yeah, I wouldn't say \"yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q: You didn't talk to him about what bar, didn't talk to him about the boyfriend, you didn't talk to him about money being owed, you didn't say any of that, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b618 The prosecutor referred to this exchange during her initial closing argument and again during rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B. The Prosecutor's Questioning Did Not Violate Argueta's Right to Remain Silent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b619 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that persons who are in custody and subject to interrogation must be \"advised immediately\" that they have the right to remain silent and that anything they say may be used against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Doyle v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   , it is \"fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process\" to allow a prosecutor to use a defendant's silence at the time of arrest \"to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181032\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/610/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b620 Argueta argues the district court erred \"by allowing the prosecutor, over trial counsel's objections, to question [Argueta] about his post-arrest silence and then draw negative inferences from that silence throughout the remainder of the trial.\" The problem with this argument is that Argueta did not remain silent after he was arrested and given a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning.

The Rule 404(b) Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A. Additional Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b630 At a pretrial hearing, the district court heard evidence of several prior acts, two of which are relevant here. First, the court heard evidence that Argueta pleaded guilty to trespassing after he was found near a woman's residence in the early hours of the morning. The woman thought there was an intruder in her house and called the police. Upon arrival, the responding officer saw Argueta emerging from her backyard, but there was no evidence he entered her house. The prosecutor argued that this evidence was admissible under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence to show intent regarding Argueta's entry into Victim's apartment. Specifically, she argued that the doctrine of chances\n   could be used to rebut Argueta's testimony that he entered the apartment innocently, merely with the intent of placing the keys inside the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b631 Second, the prosecutor sought to admit evidence that Victim saw Argueta looking through her window in 2014, and that she and a previous boyfriend confronted him and insisted he leave. At the hearing, Argueta's counsel argued that \"[e]very factor\" of Victim's eyewitness identification of Argueta weighs \"against finding that this is a good eyewitness identification.\" Trial counsel stated that if the prosecution were to put on evidence of the peeping incident, the defense would have to call an eyewitness-identification expert. Trial counsel argued that this would \"shift the jury's focus\" and the parties would \"end up spending more time trying the uncharged peeping tom incident\" than trying the charged crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b632 The court stated that evidence of the trespassing incident and the peeping incident was not admissible in the State's case in chief, but would be admissible \"if in fact the defendant puts his intent of going inside of the apartment in play.\" At trial when Argueta testified concerning his intent, the court admitted evidence of each incident during the State's cross-examination of Argueta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   B. The Trespassing Incident\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b633 Argueta argues the district court improperly relied on the doctrine of chances to admit evidence of the trespassing incident.

There was no evidence he entered the residence and there was no evidence given at trial, other than his presence on the property, that demonstrated an unlawful intent to enter the house. In this case, Argueta entered Victim's building and her individual apartment, was found there by Boyfriend and Victim, and was immediately accused of sexually touching Victim.

The trial evidence came down to a test of credibility-Argueta's testimony against Victim's. We have little trouble concluding that the jury would likely have credited Victim's testimony over Argueta's-he testified that although he met Victim just once before, he stopped by her apartment in the early morning hours to claim an eighteen-month-old, twenty-dollar debt, and that when he saw the keys in the door, he decided to do a \"good deed\" by entering the apartment to place them inside.

Argueta argues the evidence was previously undisclosed to the defense and otherwise inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b649 Assuming without deciding that the evidence was admitted in error, it was not prejudicial to Argueta's defense. The officer testified that Argueta was walking late at night in a neighborhood in which he did not live. The officer testified that Argueta stated he had to urinate frequently, and the officer told him he could not do that around the houses and if the officer caught Argueta exposing his penis the officer would arrest him. Although this evidence portrays Argueta in an unfavorable light, it does no more than demonstrate that Argueta was in a neighborhood other than his own late at night, and suggests that he may have urinated in public. Argueta had already testified that in Guatemala, his country of origin, it is acceptable to urinate outside as well as \"in people's yards.\" This evidence was relatively mild compared to the evidence of sexual touching and the peeping incident. Furthermore, given Argueta's explanation about why he was in Victim's apartment and the consistency in and corroboration of Victim's testimony, our confidence in the jury verdict is not undermined. Argueta was therefore not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to object to the admission of this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b650 Next, Argueta argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to renew the objection to the admission of the trespassing and peeping incidents on the basis that Argueta's testimony did not trigger the introduction of the rule 404(b) evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b651 During the pretrial hearing, the court determined that the trespassing and peeping incidents would be admissible if Argueta put \"his intent of going inside of the apartment in play.\" Argueta argues that the triggering event was testimony that he had been given permission to enter the apartment. He argues that \"[a]s long as [Argueta] did not claim that he had explicit permission from\n   [Victim] to enter the apartment, none of the prior incidents should have been allowed in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b652 We read the record differently and determine that the triggering event was Argueta's testimony that he entered the apartment for a lawful or innocent purpose. When discussing this event at the hearing, the court referred to Argueta's potential testimony, stating, \"I think where we have to go is to say, 'I had permission to go inside the house.' \" But trial counsel explained that Argueta was never given permission to enter, and the prosecutor explained that the real issue would be whether Argueta would testify that he was there for \"a lawful purpose\" and was \"being a good Samaritan\" by putting the keys inside the apartment. After this dialogue, the court ruled that the triggering event would be if Argueta put \"his intent of going inside of the apartment in play.\" We therefore determine that the triggering event was not testimony that Argueta had permission to enter the apartment, but testimony that he was there for a lawful purpose and innocently entered it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b653 At trial, Argueta's testimony during direct examination met this triggering event. He testified that he came to Victim's apartment to claim a twenty-dollar debt from her previous boyfriend-a lawful and legitimate purpose to stop by someone's residence. He also testified that he saw the keys in Victim's door and entered the apartment and placed them inside to do a \"good deed\"-an innocent explanation for entering. Because the triggering event for admitting the rule 404(b) evidence occurred, counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to renew an objection to the admissibility of the trespassing and peeping incidents based on the assertion that Argueta's testimony did not trigger their admission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cumulative Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b655 Finally, Argueta argues we should reverse because the \"cumulative effect of the errors was undoubtedly prejudicial.\" \"Whether errors can be classified as cumulatively harmful turns on whether the errors undermine confidence in the jury verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308000\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1139/\">\n    2002 UT App 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308000\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1139/\">\n    57 P.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we conclude it was error for the district court to admit evidence of the trespassing incident, we determined the error was harmless. And assuming, without deciding, that trial counsel should have objected to the evidence of Argueta's nighttime conversation with the police, the cumulative effect of that conversation, even in conjunction with the admission of the trespassing incident, does not undermine our confidence in the jury verdict. Thus, we conclude there is no cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b656 We conclude the prosecutor did not violate Argueta's constitutional right to remain silent when she drew attention to statements he made to Officer after he was given a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. We also conclude that though evidence of the trespassing incident was admitted in error, it was not prejudicial. Finally, we conclude Argueta did not preserve his arguments regarding the peeping incident, and his counsel did not render ineffective assistance. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    \"On appeal, we review the record facts in a light most favorable to the jury's verdict and recite the facts accordingly.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
