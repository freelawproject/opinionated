Stair sued various government entities and one government employee, alleging their negligence and gross negligence caused or failed to prevent her husband's death. The superior court granted\n   the defendants' motions to dismiss, rejecting Stair's arguments that the defendants owed duties created by public policy found in statutes, codes of ethics or the common law. Concluding that none of the defendants owed a duty that might give rise to liability, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 One of the defendants Stair sued is Jessica Mukavetz, a mitigation specialist who worked for the Maricopa County Office of the Legal Defender (\"OLD\"). OLD represented Rene Durgin, a member of the Mexican Mafia criminal street gang charged with capital murder. Mukavetz was assigned to assist in Durgin's case, and the two became romantically involved during her many visits with him in jail. From January 2012 through January 2013, Mukavetz visited Durgin in jail 75 times. Recorded telephone calls, text messages, social media posts and witness accounts identified Mukavetz as Durgin's \"wife,\" and Durgin considered himself her husband even though she was married to someone else. Mukavetz hoped to become pregnant with Durgin's child, and to that end, Durgin passed semen concealed in a pen to her during her jail visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Bobby Hoover, another member of the Mexican Mafia, also was in jail, charged with auto theft, armed robbery and home invasion. In October 2012, at Durgin's direction, Mukavetz paid Hoover's $5,000 bail, and he was released wearing an electronic ankle monitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Stair's complaint alleged that, having gained Hoover's release, Mukavetz proceeded to help him and Durgin carry out the business of the Mexican Mafia. According to the complaint, Mukavetz had a copy of a Mexican Mafia \"hit list\" on her cell phone and directly involved herself in \"extortion and threats of violent crime to be undertaken by Durgin and Hoover.\" Phone records showed a \"substantial\" amount of communication between her and Hoover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Meanwhile, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and the Phoenix Police Department had created a joint task force aimed at combatting criminal street gangs, including the Mexican Mafia. According to the complaint, the task force knew of the Durgin-Mukavetz relationship. The complaint alleged the task force had obtained \"recorded jail calls, interviews, electronic records, including [social media], text messaging, inmate account records, and inmate jail visitation records\" showing Mukavetz was using her role as a mitigation specialist to pass information and jail contraband for Mexican Mafia members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 According to the complaint, the task force knew the Mexican Mafia commonly employed \"compromised females\" to move information and contraband in and out of jails, knew Mukavetz and Durgin were romantically involved, knew Mukavetz was providing financial support to the Mexican Mafia, knew Mukavetz had bailed Hoover out of jail at Durgin's direction, and knew she was directly involved \"with extortion and threats of violent crime\" Durgin and Hoover planned to commit. The complaint specifically alleged Phoenix police knew that Hoover's release from jail \"posed a threat of murder or substantial bodily harm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Indeed, having been released from jail, Hoover proceeded to illegally acquire a sawed-off shotgun. According to the complaint, Mesa police learned on January 17, 2013, that Hoover had acquired the gun and forwarded that information to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. The complaint also alleged that Mukavetz was present during a telephone call between Durgin and Hoover on January 19 and heard Hoover rack the slide of a gun. Mukavetz also was present during a phone call ten days later in which Durgin and Hoover \"extensively discussed preparations for a 'hit' on the streets\" that Durgin had ordered Hoover to carry out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 On February 4, as Mukavetz watched, Hoover removed his electronic ankle monitor. According to the complaint, Phoenix police learned that same day that Hoover had slipped out of his monitor and found out a day later that Mukavetz had been present when he did so. Mukavetz failed to notify authorities that Hoover had acquired a gun, had removed his ankle monitor or had talked to Durgin about a planned \"hit.\" And, despite\n   knowing that Hoover had acquired a gun and removed his monitor, the anti-gang task force did not move immediately to arrest him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The criminal activities alleged in the complaint did not touch the Stair family until February 11, 2013. Stair and her husband managed several apartment properties in the Phoenix area. A week after Hoover removed his ankle monitor, Stair noticed a light in an unoccupied apartment unit and asked her husband to check on it. Mr. Stair knocked on the door of the unit, surprising Hoover, who was hiding inside. Hoover shot Mr. Stair four times, killing him instantly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 On behalf of herself and her family, Stair sued Mukavetz, Maricopa County and the City of Phoenix, alleging their negligence and gross negligence caused or failed to prevent Mr. Stair's death. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that they owed no duty to Mr. Stair. Stair moved for leave to file a third amended complaint. The superior court granted the motions to dismiss, then denied the motion to file another complaint. Stair timely appealed.

And she cites no authority for the proposition that a duty may arise from public policy found in a criminal statute other than one the defendant is alleged to have violated. Arizona's many criminal statutes outlawing or penalizing criminal street gang activities are plain evidence of a public policy against criminal street gangs. But the public policy reflected in those statutes does not create a duty enforceable in tort against one who did not violate any of those statutes. That is the nature of the legal principle that allows a court to find a duty in a statute: By enacting a statute that requires or forbids certain conduct, the legislature articulates a public policy that may impose a duty enforceable in tort against one who violates the statute. Under this principle, the statute the defendant allegedly violated establishes the scope of the duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 The gang statute to which Mukavetz pled guilty is \u00a7 13-2321(A)(4), which provides that one \"commits participating in a criminal street gang by ... [i]ntentionally promoting or furthering the criminal objectives of a criminal street gang by inducing or committing any act or omission by a public servant in violation of the public servant's official duty.\" If that statute imposed a tort duty on Mukavetz, it was to refrain from committing an act or omission that would \"promot[e] or further[ ] the criminal objectives of a criminal street gang.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Stair alleges that, in violation of the statute, Mukavetz breached her position of public trust by passing information and contraband to and from Durgin and by failing to report what she knew about the crimes Durgin and Hoover planned to commit. Stair does not allege, however, that the shooting of her husband was among the \"criminal objectives\" of the Mexican Mafia that Mukavetz admittedly promoted or furthered, and it is undisputed on appeal that his death instead was a tragic random act of violence. A criminal statute may establish a duty in tort to a particular plaintiff only when the statute is \"designed to protect the class of persons, in which the plaintiff is included,\n   <em>\n    against the risk of the type of harm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Gipson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999282\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/141/#p143\">\n    214 Ariz. at 146, \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999282\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/141/#p143\">\n    150 P.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Estate of Hernandez v.

In that case, our supreme court reversed a directed verdict against the estate of a man who was murdered two days after an anonymous caller had identified the victim\n   by name to a 9-1-1 dispatcher, warned the victim's life \"might be in danger,\" and told the dispatcher the victim was to be released the next day from the Arizona State Hospital and would be going from there to a townhouse on a specific Scottsdale street.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1536423\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/140/579/#p581\">\n    140 Ariz. at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1536423\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/140/579/#p581\">\n    684 P.2d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the caller had identified the prospective victim by name and given the dispatcher other detailed information about the victim's location, the\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   court did not consider the scope-of-duty question presented here. The court nevertheless observed that law enforcement's duty to act reasonably \"is not a duty to protect each citizen within the [city's] geographic boundaries from all harms.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1536423\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/140/579/#p581\">\n    140 Ariz. at 582, n.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1536423\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/140/579/#p581\">\n    684 P.2d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Motion for Leave to Amend.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35 Stair finally argues the superior court erred by denying her motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. In that motion, Stair's attorney asserted he had been approached by Mukavetz's supervisor at OLD, who implied that she had personal knowledge that would support a claim against her or the County. The proposed third amended complaint alleged on information and belief that Mukavetz's supervisor and OLD had \"actual knowledge about the negligent, reckless, and/or criminal propensity\" of Mukavetz with respect to her activities regarding Durgin and Hoover. OLD and the County objected to the motion, and the County filed a declaration from the OLD supervisor denying she had contacted Stair's attorney. The superior court denied the motion for leave to amend, finding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 The proposed amendment was aimed at satisfying A.R.S. \u00a7 12-820.05(B) (2018), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A public entity is not liable for losses that arise out of and are directly attributable to an act or omission determined by a court to be a criminal felony by a public employee unless the public entity knew of the public employee's propensity for that action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Citing the statute, Stair argues Mr. Stair's death was attributable to Mukavetz's criminal acts and that OLD knew Mukavetz might commit a crime because it knew of her involvement with Durgin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37 Under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), \"[l]eave to amend must be freely given when justice requires.\" But an amendment need not be granted when it would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Tumacacori Mission Land Dev. Ltd. v. Union Pac. R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062088\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/517/#p520\">\n    231 Ariz. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520, \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062088\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/517/#p520\">\n    297 P.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (App. 2013). The superior court correctly concluded that the proposed third amended complaint would have been futile. Section 12-820.05(B) does not establish a duty or authorize a cause of action; it merely carves out an exception to a broader rule of immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-820.05(A) (2018) (except as enumerated, statutory immunity statutes \"shall not be construed to affect, alter or otherwise modify any other rules of tort immunity\"). Because none of the public-entity defendants owed a duty to Stair's husband, \u00a7 12-820.05(B) is irrelevant. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Stair leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tumacacori\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062088\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/517/#p520\">\n    231 Ariz. at 519-20, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062088\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/517/#p520\">\n    297 P.3d at 925-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 38 Because Stair has not alleged facts that give rise to a duty owed by any of the defendants to her late husband, we affirm\n   the superior court's dismissal of her complaint.
