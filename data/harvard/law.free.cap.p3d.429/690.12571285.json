In the sentencing stage, the jury found Appellant committed these crimes after former conviction of two (2) or more felonies, and sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment and a $10,000.00 fine in each of Counts 1 through 4. The Honorable Cynthia Ferrell Ashwood, District Judge, pronounced judgment and ordered the sentences served concurrently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Thompson appeals in the following propositions of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

Mr. Thompson has suffered double punishment by his convictions and sentences on Count III--possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony and Count IV--possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in violation of due process under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art.

This plan led them to approach the home of the victim at around 10 a.m. Catron knocked at the door of the victim's residence. The victim, who had been paying bills, slipped his pistol into his back brace and opened the door. Catron then distracted the victim with some questions about raking his leaves. Appellant was already breaking into the victim's truck, looking for something to steal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b63 The victim declined Catron's offer to rake his leaves but stepped outside to direct him toward some other potential customers. Appellant saw the victim talking to Catron and shot his pistol at the victim through the windshield of the truck. The victim heard a bullet whiz past him, approximately a foot away, and strike the side of the house. The victim drew his pistol and returned several shots in Appellant's direction, wounding him in the belly. Appellant returned more shots as he took off running, and managed to get away. The victim ordered Catron to the ground at gunpoint and called police, who came and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b64 Around 5:30 p.m. that evening, another Davenport resident saw a man he didn't know stumbling along a road in Davenport, then falling down, and figured him for drunk. He told his wife to call police, but the man disappeared. A few hours later, this same man appeared on their front porch, leaning against the wall. Appellant told the couple he'd been hurt in a car accident and needed medical attention. He mentioned that his friend had been driving, but when asked where the friend was, Appellant said he didn't know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 The couple invited Appellant into their home and called police. Hearing their description of the man, police told the couple to quickly clear out of their house. Police later took Appellant into custody and eventually transported him to Tulsa, where he underwent surgery to remove a bullet fragment from his stomach. Appellant's weapon was never recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b66 In Proposition One, Appellant argues that his conviction under 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 652(C)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the crime of assaulting the victim with a deadly weapon, without proof of an accompanying battery, is reversible error. Because this question of statutory interpretation is raised for the first time on appeal, Appellant must show that a plain or obvious error affected the outcome of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Hogan v.

The trial court's jury instructions on this count permitted a conviction of the charged crime based on the elements of assaulting another person with a deadly weapon. The court also instructed the jury that it could convict Appellant of the lesser-included offenses of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm, in violation of 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 645,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or of simple assault. By failing to\n   object to the information or the trial court's instructions in these particulars, Appellant has waived all but plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b68 However, it is plain or obvious that a violation of section 652(C) requires not only proof of an assault, but also an accompanying battery.\n   <em>\n    Avants v.

Under this longstanding interpretation of subsection 652(C), Appellant's conviction for assaulting the victim with a deadly weapon with intent to do bodily harm, without proof of an accompanying battery, is plainly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b69 We remedy plain error only when it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Hogan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406179\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/907/\">\n    2006 OK CR 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406179\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/907/\">\n    139 P.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A conviction under section 652(C) carries up to life imprisonment for a first offense, and is subject to the 85% Rule. 21 O.S.Supp.2015, \u00a7 13.1(5). Appellant's current conviction and life sentence thus render him ineligible for parole consideration for at least twenty (23) years, three (3) months longer than a non-85% life sentence. 57 O.S.Supp.2013, \u00a7 332.7(B) (requiring parole consideration after 1/3 of sentence);\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. State\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429921\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/130/273/\">\n    2006 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429921\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/130/273/\">\n    130 P.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282-83 (noting Pardon and Parole Board policy of computing a life sentence as 45 years).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 The overwhelming evidence at trial, and the jury's verdict that Appellant committed assault with a deadly weapon, establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant is actually guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm or shooting at another with intent to injure, a felony violation of section 645.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This crime, after two (2) or more prior felony convictions, is punishable by twenty (20) years to life imprisonment, but is not subject to the 85% Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 Appellant's erroneous conviction and sentence for a crime subject to the 85% Rule significantly affects his parole consideration eligibility, and thus seriously affects the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. We therefore exercise our discretion to remedy this error by modifying Appellant's conviction to assault with a dangerous weapon or shooting with intent to injure, after former conviction of two (2) or more felonies, and affirming the sentence of life imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   No additional relief is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b612 In Proposition Two, Appellant claims his convictions and sentences for assault with a deadly weapon, possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony (burglary), and possessing a firearm after former conviction of a felony, punish him separately for a single criminal act in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    21 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 11. Reviewing for plain error, as defined above, this claim is without merit. While Counts 3 and 4 arose in part from one continuous act of firearm possession, Appellant's possession of the firearm in the commission of burglary is sufficiently \"separate\n   and distinct\" from both his earlier criminal possession of the firearm and his subsequent assault of the victim to warrant separate punishments.\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840417\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/280/\">\n    2015 OK CR 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840417\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/280/\">\n    358 P.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284-85 (finding possession of single, stolen firearm within defendant's home cannot be punished as both felon in possession and knowingly concealing stolen property; but that section 11 generally allows punishment for both the felonious possession of a firearm and for other crimes in which the weapon is possessed or used). Proposition Two is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 In Proposition Three, Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony (burglary), and the crime of second degree burglary. We determine whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, permits any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Spuehler v.

We find the evidence sufficient in each count, and no relief is warranted. Proposition Three is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 In Proposition Four, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to: (1) the improper conviction in Count 2 (see Proposition One); (2) the violations of section 11 (see Proposition Two); (3) and the insufficient evidence of burglary and possession of a firearm in commission of burglary (see Proposition Three). We review these claims under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We agreed with Appellant that his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was plainly erroneous, and modified the conviction to assault with a dangerous weapon or shooting with intent to injure. Appellant's remaining section 11 and sufficiency of the evidence claims are without merit. Assuming any deficiency in counsel's performance in failing to raise these errors at trial, Appellant cannot show a reasonable probability of a different outcome. Proposition Four is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Proposition Five challenges Appellant's life sentences as excessive. This Court will not disturb a sentence within statutory limits unless, under the facts and circumstances of the case, it shocks the conscience of the Court.\n   <em>\n    Pullen v.

Appellant is a violent recidivist who fired several shots at his latest victim during an attempted auto burglary, and might have easily committed a senseless murder. His sentences do not shock the conscience. Proposition Five is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Appellant argues in Proposition Six that the accumulation of prejudice from errors warrants relief. We remedied the only prejudicial error by modification. There is no other individual, harmful error, and no cumulative prejudice from individually harmless errors.\n   <em>\n    Barnett v.
