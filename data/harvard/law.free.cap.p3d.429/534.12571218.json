He assigns error to the trial court's decisions to (1) deny his motions for standby counsel, (2) remove him from the courtroom during trial, and (3) proceed with trial in his absence while he was self-represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Davis's requests for standby counsel. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in removing Davis from the courtroom during trial, after it warned him, due to his disruptive behavior. The court, however, allowed two material witnesses to testify in Davis's absence, with an empty defense table, and it did not afford him an opportunity to cross-examine either witness. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude this decision violated Davis's Sixth Amendment right to representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We affirm Davis's criminal judgment and sentence as to count 1 (possession of stolen vehicle). However, as the portion of the trial held in Davis's absence included testimony to support counts 2 (possession of a stolen vehicle) and 3 (possession of a controlled substance), we reverse as to those counts and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On January 23, 2014, Sergeant Timothy Gillette of the King County Sheriff's Office arrested Davis for possession of a stolen Hyundai vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Two and a half weeks later, on February 11, 2014, Officer Danny Graf of the Federal Way Police Department observed a Buick parked near a park-and-ride and saw Davis standing outside the car, making furtive movements. As Davis got into the car to drive away, Officer Graf recorded the license plate. The owner had reported the vehicle as stolen. Officer Graf then initiated a traffic stop and arrested Davis for possession of a stolen vehicle - the Buick. Officer Justin Antholt, also of the Federal Way Police Department, arrived as backup and conducted a search incident to arrest. He discovered 2.18 grams of crack cocaine in Davis's shirt pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On May 19, 2014, the State charged Davis with two counts of possession of a stolen vehicle, and one count of possession of a controlled substance. On February 6, 2015, Davis moved to proceed without legal counsel. The court granted the motion. During the trial court's colloquy to assure a proper waiver, Davis requested standby counsel. The court warned Davis it would likely not grant such a request, but told him he could file a motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Davis moved for standby counsel at a case setting hearing on January 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court explained to Davis that he did not have a right to standby counsel and ordering such counsel could raise ethical and practical concerns. Davis then elaborated on his reasons for requesting standby counsel, namely access to office equipment, and unfamiliarity with the judicial process. The trial court denied Davis's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 At another case setting hearing on February 11, 2016, Davis again moved for standby counsel. Davis stated he needed standby counsel because \"there aren't any resources available and they're limited to my health\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well. I may not be able to proceed.\" The trial court stated Washington law does not favor standby counsel. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 On April 1, 2016, Davis renewed his motion for standby counsel. Citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"254930\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/95/323/\">\n    95 Wash.

Davis claimed an \"implied right\" to standby counsel in the event he could not continue representing himself. The court declined to order standby counsel, and stated Davis must choose between having counsel and representing himself. Davis chose to proceed without a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Davis made another motion for standby counsel on May 10, 2016. The trial court asked if Davis's circumstances had changed since his last motion for standby counsel. In response, Davis referenced \"doctor appointments\" and being a \"layperson.\" Seeing no change in circumstances, the trial court denied Davis's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 On February 27, 2017, the parties appeared for pretrial hearings. Davis moved for a continuance. The trial court denied the request, as trial was set to begin the next day and the case had already been significantly delayed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Davis then stated he wanted to \"withdraw\" as his counsel and that the court could go to trial without him. The court attempted to clarify Davis's statements and asked him if he was requesting counsel when he said he wanted to withdraw, but Davis just repeated he would not come to trial and cited health issues. The trial court denied Davis's motion to withdraw as counsel because it would unnecessarily delay trial. The court also declined to appoint standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Trial started the next day and Davis moved for standby counsel and a continuance. The court denied both motions because it had already ruled on them. The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 After a CrR 3.5 hearing, Davis claimed he could not continue with the trial because of excessive pain. Davis again moved for a continuance and the trial court told him it had already denied the motion. Davis stated he was \"unable to continue as [his] own counsel.\" The court reminded Davis it had denied that motion as well. In an attempt to advise Davis of what was expected at trial, the court warned Davis it would remove him if he acted disruptively. Davis said he did not care and that the court could hold trial without him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 Davis appeared for trial on March 7, 2017. In the middle of the afternoon, during the State's examination of Officer Antholt, the court excused Davis for a restroom break. When Davis returned, he noticed the water had been removed from his table. He began banging his fists on the table, screaming he needed water. The court told Davis the water was removed because Davis took restroom breaks every twenty-five minutes. The court noted Davis had consumed twice as much water as the day before and that the proceeding would soon adjourn for the day. The court tried to proceed with trial. The State attempted to continue its examination of Officer Antholt, but Davis repeatedly interrupted to make comments about the water. The trial court temporarily retired the jury and the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: I'm going to take the jury back now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Thank you. You can hold your trial without me.

Just go ahead with your kangaroo court and your ridiculous charges, and your little games and that you do that. Load somebody else up in the prison system. Get your next victim lined up. I'm done with it. I could care less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Wait a minute. Mr. Davis, you have one more--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: What do you want? I need water. I'm done talking. What's there to talk about? You're playing a game. I'm done playing your games.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: All right. The record's going to reflect--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: All right. The record this -- all right, for the record this. I said that, I mean that. I'm not going to continue to be a gentleman and polite. I could care less what you say.

Do whatever you want.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: --from these proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: You're going to deny me water when I need water, whatever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: I need him present so I can make the record, so don't take him out yet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I don't care about your record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I don't. And I know your buddies up at the appellate court ain't gonna give a shit either, so fuck the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: So the record should reflect that Mr. Davis has been given twice as much water as he had yesterday and, therefore, he's--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: So what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: Had to use the restroom twice as much.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I had to use the restroom because I had a digestive dysfunction. I piss a lot. Ask the god damn -- the officers. I piss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: Can you keep your voice down?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No, I'm not. Freedom of expression. You don't want to listen then shut your ears.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: So at about -- ten after 3:00 he was brought back here and I've explained to him that--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: We gonna do this, we gonna play the kangaroo game. I don't care, either. You can keep playing, play with yourself. Stop playing with me. Who cares?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: This is not about the--\n   THE DEFENDANT: I don't care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: This is about you disrupting the trial, delaying the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Doesn't matter what it's about. What it's really about, nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Screaming at the top of his lungs, the jury--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: And I'm going to continue to scream. Where's my fucking water?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (Defendant screaming simultaneously with court)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: I need to proceed with the trial, and I am finding that he is voluntarily absenting himself from the rest of these proceedings under State v. Garza, G-A-R-Z-A, and the record should reflect that he continues to speak on top of his lungs, swearing, accusing me of all kinds of things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: You're being an asshole, and I can be one, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: You're now removed from the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Good. And fuck you very much, asshole. Fuck this kangaroo court shit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 15 At this point, it was after three o'clock in the afternoon. In Davis's absence, the State continued questioning Officer Antholt, who testified as to finding crack cocaine in Davis's pocket. The State then examined Officer Graf, who had identified the stolen Buick, initiated the traffic stop, and arrested Davis. Officer Graf also testified as to Davis's alleged statements about how he had obtained the Buick. The court did not give Davis an opportunity to cross-examine either officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 16 Davis returned to court the next morning. The trial court noted Davis's outburst on March 7 amounted to one of the worst it had seen. The court again warned Davis it would remove him if he raised his voice or used profanity. In its findings, the court indicated Davis's outburst also disrupted trial in the courtroom down the hall. The court noted Davis \"did not have any further behavior issues of significance,\" and he attended the remainder of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Standby Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 17 While Davis concedes he lacks a constitutional right to standby counsel, he claims the trial court abused its discretion by categorically denying his requests for such counsel. He mischaracterizes the record. The trial court properly considered Davis's requests for standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 18 An appellate court reviews a decision to deny standby counsel for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record does not support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 22 The court heard Davis's motions for standby counsel in at least six separate hearings before five different judges. Initially, the trial court engaged in a colloquy with Davis\n   to ensure he made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel. Indeed, Davis does not challenge the validity of his waiver. The court told Davis he could submit a motion for standby counsel, but warned It would not likely grant it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 23 At the next hearing, Davis presented his reasons for requesting standby counsel. He referenced issues such as lack of access to office equipment, and unfamiliarity with legal processes. The trial court explained at some length its view as to why Washington courts disfavor standby counsel. The court also told Davis that, though he could request standby counsel, such requests were rarely granted. The record shows the court considered his motion and denied it because, in its view, the appointment of standby counsel could give rise to ethical and practical concerns, and Davis failed to demonstrate his need for standby counsel overcame these concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 24 Davis moved for standby counsel several more times. Each time the trial court allowed him to be heard. The court also explained to Davis the reasons it denied his requests. The court afforded Davis opportunities to argue whether his circumstances had changed since the court denied his original motion. Concluding Davis's responses did not justify granting standby counsel, the court denied his motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 25 The court considered each of Davis's numerous requests for standby counsel. Nothing in the record suggests the court believed it did not need to exercise its discretion. The record also does not suggest the court refused to exercise its discretion in denying the motions.

Davis says that, because the record does not show he behaved severely enough to warrant complete removal, the court should have instead allowed him to watch the proceedings from a video monitor in another room, allowed him to return to the trial sooner than the following day, or provided him with transcripts of the proceedings for his closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 37 Here, the trial court warned Davis he risked removal if he continued to interrupt the proceedings. Nevertheless, Davis continued to act disruptively and disregard court\n   orders. The court tolerated much of Davis's inappropriate behavior and finally removed him following an outburst in which Davis repeatedly screamed, banged on the table, and used profanity in the courtroom. Davis yelled so loudly that proceedings in the courtroom across the hall recessed. Such conduct warrants removal from the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 38 When considering the least severe alternative, the trial court can best assess both the technological limitations of its courthouse and the defendant's impending threat to disrupt the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Chapple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314614\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/145/310/#p320\">\n    145 Wash.2d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20P.3d%201025\">\n    36 P.3d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the record does not show the court considered having Davis attend trial in some other way, such as through video monitoring. But this is not mandated. Because there exists only a preference, as opposed to a requirement, for trial courts to use the least severe means, nothing in the record shows the trial court did not act within its discretion when removing Davis from the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   D. Right to Representation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 39 Davis maintains, even if the trial court properly removed him, it violated his Sixth Amendment right to representation by allowing the State to examine two of its witnesses in his absence and not affording him an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.
