MORGAN MORTGAGE ACQUISITION TRUST 2006-CW2, Petitioner,\n    <br/>\n    v.\n    <br/>\n    The EIGHTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT of the State of Nevada, IN AND FOR the COUNTY OF CLARK; and the Honorable David M.

The decision to entertain a petition for a writ of mandamus is purely discretionary.\n     <em>\n      Smith v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558342\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/674/#p677\">\n      107 Nev. 674\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 677,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558342\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/674/#p677\">\n      818 P.2d 849\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 851 (1991). As a general rule, we will not exercise that discretion when the petition challenges a district court order denying a motion for summary judgment.\n     <em>\n      Smith v. Eighth Judicial Dist\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      Court,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11790348\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/1343/#p1344\">\n      113 Nev. 1343\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 1344-45,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11790348\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/1343/#p1344\">\n      950 P.2d 280\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 281 (1997). Petitioner argues that this petition falls within an exception to that general rule primarily because it raises important issues of law that require clarification and a decision could help resolve a large number of quiet title actions pending across the State. Because we recently addressed those issues in\n     <em>\n      Bank of America, N.A. v. SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC,\n     </em>\n     134 Nev., Adv. Op. 72,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/\">\n      427 P.3d 113\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2018), and there is nothing to preclude petitioner from seeking appropriate relief in district court based on that decision, we decline to exercise our discretion to consider this petition on the merits. Accordingly, we\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     ORDER the petition DENIED.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
