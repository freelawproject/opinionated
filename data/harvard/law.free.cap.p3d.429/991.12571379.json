We answer this question affirmatively, and therefore reverse the order of the district court dismissing Plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Melinda Wolinsky (Plaintiff) sued her employer, the New Mexico Corrections Department (Defendant), for sex-based pay discrimination in violation of the FPWA. She alleged that her salary was approximately $8,000 less than that of a male employee also employed as a \"Lawyer-A\" in Defendant's Office of General Counsel. Defendant moved to dismiss under Rule 1-012(B)(1) NMRA and Rule 1-012(B)(6) NMRA. Defendant first argued that the FPWA does not apply to Defendant because, in providing a cause of action against an employer, the FPWA does not define \"employer\" to include the state and its agencies. Defendant contrasted the language of the FPWA with that of other employment-related statutes, such as the New Mexico Human Rights Act (the NMHRA), wherein the definition of \"employer\" expressly includes the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 28-1-2(A), (B) (2007). Second, Defendant argued that the \"general grant of immunity\" in the Tort Claims Act (the TCA) applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 41-4-4(A) (2001) (stating that \"[a] governmental entity and any public employee while acting within the scope of duty are granted immunity from liability for any tort\" except as waived by the provisions of the TCA and other named statutes). The district court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that Defendant is not subject to the FPWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

However, common law sovereign immunity no longer exists. Therefore, we must determine whether the Legislature invoked the state's sovereign immunity in the FPWA. Alternatively, even in the absence of an express statutory invocation, we must determine whether the Legislature intended the state to be subject to the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"183096\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/131/522/\">\n    2002-NMCA-013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"183096\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/131/522/\">\n    131 N.M. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"183096\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/131/522/\">\n    39 P.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing the need to determine whether a statutory cause of action applies to government entities).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The FPWA Does Not Expressly Invoke Sovereign Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {10} When the Legislature invokes the state's sovereign immunity, it does so expressly. Other statutes that invoke the state's sovereign immunity-namely, the TCA and Section 37-1-23-demonstrate a clear invocation of immunity. The TCA straightforwardly provides that \"[a] governmental entity and any public employee while acting within the scope of duty are granted immunity from liability for any tort.\" Section 41-4-4(A). Similarly, in Section 37-1-23(A), the Legislature clearly invokes the state's immunity for contract claims by stating that \"[g]overnmental entities are granted immunity from actions based on contract[.]\" The FPWA does not contain any similar language, and it does not refer to sovereign immunity at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 28-23-1 to -6 (2013) (lacking language addressing the state's immunity from suits alleging violation of the conduct prohibited). We therefore conclude that Defendant has no sovereign immunity from liability under the TCA or the FPWA. We next examine the language of the FPWA to determine whether the Legislature intended the state to be a liable party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The State Is an \"Employer\" Subject to Claims Brought Under the FPWA by Public Employees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {11} The FPWA prohibits an \"employer\" from discriminating between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees at a rate less than the rate that the employer pays wages to employees of the opposite sex for equal work. Section 28-23-3(A). The FPWA defines \"employer\" as \"a person employing four or more employees and any person acting for an employer.\" Section 28-23-2(E). The FPWA does not, however, define \"person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {12} In the absence of contradictory language in the FPWA, the provisions of the Uniform Statute and Rule Construction Act (the USRCA) apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 12-2A-1(B) (1997). \"The [USRCA] applies to a statute enacted or rule adopted on or after the effective date of that act unless the statute or rule expressly provides otherwise, the context of its language requires otherwise[,] or the application of that act to the statute or rule would be infeasible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"183096\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/131/522/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Legislature enacted the FPWA sixteen years after the passage of the USRCA. Section 28- 23 -1; Section 12-2A-1. The FPWA does not provide that the USRCA does not apply; the context of the FPWA does not require that the USRCA does not apply; and the application of the USRCA to the FPWA is feasible. Therefore, the USRCA supplies the meaning of terms not defined in the FPWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {13} The USRCA defines \"person\" as \"an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture or any legal or commercial entity[.]\" NMSA 1978, Section 12-2A-3(E) (1997). A \"legal entity\" is \"[a] body, other than a natural person, that can function legally, sue or be sued, and make decisions through agents.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1031 (10th ed. 2014). The state, an entity capable of suing and being sued, is, therefore, a legal entity that falls within the definition of \"person\" and thus is subject to suit for violating the terms of the FPWA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 10-16C-4 (2010) (providing a cause of action against the state);\n   <em>\n    State v. Davisson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1923-NMSC-045\">\n    1923-NMSC-045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8843577\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/28/653/\">\n    28 N.M. 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20P.%20240\">\n    217 P. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the board of county commissioners is entitled to sue for sums due to the county).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {14} Finally, we address Defendant's argument that the Legislature must not have intended the USRCA's definition of \"person\" to include the state because the USRCA separately defines \"state.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-2A-3(E), (M). Defendant reasons that if \"person\" included the state, there would have been no need to provide a definition for \"state.\" We are not persuaded by this argument. The USRCA defines \"state\" as \"a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20P.%20240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All items within the definition of \"state\" are geographic locations. Section 12-2(A)-3(M). The items within the definition of \"person\" are different in kind; all but one of the items in the definition is a body or an entity created by law. As a result, the definition of \"state\" is not superfluous. It simply defines the geographic locations that are included by use of the term \"state\" on its own in a statute, whether or not the statute also uses the term \"person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {15} We conclude that the Legislature intended for the state to be subject to claims brought under the FPWA and we reverse the order of the district court granting Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {16}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   M.
