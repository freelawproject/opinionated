WAPC is an Iowa-based professional corporation engaged in providing professional architectural\n   and design services, primarily through its principal shareholder, Thomas Wertzberger, AIA. In January 2013, Allen Dunlavy, d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.,\n   </em>\n   retained WAPC to perform professional architectural and design services on a building construction project in Shelby, Montana (Shelby Project). Unknown to WAPC, and for reasons not of record on appeal,\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   did not actually exist as a separate corporate entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Incident to providing architectural and design services to Dunlavy, WAPC commissioned BSCE to provide onsite engineering services for the Shelby Project. By email dated Monday, January 14, 2014, WAPC authorized BSCE to proceed with a previously discussed scope of work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Please accept this email as your authorization to begin work on the Shelby [project] site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   You can proceed on an hourly basis per the schedule you sent me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    For now\n   </em>\n   , you can invoice your time to [WAPC] as listed below.\n   <em>\n    This may change\n   </em>\n   as things proceed on the project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis added.) WAPC addressed and sent the email jointly to BSCE, Allen Dunlavy, and Dunlavy's construction contractor (Warren Barse). BSCE immediately replied \"Thanks. We'll plan to meet Warren [Barse] onsite on Wednesday....\" BSCE emailed its response directly to Wertzberger, Barse, and Allen Dunlavy, with copies to various others. In a subsequent affidavit, WAPC, through Wertzberger, attested that WAPC clearly communicated to BSCE that WAPC was at all times acting on behalf and to the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp\n   </em>\n   . Wertzberger further attested that \"BSCE met with [\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ] personnel in Shelby in the early stages of the engagement to come up with the work plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By email dated Friday, January 18th, BSCE notified Wertzberger, Barse, and Allen Dunlavy of BSCE's preliminary communications with a contemplated geotechnical engineering subcontractor. The email advised that BSCE would forward the subcontractor's proposal later that day and requested that the recipients notify BSCE if they desired a sooner start date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 Several weeks later, on February 7, 2013, at 5:06 p.m., BSCE emailed an invoice to WAPC in the amount of $19,610.86 for payment on BSCE's completed Shelby Project work. At 11:33 a.m. the next morning, WAPC replied by email, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    owner\n   </em>\n   would like you to bill\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   directly for your services. If you could modify the invoice so it is to\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   and send it there that would be great.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The WAPC email further instructed BSCE to send the invoice to the referenced owner, \"[\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ] ... Atten. Allen Dunlavy.\" Without objection or question, BSCE re-addressed the invoice as directed and sent it to the address specified in the WAPC email. In a subsequent affidavit, Murphy attested that BSCE re-invoiced\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   based on BSCE's belief that WAPC and Wertzberger \"were agents of [\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ]\" By correspondence on April 26, 2013, Allen Dunlavy instructed BSCE that \"if [BSCE] [is] not paid by May 1st ...\" to \"direct all collections towards [Dunlavy]\" and that \"the other parties have no part in this invoice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b66 On May 20, 2013, after receiving no payment on the Dunlavy\n   invoice, BSCE filed a complaint in the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court against\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   , Wertzberger, WAPC, and Barse for payment on the invoiced work. Four days later, BSCE amended its complaint to included named defendants Allen Dunlavy d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   , WAPC, and Wertzberger. Following\n   Dunlavy's failure to appear and answer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   BSCE ultimately obtained a default judgment against \"Allen Dunlavy d/b/a [\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ]\" for the principal amount of the contract debt ($19,610.86), plus costs and interest. On August 12, 2014, BSCE moved for summary judgment against WAPC for the same principal amount on asserted claims of account stated and breach of contract. In opposition to the motion, WAPC asserted that WAPC never assented to the BSCE invoice as a debt owed by WAPC and that WAPC was not liable in contract because BSCE was aware that WAPC was acting as an agent for Dunlavy d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp\n   </em>\n   . Finding that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether WAPC assented to the BSCE invoice as an account stated and whether WAPC disclosed to BSCE that it was acting as an agent of an identified principal rather than in its own individual capacity, the District Court denied BSCE's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b67 On November 4, 2015, WAPC and Wertzberger filed their own motion for summary judgment on BSCE's claims on the asserted grounds that: (1) neither of them assented to the BSCE invoice as a debt owed to BSCE by either; (2) WAPC was not liable to BSCE because it entered into the BSCE contract merely as an agent for a disclosed principal (Dunlavy d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ); and (3) Wertzberger was not liable for any debt attributed to WAPC because he in turn was merely acting as a known agent for an identified principal (WAPC) and that grounds did not exist to pierce WAPC's corporate veil. BSCE opposed the motion on the asserted grounds that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether WAPC assented to the BSCE invoice as an account stated and whether WAPC/Wertzberger contracted with BSCE in their individual capacities rather than in their asserted agency capacities. BSCE alternatively asserted that, even if acting as an agent of\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   , WAPC remained liable to BSCE under agency principles either due to non-disclosure of the agency or principal or because the purported principal in fact did not exist. Finding no genuine issue of material fact on the supplemented Rule 56 record, the District Court granted summary judgment to\n   WAPC and Wertzberger on BSCE's claims. The court essentially concluded that WAPC and Wertzberger were entitled to summary judgment that: (1) WAPC's overnight delay in responding to BSCE's afterhours email invoice did not constitute assent to be personally bound by the stated debt; (2) BSCE had reason to know that WAPC engaged BSCE as an agent of Dunlavy d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ; (3) the common-law principle that an agent is liable for obligations entered into on behalf of a non-existent principal does not apply if the agent was not acting for the agent's own benefit; (4) Wertzberger made an unrebutted threshold showing that he engaged BSCE on behalf of his immediate principal (WAPC); and (5) BSCE neither pled nor made a supported factual showing for a claim for piercing WAPC's corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 We review summary judgment rulings de novo under the standards of M.

It is beyond genuine material dispute that WAPC was acting at all times as the project architect. BSCE made no assertion, much less a supported responsive showing, that WAPC had any other interest in the project or of any cost distribution agreement between WAPC and BSCE. WAPC co-addressed its January 14th notice to proceed jointly to BSCE, Allen Dunlavy, and construction contractor Barse. WAPC's included directive for BSCE to email WAPC was expressly subject to subsequent change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b619 BSCE's own contemporaneous conduct eliminates any ambiguity in WAPC's initial email statement. In response to WAPC's January 14th notice to proceed and initial invoicing instruction, BSCE responded by email directly to WAPC, contractor Barse, and Allen Dunlavy. Four days later, BSCE similarly emailed WAPC, Barse, and Allen Dunlavy (addressing them collectively as \"Gentlemen\"). The email advised them that the Shelby Project geotechnical work would commence on a specified start date \"assuming\" that they found the subcontractor's \"proposal acceptable,\" and requested that they notify BSCE if they desired a sooner start date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b620 Following its receipt of BSCE's initial email invoice after 5:00 p.m. on February 7th, and consistent with its prior notice to\n   BSCE that the invoice recipient was subject to change, WAPC advised BSCE the next morning that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [t]he\n   <em>\n    owner\n   </em>\n   would like you to bill\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   directly for your services. If you could modify the invoice so it is to\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   and send it there that\n   would be great. The owner is [\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ] [address omitted] Attn: Allen Dunlavy.... Let me know if you have any questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Emphasis added.) BSCE promptly redirected the invoice to\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp\n   </em>\n   . as directed without question, objection, or statement evincing any prior understanding or manifestation of mutual intent that WAPC would be personally bound. Consistent with WAPC's affidavit assertion that BSCE was aware at all times that WAPC was merely acting as the project architect to the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp\n   </em>\n   ., BSCE later admitted that it resubmitted its invoice to\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   as directed by WAPC based on its belief that WAPC and Wertzberger \"were agents of [\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp\n   </em>\n   .]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In yet another indicia of the parties' contemporaneous understanding, Allen Dunlavy corresponded with BSCE on April 26, 2013, and instructed BSCE that \"if [BSCE] [is] not paid by May 1st ...\" to \"direct all collections towards [Dunlavy]\" and that \"the other parties have no part in this invoice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAPC also presented unrebutted affidavit testimony that BSCE made no contemporaneous statement asserting or indicating a belief that it had contracted with WAPC in a personal capacity. The first assertion or indication of any such belief came in BSCE's District Court complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b621 Further supporting WAPC's position are two after-the-fact email statements on August 13, 2013, made by Allen Dunlavy to BSCE's counsel, WAPC, and Dunlavy's general contractor wherein Dunlavy consistently admits that he \"personally gave\" WAPC \"the go ahead to request the [sitework] survey\" and that he, not WAPC, was \"responsible for [the] debt.\" Though double hearsay is otherwise generally inadmissible pursuant to M. R. Evid. 801(c), 802, and 805, Dunlavy's statements were nonetheless admissible as definitional non-hearsay pursuant to M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) and (B) (admissions by a party-opponent). In the first instance, Dunlavy's statements were admissible against Dunlavy pursuant to M. R. Evid. R. 801(d)(2)(A) as admissions offered against him in the affidavit of BSCE counsel Mark Dunn in support of BSCE's motion for entry of default judgment. In the second instance, Dunlavy's statements were admissible\n   <em>\n    against BSCE\n   </em>\n   pursuant to M. R. Evid. R. 801(d)(2)(B) as statements in which BSCE previously manifested an adoption or belief in their truth for the purpose of obtaining default judgment against Dunlavy. If unrebutted, the totality of these facts and circumstances clearly manifest that\n   WAPC was at all times acting as an agent of a principal whose identity BSCE had reason to know, Allen Dunlavy d/b/a\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   These facts similarly contradict BSCE's assertion that WAPC expressly or implicitly agreed to be personally liable on the contract independent of Dunlavy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b622 On satisfaction of the moving party's threshold burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the evidentiary burden shifts to the opposing party to respond with an affirmative showing of specific, substantial, and material evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

Here, BSCE has made no non-conclusory showing of contemporaneous fact indicating any affirmative expression or manifestation by WAPC to be personally\n   bound to pay BSCE for the Shelby Project work. As a threshold matter, BSCE's conveniently parsed reliance on WAPC's initial email directive to invoice WAPC and its subsequent affidavit assertions that WAPC agreed that BSCE would extend credit to WAPC personally are inconsistent with: (1) the complete email statement in context; (2) BSCE's contemporaneous pre-dispute conduct; (3) BSCE's subsequent affidavit admission that BSCE believed that WAPC was Dunlavy's agent; and (4) BSCE's subsequent adoption and assertion of Dunlavy's admission that he, not WAPC, was responsible for the debt. BSCE has made no affirmative factual showing of any particular statement, circumstance, or conduct supporting its general conclusory assertion that WAPC affirmatively assented to be personally bound either in lieu of, or jointly with, Dunlavy on a contract debt negotiated by an admitted agent of a principal whose identity BSCE had reason to know. Under these circumstances, BSCE's conclusory affidavit assertions, tantamount to mere denials, were insufficient to defeat summary judgment on the Rule 56 showing made by WAPC. Regardless of the non-existence of\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   as a separate legal entity, it is beyond genuine material dispute on the Rule 56 record presented that WAPC was a disclosed agent for a disclosed principal,\n   Allen Dunlavy d/b/a/\n   <em>\n    Dunlavy Corp.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is similarly beyond genuine material dispute that WAPC did not expressly or implicitly assent to be personally liable for the preliminary Shelby Project work performed by BSCE to the benefit of the project owner.
