We follow the prevailing view, if not the Washington rule, that the court must continue to monitor the mental health of the accused and must order another mental health evaluation if a substantial change in circumstances raises reasonable doubt as to the accused's competency. Because of the trial court's failure to abide by this principle, we reverse Matthew McCarthy's conviction for first degree burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Appellant Matthew McCarthy aggressively denies any incompetency to stand trial. Nevertheless, his counsel on appeal, as did an earlier trial counsel, properly argues to the contrary. Although McCarthy promotes his competency, we still attribute his counsel's argument to him in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The conduct of Matthew McCarthy relevant to this appeal concerns more his behavior during the pendency of the prosecution rather than the conduct that led to the prosecution. But the alleged criminal behavior\n   provides a setting for McCarthy's later conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 We start with facts transpiring before the filing of charges beginning with the medical background of Matthew McCarthy. McCarthy was born in January 1979. He ceased attending school in the tenth grade. He falsely claims that he holds a college degree. Treatment providers first diagnosed McCarthy with bipolar disorder when he was sixteen years old. Providers later diagnosed McCarthy as being bipolar with paranoid features, having an antisocial personality disorder, and as suffering from a substance use disorder. Although medication assuages his disorders, it does not alleviate all symptoms. Before this prosecution, McCarthy amassed a lengthy criminal history that included two convictions for serious offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The events directly giving rise to this prosecution began on September 21, 2014, and concern Matthew McCarthy's trespass into the home of Kayla Gonzales. On that autumn day, McCarthy had been free from his latest incarceration for only two and one half weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On the morning of September 21, 2014, Matthew McCarthy drove on Mount Vernon Street in Spokane on his way to a friend's house. While driving, McCarthy noticed two cars he believed had been parked outside his home on Thor Street and found it odd that the same two cars formerly parked on his street were now parked on Mount Vernon Street. So, McCarthy stopped and knocked on the door nearest the parked vehicles. Kayla Gonzales answered the door. According to McCarthy, Gonzales looked at him as if she recognized him. McCarthy then asked for someone named Ellie. Gonzales responded that no one by that name lived at the house and began to close the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Matthew McCarthy grew curious about how Kayla Gonzales recognized him. According to McCarthy, he surmised that Gonzales must recognize him because she saw his face from pictures in his ex-wife, Laura's, home. McCarthy, convinced that Gonzales and Laura McCarthy were friends and that Laura was inside Gonzales' house with another man, blocked, with his arm, the front door from closing. According to McCarthy, his strength overpowered Gonzales as he was able to force his way into the home. Gonzales then exclaimed: \"let me get my child and leave.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) (Sept. 20, 2016) at 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 According to Kayla Gonzales, when McCarthy pushed the door forward, Gonzales released her hold from the inside of the door, which release propelled McCarthy inside the home. McCarthy lost his balance and, as he flew forward inside the home, his arm struck Gonzales' shoulder which pushed her into a wall. Gonzales, who held her cell phone in her hand when she opened the door, later testified she could not remember whether McCarthy knocked the cell phone from her hand or whether the phone flew from her hand when the door swung open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Matthew McCarthy, realizing he was inside the home, made eye contact with Kayla Gonzales and walked into the living room. Gonzales ran the opposite direction and climbed the staircase toward the bedroom where her two-year-old daughter slept. From upstairs in the bedroom with her daughter, Gonzales heard noises from downstairs as if McCarthy rummaged through the kitchen. When the noise stopped, Gonzales emerged from the bedroom. McCarthy was no longer inside the home, but he later peered through a window from the outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 According to Kayla Gonzales, after Matthew McCarthy left the residence, she, not knowing the location of her cell phone, called police from her land line. By the arrival of law enforcement, McCarthy had left the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Matthew McCarthy returned to Kayla Gonzales' home the following evening, September 22, in search of his former wife, Laura. When McCarthy knocked on the front door, Gonzales' boyfriend, Cory Hierholzer, and his brother answered. McCarthy asked the boyfriend for Laura. The boyfriend responded that Laura was not present, and McCarthy returned to his car and left the vicinity. Gonzales inquired as to the visitor. When Hierholzer described the man, Gonzales immediately called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Minutes later, Matthew McCarthy returned to Kayla Gonzales' house a third\n   time and a second time that evening. The boyfriend stood outside. McCarthy stopped his car, rolled down his window, and asked the brother if anyone had found McCarthy's cellphone. Apparently, McCarthy had misplaced his phone. The brother fidgeted like he would attack McCarthy so McCarthy sped away. Cory Hierholzer, his brother, and a few of their friends chased McCarthy in two cars. The group pursued McCarthy to a gas station and cornered him until police arrived. Gonzales drove to the gas station and identified McCarthy as the man who entered her house the previous morning. Police arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 Upon his arrest, Matthew McCarthy commented to law enforcement officers that he had not taken his medications. He refused to go to a mental health professional and instead insisted on going to jail after being informed of the charges. During interaction with law enforcement, McCarthy believed he saw people hiding behind cars, and he spoke to people not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 According to jail records, Matthew McCarthy had imbibed methamphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis shortly before his arrest. Jail medical practitioners placed McCarthy on trazadone and lithium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 The following facts lack relevance to the underlying crime but assist in understanding Matthew McCarthy's assignment of error relating to falsified reports. The facts also aid in understanding McCarthy's continuing concern, during the prosecution, that law enforcement, with the assistance of others, fabricated evidence in order to house him in a mental hospital or jail. In turn, McCarthy often believed he would prevail at trial because of the falsehoods and inconsistencies in witness stories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 According to Officer Todd Belitz, he arrived at the gas station to assist other officers on September 22, 2014. Belitz asked Kayla Gonzales about the previous morning when Matthew McCarthy entered her home. Officer Belitz's report matched the testimony that Gonzales gave at trial until Gonzales saw McCarthy peeping through the windows. In Officer Belitz's report, he wrote that Gonzales called 911, found her car keys and phone minutes later, and then, while holding her daughter, exited the front door to walk to the garage in order to safely leave the home in her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 Officer Todd Belitz further wrote in his incident report that, after Kayla Gonzales took two steps toward the garage, she saw Matthew McCarthy sitting on the hood of a green sports utility vehicle. Gonzales and McCarthy locked eyes, and Gonzales told McCarthy that he could take whatever he wanted and she would leave the door open if she and her child could leave safely. McCarthy only laughed at Gonzales. She concluded she could not leave safely, ran back inside the house, and locked the door. Officer Belitz, in his report, also declared that Gonzales remained on the phone with 911 the entire time this exchange took place. The affidavit of facts in support of charges read that Gonzales would testify that she attempted to flee in her vehicle before being stopped by McCarthy, who sat on his car laughing, and that McCarthy fled the scene in a green vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 To summarize a lengthy procedure, after two psychological evaluations finding Matthew McCarthy capable of understanding legal proceedings but incapable of assisting his counsel, one psychologist determined McCarthy to be capable of assisting his attorney. Then a jury found Matthew McCarthy competent to stand trial. A later jury found McCarthy guilty of the charges. Because Matthew McCarthy argues on appeal that he lacked competence to stand trial even after the jury finding, we seek to discern why the first jury ruled McCarthy to be competent and whether his behavior changed after the jury verdict such that the court or counsel should have sought another competency evaluation. This task requires an extensive review of the prosecution's procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 The State of Washington charged Matthew McCarthy with first degree burglary predicated on an assault of Kayla Gonzales. The alleged assault consisted of McCarthy striking Gonzales as he entered Gonzales' residence and knocking Gonzales' cellphone from her hand. Because of McCarthy's\n   extensive criminal history, including two serious offenses, the State sought an exceptional sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 Because of concerns about Matthew McCarthy's competence to stand trial, the superior court did not initially arraign McCarthy. On October 2, 2014, the superior court ordered that a psychologist perform a competency evaluation of McCarthy. Psychologist Daniel Lord-Flynn performed the evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 On October 29, 2014, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn interviewed Matthew McCarthy, then age 35, in the presence of McCarthy's appointed attorney, Kari Reardon, at the Spokane County Jail. McCarthy then lengthily discussed the legal proceedings against him. McCarthy expressed his belief that Kayla Gonzales participated, with law enforcement and his former wife, in a baroque conspiracy against him. Despite these beliefs, McCarthy acknowledged that he lacked proof of a conspiracy and the court would likely reject his allegations. McCarthy stated that he would consider his conspiracy theory's shortcomings when rendering decisions about entering a plea agreement in his prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 At some unidentified date in October 2014, Matthew McCarthy sent a letter to counsel Kari Reardon, in which correspondence he complained that she looked at him, during the interview with Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn, as if he was stupid. The correspondence also murmured that Reardon undermined him. The letter additionally exhibited a preoccupation with McCarthy's conspiracy views. Reardon forwarded the letter to Daniel Lord-Flynn for consideration. In October and November 2014, McCarthy sent additional correspondence that complained about his counsel, and he spoke with counsel about the contriving between his former wife and Kayla Gonzales. Kari Reardon informed Lord-Flynn that McCarthy no longer accepted his lack of proof for his conspiracy beliefs and thus could not rationally address the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 Because of the correspondence from Matthew McCarthy to his counsel, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn scheduled a second interview with McCarthy at the Spokane County Jail for December 1, 2014. Immediately before the interview, McCarthy spoke with his attorney, Kari Reardon. During the interview, McCarthy informed Dr. Lord-Flynn that he would not answer questions because Reardon and Lord-Flynn violated the attorney-client privilege when Reardon informed Lord-Flynn about communications with McCarthy. McCarthy expressed a desire to proceed to trial on the prosecution's charges. Lord-Flynn terminated the December 1 interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn diagnosed Matthew McCarthy with a bipolar disorder with psychotic features and with two substance abuse disorders involving alcohol and marijuana. On December 9, 2014, Daniel Lord-Flynn reported to the superior court that McCarthy understood the nature of the proceedings, but he could not make rational decisions concerning the prosecution. Therefore, according to Lord-Flynn, McCarthy lacked competency to stand trial. Lord-Flynn recommended McCarthy's admission to Eastern State Hospital for ninety days for competency restoration treatment, including involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs. On December 11, the superior court found McCarthy to lack competency to stand trial and ordered ninety days of competency restoration services for McCarthy at Eastern State Hospital. Authorities transferred McCarthy, on December 22, 2014, from jail to the hospital. The State proceeded to render a man rational so that he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 During his first stay at Eastern State Hospital, Matthew McCarthy occasionally displayed agitation, aggressiveness, and compulsiveness. He presented himself as entitled and tested the limits of hospital rules. He often spoke angrily on the phone with his legal counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26 During his first stay at Eastern State Hospital, the hospital engaged Matthew McCarthy in competency classes. McCarthy was attentive during competency exercises and usually answered all questions correctly. He engaged in discussions following the presentation of courtroom drama videos, current event classes, and videos on mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   During this stay at Eastern State Hospital, he often refused his trazodone medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27 On December 14, 2014, Matthew McCarthy on his own filed a declaration in superior court. In his declaration, McCarthy averred that he did not trust legal counsel, Kari Reardon. He accused Reardon of violating his rights and claimed Reardon would continue to violate his rights if the court did not remove her from his representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28 Matthew McCarthy insisted on a second psychological evaluation because he deemed Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn to be a \"hack\" for the State. RP (April 24, 2015) at 5-6. Because of the conclusions of Lord-Flynn, counsel Kari Reardon did not deem a second opinion to be currently merited. McCarthy wrote a letter to the superior court complaining of Reardon's refusal to hire an independent evaluator. As a result, on January 2, 2015, at the request of Kari Reardon, the court appointed Dr. Debra Brown to perform another evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 29 On March 6, 2015, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn performed another forensic evaluation of Matthew McCarthy by interviewing him with counsel Kari Reardon and psychologist Dr. Debra Brown present. During the interview with Lord-Flynn, McCarthy complained about his attorney and refused to discuss his contention of a conspiracy against him. McCarthy claimed to have hired a new attorney, who opined that Reardon was mentally ill. McCarthy refused to disclose the name of his new attorney or the details of the attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 30 As a result of the March 6 interview, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn found Matthew McCarthy as being alert and with no behaviors to suggest the presence of hallucinations or delusions. Thereafter Dr. Lord-Flynn reported to the superior court that McCarthy could now assist in his defense and was competent to stand trial because McCarthy could cooperate with his purported new lawyer. According to Lord-Flynn, any difficulty in cooperating with counsel would end with the termination of Kari Reardon's representation of McCarthy. Lord-Flynn probably assumed that the superior court would appoint McCarthy new counsel and did not recognize that courts do not readily appoint accused new attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 31 Eastern State Hospital discharged Matthew McCarthy on March 9, 2015, with the diagnoses of manic bipolar disorder in early remission, substance abuse in remission because of a controlled environment, and antisocial personality disorder. The hospital gave him a prescription of lithium carbonate. McCarthy returned to the Spokane County jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 32 On March 12, 2015, Dr. Debra Brown interviewed Matthew McCarthy alone at the Spokane County Jail. McCarthy explained to Brown that the State charged him with first degree burglary and sought lifetime imprisonment because of his third serious offense. McCarthy again complained about the performance of his counsel, Kari Reardon, and of Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn. McCarthy bespoke: \" 'It is an adversarial system but my biggest adversary is my attorney.' \" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 166. McCarthy commented that he refused to explain himself to Dr. Lord-Flynn because of his disregard for Lord-Flynn. Brown ended the interview when McCarthy remarked: \" 'Kari [Reardon] seems to think that she is the one that is trying to run my case and has forgotten who the boss is-ME!' \" CP at 166. In addition to interviewing McCarthy, Brown reviewed extensive psychological records of McCarthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33 On March 17, 2015, Matthew McCarthy submitted a grievance, with the Washington State Bar Association Office of Disciplinary Counsel, against Kari Reardon. The grievance accused Reardon of violating the attorney-client privilege, uttering prevarications, and ignoring his requests. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel declined to bring charges against counsel Reardon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34 On April 5, 2015, Dr. Debra Brown submitted her report to the superior court. Brown diagnosed McCarthy with hypomanic bipolar disorder with paranoid features, antisocial personality disorder, and substance abuse disorder in institutional remission. She concluded, contrary to Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn, that McCarthy lacked the present ability to rationally assist in his defense. She noted that McCarthy had changed little since Lord-Flynn concluded, in December 2014,\n   that McCarthy could not assist his attorney. Since that evaluation, McCarthy had continued to demonstrate symptoms of grandiosity, distrust, and paranoia. He continued to falsely blame his attorney for his misfortunes and to wrongly accuse her of working in favor of the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 35 DeAnna Cornell, an investigator hired by Kari Reardon, accompanied Reardon to the Spokane County Jail on April 17, 2015, to visit Matthew McCarthy. Cornell later signed an affidavit describing McCarthy's behavior during the visit. According to Cornell, McCarthy could not focus on the conversation even when redirected. He spoke incessantly about his ex-wife. He spoke \"over\" attorney Reardon. CP at 1524. He refused to sit, his eyes bugged out, and he laughed at inappropriate times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 36 Because of the competing evaluations of Dr. Debra Brown and Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn, the superior court conducted a contested hearing, on April 24, 2015, as to Matthew McCarthy's competency to stand trial. The superior court reviewed the reports of Debra Brown and Daniel Lord-Flynn rather than entertaining live testimony. Kari Reardon represented McCarthy at the hearing. McCarthy's counsel noted that McCarthy understood the nature of the proceedings, but he could not assist his lawyer. Reardon mentioned the State simply characterized the difficulty between McCarthy and her as McCarthy disliking Reardon. According to Reardon, the State's position did not recognize the seriousness of the discord between McCarthy and his counsel. McCarthy genuinely believed that Reardon had joined the conspiracy against him and worked together with the prosecution to harm him. Reardon commented that she represented McCarthy on charges brought in 2010 and 2013, and she encountered no difficulty with assisting him on the earlier occasions. She concluded that McCarthy's bipolarism had overcome his ability to rid himself of paranoiac delusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 37 In response, the prosecution praised Kari Reardon's abilities as an attorney and characterized her as \"strong-willed.\" RP (April 24, 2015) at 12. According to the prosecution, Matthew McCarthy also carried a strong will such that the client and his counsel may only have a personality conflict. According to the State, the superior court should appoint McCarthy a new attorney rather than declare him incompetent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 38 During the April 24 hearing, Matthew McCarthy called his counsel a \"maggot.\" CP at 461. Because of verbal abuse from McCarthy, three court officers surrounded Kari Reardon to protect her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 39 At the conclusion of the April 24, 2015 hearing, the superior court ruled that Matthew McCarthy lacked competency to assist his defense attorney and to stand trial. The court noted that counsel Kari Reardon and Matthew McCarthy enjoyed a good relationship in earlier years such that a personality conflict did not explain the obstacles between counsel and client. The superior court ordered another ninety-day placement with Eastern State Hospital, during which McCarthy would receive additional competency restoration services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 40 During his second residency at Eastern State Hospital, Matthew McCarthy generally behaved appropriately and communicated effectively. Nevertheless, McCarthy occasionally intimidated and cursed staff. Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn attributed the occasional misbehavior to McCarthy's antisocial personality disorder, not to a major mental illness. According to Lord-Flynn, medications ended McCarthy's delusions such that McCarthy's treating psychiatrist questioned whether McCarthy still suffered from bipolar disorder. McCarthy regularly attended competency restoration classes but learned nothing new beyond what he learned in earlier classes. McCarthy already understood the legal process. McCarthy continued to complain to hospital staff about counsel, Kari Reardon. He told staff that he considered representing himself in the prosecution, but he hoped the court would assign him other counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 41 On October 4, 2015, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn interviewed Matthew McCarthy again at Eastern State Hospital. Dr. Debra Brown, counsel Kari Reardon, and two psychologists from the hospital attended the clinical interview. In addition to interviewing McCarthy, Daniel Lord-Flynn reviewed Eastern State\n   Hospital charts, documents delivered to Lord-Flynn by McCarthy, and letters written by McCarthy. During the interview, McCarthy correctly answered that the prosecution would need to prove that he entered a home without permission and assaulted someone inside the home in order to convict him of first degree burglary. McCarthy expressed happiness that the trial court ordered the second ninety-day residency at Eastern State Hospital because he knew that, after two deferments of the prosecution because of incompetency, the accused was entitled to a jury trial on his competency. McCarthy looked forward to testifying at a jury trial. McCarthy also thought he might win his prosecution because of inconsistent statements from Kayla Gonzales and her boyfriend. McCarthy surmised that he might not even need to testify to win because of the inconsistent statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 42 During the October 4 interview, Matthew McCarthy announced to Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn that his relationship with Kari Reardon had ended. McCarthy stated that he paid an attorney $500, although the attorney demanded another $6,000 to represent him. McCarthy also indicated he probably would not hire the attorney. He hoped the public defender's office would assign a new attorney. Kari Reardon mentioned that the new director of the public defender's office did not assign new attorneys when the client declined representation from the first assigned attorney. McCarthy conceded that representing himself would constitute a bad decision and that he would rely on Reardon as his counsel if the public defender's office refused to assign another lawyer. Nevertheless, if Reardon continued to represent him, he would seek a plea agreement because he would not trust her to conduct a trial. Daniel Lord-Flynn attributed McCarthy's difficult relationship with Reardon to McCarthy's antisocial personality disorder not to a bipolar disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 43 On October 14, 2015, Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn reported again to the superior court that Matthew McCarthy understood the criminal proceedings against him and held the capacity to assist in his defense. Lord-Flynn mentioned, however, that McCarthy might choose not to utilize his capacity to assist his counsel. Dr. Debra Brown, in a separate report to the superior court, continued to opine that McCarthy could not assist his counsel because of his conspiracy beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 44 Matthew McCarthy personally continued to insist on his competency, but, through counsel, opposed Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn's finding of competency to stand trial. McCarthy demanded a jury trial on his competency. A jury trial proceeded on January 25, 2016, before a superior court judge other than the judge who earlier ruled Matthew McCarthy to remain incompetent. Kari Reardon represented McCarthy during the competency trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 45 During the competency trial, Matthew McCarthy declared \"absolutely\" his competency to stand trial. RP (Jan. 26, 2016) at 347. He testified about his mental health and disclosed how his behavior and interactions become chaotic when he fails to take medication. McCarthy commented that his working relationship with his attorney, Kari Reardon, ended when he learned that Reardon betrayed him by disclosing private communications to Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn. McCarthy also complained about Reardon's failure to forward him requested records. McCarthy pledged to work with another attorney, if the court appointed a substitute attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 46 During his testimony, Matthew McCarthy noted that Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn initially opined to McCarthy's competency to stand trial. McCarthy took exception to Daniel Lord-Flynn changing his opinion after Kari Reardon shared correspondence that McCarthy sent Reardon. He felt betrayed by Reardon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 47 During the jury trial, Matthew McCarthy expressed displeasure toward Dr. Debra Brown. According to McCarthy, Dr. Brown, during her second evaluation of McCarthy, told him that she would instruct Kari Reardon to withdraw from representation of McCarthy so that McCarthy could proceed to trial on the criminal charges. But three weeks later Brown wrote a report that declared him incompetent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 48 Following Matthew McCarthy's testimony, Dr. Debra Brown and Dr. Daniel\n   Lord-Flynn respectively testified to their observations of and opinions concerning McCarthy. The two psychologists concurred on diagnoses for McCarthy of bipolar disorder with paranoid features, antisocial personality disorder, and a substance use disorder. Both psychologists agreed that McCarthy understood the legal process, but the two disagreed as to McCarthy's ability to assist counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 49 Both psychologists Debra Brown and Daniel Lord-Flynn explained for the jury the difference between bizarre delusions and nonbizarre delusion. A bizarre delusion entails an impossible belief, such as aliens implanting transmitters in one's brain. A nonbizarre delusion involves a possible, but untrue, belief. Matthew McCarthy had held only nonbizarre delusions since Kayla Gonzales and Laura McCarthy could possibly know one another and conspire to place him in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 50 Dr. Debra Brown told the jury that Matthew McCarthy was not rational and could not assist in his defense. Brown testified that Matthew McCarthy insisted that Kayla Gonzales and his ex-wife were friends. McCarthy also insisted that DeAnna Cornell, Kari Reardon's investigator, was a male, but, according to Brown, Cornell was definitively a female. McCarthy believed he never violated the law. Although medication helped to treat the paranoia, the medication did not alleviate all symptoms. Brown denied telling Matthew McCarthy that she would advise Kari Reardon to withdraw from representing McCarthy so that he could proceed to trial on the criminal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 51 Dr. Debra Brown explained that Matthew McCarthy believed that his attorney, his former wife, Laura, and Kayla Gonzales all conspired in his arrest and in trying to convict him. According to Brown, these beliefs demonstrated paranoid delusions. McCarthy considered all individuals who did not concur with his conspiracy beliefs to abet in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 52 Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn believed that Matthew McCarthy would be able to cooperate with new counsel if the superior court ordered an attorney to represent McCarthy other than Kari Reardon. Dr. Debra Brown testified to the consequences of appointing Matthew McCarthy counsel other than Reardon:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q Now, you're aware that during one of the evaluations Mr. McCarthy indicated that he was-he had made a $500 down payment to retain another attorney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A Yes. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q Okay. And then did he subsequently indicate that that attorney could not be trusted and so he wasn't going to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A Yes. And that the attorney had spent the money and that the attorney had divulged information, I believe to you, and there was-there was some wrongdoing that was occurring there, too. He wouldn't tell anybody who that attorney was because-I don't know. I don't know why he didn't trust any of us in the evaluation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q Mr. McCarthy's indicated that he'll be perfectly okay if he can just have a different attorney.

Lord-Flynn\n   noted that McCarthy is intelligent, well read, and able to rationalize different legal options and understand the consequences of those options. McCarthy excelled in legal classes at the mental hospital and understood the legal process better than other members of the classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 54 Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn testified that, at the conclusion of Matthew McCarthy's second restoration treatment, McCarthy acted calmly. He slept and ate well contrary to one suffering from bipolar disorder. According to Daniel Lord-Flynn, the treating psychiatrist, during the second restoration period, found no symptoms of bipolar disorder. Toward the end of the second restoration period, treatment providers did not record delusional behavior or statements of McCarthy. During questioning by the State's counsel, Dr. Lord-Flynn averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q And there was nothing out of the ordinary, maybe some disputes with some other folks within the hospital but you attributed that to more likely antisocial personality disorder but not any delusions or paranoia going on at that time, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A True.

According to Lord-Flynn, McCarthy was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 57 The State, during summation, asked the jury to find Matthew McCarthy competent to stand trial. The State commented, in light of Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn's testimony, that treatment restored McCarthy such that his delusions lay in the past:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   So, again, we're not looking at back then.

After the jury returned its verdict of competency, the superior court authorized the withdrawal of Kari Reardon and substitution of other counsel. Reardon's zealous advocacy ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 59 On January 28, 2016, the superior court arraigned Matthew McCarthy on the first degree burglary charge, to which he pled not guilty, and the superior court appointed him new counsel, Dennis Dressler. The superior court scheduled the prosecution for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 60 On April 8, 2016, more than two months later, Matthew McCarthy wrote a letter to counsel Dennis Dressler. He wrote that jail officers planted another inmate in the jail for the purpose of supplying him narcotics. Jail officials also planted his former wife's boyfriend as his cellmate. We do not know if the two plants were the same person. McCarthy further contended that his former wife worked in the jail mailroom. The jail hired her to keep her close to the prosecution such that she would not leave the conspiracy. According to McCarthy, Laura, his former wife, intercepted his correspondence to a material witness in the case. In the letter, McCarthy directed Dressler to obtain, among other documents, a Department of Licensing photograph of Kayla Gonzales, a picture of the vehicle owned or driven by Gonzales, a bail bond contract, a Quality Inn Kennewick receipt for his former wife, and a handwriting analysis of correspondence from his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 61 On April 12, 2016, Matthew McCarthy applied to the superior court to discharge Dennis Dressler and to represent himself. For an unknown reason, McCarthy refiled a similar motion dated April 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 62 On April 21, 2016, Matthew McCarthy filed a motion to dismiss, in which he claimed the State's charging information to be insufficient. He argued that Kayla Gonzales agreed that he never struck her. Instead, the door pushed her. He added: \"It could not be reasonably believed that my sole intent was to assault Ms. [Gonzales] with a door.\" CP at 831. Therefore, according to McCarthy, the State could not prove any intent to assault, an element of first degree burglary. McCarthy's motion also focused on Kayla Gonzales' child being asleep at the time of his approach of the house on September 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 63 On May 13, 2016, the superior court entertained Matthew McCarthy's motion to represent himself. The same judge who presided over the competency jury trial presided over the May 13 hearing. McCarthy argued his motion to proceed pro se, but he added that he wanted standby counsel, other than Dennis Dressler, to register objections to evidence and question some witnesses. The superior court responded that McCarthy could not choose who he desired as standby counsel and the court would appoint Dressler if the court granted the motion to proceed without counsel. The court also warned McCarthy that standby counsel would not register evidentiary objections or examine witnesses. McCarthy responded that he still wished to proceed pro se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 64 During the May 13 hearing, the superior court granted McCarthy's wish to represent himself, and the court appointed Dressler as standby counsel. Thereafter McCarthy withdrew his motion to challenge the charging information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 65 During the May 13 hearing, Matthew McCarthy expressed a belief that correctional officers subjected him to harassment. After the court granted McCarthy's motion to proceed with legal representation, the State expressed concern about McCarthy undergoing delusions again. The prosecution mentioned pleadings in which McCarthy stated his ex-wife worked in the jail mailroom and intercepted his mail and county officials placed a human plant in his jail cell to provide him narcotics. The prosecution summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   I don't know what his medications are, if he's on his medications that stabilize him. But it does create some concern from the State's perspective having sat in on the competency trial and having a jury decide that he's capable of moving forward and he's competent, but-but, again,\n   <em>\n    it seems\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    like we're slipping a little bit here since that time.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   RP (May 13, 2016) at 715-16 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 66 The following colloquy then occurred between the trial court and Matthew McCarthy, during the May 13 hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   THE COURT: ... You don't need to respond to that, Mr. McCarthy. I understand the State's concern. We went through a whole competency trial. You were found to be competent. In listening to you today, you don't sound a whole lot different than you did at the competency trial. You seem to understand the process, the procedure, where you are in this case, and it seems that you have some defense. Whether or not it's a defense that other people would choose is a separate question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    I think what we'll do is have you come back to check on you, though, to make sure you're doing okay. If there does appear to be issues of competency, then we might have to start this whole thing over again.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Okay. Well-I mean, may I respond, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   THE COURT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I actually have my medical file since October 6th. It has come to my attention that-that 2015-okay. In 2015, from January to October, my lithium levels, which is I take lithium for bipolar, my lithium levels varied by a mere .01, from .87 to .88. Coinciding with my competency trial from when I got back to jail in October 6th to the current time, which I also have-my medications has been administered and levels and everything as such, I had not taken my medication for instance-four instances, on 3/28, 3/30, 3/31, and 4/20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   January 12th-January 12th, March 11th, and May 3rd, May 3rd most recently, I had a lithium level of .7, 0.7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   .87, .88 is my sweet spot. That's where I operate the best. That's where I felt most comfortable. And I continually kited medical because I was feeling off. And this was about my competency trial. This is around this time. And, like I said, 2015 it varied by a mere .01. In January it was .6. In March it was .5. And most recently it was .7.\n   <em>\n    This variation, and with me still taking the same medication that I was the whole time, speaks volumes.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   I'm in the most controlled situation that I could be in. I eat the same meal every other week. I take the same medication at the same time. I'm doing the same things I do day in and day out. So for the fact that the-for the fact that it was-for the fact it was up and down like it was makes me question what exactly was going on. And for it to coincide with my competency trial makes me wonder even more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   I have claimed governmental misconduct since the start. On 3/28-on March 28th I was assaulted by another inmate. He had a weapon. I have come to understand that it's quite possible he wasn't even an inmate because he's disappeared. Even though I can't see him because I'm on 6 West now, you still talk to people throughout the jail and this person is not there anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   What is a non-bizarre delusions? What did DOC Lord-Flynn say? Oh, it could be true but it's not. It sounds like an opinion to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   You have an opinion. You could be wrong. I'm not saying that I'm totally correct. What I'm saying is quite possible and any reasonable person would see that there's an issue and something going on here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   As far as the State's concerned, I'm ready to proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   THE COURT: Thank you, sir. At this point we'll hold it ready for trial having resolved these issues. And what I'll do is, Mr. McCarthy, I'll have you brought back at a later date. We'll set that date at a later time. I need to look at my calendar and find a time.\n   <em>\n    But we'll probably bring you back to check on you and make sure you're progressing and preparing your defense and see if there's anything that you need.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   RP (May 13, 2016) at 716-18 (emphasis added). The judge presiding over the May 13 hearing never presided over another hearing in McCarthy's prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 67 On May 20, 2016, seven days after the superior court approved Matthew McCarthy's\n   representing himself, McCarthy filed a motion for an ex parte emergency injunction requiring jail officials to take a urine sample from him and conduct urinalyses on the sample every two weeks. McCarthy claimed that jail officers involuntarily \"intoxicated him\" such that his jail cell \"is virtually a gas chamber.\" CP at 1060. He also claimed that the jail denied him his medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 68 In addition to the motion for an injunction, Matthew McCarthy filed, on May 16, another motion to dismiss the prosecution because of government misconduct. The alleged misconduct was the government's toxification of his jail cell and the refusal to provide medications. McCarthy mentioned that his ex-wife Laura sent him a letter with deliberate misspellings that mimicked the name of the victim, Kayla Gonzales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 69 Matthew McCarthy attached voluminous medical records, including jail medical records, to his May 16 motion to dismiss based on government misconduct. In a medical request form attached to the motion, McCarthy mentioned a recent week-long depression, during which he could not function. McCarthy described sliding between bipolar opposites with no stability. He complained of his medication not being effective and emphasized that he needed an increased dose of lithium to stabilize him. If he did not receive an increased dose, he threatened to stop taking all medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 70 In a supplemental brief in support of his motion to dismiss, Matthew McCarthy highlighted purported factual inconsistencies between the arresting law enforcement officer's affidavit in support of probable cause and his incident report. He also emphasized differences between the facts reported by Kayla Gonzales to law enforcement officers from the facts to which she testified in an affidavit in support of an antiharassment order of protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 71 In other pleadings filed after May 13, Matthew McCarthy informed the superior court that, as soon as the court authorized him to represent himself, jailers sought to physically harm him. McCarthy described how, for the last month and a half, he had been exposed to varying toxic fumes. At first, he thought officers had poisoned his food, but then noticed a smell in his cell. McCarthy described one instance when the jail's sergeant came to his cell, under the pretense to discuss grievances he had filed. According to McCarthy, toxic fumes permeated his cell and destroyed his cognitive skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 72 In a June 6, 2016 inmate grievance, Matthew McCarthy repeated the complaint of toxification he documented in earlier pleadings. McCarthy complained that a corrections officer entered his cell during the last week. Suddenly fumes enveloped his cell. The fumes impeded McCarthy's reading and other cognitive functions. When the corrections officer left the cell, he joined one of McCarthy's arresting officers, and the two laughed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 73 Matthew McCarthy filed another grievance with the Spokane County Jail that complained about the environment in a booth, to which a corrections officer assigned him for purposes of reading police reports. According to McCarthy, a vent connected the reading booth with a staff bathroom. Once inside the booth, McCarthy smelled the same toxic fumes he smelled in his cell. McCarthy complained that the continued chemical attacks prevented his preparation of a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 74 On June 6, 2016, Matthew McCarthy filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the superior court. He asked for dismissal of the prosecution because of shocking government misconduct. He claimed that law enforcement and his family conspired to create a crime that he never committed. According to McCarthy, one law enforcement officer stalked him in the course of the creation of the crime. He claimed the State had expected a finding of incompetency that attorney Kari Reardon failed to deliver on its behalf. Jail officials conspired to harm his mental health by withholding medications. Another inmate, at staff direction, attacked him. The State had failed to afford him effective assistance of counsel. He ended the petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   I am under constant abuse from my jailers trying to disqualify me from the criminal judicial process making the court's timeline unattainable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   CP at 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 75 On June 24, 2016, the superior court presided over another hearing to entertain\n   Matthew McCarthy's motion to dismiss and to conduct a status conference. The judge presiding over the June 24 hearing was different from the judge presiding over the competency trial and the May 13 motion to proceed pro se. The superior court granted McCarthy a postponement of the July 11 trial date. McCarthy then commented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: And that's the thing. Um, on May 13th when I went pro se, Judge Cooney's court said they were going to bring me back within two weeks, see how I was doing. And at the time-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   THE COURT: To see how you were doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: Yes, yes, and said that-and that's kind of odd in itself. But there has been a mental health angle involved in this case. But at that time, he-he-on May 13th he put himself pretty much in a supervisory role as far as bringing me back to see what my subpoenas were going to be and-and who I was going to be calling for my witnesses or-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   RP (June 24, 2016) at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 76 During the June 24 hearing, Matthew McCarthy complained about Dennis Dressler's purported failure to subpoena witnesses. After some inquiry, the superior court discerned that McCarthy wanted witnesses subpoenaed for that day's hearing for purposes of his motion to dismiss. McCarthy explained to the superior court that he needed proof, including documents, to win his motion to dismiss. Dennis Dressler then reported to the court that the previous judge had not directed him to assist with subpoenas. Nonetheless, Dressler had prepared subpoenas and earlier forwarded them to McCarthy for his use. McCarthy complained that the subpoenas prepared by Dressler were for purposes of the trial, not for purposes of his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 77 Matthew McCarthy next addressed the superior court, during the June 24 hearing, about the alleged abuse from correction officers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: Your Honor, there-there have been extreme abuse at the hands of correctional officers. They're alleged-there's several-there's several that have been alleged in my-in my initial motion to dismiss. There's also been an angle of medical misconduct. And-well, there have been three serious incidents in addition to just the-the-the daily-just, I don't know, whatever I've been-on May 14th, the day after I went pro se.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   THE COURT: Well, let me ask you before you go any further, what is it-before you describe all of this, who is this motion directed at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: See-see-and-and I don't know. See, that's the thing, because Spokane County Detention Services does what they want.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   THE COURT: But tell me, what is it-are you seeking me to order them to do something? [B]ecause if you are, they need to be made a party to this motion, right? [S]o that they can come in here and explain to me-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   THE COURT: -what their side of the story is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   MR. MCCARTHY: Yeah. And, see, that's-and that's the thing. It's like-I mean, this is brilliant. I've been, you know, diagnosed with a mental health illness; they said I'm-have-I'm delusional with, you know-or I'm bipolar with nonbizarre delusions. Your Honor, on May 14th, the day after I went pro se, the officers that-that work that floor, which is fine; they're officers in the jail; they can work wherever they want. But it's not a coincidence that four of them that were working that day were listed in my complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   I'm eating dinner. At first I thought it was in my food but then a toxic smell in my cell and I'm extremely hot. I panicked. That's where the injunction came from, filed that day, because I didn't know what to do. And I know testimony and weight, the court gives a certain weight to testimony and evidence for anything. In 14 years we don't have a Washington State Department of Corrections officer can say I asked for a urinalysis. I'm not being-I'm not being smart; I'm being totally truthful. I\n   didn't know what to do. I was up for two days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   During the intervening time, there were other instances where it was bizarre chemical smells in my-in my cell. And that's the thing: Let's abuse him away and dare him to say something about it; he's bipolar; he has issues; he's saying that there's-we're gassing him; it's great.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   On May-on May 31st-Mr. Kane came and dropped off my discovery on May 27th. It was made available to me on May 31st. Sergeant Bliven and Sergeant Hill came up to see me on 6-6-West on May 31st in the morning. Sergeant Hill came into my cell under the pretense of discussing some grievances that I filed. While he's in my cell, a vapor came over me and my cognitive skills were destroyed. I could barely talk. I didn't know what was going on. The way he was sitting there looking at me, he was-he was observing me. When they left, when he left my cell I went to look out the cell door. They were out there having a nice laugh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Later that afternoon when I requested to see my discovery, when I requested to see my discovery, the floor officer put me in-in booth 1. She told me to take a chair with me. This is the first time since 2014 that I could see all the documents that were related to my case. You know, \"You might be in there a while, take a chair, get comfortable.\" When I'm looking at the documents, the same smell, the same vapor came over me. And when I say the cognitive skills ceased, I almost passed out. I was in there for maybe a minute, two minutes. Needless to say that I haven't asked to see my discovery since.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Your Honor, I don't know what to do. As far as-as far as housing situations, previously in March I was set upon by a-an inmate, an inmate with a weapon. When I asked for medical attention, I didn't get it. An incident on 6-West-since that incident I got a little gun-shy. I don't want confrontation. I have so much stuff going on that I just want to be let-be able to-to take care of my case, to handle my case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   So-so with all that being said, when I first wrote the-you know, the-the motion governing Spokane County Detention Services, you know, Directive, at first I was-I was-I was looking for an order to be housed in a certain place or-but at the same-at the same time it doesn't really matter. I mean, if they're-if they're bent on disrupting this case, then it-then it doesn't matter where I'm at. So I really don't know what to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   THE COURT: What are you asking me to do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   MR.

The superior court also postponed Matthew McCarthy's pending motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 78 The superior court conducted another hearing on July 1, 2016, to address Matthew McCarthy's concerns about the Spokane County Detention Center. McCarthy repeated his claim of harassment in the jail, which agitation prevented his preparing his defense for trial. McCarthy asserted that another inmate with a weapon assaulted him on March 28. When the injury swelled the following day, McCarthy asked corrections officers for medical treatment, but the officers denied his request. McCarthy mentioned that the jail placed him in a segregation unit two days later. In turn, corrections officials placed another inmate in the cell for purposes of providing McCarthy narcotics. While in the segregation unit, McCarthy again asked for medical attention. A nurse examined him but provided no treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6 79 During the July 1, 2016 hearing, Matthew McCarthy continued that the jail transferred him to a new section on April 4. On that same day, he noticed toxic smells in his new cell. Since May 14, the jail constantly fed gas into McCarthy's cell. McCarthy mentioned that the smell, similar to his earlier use of illicit drugs, prevented him from sleep for two to three days. The superior court declined ruling for the day to allow Spokane County Detention Services an opportunity to investigate and respond to Matthew McCarthy's assertions now that the detention officials heard of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 80 In response to Matthew McCarthy's motion to dismiss and petition for writ of habeas corpus, Ron Oscarson, Spokane County director of facilities, filed a certificate under penalty of perjury. Oscarson averred that no toxic fumes entered McCarthy's cell through the jail's heating and ventilation system. John McGrath, Spokane County director of detention services, signed a certificate, in which he declared that officers entered McCarthy's jail cell and smelled no fumes. McGrath added that no other inmates or corrections officers complained of toxic fumes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6 81 During a July 15, 2016, hearing, the superior court and Matthew McCarthy discussed the witnesses McCarthy sought to subpoena. McCarthy claimed a witness would testify to Kayla Gonzales and his ex-wife knowing one another. McCarthy expressed concern that his ex-wife and Kayla Gonzales engaged in a romantic relationship. According to McCarthy, the two conspired to isolate him in jail. He stated that his defense was that the two worked to get him off the street because he was a threat to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 82 During the July 15 hearing, the State commented that Kayla Gonzales never met Matthew McCarthy's ex-wife. The State added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   Mr. McCarthy has this belief that these women know each other even though Ms. Gonzales says, \"I don't know who Laura McCarthy is.\" Supposedly there's a picture that he provided and had an investigator look at saying that in the back-in the background of this picture of Mr. McCarthy and Laura McCarthy there's alleged scribbling on a wall or poster or something that says \"KK lies\"; and then Mr. McCarthy believes that Kayla Gonzales goes by \"KK.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   RP (July 15, 2016) at 66-67. No one then questioned McCarthy's competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 83 On July 15, the trial court entertained Matthew McCarthy's motion to dismiss. Matthew McCarthy essentially argued that the court should dismiss the charges because of government misconduct in misrepresenting facts in affidavits. The superior court noted, however, that it was not certain about what McCarthy argued. The superior court denied the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6 84 After the superior court dismissed Matthew McCarthy's motion to dismiss, McCarthy mentioned his pending petition for writ of habeas corpus. The superior court noted that the State had filed affidavits disputing McCarthy's claim that prison officials engaged in perfuming his cell with toxic fumes. The court asked McCarthy if he desired\n   time to review the affidavits. McCarthy replied affirmatively and the court postponed the hearing on the petition for a writ. The record does not show any later hearing on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6 85 After postponement of the hearing on the application for a writ of habeas corpus, the following colloquy then occurred between the superior court and Matthew McCarthy, on July 15, in which colloquy the prosecution later joined. The superior court expressed concern that McCarthy represented himself while facing a penalty of life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   MR.

The superior court granted the request. At attorney Dressler's request, the court continued the trial date from July 18 to September 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   \u00b6 87 On July 21, 2016, Matthew McCarthy filed a declaration with the court that registered his disappointment with the court's denial of his claim that the jail surrounded him with fumes. McCarthy asserted that five witnesses had also experienced the fumes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   \u00b6 88 Trial proceeded on September 19, 2016. Matthew McCarthy testified on his own behalf. During his direct examination, McCarthy repeated his story of seeing two vehicles parked in front of a home that previously had been parked in front of his house. He approached the home nearest to the parked cars, and a lady, later identified as Kayla Gonzales, opened the door and yelped. She closed the door and McCarthy left without touching her. He returned the following day. He then saw Kayla Gonzales jump from the couch, and a man answered the door. McCarthy asked the man for Laura, McCarthy's ex-wife. The man told McCarthy to leave. McCarthy left, but then noticed he lost his cell phone so he returned to the home a second time that day. When he returned, two men chased him in his car. The men cornered him at a gas station. McCarthy offered to fight one of the men, if the other man did not enter the fight. Police appeared and arrested McCarthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   \u00b6 89 During the trial on the burglary charge, the prosecution extensively cross-examined Matthew McCarthy about the details of his interactions at Kayla Gonzales' home. McCarthy explained that he knocked on Kayla Gonzales' door in order to speak with Laura. He stopped at the home because of the identical cars in front of the house. McCarthy admitted to preventing Gonzales from closing the front door. He claimed Gonzales to be lying when testifying that he shoved her. At the State's request, the trial court struck the accusation of prevarication. During his testimony, McCarthy did not claim that Kayla Gonzales and Laura McCarthy knew each other. He never spoke of a conspiracy against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   \u00b6 90 On September 21, 2016, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of first degree burglary. The trial court sentenced Matthew McCarthy to a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \u00b6 91 On appeal, Matthew McCarthy assigns two errors in the trial court proceedings. First, McCarthy contends the trial court violated his constitutional right to a fair trial when it allowed him to stand trial when good reason emerged to doubt his competency. Second, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it neglected to order a competency evaluation, sua sponte, after information from the State and from him revealed him to be no longer capable to assist his own defense. McCarthy does not contend that his criminal trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to ask for another competency evaluation. We conflate the two assignments of error and ask whether\n   the trial court, at some stage after the jury finding of competency, had reason to doubt McCarthy's competency and should have directed another evaluation. We answer in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6 92 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution due process clause proscribes the conviction of a person not competent to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

In such an event, the trial judge may consider his or her personal observations in determining whether there has been a significant change in the defendant's mental state. The\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   appellate court ruled that the trial court committed no error when refusing to order another competency evaluation when the trial court noted that the defendant's behavior repeated the behavior the judge observed during the competency trial. The same judge observed Huber Mendoza at every stage of the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6 107 Matthew McCarthy does not identify a specific date on which the trial court should have ordered another competency evaluation. Nonetheless, he focuses on three hearing dates in 2016 when signs of his paranoia emerged: May 13, June 24, and July 1. We hold that, based on Matthew McCarthy's behavior on those dates and pleadings filed\n   leading to the hearings, the trial court had reason to doubt McCarthy's competency and should have ordered a new mental health evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6 108 On May 13, 2016, the superior court judge who presided over the competency jury trial entertained Matthew McCarthy's motion to represent himself. The trial judge noted irrational behavior on the part of McCarthy although the judge characterized the behavior as similar to the behavior contemporary to the competency trial. The judge indicated that the court would monitor McCarthy's mental health thereafter, but that judge never presided over another hearing. Other than other judges presiding over later hearings, we know of no further monitoring of McCarthy by the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   \u00b6 109 We disagree with the superior court judge's comment on May 13, 2016, that Matthew McCarthy's behavior echoed his behavior at the time of the competency trial. The competency trial record shows no contemporaneous delusions in McCarthy. To the contrary, the medical testimony showed treatment had resolved the delusions. Yet, by May 13, two to three months later, McCarthy suffered from delusions similar in nature to the delusions he maintained at a time when the superior court earlier declared him incompetent. By May 13, McCarthy claimed government misconduct. He asserted that his ex-wife worked in the jail mailroom and intercepted his mail and county officials placed a human plant in his jail cell to provide him narcotics. The State's attorney warned that \"we're slipping\" since the time of the declaration of competency. RP (May 13, 2016) at 715-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6 110 Through no fault of her own, the superior court judge presiding over hearings on June 24, July 1, and July 15, 2016, had not earlier observed Matthew McCarthy. She could not compare present observations with observations at the time of the competency finding. By June 24, Matthew McCarthy had described in pleadings and during colloquy with the court how, for the last month and a half, correctional officers funneled toxic fumes into his cell and then laughed at him. One coprisoner had attacked him and another had supplied him narcotics. McCarthy had disclosed that he could not prepare for trial because of toxins introduced into the booth where he studied. He had returned to his previous delusion, in which all those who did not concur in his vast-winged conspiracy theory had joined the collusion against him and this collusion denied him effective assistance of counsel. A previous superior court judge had relied on these delusions when ruling that McCarthy could not rationally assist his attorney in preparing for trial. Since those delusions did not appear at the time of the competency trial, a substantial change had occurred in the mental health of McCarthy contrary to the position of the dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   \u00b6 111 By July 15, Matthew McCarthy had returned to his belief that Kayla Gonzales and his ex-wife knew one another. By July 15, the two women, according to McCarthy, engaged in a romantic relationship. On July 15, the State mentioned its generous offer to save McCarthy from life imprisonment, which offer McCarthy rejected because of his belief he would prevail. Dr. Daniel Lord-Flynn had earlier deemed McCarthy competent in part because McCarthy indicated he would ignore his conspiracy delusions if he received a good plea bargain. This prediction turned false. Contrary to the dissent's comment, McCarthy could not appreciate the ramifications and consequences of the crime charged and the dire consequences he faced on conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6 112 The State argues that the record shows no deterioration in Matthew McCarthy's condition after the jury verdict. But the State's comments on the record belie this appellate argument. To repeat, the medical testimony during the competency jury trial showed McCarthy restored to competency in part because he no longer suffered delusions. The State emphasized to the jury that McCarthy was then sane because treatment had rid him of his delusions. On May 13, 2016, the State noted that McCarthy was slipping from the time of the competency trial. The State never contended that McCarthy feigned his delusions. The delusions increased after May 13. The State notes that defense counsel did not question Matthew McCarthy's competence after the competency trial. Yet, during much of the proceedings,\n   in mid-2016, McCarthy did not have counsel. He represented himself. Anyway, the trial court holds the obligation to order an evaluation regardless of whether defense counsel alerts the court to his client's mental incompetency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6 113 The State also emphasizes that the trial court did not question Matthew McCarthy's competence after the jury ruling. Nevertheless, the superior court judge on July 15 expressed concern for McCarthy's capacity, such that the superior court judge told McCarthy he should not represent himself. Concern for the defendant's competency should, however, result in a psychological evaluation, not appointment of legal counsel. RCW 10.77.086 does not state that questions of competency can be resolved by appointing counsel. Because of the constitutional right to assistance of counsel and the inability of counsel to assist when the accused lacks competency, the trial court must take steps beyond allowing the prosecution to proceed to trial when serious questions of competency arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6 114 The dissent emphasizes the nature of Matthew McCarthy's communications with his appellate counsel. McCarthy attached those communications to his statement of additional grounds. But McCarthy wrote his letters and e-mails more than one year after the first degree assault trial. In the letters, McCarthy complained about the lack of communication from appellate counsel, he expressed his belief that appellate counsel failed to effectively assist him, and he directed counsel to focus the appeal on his claim that law enforcement fabricated evidence against him. The communications prove nothing about an ability of McCarthy to rationally assist his appellate counsel, let alone his earlier trial counsel. McCarthy's complaints to appellate counsel echoed the accusations he asserted against Kari Reardon, at the time the trial court found McCarthy incompetent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b6 115 The dissent repeatedly mentions that Matthew McCarthy denies incompetency. The dissent may imply that McCarthy's denial of incompetency poses as a factor in assessing him competent to stand trial. We disagree. We observe that many incompetent individuals insist on their competency. Andrew D. Reisner, Jennifer Piel &amp; Miller Makey,\n   <em>\n    Competency to Stand Trial and Defendants Who Lack Insight Into Their Mental Illness,\n   </em>\n   41 Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law 85-91 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \u00b6 116 The dissent mentions that this reviewing court lacks the ability to assess factors that bear on a competency determination. In part, we agree. But we do not contend that the reviewing court's role is to determine competency. Instead, we rule that the trial court or jury should have determined competency again when Matthew McCarthy's delusions reappeared. We also conclude that, because of the passage of time, the trial court, like us, will lack the ability to retroactively assess competency during the window of time from May to September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   \u00b6 117 We in part disagree with the dissent's position that this court cannot assess the factors that bear on a competency determination. The undisputed record shows that the trial court twice found Matthew McCarthy incompetent to stand trial because of his delusions. A jury later found McCarthy competent at a time when the undisputed evidence showed he no longer held his delusions. Finally, the undisputed record shows the delusions that led to a finding of incompetency reappeared months after the jury finding of competency. A reviewing court, based on the undisputed evidence, can readily assess the need to conduct a third competency evaluation. Few cases may better juxtapose the mental health condition of the accused between the times when he was competent and the times when he was incompetent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   \u00b6 118 We note that the record lacks any entry about Matthew McCarthy suffering delusions at the time of his trial. He testified at trial but did not testify to any conspiracy theories. By its nomenclature, one's competency to stand trial should focus on the condition of the accused during the trial itself. Nevertheless, the State does not argue that, even assuming Matthew McCarthy to be incompetent in May through July of 2016, his ability to assist his attorney was restored by the time of trial. The record contains no mention of McCarthy's mental health condition\n   between July 15 and his trial in late September. The record lacks any indication that professionals between July and September 2016 treated McCarthy such that the reoccurring delusions dissipated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   \u00b6 119 We also note that at least one reviewing court directed the trial court to engage in a retrospective determination of whether the accused was competent to stand trial at the time of trial or at some date preceding trial.\n   <em>\n    Pieniazek v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12340777\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/394/621/#p624\">\n    394 P.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alaska Ct. App. 2017). Nevertheless, the State does not ask for this reconstruction of Matthew McCarthy's condition. Also, the Alaska Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pieniazek\n   </em>\n   noted the difficulty in conducting a retrospective competency hearing and allowed the trial court to grant a new trial if the court deemed it difficult to conduct the retrospective hearing. We observe an additional difficulty of a backdated competency hearing when the trial judge who presided over the competency jury trial did not preside over later hearings or the criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   \u00b6 120 The dissent forwards\n   <em>\n    State v. Ortiz-Abrego,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452144\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/394/\">\n    187 Wash.2d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20P.3d%20638\">\n    387 P.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), for the proposition that a trial court may conduct a competency hearing after trial. Nevertheless, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Abrego\n   </em>\n   vary from the circumstances of Matthew McCarthy's appeal. Immediately after the jury guilty verdict, the defense sought an arrest of judgment or a new trial because Alexander Ortiz-Abrego lacked competency to stand trial. The trial court then sent Ortiz-Abrego to Western State Hospital for an evaluation. The hospital completed the evaluation within months of the trial and the evaluating psychologist found Ortiz-Abrego incompetent. The trial court granted a new trial, and the Supreme Court affirmed the order.

The criminal charges shall not be dismissed if the court or jury finds that: (a) The defendant (i) is a substantial danger to other persons; or (ii) presents a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security; and (b) there is a substantial probability that the defendant will regain competency within a reasonable period of time.

If a competency hearing can take place posttrial, we can certainly remand for a reference hearing posttrial, to obtain findings on the many factors relevant to a competency determination. Such a reference hearing is especially necessary in this case, where a jury had found Mr. McCarthy competent and no participant in Mr. McCarthy's September 2016 trial raised a concern that he was incompetent. Defense counsel did not raise a concern about his competence, the State did not raise a concern about his competence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the trial court did\n   not raise a concern about his competence.
