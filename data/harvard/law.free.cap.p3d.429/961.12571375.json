We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Defendant was charged with residential burglary, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, stalking, larceny, and escape or attempt to escape from a peace officer on June 21, 2012. Defendant's charges stemmed from an event on May 22, 2012, involving Defendant's ex-girlfriend, E. Ramirez. Defendant and Ms. Ramirez had been involved in a two-year relationship and had a child together in March 2012. However, Ms. Ramirez ended their relationship in early May 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Ms. Ramirez testified during Defendant's trial that, on May 22, 2012, as she went inside her mother's house-a mobile home with an attached garage-and attempted to close the door behind her, Defendant pulled the door from the outside and tried to open it. Defendant asked Ms. Ramirez to open the door so they could talk. Ms. Ramirez told him to leave or she was going to call 911. However, Defendant persisted and said he wanted to see their child. Ms. Ramirez refused to open the door but told Defendant that he could see their child through the glass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} Ms. Ramirez testified that Defendant then pulled a pocket knife and threatened to cut his own throat. Ms. Ramirez still would not open the door and told Defendant that she would call his father to give him a ride home. After Defendant threatened to beat her up, Ms. Ramirez hid inside her mother's garage and called 911. Ms. Ramirez stayed inside the garage and heard Defendant trying to open the door to the garage. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Sheriff Paul Telles arrived at the house but was unable to find anyone else inside. Ms. Ramirez then left the garage and noticed that her purse, wherein she kept her car keys and credit cards, and vehicle were missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} On June 6, 2012, Deputy Telles went to Defendant's home to serve an arrest warrant on Defendant. While there, Deputy Telles spoke with Defendant's father who informed Deputy Telles that he had no contact with Defendant. After receiving permission from Defendant's father, Deputy Telles searched the home to ensure Defendant was not inside. Deputy Telles found Defendant hiding inside one of the kitchen's cabinets and placed him under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} Following his arraignment on July 2, 2012, Defendant requested a new attorney on three separate occasions. On January 9, 2013, Defendant requested a new attorney one day before trial was scheduled to begin. On March 17, 2014, he requested a new attorney two days before trial was scheduled to begin. On February 13, 2015, Defendant requested a new attorney the day he was scheduled to attend a pre-trial conference in district court. On all three occasions, the district court granted Defendant's request, allowed defense counsel to withdraw, gave Defendant more time to retain new representation, and gave new defense counsel more time to prepare for trial. Defendant's actions caused his case to be delayed for over three years from the date of his arrest. By the third request, the new judge assigned to Defendant's case explicitly told Defendant that he was causing his case to be delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {7} During a hearing on March 2, 2015, Defendant appeared without an attorney and without having applied to the public defender's office, despite the district court's order to do so for a fourth public defender. After the district court informed Defendant that a private attorney with whom he had spoken would not be representing him and that he would need to hire a public defender, Defendant asked, \"And I can't represent myself? That's what you're saying?\" Defendant agreed to go to the public defender's office despite his desire to have the private attorney represent him. Robert Turner, a contract attorney for the public defender's office, entered his appearance as Defendant's new counsel. The district court scheduled Defendant's trial for August 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {8} During a pre-trial hearing on August 6, 2015, at which Defendant failed to appear, Mr. Turner notified the district court that he needed to briefly interview two officers prior to trial and could do it the morning of trial because he had already prepared based on their reports. Mr. Turner notified the district court in advance that he would have an associate in his office work on the case and that his associate did not need to interview Ms. Ramirez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {9} On the morning of trial, Mr. Turner's associate, August Rane, appeared with Defendant. Defendant requested to represent himself, stating that he and Mr. Turner had spoken a great deal already and that Mr. Rane had not spoken with him before the day of trial, had not interviewed the witnesses in the case, and did not know the facts that Mr. Turner knew. However, Mr. Rane informed the district court that he had discussed the case with Mr. Turner, read all of the interviews, prepared the case, and would need only a few minutes to interview one officer. The district court inquired into Defendant's competence and basis for such a request, and informed him of the potential pitfalls of self-representation, the nature of the charges, and possible penalties associated with each offense. The district court then asked Defendant if he was ready to proceed to trial that morning. Defendant responded that he was not ready, at which point the district court denied Defendant's motion for self-representation. The district court stated the untimeliness of Defendant's motion and his lack of preparation as some of the reasons it was denying his motion. The district court then permitted Mr. Rane some time to interview an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {10} The parties proceeded to trial with Mr. Rane representing Defendant. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of stalking and escape or attempted escape from a peace officer, but acquitted him of all other charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {11} Defendant now asks this Court to reverse his convictions and remand for a new trial based on both the district court's denial of his motion for self-representation and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendant made repeated requests for a new attorney and was granted several continuances for his trial. Based on Defendant's three prior requests for new counsel, his repeated continuances resulting in a three-year delay, the timing of his pro se motion, and the probable need for a continuance because of his unpreparedness, the district court did not err in its decision to deny Defendant's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

New Mexico's courts have not interpreted this right more expansively than its federal counterpart.

Defendant cites four different perceived errors by counsel to support his claim of ineffective assistance. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {18} Defendant first asks this Court to take judicial notice of its February 16, 2017, order, sanctioning Mr. Turner for not filing an acceptable docketing statement. However, Defendant has failed to show how Mr. Turner's performance on appeal impacted the outcome of his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {19} Defendant next asserts that Mr. Turner was ineffective, and Defendant was therefore prejudiced, in failing to file a motion for self-representation on behalf of Defendant after learning of his intention to proceed pro se. However, we have no basis in the record to conclude that Mr. Turner knew of Defendant's intention to proceed pro se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant has also failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different had Mr. Turner filed such a motion on Defendant's behalf, especially in light of the jury's acquittal of three of the five charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKaskle v.

Counsel has a duty \"to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p688\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p688\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p688\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Mr. Rane was substitute counsel for Mr. Turner from within Mr. Turner's office. As Defendant conceded, Mr. Turner was aware of the facts of\n   his case and Mr. Turner had maintained a good level of communication with Defendant. Absent a showing of prejudice, Defendant cannot rest his claim of ineffective assistance solely on Mr. Rane's entry as a substituted counsel.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nettleton v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8030863\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/320/743/#p745\">\n    320 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745 (Del. 1974) (\"[A] last minute transfer of the case from one Assistant Public Defender to another, without more, is not sufficient ground for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. The case was not transferred from one 'law office' to another. Presumably, the file of the case was complete and ready for use by the substituted Assistant.\"). Furthermore, the record is deficient of information regarding the extent to which Mr. Rane consulted with Defendant. Therefore, we are unable to assess Mr. Rane's effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {21} Finally, Defendant asserts that Mr. Rane was ineffective in failing to call witnesses on Defendant's behalf. \"Failure to make adequate pretrial investigation and preparation may ... be grounds for finding ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834180\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/125/739/\">\n    1998-NMCA-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834180\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/125/739/\">\n    125 N.M. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834180\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/125/739/\">\n    965 P.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, again, the record is deficient of evidence that Mr. Rane failed to prepare and investigate in advance of trial, or that there were additional witnesses for Mr. Rane to call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Miera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018-NMCA-020\">\n    2018-NMCA-020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565675\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/413/491/\">\n    413 P.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] general claim of failure to investigate is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case if there is no evidence in the record indicating what information would have been discovered.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ). In fact, Mr. Rane indicated that he had discussed the case with Mr. Turner, read all of the interviews, and prepared the case. Although Mr. Rane still needed to speak with one officer before trial, Mr. Turner indicated at the pre-trial hearing that his interviews of the officers would be brief because he had already prepared based on their reports. Defendant therefore failed to establish a prima facie ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
