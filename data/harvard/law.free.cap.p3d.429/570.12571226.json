We accept special action jurisdiction and grant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual &amp; Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2015, the County awarded NGU a public works construction contract. During the project, NGU sought a change order to recoup expenses caused by delays stemming from flooding. The County rejected the request, and NGU completed the project in June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In December 2016, NGU submitted a notice of claim signed by its counsel demanding more than $550,000 in compensatory damages. The County denied the claim in January 2017, asserting that \"the potential for flooding of the site was not only foreseeable but specifically called out in the [c]ontract ... and made NGU's responsibility.\" In that denial, the County also stated that it \"reserve[d] any and all applicable defenses to the claims of NGU.\" In May 2017, NGU sued the County, asserting claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The County moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P., asserting the notice of claim did not comply with the requirement in \u00a7 11-622(A) that a claim be \"executed by the person [bringing the claim] under penalties of perjury.\" After argument, the respondent judge denied the motion but ordered that NGU \"strictly comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 11-622(A) by June 29, 2018.\" NGU served the County with an identical notice including a notarized declaration by NGU's president stating \"under penalty of perjury that he has read and verified the contents of this Notice of Claim and the statements made therein.\" The County then filed this petition for special action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In our discretion, we accept jurisdiction of this special action.

The County argues, as it did below, that the signature on the notice of claim by NGU's attorney was insufficient because it was not executed under penalty of perjury.

For a false statement to constitute perjury, it\n   must be sworn or \"subscribe[d] as true under penalty of perjury.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2702. NGU has cited no authority, and we find none, suggesting a person may be convicted of perjury based on a mere signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 We addressed a similar issue in\n   <em>\n    State v.

There, we determined that an attorney's signature alone does not meet the requirement in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3010(B) that a wire interception warrant application be \"upon the oath or affirmation of the applicant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061722\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/535/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8 -11. We noted that, \"while an attorney's submission of a signed document surely carries ethical weight, mere signing of a document does not ordinarily subject the signer to the penalty of perjury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   not only supports the conclusion that a signature alone is insufficient under \u00a7 11-622(A), it refutes NGU's argument that an attorney's signature is the equivalent of making a statement under penalty of perjury due to the attorney's ethical obligations. And, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   is consistent not only with the perjury statute but with our civil rules: Rule 80(c), Ariz. R. Civ. P., requires an otherwise-unsworn declaration to specifically state it has been made under penalty of perjury to comply with any rule requiring that \"a matter to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by a sworn written declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 Furthermore, even were we to find\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   inapplicable or meaningfully distinguishable, we would nonetheless be compelled to reject NGU's claim that an attorney's signature by itself complies with the avowal requirement of \u00a7 11-622(A). There is a profound difference between the sanctions an attorney might face under the ethical rules for violating ER 3.3(a)(1), Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 42, or Rule 11(b)(3), Ariz. R. Civ. P.,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 11(c) (sanctions for violating Rule 11 include cost shifting);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 60 (disciplinary sanctions for violation of ethical rules include disbarment, suspension, and reprimand), and the penalties a person might face for perjury, a class four felony, \u00a7 13-2702,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-702(D). In light of the unambiguous statutory language requiring the statement be made under penalty of perjury, an attorney's signature alone-like any other signature-is insufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 NGU asserts, however, that the avowal requirement is merely \"technical,\" and it thus complied with the purpose of \u00a7 11-622(A) despite its failure to strictly comply with \u00a7 11-622(A). Arizona courts have consistently required strict compliance with the state notice-of-claim statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-821.01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deer Valley Unified Sch. Dist.

As in\n   <em>\n    Arizona Telco\n   </em>\n   , the purpose of the violated ADOT regulation-adequate notice to the agency-was entirely met despite the lack of formal notice. The avowal requirement at issue here, in contrast, is not met by an attorney's signature because it does not expose the attorney (or the person represented) to the penalty of perjury. Thus, even if substantial compliance were sufficient, NGU has not substantially complied with \u00a7 11-622(A). And, in any event, even if NGU had substantially complied with \u00a7 11-622(A), Arizona courts have repeatedly stated a party must strictly comply with statutory notice of claim requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deer Valley Unified Sch.
