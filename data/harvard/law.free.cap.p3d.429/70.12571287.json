In a decision order, we ruled that HCR 2007 does not violate the \"single subject rule\" - our constitutional requirement that \"[e]very act shall embrace but one subject and matter properly connected therewith...which subject shall be embraced in the title....\" Ariz. Const. art. 4, part 2, \u00a7 13. This opinion further explains our ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In 1998, the people of Arizona approved the Citizens Clean Election Act, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 16-940 to -961 (\"CCEA\"), to \"create a clean elections system that will improve the integrity of Arizona state government.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 16-940. The CCEA created the Citizens Clean Elections Commission (the \"Commission\"), which is charged with voter education and enforcement of the Act. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 16-955 to -957. The Commission comprises five members, no more than two of whom may be from the same political party. A.R.S. \u00a7 16-955(A). Members are appointed for five-year staggered terms, with appointment authority alternating between the governor and the highest-ranking official holding a statewide office who is not a member of the governor's party. A.R.S. \u00a7 16-955(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Seeking to amend two aspects of the CCEA, the legislature approved HCR 2007 pursuant to its authority under article 4, part 1, section 1(3) of the Arizona Constitution to refer \"any measure...enacted by the legislature\" for approval by the voters. The measure, titled \"An Act Amending Sections 16-948 and 16-956, Arizona Revised Statutes ; Relating to the Citizens Clean Elections Act,\" would amend the CCEA by prohibiting the transfer of clean elections funds by candidates to political parties and would subject\n   the Commission's rule-making process to review by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (\"GRRC\"), which reviews and approves rules proposed by various state agencies. After its enactment by the legislature, HCR 2007 was referred to the Secretary of State to be placed on the November 2018 ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-161, Louis Hoffman, a drafter of the CCEA and former commission member, and Amy Chan, a current commission member acting in her individual capacity (\"Challengers\"), filed suit requesting the trial court to enjoin the Secretary from placing HCR 2007 on the ballot because the measure violates the single subject rule. The trial court dismissed the action, relying on\n   <em>\n    Arizona Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry v. Kiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    242 Ariz. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    399 P.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), to hold that the rule does not apply to HCR 2007. The trial court reasoned that because\n   <em>\n    Kiley\n   </em>\n   held that the single subject rule, contained in article 4, part 2 of the Arizona Constitution, does not apply to initiatives approved by the voters under article 4, part 1, section 1(2), the rule also should not apply to measures referred by the legislature for the voters' approval under article 4, part 1, section 1 (3). Challengers filed an expedited appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-161(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 As a preliminary matter, the State defendants and the Intervenors (\"Respondents\") argue that Challengers' lawsuit is premature because the single subject rule only applies to \"acts\" and HCR 2007 will not be an \"act\" before it is approved by the voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Respondents correctly note that the power of the people themselves to refer legislative actions to the ballot for approval or rejection extends only to legislative acts, rather than \"bills under consideration,\"\n   <em>\n    Wennerstrom v.

These observations, however, do not answer whether a challenge may be brought to the legislature's process for referring a measure to the voters after the legislature has approved the measure but prior to its consideration by the voters at the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Assuming the single subject rule does apply to legislatively referred referenda (an issue we address next), we conclude that this pre-election challenge is not premature. Arizona statutes expressly allow challenges to the \"legal sufficiency\" of legislative referenda before the election. A.R.S. \u00a7 19-161(A). The issue of compliance with the single subject rule is ripe for review--the legislature has \"enacted\" the measure and ordered its placement on the ballot pursuant to article 4, part 1, section 1 (3). Finally, this lawsuit does not challenge HCR 2007 substantively, but instead raises a procedural claim. Allowing a pre-election challenge here thus comports with our practice of allowing pre-election challenges to ballot measures based on procedural claims but not substantive challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    League of Ariz.

Section 1 (2) outlines the people's power of initiative, and section 1 (3) outlines the referendum power. Under section 1 (3), a referendum may be placed on the ballot in one of two ways: (1) five percent of the qualified electors may, by petition, refer an act of the legislature to a vote by the people; or (2) \"the legislature...may order the submission to the people at the polls of any measure, or item, section, or part of any measure,\n   <em>\n    enacted\n   </em>\n   by the legislature.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its terms, the Constitution recognizes that the legislature must \"enact\" a measure to refer it to the voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 The legislature's structure and powers are outlined in article 4, part 2 of the Arizona Constitution. Section 13 of this part, the single subject rule, is titled \"Subject and title of\n   bills\" and provides that \"every act shall embrace but one subject...which subject shall be expressed in the title....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5269803\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/213/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13. The single subject rule thus applies to every \"act\" considered by the legislature. Under article 5, section 7 of the Arizona Constitution, \"bills\" passed by the legislature generally must be presented to the governor, but \"[t]he veto power of the governor shall not extend to any bill passed by the legislature and referred to the people for adoption or rejection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 These interrelated constitutional provisions clearly establish that when the legislature refers a measure to the voters for their consideration, that action involves \"enact[ing,]\" Ariz. Const. article 4, part 1, section 1 (3), or \"pass[ing]\" a bill,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5269803\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/213/557/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 5, \u00a7 7, and such a legislative \"act\" must satisfy the single subject rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5269803\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/213/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , art. 4, pt. 2, \u00a7 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Our conclusion comports with\n   <em>\n    Kiley\n   </em>\n   , which held that the single subject rule applies to \"acts which are enacted by the legislature, and does not address initiative or referendum petitions.\"\n   <em>\n    Kiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    242 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   541 \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    399 P.3d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted).

These cases recognize that article 4, part 1, section 9 imposes a \"title and text\" requirement for initiative and referenda petitions, while the single subject rule is a limit on the legislature's power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    242 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   541 \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310537\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/533/\">\n    399 P.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
