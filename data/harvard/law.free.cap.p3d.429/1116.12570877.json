Lundstrom appeals his sentence for two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and the legal financial obligations (LFOs) imposed against him. Lundstrom argues that his pretrial appearance in restraints violated his due process rights, but he does not seek any relief due to any alleged violation of his due process rights. Rather, Lundstrom argues only that we address his claim as a matter of continuing and substantial public interest. Lundstrom also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing LFOs against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Because pretrial restraint is an issue of continuing and substantial interest, we address whether Lundstrom's pretrial restraint violated his due process rights despite the fact that Lundstrom does not seek any relief. And we hold that Lundstrom's pretrial restraint violated due process. As to the LFO challenge, we remand to the trial court for application of recent legislative amendments to the LFO statutes, consistent with\n   <em>\n    State v.

At a preliminary appearance, Lundstrom appeared in restraints. Before the proceeding ended, defense counsel stated, \"I do take exception to the gentleman being-looks like five-point shackles without an independent fiduciary [sic] determination of the appropriateness of that.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Nov. 9, 2016) at 32. The trial court did not respond to defense counsel's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Lundstrom subsequently filed a motion objecting to the restraints and requesting removal of the shackles. The motion included a certified statement from defense counsel, which stated that he had made a public disclosure request with the Clallam County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) for their policies and discovered that CCSO policy 15.106.1 required all inmates to be brought to court in full restraints (waist chain, cuffs, and leg irons ) for their first appearance. There is no record showing whether Lundstrom noted the motion for hearing before the trial court, whether the trial court held a hearing on the motion, or whether the trial court ruled on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    \u00b6 5 Lundstrom pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. At sentencing, Lundstrom objected to the imposition of any LFOs, including any community custody fees. Lundstrom's only source of income was his social security disability benefits. The trial court imposed a $500 crime victim assessment, a $200 criminal filing fee, and a $100 DNA collection fee. The trial court also ordered Lundstrom to \"pay supervision fees as determined by [the Department of Corrections]\" based on the trial court's belief that the supervision fees were mandatory.

Lundstrom pleaded guilty and waived his rights to a public trial by an impartial jury and to the presumption of innocence. Thus, those rights could not have been violated. In pleading guilty, Lundstrom also agreed to the recommendations of the State, including the imposition of an exceptional sentence. Thus, there was no prejudice in regards to sentencing because the trial court followed the sentencing recommendation Lundstrom agreed to in his plea agreement. Furthermore, Lundstrom was restrained pretrial, outside the presence of a jury. The likelihood of prejudice is substantially reduced when a jury is not present and the trial court is presumed to discharge its duties without prejudice.\n     <em>\n      E.J.Y\n     </em>\n     .,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"764581\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/113/940/#p952\">\n      113 Wash.
