Staff working for a division of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issues official commentaries to TILA. One official commentary states that a credit card does not include a card required to be used to obtain petroleum products for business purposes from a wholesale distribution facility, regardless of payment terms. In general, an official commentary is binding on a court unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that the commentary at issue here is binding because it is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. We conclude that Erik Johnson's stolen petroleum card is a type of card described by the commentary, and his liability for its unauthorized use is not limited by TILA. In so holding, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Connell Oil is in the business of selling and distributing wholesale fuel for commercial purposes. It provides its customers access to unmanned fueling stations commonly used by police, fire, transit, and school districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The unmanned fuel pumps are inoperable unless the customer uses an appropriate access device. Early on, the access device was a key, referred to as a keylock system. As technology developed, the keylock system was replaced with an optical-lock, which is a card with holes in it. Later, as computers were used to read magnetic strips, the optical-lock\n   system was replaced by the current cardlock system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The cardlock system is a plastic card that looks exactly like a credit card. The card has a magnetic strip, which when swiped, communicates the customer's account number to Connell Oil's computer system. For security, the customer must enter a personal identification number (PIN) before the pump is activated. Connell Oil recommends to its customers that they keep their PIN separate from their card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Once the customer completes fueling, an invoice is generated for the specific amount of fuel purchased. Invoices are sent to customers at regular intervals, twice each month. Customers are required to pay the invoices within 15 days. Unpaid balances accrue interest at 1.5 percent per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Since 2009, Erik Johnson has been a customer of Connell Oil. On July 27, 2014, Mr. Johnson's wallet was stolen from his farm vehicle. The next day, Mr. Johnson began contacting issuers of his stolen credit and debit cards. On July 31, 2014, Mr. Johnson telephoned Connell Oil. There is a factual dispute whether Mr. Johnson asked Connell Oil to cancel his stolen petroleum card or simply ordered one or more cards. But there is no factual dispute that the cardlock agreement required cancellation to be in writing, and Mr. Johnson never requested in writing that his stolen petroleum card be canceled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Around September 8, 2014, Connell Oil called Mr. Johnson and notified him that it was terminating his account because of suspicious activity. Because Mr. Johnson had kept his PIN and petroleum card together in his wallet, the thief was able to steal $34,649.68 worth of fuel during the six weeks before the card's cancelation. Although Connell Oil had invoiced Mr. Johnson three times since his wallet was stolen, Mr. Johnson did not detect the fuel theft. Mr. Johnson explained to Connell Oil that he was too busy during harvest to open its invoices. The parties were unable to resolve the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Connell Oil served Mr. Johnson and his wife, Jackie McConnell Johnson, with a complaint alleging that the Johnsons were liable for $34,649.68 in stolen card charges, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees. The Johnsons then filed an answer with affirmative defenses, including limitations on cardholder liability for lost or stolen cards as well as counterclaims under TILA, Washington's Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, and negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Procedure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 After discovery, the Johnsons filed a motion for partial summary judgment and Connell Oil filed a cross-motion. The court ruled that the petroleum card issued by Connell Oil was not a credit card as contemplated by TILA. The court held that the Johnsons' defenses under TILA were inapplicable, granted Connell Oil's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the Johnsons' affirmative defenses and counterclaims. The court entered judgment in favor of Connell Oil for the unpaid petroleum charges, plus interest, costs, and reasonable attorney fees in accordance with the cardlock agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Johnsons timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 25 A cardlock serves two functions. First, it unlocks an unmanned fuel pump to facilitate a wholesale purchase of gasoline. Second, it facilitates a short-term credit purchase. Although the latter function is within the definition of a credit card, the former is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 Nor is Commentary (B) arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. The device used to access fuel at Connell Oil's unmanned fuel stations evolved from a keylock, to an optical-lock, to a card with a magnetic strip. All versions of this evolution allowed a customer to access a fuel pump at an unmanned station so as to purchase fuel at wholesale prices. Because TILA is remedial in nature, the substance rather than the form of the transaction should be examined.\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901968\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/44/#p46\">\n    566 F.2d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The substance of the transaction has not changed through this evolution. Commentary (B) reasonably concluded that Congress had no more desire to regulate a cardlock than it had to regulate a keylock or an optical-lock device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    3. Whether the cardlock is a device that conforms to Commentary (B)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 27 The Johnsons argue that Connell Oil's cardlock device does not conform to Commentary (B). Specifically, the Johnsons argue that the cardlock device not only provides access to a fuel pump, but also allows customers to accumulate large credit balances on their accounts. Even if true, we disagree that this causes the device to not conform to Commentary (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 28 Commentary (B) states, \"[a] credit card does not include ... [a]ny card ... that is used to obtain petroleum products for business purposes from a wholesale distribution facility ...\n   <em>\n    without regard to payment terms\n   </em>\n   .\" Commentary (B) itself states it makes no difference if the card permits a\n   business customer to accumulate a balance and pay interest on that balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    4. Whether Mr. Johnson used his petroleum card for business purposes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29 The Johnsons do not argue on appeal that they primarily used their stolen petroleum card for personal, as opposed to business, purposes. Shalon Braswell, Connell Oil's Chief Operating Officer, stated by declaration: \"[The Johnsons] requested the use of all fuel type products to include, Diesel, Gas, and 'Off Road' which is a dyed farm diesel commonly used for agricultural purposes.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 411-12. Connell Oil's officer further stated: \"Johnson has paid [our] invoices through the business entity of Johnson Enterprise.\" CP at 412. In response, Mr. Johnson stated by declaration: \"My Connell Oil credit card allowed me to buy fuel for personal and family use, which I have done on occasion.\" CP at 227. Because the Johnsons did not raise the issue on appeal, we infer that Mr. Johnson used his petroleum card primarily for business purposes. Nevertheless, the Johnsons failed to preserve the issue. RAP 2.5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30 In summary, we conclude the trial court did not err when it ruled that the stolen cardlock was not a credit card for purposes of TILA and entered judgment in favor of Connell Oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   E. ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 31 Connell Oil, citing RAP 18.1, RCW 4.84.330, and its contract with Mr. Johnson, requests an award of attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 32 RAP 18.1 requires a party to request attorney fees and expenses if recovery of such is permitted by applicable law. If recovery of attorney fees and costs is authorized by contract, RCW 4.84.330 requires a court to award the prevailing party its reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 33 The parties' contract provides in relevant part: \"I agree to pay ... any attorney and/or court fees incurred in the collection of unpaid accounts. ... /s/ Erik Johnson.\" CP at 416. Subject to its compliance with RAP 18.1(d), we award Connell Oil its reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 34 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Korsmo, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Truth in Lending Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1667f.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
