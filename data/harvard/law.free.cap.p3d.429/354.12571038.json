(Employer) and its Insurer, Zurich American Insurance Company, appeal the decision of the Three-Judge Panel (Panel) ruling that Anthony Joseph Sylvester's (Claimant) workers' compensation claim is not barred by the statute of limitations provided in 85A O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 69(B)(1) of the Administrative Workers' Compensation Act (AWCA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The facts are not disputed. Claimant suffered a work-related injury on March 28, 2014. He did not file a claim. He underwent related surgery, paid for by Employer's insurer. Then, Employer's Insurer paid temporary total disability benefits with the last payment made on September 27, 2014. Claimant needed additional medical care for his injury and medical care was provided on May 3, 2016, paid by Insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 As a result of the medical consultation on May 3, 2016, Claimant was advised that he would either have to have additional surgery or be monitored, probably for life. A dispute arose about providing additional medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Claimant then filed a formal claim, CC Form 3, on July 15, 2016. Employer asserted that the claim was barred by Section 69(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Section 69 provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A. Time for Filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   B. Time for Filing\n   <em>\n    Additional Compensation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. In cases in which any compensation, including disability or medical, has been paid on account of injury, a claim for\n   <em>\n    additional compensation\n   </em>\n   shall be barred unless filed with the Commission within one (1) year from the date of the last payment of disability compensation or\n   two (2) years from the date of the injury, whichever is greater.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The statute of limitations provided in this subsection shall not apply to claims for the replacement of medicine, crutches, ambulatory devices, artificial limbs, eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, and other apparatus permanently or indefinitely required as the result of a compensable injury, when the employer or carrier previously furnished such medical supplies, but replacement of such items shall not constitute payment of compensation so as to toll the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   C. A claim for additional compensation shall specifically state that it is a claim for additional compensation. Documents which do not specifically request additional benefits shall not be considered a claim for additional compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 69(B)(1)(2) and (C) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 The AWCA defines \"compensation\" and \"disability\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   10. \"Compensation\" means the money allowance payable to the employee or to his or her dependents and includes the medical services and supplies provided for in Section 50 of this act and funeral expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   16. \"Disability\" means incapacity because of compensable injury to earn, in the same or any other employment, substantially the same amount of wages the employee was receiving at the time of the compensable injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7\u00a7 2(10) and (16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) agreed with Employer and dismissed the claim. The ALJ concluded that a claimant had to file a claim within two years from the date of injury or one year from the date of payment of disability compensation, whichever was longer. Thus, here, Claimant would have two years from March 28, 2014 (injury), or one year from September 27, 2014 (date last disability payment was made). The former date provided the longer time, so using the injury date resulted in a last date to file of March 28, 2016. The ALJ ruled that the statute did not extend the filing deadline based upon the last date of paid medical treatment. The ALJ dismissed the action because Claimant filed his Form 3 in July of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Panel reversed. The Panel first analyzed the contention that the alternative claim filing deadline was measured solely on the date of last payment of disability benefits. The Panel reasoned that this construction would create a disparity between workers filing a claim and workers whose employers voluntarily undertake workers' compensation without filing a claim. The Panel concluded that using the last payment of disability benefits afforded the claim-filing workers a longer period to seek additional benefits than the workers not filing a claim. The Panel also concluded that the foregoing construction of the statute would result in unnecessary litigation of uncontested clams. In either case, the result was not intended by the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 Next, the Panel found that the Employer's construction is inconsistent with Subsection B(2). The Panel read the statute to provide that payment of medical compensation extended the deadline and the replacement of medical supplies did not constitute compensation. Last, the Panel concluded that\n   Employer's construction of the limitations provision did not serve the function of a limitations statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Panel held that Section 69(B)(1) extended the statute of limitations for one year following the payment of medical or disability compensation. Consequently, Claimant filed a timely Form 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 Claimant also argued that Employer's construction of the statute violated Due Process of Law and the special law provision of the Oklahoma Constitution. The ALJ and the Panel did not reach those arguments in their respective rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Employer and Insurer appeal. Employer argues that the plain language of the statute bars the claim here and the ALJ was correct. In addition, Employer argues that the current statutory language is different from its predecessor statutes which would have permitted Claimant's filing. Thus, Employer argues that the Legislature changed the limitation period so that it runs from date of injury or the last date disability compensation was paid, whichever was later. In either case, Claimant's action is barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 The appeal involves interpretation of the foregoing statute. This presents a reviewable question of law. 85 O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 78. The review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    American Airlines, Inc. v. State ex rel.

It is undisputed that Claimant missed the deadline using the date of injury as the starting date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 In order to have a timely filing of the Form 3, Claimant must equate \"payment of disability compensation\" with the payment of the last medical treatment provided to him. The first hurdle is the amending language of Section 69. The statute replaced by Section 69 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The right to claim compensation under the Workers' Compensation Code shall be forever barred unless, within two (2) years after the date of accidental injury or death, a claim for compensation is filed with the Workers' Compensation Court. Provided however, a claim may be filed within two (2) years of the\n   <em>\n    date of the last medical treatment authorized by the employer or the insurance carrier\n   </em>\n   or the date of the payment of any compensation or remuneration paid in lieu of compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   85 O.S.2011, \u00a7 318(A) (emphasis added) (similar \"last medical treatment\" language is in its predecessor,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    85 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 43 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 17 Thus, the initial inquiry is whether the Legislature intended to-and did-alter the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dean v. Multiple Injury Trust Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451819\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/145/1097/\">\n    2006 OK 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451819\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/145/1097/\">\n    145 P.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 318(A) does not distinguish between an original claim and a claim for \"additional compensation\" whereas Section 69 separates the original and additional compensation types of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18 This Court concludes that the Legislature did alter prior law. Section 69(A) is the amending language for the prior Section 318. Section 318 provided time deadlines for filing an original claim. Section 69(A) does likewise. Section 69(A) is headed \"Time for Filing\" whereas Section 69(B) is headed: \"Time for Filing Additional Compensation.\" Section 69(A) provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   1. A claim for benefits under this act, other than an occupational disease, shall be barred unless it is filed with the Commission within one (1) year from the date of the injury. If during the one-year period following the filing of the claim the employee receives no weekly benefit compensation and receives no medical treatment resulting from the alleged injury, the claim shall be barred thereafter. For purposes of this section, the date of the injury shall be defined as the date an injury is caused by an accident as set forth in paragraph 9 of Section 2 of this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 69(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 19 By enacting Sections 69(A) and (B) the Legislature distinguished, for limitations purposes, an original claim from a claim for additional benefits. As a result, Section 69(B) is the amending provision of 85 O.S.2011, \u00a7 318(F). Section 318(F) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   F. The jurisdiction of the Court to\n   <em>\n    reopen any cause\n   </em>\n   upon an application based upon a change in condition for the worse shall extend for three (3) years from\n   <em>\n    the date of the last\n   </em>\n   order in which monetary benefits or\n   <em>\n    active medical treatment was provided\n   </em>\n   , and unless filed within such period of time, shall be forever barred. An order denying an application to reopen a claim shall not extend the period of the time set out in this act for reopening the case. A failure to comply with a medical treatment plan ordered by the Court shall bar reopening of a claim. This subsection shall be considered to be substantive in nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   85 O.S.2011, \u00a7 318(F) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 20 Section 69(B) broadens the scope from \"reopening any cause\" to the instance in \"which\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   compensation, including disability or medical, has been paid on account of injury.\" Thus, Section 69(B) covers cases filed and cases where compensation has been provided voluntarily without a Form 3 action being filed. Claimant falls within the latter classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 21 Therefore, Claimant must equate the payment for his last medical appointment with the Section 69(B) triggering date of \"last payment of disability compensation.\" \"Compensation\" includes \"medical services.\" 85A O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 2(10). This definition is the same whenever used in the AWCA, absent a plainly contrary legislative intention. 25 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 22 In past versions of the limitations statute, the language separated monetary benefits and active medical treatment. That separation is no longer the case, as the Legislature now uses a comprehensive phrase \"disability compensation\" in Section 69(B) without limitation or exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 23 Therefore, this Court holds that payment of the Claimant's medical services and the last date thereof established the date on which the limitations period began. Claimant's Form 3 was filed timely. The judgment of the Panel ruling that Claimant's claim is not barred is sustained on the basis of the foregoing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 24 Claimant sustained a work-related injury. He received surgery and temporary disability payments. Later, he was provided medical services. Claimant had not filed a claim and Employer and its insurer had voluntarily provided the benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 25 A dispute arose about continuing benefits. Claimant filed a Form 3 to seek additional benefits. The filing date was outside the deadline set out in 85 O.S. Supp. 2017, \u00a7 69(B)(1) unless the provision of the last medical services furnished the beginning date for calculating the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 26 This Court holds that the provision of medical services falls within the broad category of payment of disability compensation. The AWCA's definitions provisions, the past statutory language replaced by the current statute, and the failure of the Legislature to limit or exempt payment of medical services all lead to the conclusion that Claimant's filing of his Form 3 was not time barred. Therefore, the judgment of the Panel is sustained for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 27\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   BARNES, P.J., and GOODMAN, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    \"Compensation\" is defined in 85A O.S.

Thus, the Form 3 is not explicit as called for in the statute.
