(A&amp;W), in the amount of $29,349.33. A&amp;W protested the Department's imposition of gross receipts tax on certain trademark-related royalty fees contained within its franchise agreements with New Mexico businesses. The hearing officer granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, and A&amp;W appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} A&amp;W, an out-of-state corporation, entered into a number of franchise agreements with New Mexico businesses. Each of the franchise agreements, among other terms, contained a provision by which A&amp;W granted to franchisees a limited license to use specific trademarks. The authority to utilize the trademarks was limited to use in connection with the operation of an A&amp;W restaurant franchise. In consideration for the grant of the limited trademark license, the franchisees agreed to pay A&amp;W a monthly royalty fee equal to 5 percent of gross sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Following an audit in 2013, the Department determined that the royalty fees for the limited trademark license were subject to gross receipts tax as money received \"from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico[.]\" NMSA 1978, Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1) (2007). Consequently, the Department assessed gross receipts tax on the royalty fees in the amount of $29,349.33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, A&amp;W filed a tax protest with the Department, seeking an abatement of the gross receipts tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} Pursuant to the Administrative Hearings Office Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 7-1B-1 to -9 (2015), A&amp;W's tax protest went before a hearing officer. During the course of proceedings, A&amp;W and the Department filed cross motions for summary judgment. A&amp;W argued that the royalty fees it received as\n   consideration from the limited trademark licensing provisions are exempt from gross receipts tax as a matter of law because trademarks are not considered \"property\" under the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act (the Act), NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9-1 to -116 (1966, as amended through 2018).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-9-3(J) (defining \"property\"); \u00a7 7-9-3.5(A)(1) (defining \"gross receipts\"). The Department, in contrast, argued that such royalty fees were taxable as receipts \"from granting the right to use a franchise[.]\" Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1). After hearing argument from both sides, the hearing officer disagreed with A&amp;W's legal position and awarded summary judgment to the Department. A&amp;W appeals to this Court pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 7-1-25(A) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {5} This appeal requires us to consider the impact of two 2007 amendments to the Act on the taxability of trademark licensing royalty fees that make up part of a franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Relevant Provisions of the Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {8} The purpose of gross receipts tax is to provide revenue for public purposes by taxing certain business activities within New Mexico. Section 7-9-2. Prior to 2007, the Legislature categorized these activities in the following ways: \"selling property located in New Mexico, ... leasing or licensing property employed in New Mexico, ... selling services performed outside New Mexico, [and] ... performing services in New Mexico.\" Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1) (2006). \"[G]ross receipts\" were defined as \"the total amount of money or the value of consideration received\" from engaging in these business activities.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2007, the Legislature amended the definition of gross receipts to\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received from selling property in New Mexico, from leasing or licensing property employed in New Mexico,\n   <em>\n    from granting a right to use a franchise\n   </em>\n   employed in New Mexico, from selling services performed outside New Mexico, the product of which is initially used in New Mexico, or from performing services in New Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {9} Also in 2007, the Legislature amended the definition of \"property\" from \"real property, tangible personal property, licenses, and franchises[,]\" Section 7-9-3(J) (2006), to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   real property, tangible personal property,\n   <em>\n    licenses other than the licenses of\n   </em>\n   copyrights,\n   <em>\n    trademarks\n   </em>\n   or patents and franchises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 7-9-3(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

State\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    2000-NMCA-087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    129 N.M. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    11 P.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    rev'd on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sonic Indus., Inc. v.

However, by amending the definition of gross receipts to include the new business activity categories of licensing property employed in New Mexico and granting a franchise employed in New Mexico, Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1), the Legislature has effectively taken licensing agreements and franchise agreements out of the sale of property category. Given this development, and in light of these new categories of gross receipts, the question before us is how to properly analyze the taxability of a limited trademark license provision contained within a franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {11} Unsurprisingly, A&amp;W and the Department have differing views on the analysis to be employed, as well as on the effect that the amendments have on the taxability of the limited trademark license royalties at issue in this case. A&amp;W asserts that gross receipts tax applies to receipts from the licensing of property and that under the new 2007 Section 7-9-3(J) definition, trademark licenses are no longer considered to be property. Based on this definitional exclusion, A&amp;W contends that the royalty fees received as consideration from the trademark licensing provisions are exempt from gross receipts tax. Conversely, the Department maintains that the royalty fees for the limited trademark license are subject to gross receipts tax as money received from granting a right to use a franchise, pursuant to Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {12} In resolving these arguments, the crucial question to be answered is whether the royalty fees flowing from this particular trademark licensing provision should be treated as being received from the grant of a franchise or from the licensing of a trademark. If we were to limit ourselves to A&amp;W's view-that the limited trademark licensing provision is a separately-itemized standalone agreement, although contained within the franchise agreement-it would appear that the answer is clear that the royalties received from the trademark license are excluded from gross receipts under Sections 7-9-3.5(A)(1) and 7-9-3(J). Yet, it is not so simple. We must also, as the Department contends, consider the meaning of the word \"franchise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239899\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2014/061/4239899/\">\n    2014-NMCA-061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20P.3d%201120\">\n    326 P.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e should read the entire statute as a whole so that each provision may be considered in relation to every other part.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {13} Although we have no statutory definition of franchise in New Mexico, this Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   that \"[b]y 1969, when the Legislature extended the Act's definition of property to 'licenses, franchises, patents, trademarks and copyrights,' the use of the term franchise to describe a prepackaged system for doing business appears to have been well established.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    2000-NMCA-087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    129 N.M. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    11 P.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court also set forth the following definition of a franchise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In its simplest terms a franchise is a license from the owner of a trademark or trade name permitting another to sell a product or service under that name or mark. More broadly stated, the franchise has evolved into an elaborate agreement under which the franchisee undertakes to conduct a business or sell a product or service in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed by the franchiser and the franchiser undertakes to assist the franchisee through advertising, promotion and other advisory services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {14} We further observed in\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   that the Department had adopted a regulation defining the word \"franchise\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A franchise is an agreement in which the franchisee agrees to undertake certain business activities or to sell a particular type of product or service in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed by the franchiser, and the franchiser agrees to assist the franchisee through advertising, promotion and other advisory services.

We further held \"that for purposes of the Act, a franchise is to be treated as a compound or 'bundled' form of property, which typically includes a license to use the franchiser's trademark and a commitment by the franchiser to perform various services to assist the franchisee in the operation of the franchised business.\"\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    2000-NMCA-087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    129 N.M. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    11 P.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {15} We can presume that the Legislature was aware of these longstanding and undisturbed definitions of franchise in 2007 when it amended the definition of gross receipts to include \"the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received ... from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico[.]\" Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    2000-NMCA-087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    129 N.M. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217159\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/129/657/\">\n    11 P.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e may infer from the Legislature's inaction in response to this longstanding administrative construction of the term franchise that this definition is consistent with the Legislature's intent.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {16} Furthermore, we observe that the 2007 gross receipts amendment followed our Supreme Court's 2006 decision in\n   <em>\n    Sonic II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670351\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/212/\">\n    2006-NMSC-038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670351\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/212/\">\n    140 N.M. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670351\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/212/\">\n    141 P.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court analyzed Sonic's franchising activities under the then-current definition of gross receipts, which only included the money or value received from the sale or lease of property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670351\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/140/212/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court first determined, in agreement with this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   , that Sonic's franchising activities constituted the sale of property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The Supreme Court went on to hold that when a franchise agreement is executed outside of New Mexico, it is considered to be an out-of-state sale, and thus not considered to fall within the definition of gross receipts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Therefore, the practical effect of\n   <em>\n    Sonic II\n   </em>\n   was to render franchise agreements with out-of-state franchisers, such as the agreement in the present case, non-taxable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {17} Less than a year after the\n   <em>\n    Sonic II\n   </em>\n   decision, the Legislature added a new category of business activity resulting in taxable gross receipts: granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-9-3.5(A)(1). By this change, the Legislature effectively overruled\n   <em>\n    Sonic II\n   </em>\n   and restored the taxability of franchise agreements, even those entered into out-of-state, so long as they are employed in New Mexico. Nothing in the statute as amended indicates to us that the Legislature intended to change the definition of a franchise as adopted by the Department or as laid out by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Sonic I\n   </em>\n   , or to use the word franchise in a manner unmoored from these longstanding definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {18} We are therefore not convinced that the trademark licensing provision in this case should be treated as a standalone agreement-separate and apart from the franchise-simply because it is a separate line item in the franchise agreement, as A&amp;W urges. To the contrary, it is especially clear here in the context of a fast-food franchise that the trademark license is the heart of the franchise agreement. Consider the value of an A&amp;W franchise in which the franchisee is not granted a license to use A&amp;W's logos, colors, or menu items. Is such an agreement even a franchise? It certainly would bear little resemblance to a traditional franchise as commonly defined and understood. And in fact, A&amp;W itself agreed during oral argument before this Court that a franchise of this sort would be \"not entirely complete\" without the trademark. In this light, we conclude that the trademark licensing provision at issue in this case is central to the overall franchise and should be treated as part of the franchise for purposes of gross receipts, regardless of whether it was separately stated and itemized in the franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {19} This is consistent with the Legislature's intent, made manifest through the 2007 amendment to the definition of gross receipts, to subject franchise agreements like the one in\n   <em>\n    Sonic II\n   </em>\n   to gross receipts tax. This is also consistent with the 2006 legislative amendment that added the licensing category to the definition of gross receipts. Section 7-9-3.5(A)(1) (2006). Presumably, the addition\n   of this new category will subject certain types of licensing agreements to gross receipts tax. We acknowledge, though, as A&amp;W has forcefully argued, trademark licenses are not considered to be property under the 2007 definition, and are therefore not taxable. This does not mean, however, that the trademark license provision at issue in this case is untaxable.
