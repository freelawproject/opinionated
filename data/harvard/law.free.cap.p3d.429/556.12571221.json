In this opinion, we hold that, unlike a search\n   warrant, which must be executed within five days pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-3918(A), a seizure warrant is not subject to the same statutory five-day requirement. Accordingly, and because Miller's other challenges to the judgment are unavailing, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On April 17, 2015, the State obtained a seizure warrant authorizing\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   seizure of property from Miller. The seizure warrant was based on a judicial finding of probable cause that Miller engaged in racketeering activity. Under the authority of the seizure warrant, the State seized $28,000 from a safe deposit box leased to Miller, as well as $12,218.33 from Miller's bank and prison inmate trust accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State initiated forfeiture proceedings, and the case proceeded to a bench trial. The trial court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Miller \"possessed, solicited to possess, attempted to possess, conspired to possess, conspired and participated in the transfer and sale of, and conspired and participated in the transaction of proceeds of the sale of prohibited drugs\" in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2312, -3408, and -2317 for financial gain. Thus, the court forfeited the seized money to the State, and also entered an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   racketeering judgment against Miller in the amount of $482,400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Miller timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Although his argument is unclear, Miller appears to argue in his opening brief that the judgment does not contain a probable cause determination pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4305(E). In violation of Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure (\"ARCAP\") 13(d), Miller failed to refer to the record where he raised this argument for the trial court's consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our independent review of the record confirms the issue was not raised below. \"Matters not presented to the trial court cannot for the first time be raised on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown Wholesale Elec.

Upon expiration of the five[-]day period, the warrant is void unless the time is extended by a magistrate.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 13-3918 specifically refers to search warrants. In this case, the warrant at issue is a\n   <em>\n    seizure\n   </em>\n   warrant, making the five-day time limit under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3918 inapplicable. Miller did not cite, and we have not found, any statute or other authority that requires a seizure warrant to be executed within five days of its issuance.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2314(C), -4310(A), -4305(A), -4312(C). The State's seizures of Miller's property more than five days after issuance of the seizure warrant did not violate A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3918.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Finally, Miller argues that failure to serve him with police reports used at trial violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court's exclusion or admission of evidence will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selby v.

The trial court issued an advisory ruling granting the motion, pending any objections raised by Miller at trial. At trial, discussion was held regarding the State's motion, and the police reports were ultimately admitted. As noted above, Miller failed to provide the trial transcript on appeal. \"When a party fails to include necessary items, we assume they would support the court's findings and conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , 183 Ariz. at 73, 900 P.2d at 767 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Mustonen's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710986\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/283/\">\n    130 Ariz. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710986\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/283/\">\n    635 P.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 1981) ).
