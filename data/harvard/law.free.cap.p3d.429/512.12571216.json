This court affirmed his conviction on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But that conviction was reversed in 2013 when this court granted Whitaker's personal restraint petition because his right to a public trial was violated when six jurors were individually questioned in a closed courtroom during voir dire.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pers.

As in Whitaker's first trial, the State presented evidence that Whitaker helped his friend John Anderson and several others kidnap and kill Burkheimer, who was Anderson's ex-girlfriend. Whitaker helped to bind, hide, and transport Burkheimer. He helped to dig her grave, rob her, bury her, and destroy evidence of her murder. Although Whitaker testified in his first trial, he did not testify on retrial. With the exception of Whitaker's testimony, the evidence presented by the State in the first trial was similar to that presented on retrial and is not repeated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The jury found Whitaker guilty of premeditated first degree murder, with an aggravating factor of kidnapping and a firearm enhancement, and conspiracy to commit first degree murder. During the trial, Whitaker moved for a mistrial several times, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, a violation of CrR 6.15, and a violation of his right to a unanimous jury. After trial, Whitaker moved for a new trial based on these issues and other newly identified issues. The trial court denied his motion and sentenced him to life without the possibility of parole on the first degree murder charge (plus 60 months for the firearm enhancement) and 240 months on the conspiracy charge. Whitaker appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DURESS AS A DEFENSE TO AGGRAVATING FACTORS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Whitaker argues that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury that duress is a defense to the aggravating factors of robbery and kidnapping. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Jury instructions are sufficient if they permit each party to argue their theory of the case, do not mislead the jury, and, when read as a whole, properly inform the jury of the applicable law.\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

Whitaker acknowledges that duress is not a defense to murder, but he argues that because RCW 9A.16.060 does not explicitly prohibit the use of a duress defense for aggravating factors, duress can be applied against the aggravating factors in RCW 10.95.020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 \"The duress defense derives from the common law and is premised on the notion that it is excusable for someone to break the law if he or she is compelled to do so by threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The statute then goes on to explain the elements that must be met for duress to apply where a defendant participated in \"\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   crime.\" RCW 9A.16.060(1)(a), (c). Under the plain language of the statute, the crime the defendant participated in, and for which the defense can be applied, must be the same crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 11 Here, Whitaker was prosecuted for first degree murder. He was not prosecuted for kidnapping or robbery-those were only alleged as aggravating factors to premeditated murder and do not establish a separate crime. Therefore, under the plain language of the statute, the defense of duress\n   cannot be applied to those unprosecuted crimes alleged as aggravating factors. If the State charged Whitaker with kidnapping or robbery, he would have been entitled to a duress defense on those prosecuted crimes. But because that was not the case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Whitaker a duress instruction on the aggravating factors of kidnapping and burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 12 Whitaker relies on two out-of-state cases,\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree that there was evidence that Anderson threatened and used force against Whitaker and others as the events of Burkheimer's murder evolved. But the analysis does not end there.

Whitaker did not object to any of these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 24 The prosecutor's Invitation to the jury to Imagine what Burkheimer was thinking and telling them that she knew she was going to die are very similar to the Improper comments in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   . These statements were not relevant to the elements of the crime In deciding Whitaker's guilt and only served to appeal to the jury's sympathy by asking the jurors to put themselves In Burkheimer's shoes. We agree with Whitaker that these statements constitute prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 25 We disagree with the State's assertion that the prosecutor's arguments were not an appeal to the jurors' sympathy, but rather \"an invitation for jurors to draw their own reasonable inferences from the evidence.\" Br. of Resp't at 40. Although each of the improper statements was related to testimony given in the case, Injecting Burkheimer's perspective was improper and Irrelevant to Whitaker's guilt. Contrary to the State's contention at oral argument, Burkheimer's thoughts were not relevant to Whitaker's intent or to the element of extreme emotional distress for the aggravating factor of kidnapping. The prosecutor should have limited his arguments to what the testifying witness observed. It was unnecessary and inappropriate for him to extend the argument to Burkheimer's thoughts. Additionally, to the extent that the arguments invited the jurors to imagine Burkheimer's reactions to the crime as it was unfolding, they were embellishments on the evidence presented at trial because neither Burkheimer nor anyone else could testify to those thoughts. These arguments were clearly improper and prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 26 Nonetheless, we conclude that Whitaker waived the error by failing to object. Unlike statements in other reversible instances of prosecutorial misconduct that invoked racial prejudice or presented altered versions of admitted evidence, the statements here were not so flagrant and ill intentioned that they could not have been cured with an objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

So there's no fear, because even if there was, it's not a defense to the crime of murder in the state of Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2764-66 (emphasis added). Whitaker did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 32 Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Davenport\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor's comment that duress is not a defense to murder was improper and prejudicial for several reasons. First, the prosecutor knew that the trial court had already refused to instruct the jury on duress on the aggravating factors, as requested by Whitaker, and ignored that fact and chose to bring up the legal theory anyway. Second, in closing, defense counsel did not argue that Whitaker should be acquitted because he killed Burkheimer out of fear of Anderson, as the prosecutor implied. Rather, he argued that Whitaker did not form the intent necessary for the conspiracy charge because he was acting out of fear of Anderson, not as part of a plan. The prosecutor's mischaracterization of the defense argument at the beginning of his rebuttal argument gave it greater emphasis. Finally, it is clear from the record that the argument prejudiced Whitaker because, as in\n   <em>\n    Davenport\n   </em>\n   , the jury submitted the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The prosecutor said that \"being afraid or being under duress\" is not a defense in the state of WA. We need clarification on if that is indeed the \"Law\" in WASH.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 512. The trial court responded, \"Please refer to the instructions you have already received, in particular, Instruction No. 1.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 33 However, because Whitaker did not object to the improper argument, he must show that it could not have been cured by an instruction to the jury. He cannot do so. Whitaker raised this issue in his motion for a mistrial. The trial court held that the comment was not so prejudicial that it could not have been cured, explaining, \"If the objection had been made, the court could have stricken the comments and directed the jury to disregard them when the argument was first made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93. The jury's question to the trial court indicates that they were looking for an instruction on this issue and an instruction could have cured the prejudice. The court did not abuse its discretion by denying a mistrial on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 34 Whitaker argues that the misconduct could not have been cured because it was clearly intentional rather than inadvertent given the experience of the prosecutor. But even if it was intentional, it could have been cured had Whitaker timely objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 35 Even so, we admonish the prosecutor's intentional use of the improper arguments described above. \"In presenting a criminal case to the jury, it is incumbent upon a public prosecutor, as a quasi-judicial officer, to seek a verdict free of prejudice and based upon reason.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
