The original capture was made by Mr. Shields, a Purser of the navy, in the year 1814, in a barge armed and fitted out to cruise, but not regularly, attached to the navy. The cause was remanded to the Court below for further proceedings, and that Court decreed the proceeds to be equally distributed between the United States and the cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tor, without deducting the captor\u2019s. expenses. From this decree the captor . appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AvZ\">\n<em>March 5th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-6\">Mr. <em>C. J. Ingersoll, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiA\">stated, that it had been generally considered by the text writers, and Courts of Prize, that the right to captures, <em>jure belli, </em>was in the government, and that no individual could derive any rights of prize but from the express grant of the government.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> But, on principle, every individual is in a state of war with the en\u00e9mies of his country; and the common law certainly considers the law of nations as authorizing any subject of the belligerant state to seize enemy\u2019s property within the realm, or the property of other subjects previously captured by the enemy, to the exclusion of the king, the admiral, and the owner, unless the latter came the same day they were taken, and claimed them <em>ante occasum solis.</em><footnotemark><em>b</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To the same effect is the case in the book of the 7th <em>Edw. </em>IV. 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-8\">The principle is, that personal effects, seized in war, are acquired to the taker by occupancy; and immoveables, such as cities, lands, &amp;c. to the public.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> But the crown, always rapacious, and seeking to extend, its final prerogative, subsequently introduced the doctrine of public title to personal things taken in war. Thus the sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tute 34 Edw. III. c. 1. declares, that the crown was always seized of the forfeitures of war; and hence came the doctrine of the droits of admiralty.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> It does not appear that this assumption has ever been expressly recognised by this Court as a part of the law of this country; and, unquestionably, a non-commissioned captor may seize enemy\u2019s property,<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> and after a. condemnation, as in this case, it must be adjudged to the captors. It is now to\u00f3 late for the government to interpose its claim. The act of the 23d April, 1800, c. 189. [xxxiii.] s.. 5. and the. Prize Act of 1812, c. 430. [cvii.] gives the proceeds of vessels and goods, adjudged good prize, to the captors. But at all events, the captors are entitled to be repaid their expenses, and to a liberal salvage.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-4\">The <em>Attorney </em>General, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvE\">argued, that it was established as an elementary principle in the law of prize, that all captures <em>jure </em>belli, enured to the public, and that the actual captors could only derive their title from the grant \u00f3f the government. This was the case with commissioned captors, and still more emphatically as to non-commissioned captors; who, though they had a right to seize enemy\u2019s property, could claim no title to the proceeds upon adjudication, except what was derived from the bounty of the public.<footnotemark>d</footnotemark> Whatever might.have been the ancient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>common law doctrine in England, it had been long since settled in that country, that all rights of prize were derived from the grant of the crown. Without entering into all the distinctions as to the capacity in which the crown took, whether in the. king\u2019s office of . Admiral, or <em>jure coron\u00e1, </em>it might be laid down as a general proposition, that non-commissioned captors, a\u00e1 a matter of strict right, were not entitled t\u00f3 any share of the prizes captured by them. Captures made by tenders-or boats, sent .out by officers of the navy, but not regularly attached <em>bf </em>public authority, to the navy, are condemned as droits of admiralty.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> But in these, and all other cases of seizures by non-commissioned captors, it was usual to reward the takers with a liberal, share of the property, in the discretion of the Court of Admiralty.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> There was no reason why-any different principle or mode of proceeding should be adopted in this country. It does not depend upon any peculiar municipal regulations, but grows out of a principle' recognised by all the writers on public law : <em>Bello parta cedunt reipublica.</em><footnotemark><em>c</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the present case, a moiety of the proceeds had been allowed to the actual captors as salvage; but the provisions in the Prize Acts fot the distribution of prizes, were confined to commissioned public and private armed vessels,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AV_O\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\n<em>March 7th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"><em> </em>2 <em>Wheat.

If the original law of England authorized an individual to acquire to his own use the property of an individual, without any express authority from the public, that law was changed long before the settlement of .this country. It never Was the law of this country. Before the revolution, all captures from the enemy accrued to the government, to be distributed according to law ; and the revolution could not strip the government of this exclusive prerogative, and vest it in individuals. It is, then, the settled law of the United States, that,all captures made by non-commissioned captors, are made for the government; and since-the provisions in the Prize Acts, as to the. distribution of prize proceeds, are confined to public and private armed vessels, cruising under a regular commission, the, only claim which can be sustained by the captors in cases like the present, must be in the nature of. salvage for bringing in and preserving the-property.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In the present case, the District Court'have awarded, one half of the prize .proceeds, or salvage, to the captors; It was an exercise of sound discretion; and this Court would, with extreme reluctance, interfere with that, discretion, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>in a very clear case of mistake. We perceive no. such mistake in this case, and are well satisfied with the amount of the salvage as decreed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">As to the question which has been made, whether the appeal w\u00e1s in due time, it appears, that the appeal was prayed for within five years, and was actually allowed by the Court within that period. It is true that the security required by law was not given until after the lapse of the five years ; and, under such circumstances, the Court might have disallowed the appeal, and refused the security. But, as the Court accepted it, it must be considered as a sufficient compliance with the order of the\u00a1.Court, and that it had relation back to the time of the allowance of the appeal. The mode of taking the security, and the time for perfecting it, are matters of discretion, to be regulated by the Court granting the appeal; and when its order is complied with, the whole has relation-back to the time when the appeal was played. We must presume , the security was given, in this case, according to the rule prescribed by the District Court, and the appeal was, therefore, in.time.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
