William Craw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ford, deceased, the father of the female appellants, being, in his lifetime, a colonel in the Virginia line, on continental establishment, and, as such, entitled to the quantity of 6,666 and 2-3d acres of land, to be laid of between the Scioto and Little Miami; rivers, on the northwest side of the river Ohio, departed this life having first duly made and published his last will and \u2018testament, bearing date the 18th of June, 1782, whereby he devised all his est\u00e1te, not otherwise disposed of by said will, to be equally divided between his three children, John Crawford, and the female complainants, and their heirs for ever, That this will was proved and recorded in Westmoreland county, in the State of Pennsylvania, ion the 10th of September in the same year. That a warrant for the above quantity of land was after-wards issued in the name, of the said John Crawford, as heir at law of his father, under which the following entries were made; one for 800 acres, which was surveyed and patented to Lucas Sullivant, of which quantity 400 acres \u00e1re claimed by Bernard Thompson ; another for 95&amp; 2-3d acres, which was surveyed and patented to John Armat, but then, claimed by William Winship ; another for 956 acres, patented to some person unknown^ but claimed by Samuel Finley; another for 955 acres, patented to some person unknown, but believed to be claimed and possessed by Lucas Sullivant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">The bill then proceeds to interrogate the above parties, who are made defendants, severally, as to their knowledge of the above will, and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>title of the female complainants, and requires of them to set forth and describe the lands severally claimed by them, from whom they purchased, at what time, and for what price the same were purchased, and when the purchase money was paid. The prayer is for a conveyance, by each defendant, of two thirds of the land claimed by them respectively, and for possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">The answer of the heirs of Winship states, that the land to which , they claim title was purchased, for a valuable consideration, of Thomas Armat, by their father, to whom a conveyance was made in the year 1807. That a bill was bled by the present complainants, against the said Thomas Armat, in the District Court of Ohio, exercising the powers and.jurisdiction of a Circuit Court, for the land now in controversy, to Which the said Armat filed his answer, asserting himself to be a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the land, for a valuable consideration, and without notice, and that, the cause coming on to., be heard, th\u00e9 bill was dismissed without costs, after which decree, the purchase was made of Armat by the defendant\u2019s father.

If it arises from the character of the parties, as being citizens of different States, aliens, &amp;c. the citizenship or alienage of the respective parties must be set forth.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> He also contended, that the probate of the will of W. Crawford, in Westmoreland county, now a part of the State of Pennsylvania, but then claimed by Virginia, as being within its territorial limits, was sufficient to pass the title to the lands in question; but if this were not so, that the probate and record of the will was notice to all the world, and affected, in the view of a Court of equity, he consciences of the grantees, and all those claiming under them. He, however, concluded by asking, that in case the decree of the Court below should be affirmed, that it might be without prejudice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\">Mr. <em>Scott, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A93\">insisted, that the appellants had entirely failed in establishing any title to the lands in question, under the will of W. Crawford, they not having exhibited a probate either in the State of Virginia, or of Ohio, which then constituted a. part of Virginia. By the law of Virginia, then in force, it was necessary that a will of lands should be duly proved, and admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>record in the Court of the county where the testator had his residence at the time of his decease; or, if he had no place of residence in the State, then in the County Court of the county where the lands devised were situate; or, if the land was of a certain value, it might be proved in the General Court.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> The will of W. Crawford, whether executed in Virginia or elsewhere, could not have the effect to pass his real estate, situate in that State, unless made and proved in conformity with its laws. It belongs to the sovereign power of every State, to prescribe the rules by which real property within its territory shall be transferred. No Courts but those of Virginia} or Ohio, could have jurisdiction of this will, because the probate must depend upon the legality of the execution, and that again must depend upon the <em>lex loci. </em>The probate of a Court of competent jurisdiction is, by the local law, conclusive evidence of the due execution of a will of realas well as personal estate. But the Court of Westmoreland county could have no jurisdiction of the probate of this will, because that Court was not established under the authority of Virginia, and because the lands did not lie in that county, nor was the testator resident there. A mere contested claim to the territorial jurisdiction could never lay the foundation to establish the validity of this probate, which was, in fact, made in a foreign country. It is laid down, by the text writers on this subject, that \u201c if a will be made in a foreign country, disposing of goods in Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>land, it must be proved there.\u201d<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> <em>A fortiori. </em>would it *be required to be -proved there, (if by the English law probate of a will of lands were conclusiv\u00e9,) where it related to real property.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> If this will could not pass the legal title to the lands in controversy, neither could the respondents be affected with-constructive notice by the probate in Pennsylvania. Had it been duly proved and recorded in the State where the lands are situate, it is so vaguely drawn as not to designate, with certainty, the particular lands in question.The claim of the appellants would, therefore, still be but a latent equity, and the purchaser from the heir would be protected.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> He also insisted, that the respondents were protected by the former decree in the District Court. Although the Courts of the United States are Courts of limited jurisdiction, so that their judgments will be reversed on error, unless the jurisdiction appears upon the face of the record, yet they are not inferior Courts in a technical sense ; \u00e1nd so long as their judgments.remain unreversed, they are conclusive. Their judgments may be reversed in an appellate Court for this caus\u00e9; but they ar\u00e9 not mere nullities.<footnotemark><em>d</em></footnotemark></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AO5\">\n<em>March 16th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\"> Turner v.

A judgment of those Courts may be reversed for want of jurisdiction appearing on the face of the proceedings but, until so reversed, is conclusive as <em>a res adjudicata.</em></headnotes>\n<p id=\"Az-\">The question which the plea of Thompson\u2019s heirs, and. the answer of Winship\u2019s heirs, presents, is, whether the general decree of dismission of the bill inequity, filed by the present plaintiffs in the Federal District Court of Ohio, against the ancestor of these defendants, under whom they respectively claim title, is a bar the remedy which is sought to be enforced by the present suit? The reason assigned by the cation, why that decree cannot operate as a bar, is, that the proceedings in that suit do not show that the parties to it, plaintiffs and defendants, were citizens of different States, and that, consequently, the suit was <em>coram non judice, </em>and the decree void.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">But this reason proceeds upon an incorrect view of the character and jurisdiction of the inferior Courts of the United States. They are all of limited jurisdiction ; but they are not, on that account, inferior Courts, in the technical sense of those words, whose judgments, taken alone, are to be disregarded. If the jurisdiction be not. alleged in the proceedings, their judgments and decrees are erroneous, and may, upon a writ of error, or appeal, be reversed for that caus\u00e9. But they are not absolute nullities. This, opinion was strongly intimated, if not decided, by this Court, in the case of <em>Kempe's lessee </em>v. Kennedy, (5 <em>Cranch's Rep. </em>185.) and was, after-wards, confirmed by the decision made in the case of <em>Skillern's executors </em>v. <em>May's </em>executors, (6 <em>Cranch's Rep. </em>267.) That suit came before this Court upon a writ of error, where the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of the Court below was reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein. After this, it was discovered by that Court; that the jurisdiction was not stated in the proceedings, and the question was made, whether that Court could dismiss the suit for that reason? This point, on which the Judges were divided, was certified to the Supreme Court, where it was decided, that the merits of the cause having been finally decided in this Court, and its mandate only requiring the execution of its decree, the Court below was bound to carry that decree into execution, notwithstanding the jurisdiction of that Court was not alleged. in the pleadings. Now, it is very clear, that, if the decree had been, considered, as a nullity, on the ground that jurisdiction was not stated in the proceedings, this Court could not have required it to be executed by the inferior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We are, therefore, of opinion, that the decree of dismission relied upon in this case, whilst it remains unreversed, is a valid bar of the present suit as to the above defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The next question is presented by the answer of Finley. At the death of William Crawford, in the year 1782, he was entitled to a certain quantity of land to be laid off between the rivers Scioto and Little Miami, under a promise contained in an act of the legislature of Virginia. His interest in this land was purely an equitable one. After his death, a warrant to survey the same was granted to John Crawford, his only son and heir at low, who assigned to one Dyal a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tract which had been surveyed under the warrant, and the defendant claims a part of the tract so surveyed, under Beauchamp, who purchased from Dyal. He alleges, in his answer, that he made the purchase <em>bona fide, </em>paid the purchase money, and obtained a grant for the land, before he had notice of the will of William Crawford, or of the claim of his daughters under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Crawford\u2019s will, under which the female complainants claim title, was proved in some Court in the county of Westmoreland, in the State of Pennsylvania, and was there admitted to record; but it does not appear, nor is it even alleged, to have been at any time proved in the State of Virginia, or in the State of Ohio, where the lands in controversy lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At the time of the death of William Crawford lands lying in Virginia were transmissible by last will and testament, in writing, the same being signed by the testator, or by some person in his presence, and by his direction, and if not wholly written by himself, being attested by two or more credible witnesses, in his presence. But to give validity and effect to such will, it was necessary that it should be duly proved, and admitted to record, in the Court of the county where the testator had his residence at the time of his decease, or, if he had no place of residence in that State, then in the Court of the county where the land devised lay, or it might be proved in the General Court, where the land was of a certain value. Subsequent to the death of William Crawford an act of assembly was passed, which per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>mitted authenticated copies of wills, proved in any other State of the Union, or abroad, to be offered for probate in the General Court, or mthe Circuit, County, or Corporation Court, where the whole of the estate lies.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AHV\">Probate of a will of lands in one State, does not affect <em>the </em>title to real property in another. The lex lori r\u0153i sil\u0153, governs as to the disposition of real property.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">By the law of the State of Ohio, lands lying m that State m\u00e1y be devised by last will and testament, or writing; but, before such will can be considered as valid in law, it must be presented to the Court of Common Pleas of the county where the land lies for probate, and be proved by at least two of the subscribing witnesses. If the will be proved, and recorded, in another State, according to the laws of that State, an authenticated copy of the will may be offered for probate in the Court of the county where the land lies, without proof by the witnesses ; but it is liable to be contested by the heir at law, as the original might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">It is an acknowledged principle of law, that the title and disposition of real property is exclusively subject to the laws on the country where it is situated, which can alone prescribe the mode by which a title to it can pass from one person another. For the establishment of this doctrine, it will be sufficient to cite the cases of the <em>United States </em>v. Crosby, (7 <em>Cranch\u2019s </em>Rep. 115.) and <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>(9 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>565.) It follows, therefore, that no estate could pass to the daughters of William Crawford, under his will, until the same should be duly -proved according to the laws of Virginia, where the land to which be was entitled lav. at-the time of his death, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of the territory of Ohio, after the cession by Virginia to the United States, under the ordinance of Congress of the 13th of July, 1787, or according to the law of that State, which has already b\u00e9en recited. The probate. of the will in the State of Pennsylvania, gave it .no validity whatever in respect to these lands, as to which this Court is bound to consider Crawford as having died intestate, and, consequently, that they descended to John Crawford, his only son and heir at law, according to the law of Virginia, as it stood in the year 1782. The Court below, then, could do no less than dismiss the bill as against this defendant, upon the ground, that the complainants had shown no title whatever, legal or \u00e9quitable, to the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">This Court might be induced to yield to the application of the counsel for the appellants, that in case, of an affirmance, it should, be without prejudice, if we could perceive, from the record, that the complainants could, in another suit, pre sent their case under a more favourable aspect. But this the answer of Finley will not permit us to anticipate; for, even if an authenticated copy of Crawford\u2019s will should hereafter be offered for probate, and admitted to record in the State of Ohio, still, the title to be derived under it could not be permitted to overreach the legal title of this defendant, founded, as it is, upon an equitable title, acquired <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration paid, which purchase, payment, and acquisition of legal title, were made before he had either legal or constructive notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>will, or of the claim of the daughters, for we arc all of opinion, that the probate of the will in Pennsylvania cannot.be considered as constructive notice to any person, of the devise of the lands in controversy. The decree of the Court below\" must, therefore, be affirmed generally, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
