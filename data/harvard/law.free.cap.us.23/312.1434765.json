It was a proceeding against the vessel, and the negroes taken on board of her, under the Slave Trade Act of the 3d of March, 1807, c. 77. in which the vessel was condemned in the Court below, and that decree was affirmed on appeal, by this Court., After the condemnation of the vessel in the District Court, and before the appeal to this Court, the negroes found on baard of her were, (under the 4th, section of the act of Congress, and under an act of the State of Louisiana passed on the 13th of March; 1818, in pursuance of the act of Congress,) delivered by the Colector of the Customs for the port of New-Orleans, to the Sheriff of the parish of New-Orleans, for sale according, to law. A cross libel was aft\u00e9rwards filed by the alleged-original Spanish owners, claiming restitution of the negroes, which was dismissed, and on appeal, the decree affirmed by this Court. By consent of all the parties in in\u00eder\u00e9st, the negroes were sold by, the Sheriff, and the proceeds lodged in the Bank of the United States, subject to the Order of the Court below.

He, soon afterwards, werit onshore, and put a person on board to take charge of the Vessel, which remained at anchor opposite the block-house, until the 21st of April; when Lieutenant Me\u00e1de, with six soldiers in a boat, went from Fort St. Philip, in company with a custom-house boat, and Mr. Gardner, an officer of the customs, on board, took possession of the vessel, and brought her up under the guns of the fort. It appeared, that Roberts, afterwards, came on board the vessel, but did. not remain on board until h\u00e9r arrival at the.city of New-Orleans, he having left her. in order to board another vessel in the river. On the 21st of April, Mr. Chew, the Collector at' New-Orleans, acting on independent information which he had received, sent an armed revenue boat, with an Inspector of the Customs, down the river, with instructions to seize the vessel. On arriving at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Fort St. Philip, they found the vessel at anchor opposite the fort, with a serjeant\u2019s guard on board, which had been placed there by Major Humphrey, the commanding officer at the fort. The inspector received from that officer the ship\u2019s papers, and took possession of the vessel and negroes, the guard having been withdrawn, and brought them up to the city of New-Orleans. Proceedings were commenced against the property at the instance of Mr. Chew, and the other officers of the customs, and though his name was not inserted in the libel, the -prosecution was conducted by him until its final determin\u00e1tion, and the other parties claiming as captors, or seizors, did not intervene-Until after the decree of this Court on. the appeal in the original cause.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AMtt\">\n<em>March 15th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-3\">The Court below pronounced a decree, dismissing the claims of Messrs.

It is only necessary to mention, that after the condemnation of the vessel, in the District Court of Louisiana, and before the intervention of the appeal to this Court, the negroes seized on board of her, in pursuance of the act. of Congress, and the act of Louisiana, which will be hereafter commented on, were delivered by Mr. Chew, (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Collector of the Customs,) to the Sheriff of the parish of New-Orleans, to be sold according to law; and a few days afterw\u00e1rds a. new libel, claiming the property of the negroes, having been filed, by the Spanish owners, (which was after-wards dismissed; and on appeal, the dismissal confirmed by this Court,) by . consent of all the parties in interest, the negroes were sold by the Sheriff, and the proceeds lodged in the Bank of the United States, subject to the order of the District Court. The question, now in Contestation respects the manner in. which the proceeds of this sale, as well as of the sale of the vessel and effects, are to be distributed, and the parties who are entitled. to them. Mr. Roberts, who is an Inspector of the Customs, claims title as the original seizor or captor; Messrs. Gardner, Meade; and Humphrey, make a like claim under a subsequent military seizure made by them; and Mr. Chew, and the Surveyor and Naval Officer of the port of New-Orleans, a like claim as the true and actual captors and seizors, who made the last and only effectual Seizure', and prosecuted the same to a filial decree of condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\">Mr. Chew caused the original libel against the vessel to be brought, arid though his name is accidentally. omitted in. it as the officer through whose, instrumentality the seizure was made, yet it is admitted, and indeed could riot be denied, that he was the sole responsible prosecutor of the suit, until the final condemnation of the vessel, and the final dismissal of the second libel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>brought by the original Spanish claimants. The claims of all the other parties, now before the Court, adverse to that of Mr. Chew, have intervened since the final judgm\u00e9nt pronounced in the Supreme Court in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">The Josefa Segunda was finally condemned under the seventh section of the Slave Trade Act, of the 2d of March, 1807, ch. 77. It will be necessary to refer , to the terms of that section at large, because the question here respects as well the distribution of the proceeds of the vessel; (which must be made according to the rules prescribed in that section,) as of the proceeds of the sale of the negroes, who were unlawfully brought into the United States ; and, in the progress of the discussion, it will materially aid us in the decision of the latter, to ascertain who, by the construction of that section, are the captors entitled to the distribution of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The fourth section of the act of 1807 provides, that \u201c neither the importer, nor any person or persons claiming from or under him, shall hold any right or title whatsoever to any negro, &amp;c. who may be imported or brought within the United States, or territories thereof, in violation of this law; but the same shall remain, subject to any regulations, not contravening the provisions of this act, which the Legislatures of the several States or territories, at any time hereafter may make, for disposing of any such negro,\u201d &amp;c. Accordingly, the Legislature of Louisiana, on the 13th of March, 1818, passed, an act avowedly to meet the exigency Of this section, which act, af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ter reciting the substance of the same section, proceeds tot declare, that the Sheriff of the parish of New-Orleans is authorized and required to receive any. negro, &amp;c. delivered to him in virtue of the act o\u00a3 Congress, until the proper Court pronounces a decree of condemnation; and after such condemnation, it authorizes him to sell such negro, &amp;.c. as a slave for life; and then declares, th<em>at </em>the proceeds of such sale shall, after deducting all charges, be paid over by the said Sheriff, one moiety for <em>the use of the commanding officer of the capturing vessel, </em>and the other moiety to the treasurer of the Charity Hospital of New-Orleans, for the use and benefit of the s\u00e1id hospital.\u201d There is no doubt that this act is not in contravention of the intention of the act of Congress, for the sixth section contains a proviso, recognising the validity of such a sale, When made under the . authority of a State law.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AEp2\">Jurisdiction of the District Court over the present proceedings.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b330-3\">Some objection has been suggested as to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Louisiana, to the present proceedings, upon the ground that the distribution is to be made under this act by the Sheriff of New-Orleans. But upon a full consideration of the act of 1807, we are of opinion, that ;he objection cannot be. maintained. By the judiciary act.of 1789, as well as by the express provisions of the act of 1807, the District Court has jurisdiction over seizures made under the latter act. The principal proceedings are certainly to-be. against the vessel, and the goods and effects found on board. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the negroes are also to be taken, possession of, for the purpose of being delivered over to the State governments, according to the provision of the act; and it is. obvious, that this delivery can-only be after-a condemnation has occurred, since it is only in that event that the State Legislature can acquire any right to dispose of them. The proviso in the seventh section, that the oncers to whom a moiety of the proceeds is given on condemnation, shall be so entitled only in case they safely keep and deliver over the negroes according to the laws of the States, operates by way of .condition to the completion of their title; but does not import any requirement that the delivery shall be \u00a1Until after the condemnation. On the contrary, as by a decree of restitution of the vessel and effects, the claimants . would be entitled to a restitution of the negroes, the reasonable construction seems to be., that. they remain subject to the order of the District Court, as property in the custody of the law, though in the actual possession of the seizing officers. The possession of the latter is the possession of the Court, as much in respect to the negroes as the vessel and cargo; and it must remain until the Court, by pronouncing a final decree, directs in what manner it is to be surrendered. In the present case, the negroes were sold, and the proceeds substitut\u00e9d for them were in the custody of .the\u00bb Court. It was, therefore, authorized to deliver them over to the parties who should be entitled, under the State law, lit terms, the State law required the delivery to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Sheriff\u2019 to the use of the parties; but who the parties were to whose use the Sheriff, must hold them, could not be ascertained by him, but must be awarded by the Court, to whom, as an incident to. the principal cause, it exclusively belonged. In what manner could any other Court be authorized to -ascertain who was <em>the commanding officer of the capturing vessel ? </em>The decree, of the Court, in distributing the proceeds of the vessel and cargo, must necessarily involve this inquiry; and certainly it cannot for a moment be maintained in argument, that any other person than the commander of the capturing vessel, who would share the proceeds of the prize and her cargo, could be within the meaning of the law of Louisiana. The common form of drawing up decrees, in, cases of condemnation, is, that the proceeds be distributed according to law. But if any difficulty arises, upon petition, the Court always proceeds to decide who are the parties entitled to distribution, and to make \u00e1 supplementary decree. But it may do the same in the first instance, and make the particulars of the distribution a part pf the original degree. In the present case, if the original decree had been drawn out at large; it ought to have been, that the n\u00e9groes so captured be delivered over to the Sheriff of New-Orleans for sale, according to the act; of Louisiana in this behalf provided, and that the net proceeds of the. sale be afterwards paid over, viz. one moiety to A. B., adjudged by the Court to be the commanding officer- of the capturing vessel, and the other moiety to the Charity Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of New-Orleans. This course of proceeding is very familiar in. prize causes; where the Court of Admiralty always ascertains who are the captors entitled to the prize proceeds; and the Courts of common law will never entertain any jurisdiction over the proceeds until after such adjudication. Considering this cause, then, as a cause of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, belonging exclusively to the Courts of the United States, we are not aware how any ether Court could adjudge upon the question who were the captors or seizors entitled to share the proceeds; and we think that the District Court has jurisdiction over the present proceedings.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AeQ\">What is necessary to constitute a valid seizure, so as to entitle the party to the proceeds of a forfeiture.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In respect to the claim of Mr. Roberts, we do not think that the evidence establishes that he ever made any valid seizure of the vessel. It is not sufficient that he intended to make one, or that, on some occasions, he expressed to persons that he bad so done. There must be an open, visible possession claimed, and authority exercised under a seizure. The parties must understand that they are dispossessed, and that they are no longer at lib\u00e9rty to exercise any dominion , on board of the ship. It is true, that a superior physical force is not necessary to be employed, if there is a voluntary acquiescence in the seizure and dispossession. If the party, upon notice, agrees to submit, and actually submits, to the command and control of the seizing officer, that is sufficient; for, in such cases, as in cases of captures <em>jure belli, </em>a voluntary surrender of authority, and an agreement to obey the captor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>supplies the place of actual force. But, here, Mr. Roberts gave no notice of the seizure to the persons on <em>board; </em>he exercised no authority, and claimed no possession. He had no force adequate to compel submission; and his appearance in the vessel gave no other character to him than that of an inspector, rightfully on board, in performance of his ordinary duties. To construe such an equivocal act as a seizure, would be unsettling principles.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A1SI\">Effect of a voluntary abandonment of a seizure.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Messrs. Humphrey, Meade, and Gardner, certainly did make a seizure, by their open possession of the vessel, and bringing her under the guns, of Fort St. Philip. But there is this objection to the seizure, both of Mr. Roberts, (assuming that he made one,) and of the other persons, that it was never followed up by any subsequent prosecution or proceedings. The seizure of Messrs. Humphrey, Meade, and Gardner, seems to have been Voluntarily abandoned by them ; and even that of Mr. Roberts, if he made one, does not seem to have been persisted in. Now, a seizure, or capture, call it which we may, if once abandoned, without the influence of superior force, loses all its validity, and becomes a complete nullity. Like the common case of a capture at sea, and a voluntary abandonment, it leaves, the property open to the next occupant. But what is decisive in our view is, that neither of these gentlemen ever attempted any prosecution, or intervened in the original proceedings in the District Court, claiming to be seizors, which was indispensable to consummate their legal right; and their claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>was, for the first time, made after \u00e1 final decree of condemnation in the Supreme Court; This was certainly a direct waiver of any right acquired by their original seizures. It is not permitted to parties to lie by, and allow other persons to incur all the hazards and responsibility of being held to damages in case the seizure turns put to be wrongful, and then to come in, after the peril is over, and claim the whole reward. Such a proceeding would be utterly unjust,-and inadmissible. If the parties meant to have insisted on any right, as seizors, their duty was to have inr tervened in the District Court before the hearing on the merits, according to the course pointed out by Lord Hale in the passage cited at the. bar, where there are several persons claiming to be seizors of forfeited property.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> In the present case, Mr. Chew actually advanced a considerable, sum of money for the maintenance of these negroes during the pendency of the suit; and if it had been unsuccessful he must have exclusively borne the loss. Upon the plain ground, then,. that Mr. Roberts, and Messrs. Humphrey, Meade, and Gardner, have not followed up their seizure by any prosecution, such as the act of 1807 re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>quires, we are of opinion, that there is no foundation, in point of law, for their-claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">That Mr. Chew, on behalf of himself, and the Surveyor and Naval Officer of the port of New-Orleans, did make-the seizure on. which the prosecution in this case Was founded, is completely proved by the evidence ; it is also admitted by the United States, in their answer to the libel of Messrs. Carricaberra, &amp;c. the Spanish claimants, and is averred by Mr. Chew, and his coadjutors, in their separate allegation and answer, to the same libel. While the vessel lay at Fort St. Philip, armed boats, under revenue officers, were sent down by him, with orders to seize her, and bring her up to New-Orleans for prosecution, which was done accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The remaining question then is, whether Mr. Chew, for himself and his coadjutors in office, is to be considered as entitled to the proceeds of the vessel under the act of Congress, and to the proceeds of the negroes, as \u201c the commanding officer of the capturing vessel,\u201d within the sense of the Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">If he is entitled to the proceeds of the vessel and cargo, under the 7th section of the act of 1807,. then, we think, he must be fairly considered as within the spirit,, if not the letter, of the act of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"A49\">The 7th section is certainly not without difficulty in its construction. In the first clause it declares, that vessels found <em>\u201c </em>in any river, port, bay, or harbour; or on the high seas, within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>bbvering on the coast thereof, having on board any negro, &amp;c. for the purpose of selling them as slaves, &amp;c. contrary to the prohibitions of this act, shall be forfeited to the use of the United States, and may be seized, prosecuted, and condemned, in any Court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof.\u201d Under this clause, standing alone, it cannot be doubted, that any person might lawfully seize such a vessel at his peril, and if the United States should choose to adopt his act, and proceed to adjudication, he would, in the event of a condemnation, be completely justified. But it may be considered as peculiarly the duty of the officers of the customs, to watch over any maritime infractions of the laws of the United States; and, by the Collection Act of 1799, (ch. 128. s. 70.) it is made the duty of all custom-house officers, as well within their Districts as without, to make seizures of all vessels violating the revenue laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">The section, then, in the next clause, authorizes the President of the United States to employ any of the armed vessels of the United States to cruise on .any part of the coast, to prevent violations of the act,.and to instruct and direct the commanders of such armed vessels, to seize all vessels contravening the act, \u201c wheresoever found on the <em>high seas,\u201d </em>omitting the words, \u201c in any river, port, bay, or harbour,\u201d contained in the former clause. It then proceeds to declare, that the proceeds of all such vessels, when condemned, \u201c shall be divided equally between the United States, and the officers and men, who shall make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>such seizure, take or bring the same into port for condemnation, whether such service be made by an armed vessel of the United <em>States, or revenue cuttes thereof, </em>and the same shall be distributed in like manner as is provided by law for the distribution of prizes taken from an enemy.\u201d In a strict sense, the present seizure was not made by an armed vessel of the United States, nor by a revenue cutter, which, by the act of 1799,. (ch. 128. s. 98.) the President is at liberty to require to co-operate with the navy. But if we consider these cases as put only byway of example, of if we give an enlarged meaning to the weirds \u201c revenue cutter,\u201d so as to include revenue boats, such as the. Collector is, by the act of 1799, (ch. 128. s. 101.) authorized to employ, with the approbation of the Treasury department, then the seizure of Mr. Chew may be brought within the general terms of the act. The United States do not appear to have resisted this construction as to the proceeds, of the sale of the Josefa Segunda. And, on the other hand, if we consider, that the act meant to deal out the same rights to all parties who might seize the offending vessel, whether they were officers of armed vessels, or of revenue cutters, or merely private individuals, who may seize and prosecute to condemnation, then, under that construction, Mr. Chew may be properly deemed the seizing officer, entitled, with his crew, to the proceeds of the vessel. If such a construction is not admissible, within the equity of the act, then it is a <em>casus omis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sus, and the property yet remains undisposed of by law.</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">Upon the best consideration which we have been able to give the. case, we are of opinion, that it is a <em>casus omissus, </em>or rather, that all the beneficial interest vests, in the United States. The first clause of the seventh section declares, that all vessels offending against it, \u201c shall be forfeited to <em>the use of the United States f </em>and may be seized, prosecuted, and condemned, accordingly. The seizure may be made by any person; but the forfeiture is still to be, by the terms of the act, for <em>the use of the United States. </em>If the act had stopped here, no difficulty in its construction could have occurred. As nothing is given by it to the seizing officer, nothing could be claimed by him except from the bounty of the government. The subsequent clause looks exclusively to cases where the seizure is made by armed vessels of the. navy, or by revenue cutters, and directs, in such an event, a distribution to be made in the same manner as in cases of prizes taken from an enemy. Correctly speaking, these cases constitute exceptions from the - preceding clause, and take them, out of the general forfeiture <em>\u201c to the use of the United </em>States. It might have been a wise policy to have extended the benefit of these provisions much farther, or to have given, as the act of the 20th of April, 1818, (ch. 85.) has given, a moiety in all cases to the person who should prosecute the seizure to effect. But Courts- of law. can deal with questions of this nature only so far as the Legislature has clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>expressed its will. Mr. Chew appears to be a very meritorious officer, and deserving of public respect for his good conduct on this occasion. But as the act has made no provision for his compensation, he must be left, in common with those who made the military seizure, to the liberality of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The remarks which have been already made, dispose of the case, so far as respects the proceeds of the vessel,-and we think they are decisive as to the claim to the proceeds of sale of the negroes. The case as to this matter is also a <em>casus omissus </em>in the act of Louisiana. That act had a direct reference to the act of Congress, and \u201c the commanding officer of the capturing vessel,\u201d in the sense of the former, must mean the commanding officer of such an armed vessel, or revenue cutter, as is entitled to share in the distribution of the proceeds by the latter. It would be going very far to give a larger construction to the words than, in their strict form they import; and^since they admit of a reasonable interpretation, by confining them to the cases provided for by Congress, we are satisfied that our duty is complied with, by assigning to them this unembarrassed limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The decree of the District Court, so far as it dismisses the claims of Messrs. Roberts, Humphrey, Mead, and Gardner, is affirmed, and so far as it. sustains the claim of Mr. Chew, and the Naval Officer and Surveyor of the port of New-Orleans, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><em> Harg. Law Tracts, </em>(4t.) p. 227. \u201c At. common law, any person might seize uncustomed goods to the use of the king and himself, and thereupon inform for a seizure. -But yet, if A. seize goods uncustomed, and then B. seize them for the same cause, he that first seizeth ought to be preferred as the informer.
