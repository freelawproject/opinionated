The claim of Mr. Burke, as a <em>bones fidesi </em>purchaser, was then rejected, upon the ground of the illegality of the original capture, it having been made in violation of the Neutrality of the United States; and a general decree of restitution was awarded in favour of the libellant, suing in his official character as the Consul of Spain, for the benefit of the original owners. A mandate issued from this Court to the Court below, to carry , that, decree into effect. Pending the original proceedings in the Court below, and before the appeal, the property, upon the. application of Mr, Burke, was delivered to him, uppn a stipulation given with sureties in the . usual manner, for the payment of the appraised value, according to. the future decree of the Court. The appraisers estimated the property at 7,473 dollars and 43 cents, being, as they declare, \u201c the <em>long price, </em>including custom-house duties,\u201d and for this sum, the stipulation was given. Upon the application to the Court below, to enforce the mandate of this Court, Mr.. Burke filed a petition, asserting that he had incurred cost and expenses and paid certain liens upon the property. The specifications now insisted on, were the following: (1) Insurance on the property from Galveztown to Baltimore, viz. 751 dollars \u00e1nd 25 cents. (2.) Duties paid on the same at Baltimore, viz. 1945 dollars, and 14 cents. A petition was also filed on behalf of Mr. Burke and a Mr. Forbes, (who now, for the first time, appeared in the cause,) as joint owners of the schooner Harriet, in which the property in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>tion was brought from Galyeztown to Baltimore, praying for the allowance of freight for the voyage, amounting to i,500 dollars. The libellant. also made an application for interest upon the amount of the stipulation to be decreed in his favour, either from the time of capture, from the date of the stipulation, or from the decree of this Court.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AfOH\">\n<em>Feb. 10th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">The respective, claims of all the parties for those allowances were rejected by the Circuit Court, and from the decree dismissing them an appeal was taken to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\">The <em>Attorney </em>General, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqRH\">Burke, stated, that .the allegation demanding restitution in the original case, .was filed by the Spanish Consul against the goods, and the appellant claimed the cargo as having been remitted to him in return for an outward cargo shipped to his agent at Matagorda. It is now alleged, that he was- part owner of the capturing vessel, and, therefore, as a wrong doer, not entitled to the equitable deductions he claims. He insists, that he is a <em>bona jidei </em>purchaser, without notice of the illegal capture, and, therefore, entitled to be allowed for duties and other charges. In the admiralty, the libellant and claimant are both actors.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> If, therefore, it had been the wish of the libellant to put in issue the fact of Burke\u2019s knowledge of, or connexion with, the illegal capture, he. should have answered the averment which. is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>contained in the claim,, that he (Burke) was entirely ignorant of, and unconnected with, that. transaction; or he should have filed an amended libel, and charged the guilt of Burke. The libellant did neither; and thus th\u00e9 fact of B.\u2019s guilt or innocence was not in issue in that case. It was not involved in the decision of the Court, which turned on the facts of the illegal armament of the Patriota in the ports of the United States, the capture of the Santa Maria by that vessel, and the identity of the goods as part of the cargo of the Santa Maria. These facts being established, it was immaterial who the owners of the capturing vessel were, or how the goods came into the possession of Burke. Restitution was decreed to the original owners, and it was in the execution of this decree under the mandate from this Court, that the proceedings now in question took place. Upon the present appeal, nothing is before the Court but what is subsequent to the mandate.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> The respondents cannot, therefore, enter into the question o'f the guilt or innocence of Burke upon the evidence in the original cause. He is now to be considered as an innocent, purchaser, and entitled as such to all equitable deductions, meliorations, and charges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">Besides the other claims which are nowinsisted on, there was a minor claim in the Court below for the difference between the valuation and the actual sales, which was withdrawn upon the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tnority of the case of the <em>Betsey, </em>and other \u00a1cases cited in a note to that case.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfQ\">To the claims for duties, insurance, and freight, it was objected in the Circuit Court, that the Court had no authority to consider them, because the.original decree of this Court had closed the door against all inquiry into the subject, upon the principle settled in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himely. </em>But this was a misapplication of the principle determined in that case. The question on the first appeal was merely as to the proprietary interest of the cargo. But after the principal question in the cause has been finally decided, and the cause <em>quoad hoc </em>perpetually disposed of, any question of charge upon the original fund may still be taken up as a new. question, so long as the fund remains within the power of the Court. Such is understood to be the practice, both in England and in this country.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> Considering Burke as an innocent purchaser of the goods, who had brought them to the United States, where, they were claimed by the original owners, and restored to them, because of the defect, df title in those from whom Burke had purchased, this case cannot be distinguished in principie from that of <em>Rose </em>v. Hime<em>ly, </em>in. which freight, insrirance, duties, and other expenses, were allowed, under the same circumstances.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> The charges arid expenses in the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sent case, having b.een actually borne by the innocent purchaser, in bringing the goods safely into the country, seem to enter into the value of the articl\u00e9s. themselves ; and in withdrawing them from the possession of the. purchaser, a reimbursement of his actual expenses is required by natural equity, and may be. considered as a species of mitigated salvage. . The claim for the mount of the duties rests upon higher grounds. Wherever goods are sold by order of Court, or consent of parties, the duties attach as upon an ordinary importation ; and upon restitution of the proceeds, the amount of the. duties is to be deducted.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> The party gets more than the value of the goods, if, he gets the amount of the duties ; and' the purchaser pays the duties twice over. to the government as duties, and again to the origh nal owner, as part of the <em>long price </em>value of his goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avfm\">As to the claim by the other party for interest upon the appraised value, so far as it is claimed from the time of capture, the question is not he-fore this Court, because it was not made in the Court below; Nor can it be allowed from the, date Of the stipulation,'because the stipulation is a mere substitute for the specific goods, which would not have carried interest. The principle, of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himely </em>applies to this demand, since it is in the nature of a claim for damages for the illegal detention and delay, which were prayed in the original libel, but wliich were n\u00f3t allowed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the Court below, nor by this Court, upon the first appeal. Interest might, .doubtless, .have been expressly reserved in the stipulation, if the Court below had deemed the party entitled to it. But these questions are definitively closed by the original decree, and cannot arise upon the mandate to carry that decrpe into effect-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-4\">Mr. <em>D. Hoffman, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqu\">insisted, that the' original proceedings in the cause showed that Burke was a participator in the illegal seizure of this property, and, consequently, could not claim any. equitable deductions from the full value on account of charg\u00e9s incurred by him in its preservation. He was \u00e1 <em>malts Jidei </em>possessorpwho was not entitled to be allowed for his expenses^ actually laid out upon the property, still less for the fictitious charges of freight, insurance, and duties. As to the duties, they have been incurred solely by his electing to import the goods for consumption. Had they been delivered to the original owners, and carried away by them, or had they never been brought in, they would\" not have been subject to duties.. There, was a manifest inconsistency in the opposite argument, which would not admit the stipulation to carry interest, whilst it sought to diminish the principal sum specified in the stipulation, by claims which might have been made upon the original hearing. But there is no principle, authority, or established practice, which requires, that wher\u00e9 the goods have been delivered' on bail, the Court should, cotemporaneously, decree restitution of the spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>cific thing, and the, performance of the stipulation. The Court may decree restitution generally, and in executing the decree it is to be applied to the stipulation, so as to include not only what is substantially comprehended in the decree, but every equitable demand consistent with it, although not expressly included in, its terms. The allowance of interest by the Court below, after the original decree in this Court, does, not so much depend upon the -circumstance of its being expressly reserved upon the face of the stipulation, as upon the notorious fact, that the Court would be subsequently called on to act definitively upon the stipulation, when it came to execut\u00e9 the final decree of this Court. In thus executing it, by.allowing interest, the Court below' would not, modify or add to the original decree of this Court, since this allowance opens nothing which had been adjudicated by this Court, and is to be regarded as nothing more than an incident to the execution of the decree of restitution. That restitution would have been incomplete without it, as, if the property had not been delivered to the capturing claimant upon bail, it might have been delivered, in the same manner to the original owner, or sold by order of Court, and the proceeds invested in stocks bearing an interest;</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8s\">As to the case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himely, </em>it will be found that the Court there assumes, that the qu.estion of interest was before it oh the origina appeal, and asserts, that if the claim had thei been blade, it would have been rejected, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the Court did not consider the appellants as infected by the marine trespass committed by the captors. \u201c The circumstances of the case were such as to restrain the Court from inserting in its decree any thing which might increase its severity. The loss was heavy, and it fell unavoidably on one. of two innocent parties. The Court was not inclined to add to its weight by giving interest in the nature of damages.. The allowance of interest, therefore, in the Court below, is overruled.\u201d<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Besides, in that case, the Court had all the questions of equitable deductions and allowances before them on the original appeal, and gave a very special decree and mandate, which, <em>ex </em>industria, omitted interest. But here the question is not between two equally innocent parties. Here none of the questions of freight, insurance, duties, and interest, were raised in the original cause. They were all reserved as incidental to the stipulation, which was not then brought before, this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\">The doctrine laid down in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himely, </em>that after a decree in this Court, and the cause sent by mandate to the Court below, and the further proceedings upon the mandate are appealed from, nothing is before this Court on the appeal but what is subsequent to the mandate, is unquestionably a sound and salutary rule. But is it any thing more than what the general principles of law would establish ? Is it any thing more than an application of the familiar maxim as to <em>res </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>adjudicata? </em>\u201c Nothing is before this Court,\u201d says the Chief Justice, \u201c but what is subsequent to the mandate.\u201d This is unquestionably true, but with this indispensable qualification, that the matter in question prior to the niandat\u00e9 was, or ought necessarily to have been, before the Court originally. The rule was applied to the claims of freight and insurance which the original decree of this Court had expressly allowed, but which the commissioner appointed by the Circuit Court under the mandate had disallowed. But no case can be found which requires the Court below to pass any decree, in the first instance, upon the stipulation, or to allow interest before the appeal, or which requires the question of interest, or any similar incidental _ claim, to be brought before this Court upon the original appeal. The rule in regard to matters prior' or subsequent to the mandate, appears to be understood precisely in this. manner by the learned Judge who delivered, the opinion of the Court in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter. </em>\u201c \u00c1 final judgment of this Court is conclusive <em>upon the rights which it decides, </em>and no statute has provided any process by which this Court can revise its own judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-3\">The claim for interest is an incident to the execution of the .mandate for restitution. Interest is impliedly due, wherever a liquidated sum, of money is wrongfully withheld. \u201c If a man has my money by way of loan, he ought to answer interest; but if he detains my.money wrongfully,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AuV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Feb. 26th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUG\">he ought, <em>a fortiori, </em>to answer interest; and it is still stronger, when one by wrong takes from me my money or goods, which I am trading with, in order to turn them into money.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Were not this the case, a strong temptation would be presented to debtors to violate their duty. In the language of Lord Mansfield, \u201c\u2018they would be encouraged to make use of all the unjust dilatoriness of chicane, and the more .the plaintiff is injured, the less he will be relieved.\u201d This is. emphatically applicable to the present case, where the capturing claimant has superadded to the original wrong done to the owners of these goods, all the. unjust dilat\u00f3rin\u00e9ss of chicane.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em> </em>Jennings v.

And. the first question,, therefore, that arises, is, whether upon, this appeal the Court can look into those proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining.the guilt or innocence of the claimant ? The principle laid doin in the case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himely, (5 Cranch, </em>313.) that upon an appeal from a mandate, nothing is before the. Court but the proceedings subsequent to the mandate,.is undoubtedly correct in the sense in which that expression was used, with reference to the doctrine of that case. Whatever had been formerly before the Court, and was disposed of by its decree, was considered as finally disposed of; and the question of interest raised upon the execution of the mandate in that case, was in that predicament. But upon all proceedings to carry into effect the decree of the Court, the original proceedings are always before the Court, so far as they are necessary to determine any new points or rights in controversy between the parties, which were not terminated by the original decree. The Court may,, th\u00e9refore, inspect the;original proceedings, to ascertain the merits or demerits of the parties, so far &amp;s they bear on the new claims, and must decide upon the whole examination what its duty requires. In the present case, it is impossible to separate the stipulation from the other proceedings. It is unintelligible without reference to them. The Court must inspect them, to guide it in its future acts, and to. enable it to carry into effect the decree of the Supreme Court,. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>decree restores the property generally as claimed by the libellant; but what that property is, in what predicament it is, and what are the means by which it is to be restored, must be ascertained, before .the Court can institute any farther proceedings.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AmU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The rule, that upon an appeal from a mandate, nothing is before the Court hut the proceedings subsequent to the mandate, explained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"ATB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>After a general decree of restitution in this Court, new claims for charges and liens cannot be set up in the Court below.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Another preliminary question is, whether the subject matter of these cl aims, is, in this stage the cause, open tor discussion. AH the claims of Mr. Burke might certainly have been brought forward and insisted, upon in the original proceedings. If his right to the property was established, still he might be entitled to equitable deductions for meliorations or charges; and if these claims were favoured by the Court, the decree of restitution would have been subject t$ these deductions. They would then have' constituted a lien upon the property, and the Circuit Court must have enforced it. But no such claims were insisted upon in the~written allegations, or even <em>viva voce </em>at the hearing; the omission was Voluntary and the decuee of restitution passed, in the most absolute and unconditional form. The consequences of now admitting them to be brought before tins' Court by appeal, would be most inconvenient and mischievous in practice. It would encourage the grossest laches and delays. The party might, lie by through the whole progress of the original 'cause, until, \u00e1 final decree, holding the real owner out of his property, and securely enjoying, as in this case, the profits, and then start new claims for future investigation, which would protract the. final decision to nn indefinite period. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>course would have a tendency justly to bring into disrepute the. administration of justice,, and inflict upon the innocent all the. evils of exp\u00e9nsive litigation. W\u00e9 think, therefore, that upon principle, every existing claim which the party has omitted ,to make at the hearing upon the merits, and before the final decree, is to b,e considered as waived by, him, and is not to be entertained in any future proceedings; and when a decree has been, made, which is in its own,terms .absolute, it is to be carried into Reflect, -according to those, terms, and excludes all inquiry between the litigating parties as to liens or claims, which might\u2019 have been attached to it by the Court, if they had, been previously brought to its notice. These remarks apply as well to the claim for freight, as the other items. Mr. Burke, as the importer of the goods, would, if. the carrier ship had belonged to a mere stranger, have been directly responsible for the, freight,. and would hav\u00e9 been .entitled to. bring it forward if the original, suit as an equitable charge. &lt;. It cap make no difference in his favour,, that he was, as he now asserts himself in his petition to be, a joint owner of the vessel with Mr. Forbes. Whether, as between- himself and his co-proprietor,' he would -be'liable to pay any freight, does not appear, for the. petition is nak\u00e9d of any proofs, and .lie may have occupied only ins own portion of the vessel. Nor .is there any evidence adduced, that Mr. Forbes was really. a joint owner ; and. in his original claim, .Mr, Burke, expressly asserts the vessel to be his Own, in terms which, imply a sole proprietary interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>But without relying on these circumstances, it is sufficient to say, that it is too late for Mr. Burke in any way-to assert, the claim for freight, and if payable at all, he must how bear the burthen occasioned by his own laches:</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AK82\">Interest upon <em>the stipulation not allowed. Not, in personam, </em>against the party, the claim or interest not having been asserted before the original decree and mandate thereon.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">This view of the subject, makes it. wholly unnecessary to enter upon the inquiry, how far Mr. Burke is an innocent. possessor of the property in controversy,..and, as such, entitled to equitable deductions, and charges. The claim, whether, a lien, or a mere , equity, has been totally displaced by. the unconditional decree of. restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The same doctrine applies to the claim of interest made by the. libellant. The question was involved in the original proceedings, and the libe<em>l </em>itself contains an express prayer for as well as for restitution, of. the property. D\u00e1mages are often given by way of interest for the illegal seizure and detention of property; and, indeed, in cases of tort, if given at all, interest partakes of the very-nature of damages The ground now assumed is, that interest ought to be given since the date of the stipulation, or, at all events, since the decree of restitution, because the claimant, has had the use of the property during this period, and it is but a just compensation to the libellant for the d\u00e9lay and loss lie has sustained by the dispossession. It might have been just and proper for the -Court below to have refused the delivery of the property upon stipulation, unless upon the express, condition, that the same should carry; interest, if so decreed by the Court. And in cases of this nature, it ap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>pears to us highly proper that such a clause should be inserted in the stipulation. But the present stipulation contains no such clause, and, therefore, so far .as respects the principal- and sureties, to decree it' upon that, would be to include a liability not justified by its terms. It is true, that interest might be decreed against Mr. Burke personally, not as the stipulator, but. as the claimant in the cause; but then it would be by way of damages for the detention or delay. In this view, it was a matter open for discussion upon the original appeal; and no interest having, been then asked for or granted, the claim is finally at rest. What was- matter formerly before the Court cannot. again be drawn into controversy!</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ADd_\">313.) ed\u2019</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"A5Y\">Duties to be deducted from the appraised value.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We have considered these questions thus far principle. But they have been, already decided by this Court. The case of <em>Rose v. Himely, </em>(5 <em>Cranch's Rep. </em>313.) is directly in point. The authority of that ease has not been in the slightest degree impugned, and, without overthrowing it, this Court'could not now entertain the present claims. We are hot disposed to doubt the entire correctness of that adjudication,</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">The question, in regard to the duties, admits of a very different consideration. The decree of restitution awards to the libellant the whole. property in controversy, and nothing more. Upon the face of the proceedings it appears, that the stipulation was taken for the appraised value of the property, including, the duties paid to the United States by the claimant. The amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>those duties never constituted any part of the property of the libellant, or those for whom he acts. Neither lie nor they have ever incurred the charge, or made the advance. And if it is now given to the libellant, it is a sum beyond the value of the property, which has been paid upon the importation without his aid, and without any injury to him or his principal. It is true, that m the hands of the claimant the property may be assumed to be Worth the whole appraised value; but that value includes not only the value of the property <em>perse, </em>but the amount of the duties already paid by-the claimant. In receiving it, the claimant has received no more of the libellant\u2019s property than the sum, deducting the duties' already paid. It has been said, that the property was wrongfully brought to the United States by the claimant, and, therefor?, he is not entitled to favour. This might be a satisfactory answer to any attempt of the claimant to charge the libellant with the duties as an equitable charge. But no such claim has been asserted; and if the Court were now to decree to the libellant the. whole sum in the stipulation, the decree in effect would require the, claimant to pay the duties to the libellant, as well as to the government. The original d\u00e9cree purports no such thing. It is confined to simple restitution of the property; and the proceeds substituted for that, are the net sum, deducting the duties, the market price, or. appraised value, being compounded of the original value and the duties. These observations are confined to a c\u00e1se, where the error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>stipulation is apparent, upon the face of the proceedings ; and-it would be dangerous, as well, as improper, to entertain the question, where the .eyidehe\u00e9 must be sought from extrinsic sources.-</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Upon, the whole, the decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed as to all things, except the dis-allowance of the claim for the deduction of duties, and as to that, it is reversed; and it is ordered that the libellant have restitution if the net appraised value, deducting the duties and that as to So much thereof as has not been, already paid to him, interest be allowed to bina at the rate of six per cent; per annum, from the time of th\u00e9 allowance of the present appeal, unto the final execution of this decree, and that the stipulation stand security therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Decree. This caus\u00e9 came,on, &amp;.c. on consideration whereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the decree of the Circuit Court in the premises be and hereby is affirmed, except ih disallowing the item stated in the petition of the, claimants, paid for duties, and except so far as is otherwise directed by this decree ; arid this Court, proceeding to pass such decree as the Circuit Court ought to have given, do hereby further order, adjudge and decree, that the said items of duties, amouriting to the sum of nineteen hundred , and forty-five dollars and fourteen cents, be.deducted from the appraised value of the property, as ascertained in the stipulation; and that the libellant have restitution of the residue of the appraised value; and that upon so rnueh of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>said residue as has not already been paid to the libellant, interest at the rate of six per centum per annum be allowed to the libellant, from the time of the present appeal until this present decree shall be executed upon mandate by the Circuit Court, together with all the costs of suit on the presentas on the original appeal; and that the said stipulation do stand as security therefor ; \u00a7nd that the Circuit Court do award execution upon the said stipulation, for the amount of principal and interest so ordered, adjudged and decreed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"b\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"><em> </em>The Diana, 3 <em>Wheat.
