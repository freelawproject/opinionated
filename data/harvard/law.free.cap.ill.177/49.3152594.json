Stat. 1874, p. 417,) which provides that if any intestate \u201cleaves a widow or surviving husband and no kindred, his or her estate shall descend to such widow or surviving husband,\u201d must be construed as including within its scope the term \u201cnext of kin,\u201d as used in clause 5 of the same section.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b49-9\" pgmap=\"49\">2.

They are substantially as follows: Ella M. Lockwood, the late wife of appellant, William E. Lockwood, died intestate on the 25th day of February, 1897, at her residence in Quincy, Illinois, seized in fee of all of the lands in controversy, leaving no child or children or descendants of a child or children, and no parent, brother or sister, or descendants of any such, surviving, but leaving her said husband surviving, and also leaving the complainants, George A. Moffett, an uncle, and Ann B. West and Emily C. Sibert, her two aunts, as her sole and only next of kin, surviving, all of her other kin and relatives being cousins of the first or still more remote degree. The circuit court found that the uncle and two aunts inherited and owned, and decreed to them, an equal half of all of the lands in controversy, and decreed to appellant the other half of the lands, and also a homestead and dower out of the half decreed to said three complainants. From that decree William R. Lockwood, the surviving husband, appeals to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-3\" pgmap=\"50\">The errors relied on for a reversal of the decree are, that the circuit court erred in finding that said complainants have any interest in the lands in controversy, and in decreeing to them an equal half of the said lands, or any interest therein, and in not dismissing their bill for want of equity; and also in not holding and decreeing that the appellant was and is the sole owner of all of the lands in controversy.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-4\" pgmap=\"50\">W. L. Vandeventer, and S. B. Montgomery, for appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-5\" pgmap=\"50\">A fair construction of the Statute of Descent clearly indicates a settled policy by the legislature to favor the immediate family of the intestate by providing for the devolution of intestate estates in the following order: First, to children and their descendants; second, to widows and surviving husbands; third, to parents, brothers and sisters and their descendants, the descendants taking by representation; fourth, to the next of kin more remote than parents, brothers and sisters.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\" pgmap=\"50\">It is a familiar rule that where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, the one which comports with the policy of the State must be adopted rather than that which runs counter to such policy.

A construction leading to such an absurdity is not to be attributed to the legislature, and such a construction must be adopted, if possible, eliminating and avoiding such absurdity. People v. Gaulter, 149 Ill. 47; Perry County v. Jefferson County, 94 id. 214; People v. Hoffman, 97 id. 234.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-4\" pgmap=\"51\">A. C.

On the other hand, the courts, counsel and suitors have, from the creation of this State, uniformly acted upon the assumption that the surviving spouse took only one-half the realty where there were kindred of the intestate living, other than non-resident aliens and those tracing relationship through them. Such was the uniformly accepted construction up to the act of 1877, under which appellant claims. Tyson v. Postlethwaite, 13 Ill. 728; Tyler v. Tyler, 19 id. 151; Lessley v.

Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, That estates, both real and personal, of residents and non-resident, proprietors in this State dying intestate, or whose estates, or any part thereof, shall be deemed and taken as intestate estate, after all just debts and claims against such estates are fully paid, shall descend to and be distributed in manner following, to-wit:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-9\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201cFirst\u2014To his or her children and their descendants in equal parts, the descendants of the deceased child or grandchild taking the share of their deceased parents in equal parts among them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-10\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201cSecond\u2014When there is no child of the intestate nor descendant of such child, and no widow or surviving husband, then to the parents, brothers and sisters of the deceased and their descendants, in equal parts among them, allowing to each of the parents, if living, a child\u2019s part, or to the survivor of them, if one be dead, a double portion; and if there is no parent living, then to the brothers and sisters of the intestate, and their descendants.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-11\" pgmap=\"52(20) 53(65)\">\u201cThird\u2014When there is a widow or surviving husband, and no child or children or descendants of a child or children of the intestate, then (after the payment of all just debts) one-half of the real estate and the whole of the personal estate shall descend to such widow or surviving husband as an absolute estate forever, and the other half of the real estate shall descend as in other cases where there is no child or children or descendants of a child or children.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b53-5\" pgmap=\"53\">\u201cFourth\u2014When there is a widow or a surviving husband, and also a child or children or descendants of such child or children of the intestate, the widow or surviving husband shall receive, as his or her absolute personal estate, one-third of all the personal estate of the intestate.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b53-6\" pgmap=\"53\">\u201cFifth\u2014If there is no child of the intestate or descendant of such child, and no parent, brother or sister or descendant of such parent, brother or sister, and no widow or surviving husband, then such estate shall descend in equal parts to the next of kin to the intestate in equal degree, (computing by the rules of the civil law,) and there shall be no representation among collaterals, except with the descendants of brothers and sisters of the intestate; and in no case shall there be any distinction between the kindred of the whole and the half blood.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b53-7\" pgmap=\"53\">\u201cSixth\u2014If any intestate leaves a widow or surviving husband and no kindred, his or her estate shall descend to such widow or surviving husband.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b53-8\" pgmap=\"53\">\u201cSeventh\u2014If the intestate leaves no kindred, and no widow or husband, his or her estate shall escheat to and vest in the county in which said real or personal estate, or the greater portion thereof, is situated.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b53-9\" pgmap=\"53(80) 54(140)\">The question to be determined is, to whom does the real estate of Ella M. Lockwood, the intestate, go, she leaving no child or children or descendants of a child or children, and no parent, brother or sister or descendants of a parent, brother or sister, surviving, but leaving William R. Lockwood, her husband, surviving, and complainants, George A. Moffett, an uncle, and Ann B. West and Emily C. Sibert, her aunts, as her sole and only next of kin, surviving? Under clause 3 of section 1, after the payment of all debts one-half of the real estate and the whole of the personal estate shall descend to such widow or surviving' husband as an absolute estate forever, and the other half of the real estate shall descend as in other cases where there is no child or children or descendants of a child or children. As to the one-half of the real estate, there can be no question but that the husband, William R. Lockwood, inherited the same as an absolute estate. But the controversy here is over the other half, the uncle and two aunts, the appellees, as next of kin, claiming one-half of all the real estate of the intestate, Ella M. Lockwood, while the surviving husband, William R. Lockwood, claims all the real estate.</p> <p id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">In construing statutes the intention of the law-giver is to be deduced from a view of the whole and every part of the statute taken and compared together. (1 Kent\u2019s Com. 462.) The ordinance of July 13, 1787, for the government of the territory north-west of the Ohio river, relating to the descent of intestate estates, saved, in all cases, to the widow of the intestate her third part of the real estate for life arid one-third part of the personal estate. (Purple\u2019s Real Estate Stat. 30, 31.) The statute remained the same until the act of January 23, 1829, which gave the widow of the intestate one-half of the real estate when there was no child or children or descendants of a child or children of the intestate. While the widow was provided for in case of the death of the husband intestate leaving no child or children or their descendants, there was no provision for the husband in case of the death of the wife intestate leaving no child or children or their descendants. The legislature, by an act in 1843, (Rev. Stat. 1845, chap. 109, sec. 47,) extended this right of the wife to the surviving husband, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b54-6\" pgmap=\"54(33) 55(11)\">\u201cSec. 47. When any feme covert shall die intestate, leaving no child or children or descendants of a child or children, then one-half of the real estate of the decedent shall descend and go to her husband, as his exclusive estate forever.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b55-5\" pgmap=\"55\">At common law collateral kin took to the exclusion of a surviving spouse. Indeed, the spouse never was regarded as \u201cnext of kin\u201d or one of the \u201ckindred.\u201d In Townsend v. Radcliffe, 44 Ill. 446, this court said: \u201cHe [the husband] can not claim to be next of kin to his wife, for in no sense is he such, nor is the wife next of kin to the husband. \u2014 Watt v. Watt, 3 Ves. Jr. 247; Garrick v. Lord Camden, 14 id. 386; Bailey v. Wright, 18 id. 49; Kent\u2019s Com. 136, (5th. ed.)\u201d</p> <p id=\"b55-6\" pgmap=\"55\">It is contended that under the sixth clause of the Statute of Descent appellant, Lockwood, took the entire real estate. The sixth clause directs that if there be a widow or surviving husband and no kindred, the entire real and personal estate shall descend to the widow or surviving husband. In construing this section, appellant insists that the word \u201ckindred,\u201d in this sixth clause, should be restricted to \u201cparents, brothers and sisters and their descendants,\u201d thus excluding next of kin (other than those named) in favor of the surviving spouse. He cites Webber v. City of Chicago, 148 Ill. 313, \u201cthat where an enumeration of specific things is followed by general words or phrases the latter are held to refer to things of the same kind as those specified.\u201d But in the same connection we further said: \u201cBut this is only one of many rules of construction, all of which are to be employed for the attainment of the same end, viz., that of ascertaining the intention of the legislature or the contracting parties, as expressed in the statute or contract sought to be construed; and where, from the whole instrument, a larger intent may be gathered, the rule under consideration will not be applied in such manner as to defeat such larger intent.\u2014Bishop on Contracts, sec. 409.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b55-7\" pgmap=\"55(37) 56(242)\">By application of the rule that a general expression may be limited by the specific words preceding, appellant would make the word \u201ckindred,\u201d in said sixth clause of section 1, mean only \u201cparents, children, brothers and sisters, and their descendants.\u201d This construction, in view of the language used, cannot be sustained. The word \u201ckindred\u201d is used in a larger sense, and must be held to include the phrase \u201cnext of kin.\u201d The phrase \u201cnext of kin\u201d is used in the fifth clause of the statute, and if \u201ckindred,\u201d as used in clause 6, is to be limited to such kindred as are specified and provided for in the preceding clauses, then \u201cnext of kin\u201d must be included as among the \u201ckindred\u201d so expressly specified and provided for. As appellee says, if the word \u201ckindred,\u201d as used in the sixth clause of the statute, must, for the reasons alleged by appellant, be held to mean only \u201cparents, children, brothers and sisters, and their descendants,\u201d then for the same reasons must the word \u201ckindred,\u201d as used in the seventh clause, receive the same construction, because, as said in Reeve on Descents, 32, \u201cthe same words ought certainly to receive the same construction in both parts of the statute.\" If under clause 6 the spouse inherits all the realty, to the exclusion of \u201cnext of kin,\u201d then it follows that under clause 7, there being no surviving spouse, the county would take by escheat the whole of the property to the exclusion of the \u201cnext of kin,\u201d which would cause the disinheritance of \u201cnext of kin,\u201d in all cases, and is inconsistent and irreconcilable with section 5.</p> <p id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56(131) 57(101)\">In Wunderle v. Wunderle, 144 Ill. 40, which was a bill filed asking for a partition of 116 acres of land, Alexander Wunderle, the owner of the land, died intestate, leaving no issue, but leaving him surviving a widow and one brother and sister, who were non-resident aliens at the time of the intestate\u2019s decease. This court said (p. 67): \u201cInasmuch, therefore, as the appellants cannot inherit from their deceased brother by reason of their alienage, the interest in the land which would otherwise have gone to them descends to the next of kin competent to take under the statutes of Illinois. We are of opinion that under the facts of this case, as presented by the record, the appellee must be regarded as such next of kin. Our Statute of Descent provides, that \u2018if any intestate leaves a widow or surviving husband and no kindred, his or her estate shall descend to such widow or surviving husband.\u2019 (Rev. Stat. chap. 89, sec. 1, clause 6.) The kindred here referred to are evidently such kindred as are capable of inheriting. It not appearing that the deceased had any other kindred than his non-resident alien brother and sister, his widow is entitled to take the whole of the land in controversy.\u201d The construction placed upon the word \u201ckindred\u201d in this case is contrary to the construction claimed by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">The case of Beavan v. Went, 155 Ill. 592, cited by appellant as a case where this question was considered, is not authority, for the reason that this question was not before the court. It was a mere dictum of the judge who wrote the opinion, and he expressly states that he expresses no decided opinion upon the question, but places the decision upon another ground.</p> <p id=\"b57-6\" pgmap=\"57(196) 58(25)\">The act of 1877, which added to the concluding portion of the third clause of the statute these words, namely, \u201cand the other half of the real estate shall descend \"as in other cases where there is no child or children or descendants of a child or children,\u201d must be regarded as merely declaratory of the law as it had previously been acted upon,\u2014that the surviving spouse took only one-half of the realty where there were kindred of the intestate living, other than non-resident aliens. In construing the words, \u201cand the other half of the real estate shall descend as in other cases,\u201d they must be held to mean, that as under clause 3 there is a spouse surviving, the other cases must be those where there is no spouse. In examining the statute to see which of the clauses provides for the \u201cother cases\u201d referred to in clause 3, we are necessarily limited to those clauses where there is no spouse. Clauses 2, 3 and 5 cover the only \u201ccases\u201d of intestacy with no lineal descendants surviving, and, therefore, when clause 3 refers to \u201cother cases where there is no child or children or descendants of a child or children,\u201d it evidently refers to the cases provided for by clauses 2 and 5.</p> <p id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58\">The Statute of Descent also makes a distinction.between the inheritance by a surviving spouse of a legitimate and that of an illegitimate intestate. In the case of the surviving spouse of a legitimate intestate, under clause 3 of section 1, as we have seen, the surviving spouse takes one-half of the real estate and the whole of the personal. Clause 3 of section 2 provides: \u201cAn illegitimate intestate leaving no child or descendant of a child, the whole estate, personal and real, shall descend to and absolutely vest in the widow or surviving husband.\u201d If the legislature had intended to give all the realty to the surviving spouse of the legitimate intestate, is it probable they would have said he or she should take half? But if such was the intention, would not the legislature have said, as in the case of the surviving spouse of the illegitimate intestate, he or she should take the whole of the real estate?</p> <p id=\"b58-6\" pgmap=\"58\">Under clause 6, where the intestate leaves a surviving husband and no kindred, her estate descends to the husband. This is the section under which appellant claims all of the real estate in question; but it is manifest that his claim cannot be sustained, for the reason that the intestate left kindred. We are therefore of opinion that appellant did not inherit all the real estate, but that he inherits one-half as his absolute estate and the other-half must descend to the \u201cnext of kin,\u201d-\u2014the appellees,\u2014 under the third clause of section 1 of the statute, subject' to the dower and homestead of appellant in said half.</p> <p id=\"b58-7\" pgmap=\"58\">The decree of the circuit court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b58-8\" pgmap=\"58\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
