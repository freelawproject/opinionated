Defendant says and charges, that -at the time of making said agreement to arbitrate, she was \u25a0incapable in law of making or entering into the same, being \u2022then and at the time of the making thereof- a feme covert, the wife of Joseph P. Taylor, since deceased, and who never gave his assent or sanction to the same ; \u201d and that the agreement, the award and the judgment were void, <em>&amp;c.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">To this answer the defendant in error excepted, and the exception was sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">This ruling of the Court is embodied in a bill of exceptions.

Murray, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8s4\">I. The judgment on the \u25a0award was final and conclusive, and as the same was not appealed from cannot now be enquired into. (16 Tex. R. 574.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\">II. A petition for <em>scire facias, </em>to revive a judgment, is not necessary. (Hopkins v. Howard, 12 Tex. R. 7.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b455-10\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aag\">Defendant in error sought by <em>scire facias </em>to \u2022revive a judgment against plaintiff in error, who pleaded her coverture at the time judgment was rendered, and that her husband did not consent to the arbitration upon the award in which the judgment was founded. The Court below held her plea insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In the case of Bullock v. Ballew, it is said that \u201c in an action on a judgment no defence can be admitted which existed prior to the judgment.\u201d (9 Tex. R. 498.) This rule relates to such matters as would render the judgment defective or erroneous, or voidable, but not to such as would render the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ment absolutely void. (Hopkins v. Howard, 12 Tex. R. 7 <em>; </em>McFadden v. Lockhart, 7 Tex. R. 573.) Her act done under coverture may be voidable, and though her coverture would excuse her not having made her defence at the time the judgment was rendered, yet until such judgment is avoided, set aside, or annulled, by some proceeding, she cannot resist the enforcement of process upon such judgment. (North v. Howard, 5 Tex. R. 297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The object of this proceeding by <em>scire </em>facias, is to procure the process of execution. (Bullock v. Ballew, 9 Tex. R. 499,. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">If it should be thought permissible to entertain a plea of this nature in this proceeding, it would have been incumbent on her to have stated, in the shape of a cross-action, all such facts as were necessary to show, affirmatively, that the judgment should not have been rendered against her. This she has not done. The facts stated by her, to-wit: her coverture, and the want of her husband\u2019s consent, would, under some circumstances, be sufficient, under others not.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The exceptions to the plea were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
