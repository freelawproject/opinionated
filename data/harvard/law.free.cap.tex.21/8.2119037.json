Mary A. Hubert. In 1824 Samuel Miller received a grant for a league of land on the west side of the Brazos river, at the mouth of New Years creek, and conveyed the same, in August, 1837, to Bartlett. The field-notes of said grant were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">Beginning at the Brazos river, at the upper corner of the league of John Elam, which is a mound at the distance of eight varas from an elm, S. 40 \u00b0 W., and six varas from another elm, N. 30 \u00b0 W.; thence 3543 varas<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> west to a mound at the distance of 4 varas from a cedar, S. 20 \u00b0 E., and 6 varas from a pecan, 45 \u00b0 W.; and thence N. 5000 varas to another mound ; and thence E. 7310 varas to the Brazos river, to the lower corner of William Gates\u2019 league : thence with the meanders of the river to the place of beginning, comprehending one league of land, bounded on the east by the Brazos river <em>} </em>on the south by the league of John Elam ; on the north by the league of William Gates ; and on the west by vacant land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">In 1831 Adam Lawrence received a grant of a quarter of a league, and in October, 1837, conveyed the same to F. W. Hubert, the husband of the defendant. The field-notes of said grant were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Situated upon New Years creek, and adjoining the lands of Samuel Miller and Gibson Kuykendall, and from an elm which serves for a mound, which is situated upon the right bank of said creek, at the mouth of Little Cedar creek, run a line west 300 varas to a mound; and thence south 5430 varas to the northern line of Gibson Kuykendall\u2019s land, to a mound; thence north, 80 \u00b0 east, and following Kuykendall\u2019s line 1330 varas, to Miller\u2019s west-end line ; thence north, following Miller\u2019s said line, 3675 varas, to the north-west corner of Miller\u2019s land; thence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>east following the northern line of Miller\u2019s league, 847 varas, to New Years creek ; thence with the meanders of said creek to the place of beginning ; comprehending one quarter of a league of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">From the beginning corner of the Miller league to the mouth of New Years creek, say 3000 varas, the main course of the river was north; and from the mouth of New Years creek to the upper corner of said league, the main course of the river was east north east. The main course of New Years creek was north west. The mouth of Cedar creek was about 2500 varas from the point where the upper line of the Miller league crossed said creek. These particulars, taken in connection with the field-notes, will enable the reader to make a diagram of the two surveys, accurate enough for the purposes of this report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">It will be perceived that Lawrence lay in the rear of Miller, and called for the back line of Miller. The issue in this suit related solely to this boundary line, running north and south, and the quantity of land in dispute was about 320 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">The facts and evidence were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">Bartlett Sims, for plaintiffs, testified that he was an authorized surveyor in 1824, and made the Miller survey ; that he meandered the river on the east side before he made said survey ; that after meandering the river, he commenced at the Gates\u2019 corner (the upper corner of Miller\u2019s survey,) and run all round what he supposed to be the whole league of land, but that in. closing the survey he found that there was not a sufficient quantity of land enclosed within the lines.; that he then commenced at the lower corner and extended the line 400 or 500 varas further west, and then made a call for the back line, to correspond, but did not run it; that he did not \u2022recollect the corner trees ; that he marked the extension of the lower line ; that he ran it through prairie, so that there was not much marking to do ; that he stuck down a stake in a swamp-dogwood thicket, in the edge of a prairie for the south west corner, and did not mark any bearing trees, that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>recollect of; that he did not run or mark the extension of the upper line, nor the back line corresonding therewith ; that the bearing trees called for in the field-notes, at the N. W. and S. W. corners, must be the calls of the corners as first made ; that he thought the error was in not erasing the call for bearing trees at the corners as first made, when corrected ; that the back line furthest west was the true boundary of the Miller league.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">Horatio Ohrisman, for defendant, testified that he had been a Public Surveyor in the time of the colony, and made the original survey of the Adam Lawrence quarter of a league ; that he first surveyed these quarters of a league for Gibson Kuykendall, which lay partly in the rear of the Miller league, at the lower end of the latter ; that running round from below, he established the N. W. corner of the Kuykendall, and from his calculations he found how far he would have to run east to intersect the Miller survey, which had been made by Sims ; he then run east the distance at which he ought to have intersected the Miller survey, and at this point made Kuykendall\u2019s corner ; that before establishing this corner, he looked for the line of Miller\u2019s survey, but could not find it. Witness stated that in making the survey for Adam Lawrence\u2019s quarter, he commenced at the mouth of Little Cedar creek, and meandered down New Years creek, until he intersected the north boundary line of the survey of Miller\u2019s league, which had been previously made by Bartlett Sims ; he then followed the Miller survey west until he came to the N. W. corner of Miller\u2019s league; that the north line of the Miller survey was plainly marked, when he followed it, between New Years creek and the N. W. corner, and agreeing with the field-notes, of the Miller league, which had been furnished him from the Land Office ; from this corner there was no line running west; but from this N. W. corner of Miller\u2019s survey he followed a plainly marked line due S., far enough .to ascertain that it was the western line of the Miller league. Witness then went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>where he had commenced the survey at the mouth of Little Cedar creek, and having the meanders of New Years creek, and the distance from the point where Miller\u2019s north line crossed New if ears creek to the N. W. corner of Miller\u2019s survey, being ascertained by his measurement, and having Sims\u2019 call for the course and length of Miller\u2019s western line, and likewis e having the course and distances of the surveys lying south of the survey he was then making ; he then made his calculations for the Lawrence survey, and from the mouth of Little Cedar creek run west a sufficient distance, and made the N. W. corner of Lawrence\u2019s survey, from which he run south to Kuykendall\u2019s line, where he made the S. W. corner of Lawrence\u2019s survey, and stopped : it not being necessary for him to run again the western line of the Miller survey, which had been fun by Sims, and the north line of the Kuykendall survey, which had been run by himself; but calling to run with the lines of those two surveys, he closed the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">D. Parker, for plaintiffs, testified that he was the County Surveyor of Washington county ; that by order of Court he had surveyed the Miller league, and returned a plot and field-notes of his survey ; (which was, in evidence ;) that he commenced his survey at the S. E. corner of said league, on the Brazos river, where he found the course as described in his field-notes ; that he run west on a plainly marked line\u2014marks having the appearance of an old survey\u20142680 varas, where he found trees marked as an old corner ; one a cedar and the other a pecan ; those trees, from their marks, seemed to be bearing trees, but \"he found no stake or mound; he then continued 3300 varas; to find this distance, he first went to a hackleberry, said to be Gibson Kuykendall\u2019s corner, and run south ; and the two lines intersected at the said distance of 3300 varas, which is in a field and no corner found. From this point to said hackleberry there are but few marks on the line; distance, as stated in his field-notes, 1325 varas ; and from this point\u2014the hackleberry\u2014he found no line running north. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>He then returned to the cedar and pecan aforesaid, which had the appearance of the trees described in the field-notes, by which he run out the league ; and from this corner\u2014at the cedar and pecan\u2014he found an old line plainly marked, running due north, which measured 4900 varas, where he came to the end of the old line, and found an elm and a cedar marked as bearing trees, which were also named as N. W. corner of the Miller league in the said field-notes, by which he made his survey. He examined and could find no line from this point running west, but he found a line running east, which he did not measure, but called for the length of said line running east, from the measurement of O. H. P. Garret, who had previously run said line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">Defendant proved that the lines of the Lawrence survey were plainly marked, (counting as one the line first run and marked by Sims as the back line of the Miller survey,) but it appeared that part of the south line, that is from Kuykendall\u2019s corner to the line first marked by Sims as Miller\u2019s back line, was marked in 1843, by Nathan Clampet, then County Surveyor, surveying for F. W. Hubert. The Miller survey, if bounded by the back line first marked by Sims, would only contain about 3900 acres; the Lawrence survey, as claimed by the defendant, would contain about a quarter of a league.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">Gibson Kuykendall testified, that he was along when the original survey was made ; and he understood at the time, that his N. E. corner was on Miller\u2019s back line ; that they marked a small hackleberry as a bearing tree, for said corner, in the prairie, near the cedar brake. It was in proof that the N. W. corner of the Miller league, as first established by Sims, was a few varas within the defendant\u2019s field.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The following instructions were asked by plaintiffs, and all given except the 4th and 7th:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">1st. That unless they believe the inner or eastern one of the two lines was marked and adopted by the surveyor, as the western line of Miller\u2019s league, they are not bound or authorized to adopt it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>2nd. That if the jury believe from the evidence, that Sims .made a mistake in surveying the Miller league, he had the right and it was his duty to correct it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">3rd. That the diagram submitted to the jury is competent to show the true situation of the lands in dispute, and it is competent for the jury to compare the agreement of the surrounding surveys, to come to a correct conclusion as to which is the true line, and that the corresponding calls of the surrounding surveys are competent evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">4th.' That if the jury believe from the diagram, that the line beginning at No. 1 and running to No. 3, corresponds with the calls of Miller and Kuykendall, and that the line from 1 to D corresponds with Miller\u2019s and Elam or Bartlett\u2019s survey, and that the line from 3 to 8 corresponds with Miller\u2019s and Kuykendall\u2019s surveys, but that the line from 1 to 2 disagrees with all or many of these, it is a circumstance that may be taken into the account to determine that the puter one is the true line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">5th. That unless there is testimony to show it, the jury have no right to presume that there is vacant land between the surveys. That the law required that there should be none left. That the presumption is that the surveyor pursued the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-8\">6th. That the figure or shape of the survey can not be altered, unless the proof shows the necessity for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">7th. That the deed from the Government to Adam Lawrence, and that from Lawrence to Hubert, having Kuykendall\u2019s corner on Miller\u2019s line, for the corner of the land, of defendant, if that corner is identified, you can not extend the line of Lawrence or Hubert further east than that of Kuykendall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-10\">The following instructions were given at the request of the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-11\">1st. That the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title, and must show that the land claimed is included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>within the lines established by the surveyor, when the survey was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">2nd. That the lines actually run and the corners actually made must govern the survey, whether it corresponds with the lines called for in the grant or not, or whether the land included in the grant is too great or too small.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">3rd. If Gibson Kuykendall\u2019s survey was made after the-Miller survey, the lines or corners of the Kuykendall survey can have no influence over the Miller survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-7\">4th. That the marked lines and corners of Miller\u2019s survey govern and control, without regard to any effect they may have on the quantity or shape of the Miller league.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-8\">5th. That by the law it was made the duty of the surveyor-to mark the lines and corners of all surveys, and if the surveyor-made a mistake in the first survey, it was his duty to mark the line as corrected ; and if he failed to mark the lines and corners as corrected, the plaintiff can not claim beyond the-line actually marked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-9\">6th. If in correcting the survey, the surveyor extended the-lower line, but called for the bearing trees first marked, the-plaintiff can not claim beyond the corner trees established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-10\">7th. That a grant is to be governed by its distinct and visible location calls, as marked upon the land, in preference to quantity, course, distance, map or anything else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-11\">8th. If the jury believe that a line was marked for Miller\u2019s western line, it is the true line, and must govern, whether it corresponds with the distance called for or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-12\">9th. That the surveyor who originally surveyed the land could not adopt as the western line of Miller\u2019s survey, any other line than the one actually marked by him, unless he actually run and marked another line, if it were susceptable of being marked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-13\">10th. If the trees marked as bearing trees and called for in the grant are found on the ground, they show the true corner, whether they correspond with the distance or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>11th. If the trees marked as bearing trees and called for in the grant, as at one end of the western line, and no bearing trees are called for at the other end of the line, then the bearing trees called for and found on the ground,.show the true location of the western line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">12th. That it is immaterial whether the defendant know that the plaintiff claimed the land in dispute before he purchased ; the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover unless they show that the land in dispute is included within their grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">13th. That it was competent for the surveyor to correct his survey, and it was his duty to do so when found to be wrong ; but corners and lines called for by him, but never run -or marked on the ground, are not to control or govern the lines and corners actually run and marked upon the ground ; but the lines actually marked upon the ground are to govern the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">Verdict and judgment for defendant. Motion for a new trial overruled, &lt;fcc. Bill of exceptions as follows : Be it remembered that on the trial of this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel offered to read the Interrogatories and Answers of Murdock McKinnon, on file among the papers in the cause, and read the first interrogatory and answer, without objection being made, and then offered to read the second interrogatory and answer which were objected to by the defendant\u2019s coun. sel. 1st. Because the interrogatory was leading; 2nd. Because the answer is not responsive to the interrogatory ; which objection was sustained and said second interrogatory and answer : \u201c Do you know or did you hear Hubert admit that Bartlett informed him, that he (Bartlett) owned the Miller league, and that there was an open or unmarked line, and that part of the land Lawrence was pretending to sell was his, (Bartlett\u2019s,) and part of the Miller league ? \u201d If yea, please to state what Hubert said and did on the receipt of the information. Answer\u2014I do, Mr. Hubert told me that Bartlett had informed him that there was an open or unmarked line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>between them, and that they had agreed to have a friendly suit to decide the matter ; and Mr. Hubert sent for Mr. Lawrence to come and show him the corners. Mr. Lawrence came over and I went out in company with them to the south-west corner of Lawrence\u2019s survey, and from there with Kuykendall\u2019s line to a hackleberry on the edge of the prairie, which Lawrence said was his corner \u201d\u2014were ruled out by the Court and the plaintiffs refused permission to read said second interrogatory and answer, to which ruling of the Court the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepts, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">The first interrogatory to said witness, and his answer thereto, were as follows : Interrogatory 1st. Were you acquainted with E. W. Hubert at the time he purchased land in Washington county of A. Lawrence ? If yea, please to state what information you may know of Hubert\u2019s having a conflict with lessee Bartlett, before he completed his trade. Answer to interrogatory 1st. I was\u2014I had charge of Mr. Hubert\u2019s plantation at the time he made the purchase of land from A. Lawrence. Mr. Hubert instructed me to take the hands and go down, and Mr. Thomas Stevans would inform me where to' commence work. Mr. Stevans directed me to the place, and on the next day after I went on the place, Mr. McEadden brought me a written notice not to intrude on the Miller league. I gave Mr. Hubert the notice as soon as he came down, which was in a day or two afterwards.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-6\"><em>A. M. </em>Lewis, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akc\">I. The Court erred in ruling out the the testimony of McKinnon. It prov\u00e9s, 1st. That defendant\u2019s intestate knew when he bought, that the line of the Miller league was not well defined ; and 2nd. That the vendor of Hubert showed the same hackberry that plaintiffs claimed as his true title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">II. The testimony of Sims shows that there was a mistake in' the survey as first made, and that he immediately cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>rected it, and extended the lower line some four or five hundred varas further west, and planted a corner. Kuykendall shows that one of his corners was on the line of the Miller league, and that the hackberry was a bearing tree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">TTT. Take the statement of Sims, Kuykendall, Clampett, Parker, and that part of McKinnon\u2019s ruled out, and the conclusion is irresistible, that the land was actually surveyed for Miller as he contends. It is true Sims did not testify to the marking of this line, but he does to a corner at the proper distance, and Parker found some marks on it. Kuykendall had his corner established on this line and the hackberry was a bearing tree. Lawrence showed Hubert this same hack-berry as his line; and Clampett surveying for Hubert, found the hackberry, and actually marked the line from there to the old line that had been surveyed for Miller.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-6\">Add to all this, that if the finding for the defendant in the Court below was proper, it is to falsify two of the corners of the Kuykendall survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">It may be said that the line contended for by the appellants, was not plainly marked. We answer that it was so plainly marked that the same Surveyor who made Lawrence\u2019s survey found it twice in making Kuykendall's ; so plainly marked that Lawrence found it when called on by Hubert to show his line, and so plainly marked that Campett found the same corner in 1843 ; and so plainly marked that when Parker was directed, he found a part of the line. It is true that the S. W. corner could not be found, because there had been a field opened where it should lie, and so of the N. W. corner; it is in the field of the appellee, and a part of the line runs through prairie.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-8\"><em>J. Sayles, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO\">I. But a single legal proposition is presented by the record in this case, viz: Do the'marked lines and corners of a survey control, when they are variant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the calls as to distance ? This question is settled in the affirmative by the decision of this Court in this case and in others, and is the settled law in every State in the Union. (Hubert v. Bartlett, 9 Tex.

Thomas, 16 Id. 74; Bolton v. Lann, 16 Id. 96.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">II. The question of fact, whether the western boundary line of the Miller league, as claimed by the plaintiffs, was the marked and true line, was fairly submitted to the jury ; and their verdict would not be disturbed, unless against the weight of evidence. (19 Tex. R. 97.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">Sims states that in extending the lower line, he stuck a stake in a dog-wood thicket at the end of the extension ; but he did not in any way mark the extension, and in his corrected field-notes, called for the bearing trees originally marked. Even if the bearing trees had not been called for in the field-notes, they would have determined the corner, being a more permanent and notorious indication of the true corner, than a stake set in a dog-wood thicket. \u201c Where a grant called for \u201c a stake at a given distance, 'and it was proved that a white <em>\u201c </em>oak, one hundred and thirty poles beyond the distance called \u201c for, was marked as the corner, it was held that the white \u201c oak, though not called for in the grant, was the true corner \u201c of the grant.\u201d (Holland &amp; Bridges, v. Overton\u2019s Lessee, 4 Yerg. R. 482.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\">It is said that the hackberry, the corner of Kuykendall\u2019s survey, determines the true western line of the Miller survey. But it appears from Chriesman\u2019s testimony that he called for the Miller western, line, obtaining its locality from calculation? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and .that when he marked the hackberry, he looked for the line of Miller\u2019s survey, but could not find it. In truth, the hackberry is not upon the line claimed by the plaintiffs. Although, arguendo, they only claim to the line formed by the hackberry ; thus themselves abandoning the call for distance, and claiming to go only to a line determined by a subsequent survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">By the law in force at the time the survey was made, the Surveyor was required to establish the corners and lines clearly, for the purpose of showing the locality of the tract, so that subsequent Surveyors could find the lines with certainty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">III. McKinnon\u2019s testimony was properly excluded. The interrogatory was leading and <em>suggestive; </em>the testimony, however, if received, could not have affected the result.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> So in the transcript; but see report of same case in a former trial, (9 Tex. R. 100,) where this number is stated as 3143, which is more consistent with other testimony in the case, although not sufficient to embrace the proper quantity of land.\u2014Reps.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-7\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">The question in this case is, which is the true western boundary line of the Miller league: the one which the Surveyor Sims ran, in making the survey ? or the one which he called for by course and distance and did not run ? It is now shown by Sims, the Surveyor, that he completed the survey; and finding, upon calculation, that it contained too little land, he corrected the survey by extending the Southern boundary line, four or five hundred varas, and at that point putting down a stake. He did not make a regular corner there, by making bearing trees or calling for any objects; but in designating that corner, (the south-west,) he called for the bearing trees which he made in making the survey. So with the north-west corner. The western boundary of the corrected line was not run ; nor was the extension line of the northern boundary run.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">After making the survey, then, with plainly marked lines and established corners, the Surveyor sought to correct and enlarge it, by simply running out one line from a corner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tract, establishing no corner there, but calling for that distance in his field-notes. Still the field notes called for the bearing trees at the corners established in the original survey. This was in fact no correction of the survey, at all. The object of marking the lines and establishing corners of land, is to fix ascertainable boundaries, and give notice of appropriation to all who have access to the field-notes. In both of these, was this correction wanting. The principles involved in this case were settled by this Court, when it was here previously. (Hubert v. Bartlett, 9 Tex. R. 97.) There is nothing in the case, as now presented, to change the result then arrived at.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The evidence, objected to by the appellee, was properly ruled riot to be admissible. The testimony, sought to be introduced, was wholly immaterial to the true issue in the case, as above stated. And had it been material the question was leading, and part of the answer was irresponsive; and it was therefor liable to the objections made to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The charge of the Court was in accordance with the Opinion of this Court previously delivered : and is believed to have been sufficient and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
