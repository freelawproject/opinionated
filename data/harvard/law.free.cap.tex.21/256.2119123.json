The balance to be secured by a lien or mortgage on the building when completed, in case it was completed to the satisfaction of the committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">The bond of McHugh was without date, but it was approved by a majority of the committee on the 17th September, 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">Committee paid September 13, 1851, \u201c \u201c September 20, 1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">\u201c \u201c September 27, 1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">\u201c \u201c October \u2014, 1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">\u201c \u201c October 4,1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">\u201c \u201c October 11, 1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\">\u201c \u201c October 25, 1851,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-14\">$240 00 259 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-15\">77 00\u2014 $576 00 755 00 150 00 100 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-16\">150 00\u2014 1,155 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-17\">By November 11, 1851, the Committee had paid, $1,731 00 November 11, 1851, committee gave notice that the work was not being done in a satisfactory manner in some particulars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-18\">The work of McHugh was continued, and the payments by the Committee, as appears, reached the sum of $4,753 45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-19\">On the 20th September, 1852, the committee, by resolution, declared the contract forfeited by the appellee. He, however, kept possession of the building in its uncompleted condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>his family residing in it until 1854, when appellants took proceedings and had him turned out of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">All the testimony on the trial, for both the appellee and appellants, concurs in establishing the fact that the work was done in a manner to render it almost worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The appellants offered to prove by the depositions of Anderson, Goff and Miller the character and value of the work, &amp;e., on the building, and also by the testimony of Dubois to the same effect, the material facts of which were ruled out by the Court, upon the ground that these witnesses were not particularly familiar with the kind of work to which their evidence related; to which the appellants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">There was a verdict and judgment for appellee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>Shenuood &amp; </em>Goddard, for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ach\">contend that,</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">I.

So a, man may testify as to the value of cotton without being a merchant or farmer. Want of familiarity with the subject is an objection to the weight, rather than to the admissibility, of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It is contended that the evidence was properly excluded, because the value of the unfinished building was not the true criterion, as to the amount that McHugh was entitled to recover, but the contract price, less what it would take to finish the building, was the true criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Suppose that the work had been done so badly that the house never could be finished according 'to contract, then of course the rule contended for could not obtain. Suppose also a very inconsiderable portion of the whole work was done.( then the rule suggested would be a very indirect mode of arriving at the rights of the party. If, however, the work contracted to be done was considerably advanced towards a completion, and, there was no complaint that the work was not in accordance with the contract, so far as it was completed, then the rule would be correct, as being the most direct way of estimating the value of the plaintiff's services, &amp;c. (Hilliard v. Crabtree's Adm\u2019r, 11 Tex. R. 264.) That the work was done in the time, and in a workmanlike manner, as stipulated for in the contract, cannot be plausibly contended for. The plaintiff, therefore, cannot rely on the contract as made in the writing. If he relies on the implied promise, from his labor and materials being received and used, the rule would be that he should recover so much as they were reasonably worth. (O'Conner v. Van Homme, Dallam, 429 ; Story on Con. Sec. 15, 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Again, if the work was received as it progressed, and certain installments paid from time to time on the said work, still as the work was stipulated to be done for a price in gross, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>not by parcels, it was proper <em>to </em>estimate the value of what was done in order to determine whether appellants had overpaid for the work actually finished. (Story on Con. Sec. 19.) In any point of view that the case can reasonably he regarded the evidence was admissible, and the Court erred in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">There are numerous questions presented in the record, which, it is presumed, it is hardly necessary to refer to, as upon another trial they may not arise, and if they do, may be presented in a shape more favorable to judicial investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
