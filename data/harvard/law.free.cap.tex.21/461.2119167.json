It was proven that the plaintiff had never seen or received the yoke of oxen, the consideration for the sale of the horse, but that they were immediately driven off by a brother of the defendant\u2019s into another county.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The defendant alleges that the Justice gave judgment on the facts recited in his petition, and if so it was not founded on the law or the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judgment dismissing the petition for <em>certiorari </em>is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
