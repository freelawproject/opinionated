The slave was taken in December, 1853, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the claim was made on the 14th of January, 1854. The claimants gave in evidence a transcript from the Probate Court of Chicot county, Arkansas, in the matter of the succession of Britton Ward : entry showing petition of Stokely Ward, administrator of Britton Ward, in July, 1842, representing that there was more property than was required to pay the debts of said estate, and praying a distribution thereof as follows : to Stokely Ward one share ; <em>to </em>Bosa Bankston, formerly Ward, one share; to Sally Terry, formerly Sally Ward, one share ; to the heirs and legal representatives of Squire Ward one share; to the heirs and legal representatives of Huldah Burch, formerly Ward, one share; to the heirs and legal representatives of Leona Trammell, formerly Ward, one share ; to Tensey Vessells, formerly Ward, one share ; to the heirs and legal representatives of Bfinkly Ward one share; petition refused ; re-hearing ; re-argument and taken under advisement. Same Term entry entitled Stokely Ward, administrator of the estate of Britton Ward, deceased, v. Bosa Bankston, Sally Terry, Leona Trammell, Stokely Ward, the heirs and legal representatives of Huldah Burch, the heirs and legal representatives of Squire Ward, the heirs and legal representatives of Brinkly Ward, Tensey Vessells, all heirs and legal representatives of Britton Ward, deceased. This day came the parties by their attorneys, &amp;c.; petition granted and final distribution ordered, \u201c the parties themselves being present and consenting to the same ; it is ordered that the negro property on hand and other property on hand be forthwith equally divided between the heirs named in the motion of said complainant; that is to Bosa Bankston, formerly Bosa Ward, one share : Sally Terry, formerly Sally Ward, one share; Leona Trammell, formerly Leona Ward, one share ; Stokely Ward one share ; the heirs and legal representatives of Huldah Burch, formerly Huldah Ward, one share ; to the heirs and legal representatives of Squire Ward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>one share ; to the heirs and legal representatives of Brinkly Ward one share ; to Tensey Vessells, formerly Tensey Ward, one share, &amp;c.; dividing the property into eight lots, lot No. 3 to consist of Charlotte and Frank her infant chilch &amp;c.; and the same entry showed that the division was approved by the Court, and that \u201c the Court ordered the names of the \u201c eight heirs aforesaid to be placed in one hat and the eight \u201c lots in another, and the interest of each heir fairly drawn \u201c for ; when by ballot drawn it appeared that Rosa Bankston \u201c drew lot No. 1 ; that Sally Terry aforesaid drew lot No. 2 ; \u201c that Leona Trammell drew lot No. 3; that Stokely Ward \u201cdrew lot No. 4 ; that Huldah Burch\u2019s heirs drew lot No. \u201c 5 ; that the heirs and legal representatives of Squire Ward \u201c drew lot No. 6 ; that Brinkly Ward\u2019s heirs and legal representatives drew lot No. 7 ; and that Tensey Vessells drew \u201clot No. 8. Therefore it is ordered, adjudged and decreed \u201cby the Court, that each of the heirs aforesaid be and they \u201c are hereby forever invested with the fee simple and separate \u201c title to the negro or negroes and money which was by said \u201c allotments and ballots set apart to them; and that all right \u201c and title to the same be forever divested out of the other \u201c heirs who have drawn their separate shares in said allot- \u201c ments as also out of all other persons whatever ; and it is \u201c ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Court, that each of \u201c the heirs or parties entitled to a share in the foregoing allot- \u201c ments and division, shall, by themselves or legal representa- \u201c fives, have the right to call upon the administrator or any \u201c other person having the possession or custody of said prop- \u201c erty and negroes, &amp;c., take the same into their possession ; \u201c to sue for and recover by any and all remedies known to \u201c our laws ; to acquire possession and custody of their respec- \u201c tive shares according to law, the legal possession, of which \u201c is hereby granted and adjudged to the parties, and to give <em>\u201c </em>the administrator or other persons a receipt or release there- \u201c for in their own right,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>There was also a copy of the motion or petition of Stokely Ward, as administrator, for distribution ; and in it, in naming the distributees, the words \u201c the heirs and legal representa- \u201c lives of Leona Trammell \u201d were used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">Claimants introduced the depositions of Nicholas Trammell, Nathaniel Trammell and Green B. Baker, who testified that the plaintiffs were the children and grand children and heirs of Leona Trammell, deceased ; that Sarah and Elizabeth married G. W. and Edmond Sawyer, in 1847 ; that two of the infant plaintiffs are the children of Elizabeth who died in 1852 ; that Leona Trammell died in Spring of 1838 ; that at her death her children were all infants ; that Sarah was born November 29th, 1830 ; that Elizabeth was born January 18th, 1832; that Amelia E. was born May 12th, 1836 ; that Wm. H. was born March 11th, 1838 ; that Leona was the daughter of Britton Ward, who died about 15 or 18 months after the death of said Leona ; that Leona was residing, at the date of her death, about one hundred miles distant from the residence of her father ; that Charlotte and her infant boy Frank, the negro in controversy, belonged to said Ward at his death, and was set aside as the share of Leona Trammell, deceased, in the distribution of said Ward\u2019s estate; that the said boy had remained in the possession of N. Trammell, the husband of said Leona and father of said plaintiffs, from said distribution, when he recovered him, till he was levied on by execution in favor of said Boyle ; that the said Ward had eight children, Squire, Stokely, Brinkly, Tursby, Huldah, Rosa, Sarah and Leona; that the heirs had all acquiesced in the said distribution of said estate. Claimants introduced in evidence the Revised Statutes of Arkansas, adopted at the October session of the General Assembly of said State A. XL 1837, from which both parties read certain Sections of the laws of said State, and it is hereby agreed that the same may be referred to in the Supreme Court, without having the same copied in this statement of facts.

Harper testified that he knew the boy Frank ; that Nat Trammell brought him to the county several years since, and always claimed him as his own property; heard him assert his claim years before said boy was levied upon, in the presence of his sons-in-law, the two Sawyers, and heard the Sawyers say that he belonged to Trammell; the boy Frank was notoriously known as the property of Nat Trammell ; witness lived within one-half mile of Nat Trammell; never heard any doubts as to Trammell\u2019s title until the commencement of this suit; heard the Sawyer's say that if they owned Frank they would not give him for any other negro they knew of; that the two Sawyers were living at the house of Nat Trammell at the time; heard Trammell claim negro Frank, and speak of him as his property frequently in the presence of the Sawyers, his sons-in-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">C.

S. Patton testified that he levied the attachment of Boyle on the boy Frank while in the possession of Ttammell at his tavern in La Grange. Trammell alway\u00e1-claimed the boy as his own property; the Sawyers, his sons-in-law, were frequently at Trammell\u2019s, and one of them was living with Trammell. The boy Frank was notoriously known as Trammell\u2019s property ; never heard Trammell\u2019s title doubted until the commencement of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-9\">The Court instructed the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>That if Leona Trammell was living at the time the distribution of the estate of Britton Ward was made by the Probate Court of Arkansas, then the portion of the estate of Britton Ward, which Leona Trammell could inherit, rested by the law of Arkansas in Nathaniel Trammell, her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">If the record of the Probate Court of Arkansas, which made the distribution of Britton Ward\u2019s estate, recites the fact that Leona Trammell was present in Court when the distribution was made, either in person or by attorney, then the recital of the record is conclusive evidence of that fact, and cannot be contradicted by other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">If the language of the record of the Probate Court of Arkansas is ambiguous or of uncertain import, then parol or other testimony may be considered, in order to arrive at a proper construction of the language of the record, or in order properly to ascertain what the record recites.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">If Leona Trammell died before her father, Britton Ward, then whatever portion of Britton Ward\u2019s estate Leona Trammell could inherit, if she had survived him, would descend to and rest in her children, without any interest on the part of Nathaniel Trammell, the husband of Leona attaching to the said inheritance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\">Where a decree of a Court recites the prayer of a petition, the recital of the prayer of the petition is not evidence that the facts set forth in the petition are true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-9\">If Leona Trammell was dead at the time of the decree distributing the estate of Britton Ward was made by the Probate Court in Arkansas, and her heirs were not present in Court, either in person or by guardian, when the decree was made, then the Court acted without jurisdiction as to them ; and the decree, as to them, was and is a nullity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-10\">If the decree of the Probate Court in Arkansas did not vest title in these plaintiffs to the property in controversy, and if Leona Trammell was an illegitimate child of Britton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Ward, then these plaintiffs cannot inherit any portion of Brit-ton Ward\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">A child, to be legitimate, must either be born in lawful wedlock, or the parents of such child must afterwards marry and recognise the child as their own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">If Nathaniel Trammell received the negro boy in controversy, from the estate of Britton Ward, as his own property,, in right of his wife, then the claimants cannot recover in this-suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">If Nathaniel Trammell held the boy in controversy adversely to the claimants, or such of them as were of age or married, then such of the claimants as were of age or married; for two years after such adverse possession commenced and before the institution of this proceeding, are barred of their claim by such adverse possession ; but such of the claimants as are under age or unmarried are not so barred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">The disability of marriage cannot be added to the disability arising from minority, to protect a party against the laws of limitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-9\">A mistake or error in a decree of a Court of competent jurisdiction, can only be corrected in the Court which rendered the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\">The claimants requested the following instructions, which were refused:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-11\">The claimants ask the Court to charge the jury, that if they believe the heirs of Leona Trammell were made parties to the motion for distribution of the property of B.

The heirship of the distributees of Britton Ward\u2019s estate was determined by the decree of a competent Court of the proper jurisdiction, and cannot be questioned in thiso case. (Sutherland v. De Leon, 1 Tex. R. 309, and cases cited ; Dancy v. Stricklinge, 15 Tex. R. 557, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">II. There was no evidence in the record nor elsewhere, that Leona was in Court, in person or by attorney ; it is clear that the words \u201c the heirs and legal representatives of \u201d were inadvertently omitted in the after part of the proceedings. The charge on that point was therefore erroneous, being calculated to mislead the jury. (Yarborough v. Tate, 14 Tex. R. 483 ; Earle v. Thomas, Id. 583 ; Hancock v. Horan, 15 Id. 507.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-8\">III. The record shows that the heirs and legal representa tives of Leona Trammell were made parties by the petition or motion ; and the decree recites that the parties were present in Court. The decree has been acquiesced in by all the parties. The property passed into the hands of the father and natural guardian of the claimants. It was therefore erroneous to charge the jury that if the heirs of Leona Trammell were not parties to the decree, it was void as to them. They had a right, at all events, to acquiesce in it and claim the benefits of it, as against all strangers thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-9\">IV. The motion for a new trial ought to have been sustained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-10\"><em>Tate </em>and <em>McFarland, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arc\">I. Trammell has claimed Frank in the presence of Sawyers and their wives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>-Tor four years prior to the institution of Boyle\u2019s suit, and he '\u25a0was notoriously known as his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">\u00ab11. It will be seen by reference to the decree, that Leona ' Trammell was the party really before the Court, and the Court declared that she herself was entitled to one share. It no where appears that any guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed to represent the heirs of Leona Trammell; and it is clear from the decree, that the Court acted upon the presumption that Leona was alive. The decree is conclusive against all parties and their privies. It matters not that it was based upon facts which did not exist. It cannot now be brought in question on a collateral proceeding. If there was a mistake it could only be corrected by application to the Court in which it was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">III. If the decree was a nullity on account of Leona being dead, (which fact we do not admit) and the plaintiffs in error should claim as heirs of Leona Trammell, we say that the testimony shows that she was illegitimate and could not inherit from her father Britton Ward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-7\">The charges given to the jury we think were quite as favorable for the plaintiffs in error as they could have asked.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-8\">IY. The wives of Sawyers were barred by limitation, if indeed they had any title to Frank.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-9\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">The property in controversy certainly belonged to B. Ward before his death in the State of Arkansas. It was administered upon there by his son, S. Ward, as a part of his estate, and upon a distribution thereof, it was received from the administrator by Nathaniel Trammell, and, in that .\u2018State and in this, retained by him from that time, which was In 1842, up to the time of the levy of Boyle\u2019s executions, in December, 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The capacity <em>in </em>which Trammell received it is one of the principal matters in dispute. Appellants contend that he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ceived it as their property and as their natural guardian. Appellee contends that he received it in his own right by virtue of his being then the husband of Leona Trammell, as the distributive share of her father\u2019s estate, or that Leona being an illegitimate child, Trammell received it without any right, and has acquired a title to it by possession, or if the appellants were entitled to a share of B. Ward\u2019s estate in right of their mother and they were not represented by guardian or in person when the estate was distributed, the decree of distribution was as to them a nullity, and from which it follows,, that Trammell and not his. children have whatever title to the property which his continued possession may confer.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">One of the items of evidence to show in what capacity Trammell received the property, was a transcript of the record of the Probate Court of Arkansas relating to the distribution of said Ward\u2019s estate. This shows that the administrator filed a petition for a distribution, in which he names the several parties who are entitled to distributive shares of the estate, and among them \u201c the heirs and legal representatives of Leona Trammell.\u201d This petition is finally granted and in pursuance thereto the Court makes an order of distribution, and in the order the name of Leona Trammell appears-as one of the distributees, leaving off the designation \u201cthe heirs and legal representatives of\u201d as indicated in the administrator\u2019s petition. The negro in controversy is part of the property set apart as the share of Leona Trammell by said order. It was also shown that Leona Trammell died before her father B. Ward died, and that he was never married to her mother, and that by the laws of Arkansas illegitimate children could not inherit except through their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The leading matters adjudicated in this order of the Probate Court were:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">1st. That the estate should be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">2nd. That the persons named were entitled to distributive shares of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>3rd. That each distributee should hold in severalty the portion set apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Now as to whether one of these distributees, who were entitled as children of B. Ward, was then dead or alive, was a fact necessarily involved in the scope of the adjudication, but only incidentally so. That Leona Trammell was such child and so entitled as one of the eight distributees was adjudged. That established her heirship to the property set apart to her conclusively, except the contrary was shown by appeal or other direct proceeding by some party then having an interest in that property. The decree was founded on the basis of her then being alive. But that was not an issue which was specially tried, nor was it one of the leading objects of the adjudication. If she happened then to be dead, her heirs might adopt the division, and claim the share set apart to her. And if they did so the other distributees would not be injured and would have no right to complain. No one else could complain that the decree took for granted an incidental fact, which did not exist so as to defeat or annul the distribution. It may be asked, who was competent to try the issue of whether she was dead or alive, so as to make that determination conclusive ? Those of course who were her minor heirs or claim to be ; and her husband Nathaniel Trammell. Their interests in this issue would be adverse. The other distributees would have no interest in this issue otherwise than an incidental one. Therefore it is clear, that, with reference to the parties and object of this adjudication, the question of whether Leona Trammell was living or not, was merely incidental, and is not conclusively established \"by it, as against persons claiming to be then her minor heirs who were not then represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">So too the fact of her appearance in Court at said adjudication, being recited in the decree, may be evidence of her then being alive, but it is not conclusive for the same reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>it being a mere incident and not the main object of the decree. (1 Greenleaf Ev. Sec. 528 and references ; Id. 550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The effect of this record was to establish conclusively that Leona Trammell (or her heirs, if she were dead, and they adopted the distribution) was entitled to a distributive share of B. Ward\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Secondly it might establish <em>prima </em>facie, but not conclusively, that she was alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The most reasonable explanation of it, considering the petition of the administrator and orders of the Probate Court founded thereon, is that Nathaniel Trammell was present and represented the interest in her share of the estate. If she were then really dead, and he concealed that fact, he cannot avail himself of his fraud as against her minor heirs. Or if the designation of \u201c the heirs and legal representatives of \u201d was dropped from before the name of Leona Trammell, by mistake or inadvertance of the Clerk in entering the order, that could not be held to change the existence of a fact which had transpired, and which affected the interest of minors not there represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The fact, that the record designates two parties to take this share to-wit: \u201c the heirs and legal representatives of Leona \u25a0\u201c Trammell \u201d and \u201c Leona Trammell,\u201d renders it subject to explanation by the proof of facts to show who must have been intended. (Greenleaf Ev. Sec. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Upon the subject of the plea of the Statute of Limitations, it appears that Trammell was in the adverse possession of this property for several years, but no definite period of time is fixed by the witnesses. That could not operate as a bar to the rights of the minor children of Leona Trammell. (Wade <em>ex ux. </em>v. Johnson, 5 Humph. 117 ; Angel on Lim. Sec. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The Sawyers were married to their wives in 1847, who were then infants ; and were then not barred of their rights. If Trammell\u2019s adverse possession commenced before that time, the Statute of Limitations would then have commenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>run.; but if his adverse possession commenced after that time,, they were protected from .the operation of the Statute by their coverture.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Without adverting more minutely to the several questions in the case, as presented by the record, it will be seen, from the view here taken of them, that the Court below erred in the instructions given to the jury. Judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
