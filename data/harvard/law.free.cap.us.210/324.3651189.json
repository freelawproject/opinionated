In the first it was recited that as the information did not charge that the defendant was not licensed to engage in the business of bookmaking, etc., alleged to have been carried on prior to June 16, 1905, no violation of law was stated. The remaining grounds set forth reasons why it was asserted that the information in the second and third grounds, heretofore stated, did not charge violations of law or state facts upon which a judgment of ouster for such alleged acts could lawfully be based. After hearing argument the Supreme Court of Missouri sustained the first ground of demurrer and overruled all the others, and granted defendant fifteen days in which to answer the' remaining allegations contained in the information, viz., the second, third and fourth grounds of alleged misuse and nonuse of the corporate franchises heretofore referred to. 200 Missouri, 34. Subsequently an answer was filed, of which (omitting title) a copy is -in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Thereupon a motion for a final judgment of ouster, etc., on the pleadings was filed, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">\u201cFirst. That said return and answer fails to state facts showing any sufficient cause or excuse for, or any legal defense to, the nonuser of respondent\u2019s franchises authorizing it to give exhibitions of agricultural products and exhibition, of contests of speed or races between horses for the purpose of encouraging and promoting agriculture and the improvement of stock, and for the establishing and maintaining of suitable fair grounds in the city and county of St. Louis, as set forth and charged in the information herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-6\">\u201cSecond. It appears from the facts stated in said return and answer, and the second count thereof, that respondent is guilty of the acts of misuser and abuser of its franchises charged in the information herein filed, in this, to wit, that respondent engaged in the business of bookmaking and poolselling, registration of bets, and the acceptance of bets in violation of the laws of this State:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-7\">\u201cWherefore, informant prays that final judgment of ouster be rendered against the respondent as prayed for in the information in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">A motion to strike from the files having been overruled, the motion was heard and granted, and judgment of ouster was entered,, a fine of five thousand dollars was imposed upon the corporation because of nonuse, misuse, and violation of its franchises, and provision was made for the winding up of the affairs of the corporation. A motion for a rehearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>made, in which the protection of various clauses of the Constitution of the United States was invoked, the following only being material to the controversy arising on this record:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201cThird. Respondent is charged with nonuse of its corporate franchise as to the right to hold fairs. The. general denial of respondent applies to this charge, and there has been no trial as to that fact. Yet the judgment adjudges the respondent guilty without a hearing, thereby also violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">\u201cBut without this, the plea of estoppel interposed by the, respondent to the charge of nonuse does not deprive respondent of the benefit of its general denial of that charge. Even at common law, and certainly since the statute of Anne, a plea of estoppel may be united with a general denial in a <em>quo warranto </em>proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">\u201cFifth. The judgment of ouster ought not to be entered in this case in the present state of the pleadings, for the reason that even though the power conferred by the charter of the respondent to engage in bookmaking and poolselling be re- \u2022 garded as taken away by the repeal of the breeder\u2019s law, and even though respondent has lost its charter privileges to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>duct fairs by failure to exercise those privileges, nevertheless respondent has other privileges conferred by its charter which are not contrary to any law of this State or to the policy of the State, and which have not been lost by nonuser, among which privileges is the right to conduct horse races for prizes or purses or at pleasure, and which the judgment of this court deprives respondent of without respondent having in any manner lost the right so to do, and in this respect also the judgment deprives the respondent of its property without due process of law, contrary to the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which respondent here invokes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">The motion for a rehearing was granted, and upon a reconsideration of the cause the motion for judgment on the pleadings was again sustained upon the ground of nonuser of the corporation franchises, and judgment was entered ousting the corporation of all of its franchises and charter rights, and adjudging that the same be forfeited to the State and the corporation dissolved. 200 Missouri, 34. A motion for a rehearing having been filed and overruled, the cause was brought here by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Mr. Thomas Bond, </em>with whom <em>Mr. Henry W.

For its further answer to that portion of the information of the Attorney General herein, wherein it is alleged that respondent has failed to exercise 'certain franchises claimed1 to be possessed by it, this respondent states that it has fully carried out and exercised all those provisions in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>charter authorizing it to give exhibitions of agricultural products and exhibitions of contests of speed and races between horses for the purpose of encouraging and promoting agriculture and the improvement of stock, and has provided suitable fair grounds for the same, in this that between the eighteenth day of January, 1901, and the sixteenth day of June, 1905, in pursuance of the provisions and requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 7419 to 7424, inclusive, Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1899, respondent duly paid large sume of money into the treasury of the State of Missouri, which were placed by the treasurer of the State of Missouri to the credit of the State fair fund, the same being a fund created by \u00a7 7424, Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1899, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>fer the development and advancement of the industrial interests of this State under the direction of the state board of agriculture, and that all of said money so paid into said fund was received, used and appropriated by the State of Missouri for the purpose of holding and giving annual exhibitions of agricultural products and stock of every kind and description at the city of Sedalia, State of Missouri, and that the said sums of money paid by respondent into the treasury of the State of Missouri under the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 7419 to 7424, inclusive, were used and appropriated by the said State of Missouri and its said state board of agriculture solely for the maintenance and support of said Missouri State fair held annually at Sedalia, Missouri, and for the further purpose of providing, constructing, improving and equipping all grounds, stands and buildings necessary for the holding and giving of said fair. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\">Respondent further states that by exacting and receiving the said sums of money for the above-mentioned purposes the said State of Missouri intended to and did accept the same as full and complete performance and \u00dase by respondent of its franchise to give exhibitions of agricultural products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and stock, and the said State of Missouri thereby intended to and did waive any other or further exercise of such franchise on the .part of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"ANz\">Further answering the allegations of non-user from June 16, 1905, to the date of the filing of this information, to wit, July 28, 1905,-respondent states that the franchise of giving exhibitions of agricultural products and stock is not one which can be exercised continuously and at all times from, the beginning to the end of the year, but is one, owing to its peculiar character, which can only be exercised during the harvest.season of each year. For these reasons respondent was not required to exercise such franchise between the above specified dates, but respondent further avers that it has in good faith endeavored at all times to exercise the franchises granted to it by its articles of incorporation in the manner and for the purposes intended by such grants, and that such is its purpose in the future, and respondent intends in every way to comply with and perform according to law all the obligations which it assumed upon the grant of the aforesaid franchises to it by the State of Missouri, and respondent again specifically denies each and every charge, allegation or assertion of a contrary purpose on its part, contained in the information filed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\">Wherefore, respondent prays that it be hence discharged with .its costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-9\">Me. Justice White,</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Soon after the filing of the record in this court the Attorney General of Missouri submitted a motion to dismiss the writ of error or to affirm, and the determination of the motion was postponed until the hearing on the merits. The cause having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>argued, the motion to dismiss or affirm must now be disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We are of opinion that the' record does not present any Federal question and that the motion to dismiss must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The Supreme Court of Missouri, in the opinion delivered by it on the rehearing, considered three propositions: First, the effect of the general denial contained in the first paragraph and the plea embodied in the second numbered paragraph of the answer; second, upon what grounds a forfeiture of a corporate franchise might be declared; and, third, whether or not, in addition to ousting the corporation from its franchises, the court could and should \u201cappropriate a part of its substance to the use and benefit of the State.\u201d These propositions were determined after an elaborate consideration of the subject and a review of many authorities. It was decided that the plea following the general denial in the answer amounted to a plea of confession and avoidance; that in consequence the general denial first pleaded raised no issue, and hence \u201cthe motion for judgment upon the ground of nonuser should be sustained.\u201d It was next determined, after declaring that it was the duty of the court to act with great caution in decreeing a forfeiture, that forfeiture of the corporate franchises might be declared \u201cwhere there is either willful misuse.or willful nonuse of the franchise and franchises, which are of the essence of the contract with the State, and those in which the State or public is most interested, then a forfeiture of the whole charter should be and will be declared. When a corporation receives from the State \u00e1 charter granting certain franchises or rights, there is at least an implied or tacit agreement that it will use the franchises'thus granted; that it will use no others, and that it-will not misuse those granted. A failure in any substantial particular entitled the State to come in and claim her own, the rights theretofore granted, and this through a judgment of forfeiture? in a proceeding like the one at bar.\u201d On this branch of the case the court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\"The right to construct and maintain suitable fair grounds in the city and county of St. Louis, and to give exhibitions of agricultural products thereat, is one of the essence of this contract between the State and the respondent. It was and is the franchises in the exercise of which the State and general public have the most interest and concern. A failure to exercise this franchise was a failure to perform the very thing which was of the essence of the contract. That this failure was willful is shown by the length of time of the admitted nonuser as well as by other things made apparent by the pleadings. So far as the State and general public are concerned this right or franchise, so long neglected, was leading and uppermost in interest. No legal excuse is offered for respondent\u2019s failure. It would appear, at least by inferences deducible from the pleadings, that respondent was alert in promoting that incidental feature of its charter, gambling upon horse races, and furnishing its gamblers with refreshments, both liquid and solid, but extremely indifferent as to doing the things, moral in character, which it had, by receiving its charter, tacitly agreed to do, and the only things in which the State and the public had any special interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201c Such a flagrant and willful nonuser of franchises, which are of the very essence of the grant, demand, in our judgment, the forfeiture of all the rights and franchises granted, and we' therefore hold that there shall be a judgment decreeing a forfeiture of all the rights and franchises granted to respondent by its charter and a dissolution of said corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">As to the third proposition, the court was of opinion that no further fine or punishment than that of ouster should be inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In substance the contention of plaintiff in error is that the plea, contained in the second paragraph of the answer, merely presented a question of estoppel, which did not waive the prior general denial, and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri destroyed, \u201cwithout a trial or a hearing and by an unequal and ..unjust enforcement of the law, vested property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>rights both of plaintiff in error and its stockholders, in the face of Federal immunities, which the record shows to have been specially set up and claimed.\u201d In effect' this is but asserting that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri was so plainly arbitrary and contrary to law as to be an act of mere spoliation. But we fail to perceive the slightest semblance of ground for such a contention. In determining the scope and effect of the allegations of the answer and in reaching the conclusion that the charges of nonuser contained in the information stood as confessed under the pleadings, the Supreme Court of Missouri followed its conception of the rules of pleading, as expounded in many of the previous decisions of that court, and the question of the extent of the power to take from the corporation its charter grant of franchises was determined as a question of general law. The determination of those matters did not involve a Federal question. <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Itsell, </em>133 U. S. 65. Manifestly, the proceeding constituted due process. <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>137 U. S. 692; New <em>Orleans Waterworks </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(where the subject of the power of a State to forfeit corporate franchises is considered), 185 U. S. 336, 344. And if the fact was, which we do not intimate is the case, that the court below erred in the conclusions rea\u00f3hed by it in respect to the propositions which it determined, the error would not afford a basis for reviewing its judgments in this court. <em>Central Land Co. </em>v. <em>Laidley, </em>159 U.
