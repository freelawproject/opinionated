In either case the Government was the disburser of the money\u2014 the hand which directly dispensed the aid \u2014 and the money was disbursed under a contract. To deprive the Secretary of the power to make such contracts altogether was the only effectual means of preventing him from using Indian treaty and trust funds for sectarian schools, and it would operate just as effectually in regard to such funds as in regard to funds derived from the appropriation for the support of schools.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The Secretary\u2019s power to make such a contract was taken away altogether, and not merely as regards contracts where the money was to be paid out of appropriations by Congress expressly for the support of Indian schools.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">As regards the taking away of the Secretary\u2019s power to make such a contract, no distinction can be drawn between money expressly appropriated by Congress for the support of Indian schools and money appropriated by Congress in fulfillment of Indian treaties and available for education.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">As regards use under contracts with sectarian schools, no distinction can be drawn between money expressly appropriated by Congress for the support of Indian schools and money paid by the Government as interest on Indian funds held in trust by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">While in the case of the Sioux trust fund the appropriation is made by a different system from that pursued with the Sioux treaty fund, there is still an appropriation within the meaning of the acts of 1896 and 1897, declaring it to be \u201cthe settled policy of the Government to hereafter make no appropriation whatever for education'in any .sectarian school,\u201d and the act of 1899 which said, \u201cthis being the final appropriation for sectarian schools.\u201d The word \u201cappropriation,\u201d used as it is here, in statutes of the class known as \u201c appropriation acts,\u201d is necessarily, technical. It means an appropriation by Congress of money in the Treasury of the United States. Restricted as this meaning is, however, the whole phrase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cmake no appropriation whatever,\u201d is as broad a phrase as the limits of that meaning will possibly permit, and it refers to any and every kind of appropriation that Congress can make, without regard to the method of such appropriation. \u201cNo appropriation <em>whatever\u201d </em>is a phrase that can have no limits but those which necessarily restrict the word \u201cappropriation\u201d itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">The appropriations of funds in the United States Treasury are of two kinds, viz., those made for each successive fiscal year, and permanent annual appropriations. The latter are provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 3687-3689, Rev. Stat., and cover a number of matters (the cost of revenue collection, payment of interest on the public debt, etc.), which are expected to recur every year, either indefinitely or for a considerable period, so that it is held inadvisable to make a special appropriation for them every year. When the Revised Statutes were compiled, the Indian trust funds were all invested (under \u00a7\u00a72095,2096), and the income received was paid to the Indians or expended for them, and this system was not changed until the act of April 1; 1880, c. 41, 21 Stats. 70. That act, providing for the payment of interest upon Indian trust funds deposited in the Treasury to the credit of Indian tribes, such payment to \u201cbe made in the usual manner, as each may become due, without further appropriation by Congress,\u201d really constitutes a permanent annual appropriation of such interest. Had that change been made before the Revised Statutes were compiled, the interest on the Indian trust funds would presumably have been included in the permanent annual appropriation system, The words \u201c <em>without further </em>appropriation by Congress \u201d clearly show that the provision of the act of 1880 constituted' an appropriation once for all, or in other words a permanent annual appropriation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-7\"><em>The Solicitor General </em>and <em>Mr. Edgar H. Gans, </em>with whom <em>The Attorney General </em>was on the brief, for appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">There is no constitutional question. For eighty years Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>gress extended aid out of the public funds to mission schools of various denominations, finally withdrawing it because of opposition among the people at large and because the time had thus arrived for establishing distinctive government schools. If there were a valid constitutional objection to the earlier course, it is probable that it would have been discovered during that period of eighty years. The Constitution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d A religious establishment, however, is not synonymous with an establishment of religion. See <em>Bradfield </em>v. <em>Roberts, 175 </em>U. S. 291, upholding an appropriation for a Roman Catholic hospital. A school, like a hospital, is neither an establishment of religion nor a religious establishment, although along with secular education there might be, as there commonly is, instruction in morality and religion, just as in a hospital there would be religious ministrations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">But opposing counsel advance a line of suggestion similar to that made by the complainant in <em>Bradfield </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>viz.: that the contract involved a principle and a precedent contrary to the Article of the Constitution, and tended to obliterate the essential distinction between civil and religious functions and injured the complainant and all other citizens and taxpayers of the United 'States, and was contrary to the Constitution and declared policy of the Government. But the court passed all such contentions, merely referring to them as statements of complainant\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">The question here is wholly of statutory construction. The aid of'the public funds was gradually diminished and then wholly withdrawn with the declaration' in the acts of 1896 and 1897 that thereafter the policy of the Government would be to make no appropriation for sectarian schools, and the reference to the appropriation of 1899 as final, 29 Stat. 345; 30 Stat. 79 and 942. These declarations of policy would not prevent the present or a future Congress from resuming the appropriation and renewing the aid. The pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>hibition must be restricted to the particular kind of appropriations in which the declaration' of policy appears, namely, to those under the heading \u201cSupport of Schools\u201d which are altogether appropriations of public funds for Indian education; it is not intended to apply to the \u201ctribal funds,\u201d as contended by the appellants, which are dealt with in an entirely different and separated portion of the appropriation acts. It is a case where the proviso or exception' relates only to the particular paragraph or distinct portion of the statute where it occurs, and is not to be extended to the whole statute or other portions of it. <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Collector, </em>3 Wall. 495; <em>Henderson\u2019s Tobacco, </em>11 Wall. 658; <em>Dollar Savings Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>19 Wall. 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">The \u201ctreaty funds\u201d are manifestly funds belonging to the Indians, just as much in the case of the treaty funds which are the annual payment by installment of obligations to the Indians incurred under treaties, as with the trust funds which are the lump sums paid in settlement of such obligations, upon which the income is expended for the benefit of the Indians. In each case there is an \u201cappropriation,\u201d annual or permanent, made, not as the ordinary appropriation applying public funds, but simply as an authority or mandate to the executive agents and the trustee to apply the avails of the fund as usual every year for the benefit of the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">There is no injustice in permitting an Indian to select - a school for his children under the auspices of the church to . which he is attached, and allowing on that account a portion of the tribal funds or a portion of the annuities or rations to be applied. Why should not one Indian or a group.of Indians benefit by their strict proportionate share of the tribal funds and be permitted to determine, always within the scope of the Secretary\u2019s discretion, how their proportion of the funds should be expended? It is significant that Congress has refused to direct otherwise, laying on the table a bill forbidding trust and'treaty funds to be so applied (H. R. 7067, 59th Cong.,, lstsess.). .</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>As to the related point that payments out of the treaty fund will diminish the amount of money which should be expended for the benefit of the entire tribe, the fact is that while the money arising from such funds is not systematically distributed <em>per capita, </em>it is nevertheless expended for <em>the benefit and advantage </em>of the Indians under a liberal exercise of the Secretary\u2019s discretion. The Indian may have no individual <em>locus' standi </em>to compel payment in hand to him, but that does not prohibit the Secretary from applying a proper share of the funds for his. individual benefit, especially when the Secretary\u2019s discretion is exercised by giving the same benefit to a collective group of individual Indians. That the treaty funds are intended by the law to provide for the Indians as individuals is evident from the heading \u201cSubsistence and Civilization,\u201d under which the appropriation acts go on to provide for fulfilling treaty obligations, and from the long established practice of distributing food and clothing out of treaty funds. An examination'of examples of such funds in the treaties and statutes shows that the entire application of the proceeds of such tribal funds is committed to the Secretary\u2019s discretion with little limitation. Treaty of 1848, art. 5, 9 Stat. 952; treaty of 1865, art. 2,14 Stat. 687; act July 15,1870, c. 296, 16 Stat. 362; act June 16, c. 252, 21 Stat. 292; act March 22, 1882, c. 46, 22 Stat. 30; act June 12, 1890, c. 418, 26 Stat. 146. In short, it is evident that while in a certain sense these funds and their revenue are to be administered for the benefit of the tribe, the aggregate community, the determination of that matter also is committed to the Secretary, and he is plainly authorized to administer the funds proportionately for the benefit of smaller groups or of individuals and in the way of benefiting them with any educational or civilizing influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-5\">It would be unjust to withhold from an Indian or community of Indians the right, within reasonable limits, in good faith, and under the safeguards provided by the President\u2019s instructions, to choose their own school and to choose it frankly because the education therein is under the influence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>religious faith in which they believe and to which they are attached, and to have the use of their proportion of tribal funds applied under the control of the Secretary\u2019s discretion to maintain such schools. Any other view of the case perverts the supposed general spirit of the constitutional provision into a means of prohibiting the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> \u201c 3.

The Catholic Missions schools were erected many years ago at the cost of charitable Catholics, and with the approval of the authorities of the Government of the United States, whose policy it was then to encourage the education and civilization of the Indians through the work of religious organizations. Under the provisions Of the act of 1819, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) were appropriated for the purpose of extending financial help \u2018to such associations or individuals who are already engaged in educating the Indians,\u2019 as may be approved by the War Department.</p>\n<p id=\"AaL\">\u201cIn 1820, twenty-one schools conducted by different religious societies were given eleven thousand, eight hundred and thirty-eight dollars ($11,838), and from that date until 1870, the principal educational work in relation to the Indians was under the auspices of these bodies, aided more or less by the Government. For a long time the different denominational schools referred to were aided by the Government without any formal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">\u201cIn 1870, an act of Congress was passed appropriating one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for the support of Indian schools among Indian tribes not otherwise provided for, <em>i. e., </em>among tribes not having treaty stipulations providing funds for educational purposes, and these appropriations continued until 187Q. Contracts were made annually with the mission schools of the different denominations payable out of this appropriation for the education of Indian pupils. As to the tribes having funds for educational purposes under treaty stipulations, contracts were also made with the mission schools of the different denominations payable out of the treaty funds. In 1876, Congress began the general appropriation \u2018for the support of industrial schools and other educational purposes for the Indian tribes,\u2019 and these annual appropriations from the public moneys of the United States have been \u2014 from that time until the present. These appropriations always were put in the appropriation acts under the heading \u2018Support of Schools\u2019 \u2014 and from these public funds, and, in the discretion of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from the tribal funds hereinafter explained, wore paid the amounts due under the contracts made by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the approval of the Secretaiy of the Interior, with the various denominational schools for the education of Indian pupils.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">'\u25a0&gt;!.\u25a0 !\u2018i-i'Te 1S95 opposition developed to these contracts with deu. \u2022'\u25a0\u00a1i\" Is on the ground that the public moneys of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>/ tes raised by taxation should not be used for education in sectarian institutions; and also for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">\u201cAccordingly there is found in the appropriation act of 1894, ch. 290 (28 Statutes at Large, p. 311) approved August 15, 1894, in that part of the act appropriating the public moneys for the support of Indian schools and under the heading \u2018Support of Schools,\u2019 the following:</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">\u201c\u2018That the expenditure of money appropriated for school purposes under this act shall be at all times under\u2019the supervision and direction of the Commissioner for Indian Affairs and in all respects in conformity with such conditions, rules, and regulations as. to the conduct of and methods of instruction and expenditure of money as may, from time to time, be prescribed by him, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\u201c \u2018 Provided, that the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed to inquire into and investigate the propriety of discontinuing contract schools and whether, in his judgment, the same can be done without detriment to the education of Indian children, and that he submit to Congress at the next session the result of such investigation, including an estimate of the annual cost, if any, of substituting Government schools for contract schools, together with such recommendations as he may deem proper.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A7X\">\u201c In his annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, the Secretary of the Interior said:</p>\n<p id=\"AVM\">\u201c \u2018The contract schools are now the subject of general discussion.

Money has been invested in their construction at a time when they were recognized as wise instrumentalities for the accomplishment of good. I do not think it proper to allow the intense feeling of opposition to sectarian education, which is showing itself all over the land, to induce the department to disregard existing conditions.

This was entitled \u2018An act to divide a portion of the reservation of the Sioux Nation of Indians in Dakota into separate reservations, and to secure the relinquishment of the Indian tribe to the .remainder.\u2019 Under this act, the Indians made certain.cessions of land, and in partial consideration therefor it was provided in section 17 of the act as follows; \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u201c\u2018And in addition thereto, there shall be set .apart out of any sum in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of three million dollars, which said sum shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Sioux Nation of Indians as a permanent fund, the interest on which at five per cent, per annum shall be appropriated under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior to the use of the Indians receiving rations and annuities upon the reservations created by this act in proportion to the number that shall so receive rations and annuities at the time that this act takes effect, as follows: One-half of said interest shall be so expended for the promotion of industrial and other suitable education among the said Indians, and the other half for such purposes, including reasonable cash payments <em>per capita, </em>as in the discretion of such Secretary, shall, from time to time, most contribute to the advancement of said Indians in civilization and self-support.\u2019 25 Stat. at Large, 895.</p>\n<p id=\"AxB\">\u201cThis is the fund called the \u2018Sioux Trust Fund\u2019 in the fifth paragraph of this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201cThe method of the payment of the interest on this fund was changed in 1880 by the act of 1880, chapter 41, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">\u201c \u2018The Secretary of the Interior be, and he is hereby authorized to deposit in the Treasury of the United States, any and all sums now held by him, or which may hereafter be received by him, as Secretary of the Interior and trustee of various Indian tribes, on account of the redemption of United States bonds or other stocks and securities belonging to the Indian trust fund, and all sums received on account of sales of Indian trust lands, and the sales of stocks lately purchased for temporary investment whenever he is of the opinion that the best interests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits in lieu of investments, and the United States shall pay interest semi-annually from the date of deposit of any and all such sums in the United States Treasury, at the rate per annum stipulated by treaties, or prescribed by law, and such payments shall be made in the usual manner, as each may become due, without further appropriation by Congress.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">\u201cThis provision is partially cited in the bill in paragraph 6.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">\u201c15. Under a treaty between the United States and different tribes of Sioux Indians made on April 29, 1868 (15 Stat. at Large, 635), these Indians made large cessions of land and other rights, and in partial consideration therefor the United States agreed with them as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ACC\">\u201c \u2018Art. VII. In order to insure the civilization of the Indians entering into this treaty, the necessity of education is admitted, especially of those as are or may be settled on said agricultural reservations, and they therefore, pledge themselves to compel their children, male and female, between the ages of six and sixteen years to attend school, and it is hereby made the duty of the agent for said Indians to see that this stipulation is strictly complied with, and the United States agrees that for every thirty children between said ages who can be induced or compelled to attend school, a house shall be provided and a teacher competent to teach the elementary branches of our English education shall be furnished, who will reside among said Indians and faithfully discharge his or her duties as a teacher. This provision of this article to continue for not less than twenty years.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AJZ\">\u201cBy the act of Congress of February 28, 1877, ch. 72 (19 Stat. at Large, 254-6), ratifying an agreement with bands of Sioux Nation, in consideration of further land cessions, it was provided:</p>\n<p id=\"AVY\">'\u201cIn consideration of the foregoing cession of territory and rights and upon full compliance with each and every obligation assumed by the said Indians, the United States does agree to provide all necessary aid to assist the said Indians in the work of civilization to furnish to them schools and instructions in mechanical and agricultural arts as provided by the treaty of 1868.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A2T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201c By the seventeenth section of the act of 1889, ch. 405 (25 Stat. at Large, 894), it was provided\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u201c \u2018that the 7th article of the said treaty of April 29, 1868, securing to said Indians the .benefit of education, subject to such modifications as Congress shall deem most effective to secure said Indians equivalent benefits of such education, shall continue in force for twenty years from and after the act shall take effect.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">\u201cBy the act of 1905, ch. 1479 (33 Stat. at Large, p. 1048), entitled\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AuP\">\u201c \u2018An act making appropriations for current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1906, and for other purposes \u2019\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AKo\">\u201cit was provided under the heading \u2018Fulfilling Treaty Stipulations with and Support of Indian Tribes\u2019 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AXQ\">\u201c \u2018For support of and maintenance of day and industrial schools, including erection and repairs of school buildings, in accordance with art. 7 of the treaty of April 29th, 1868, which article was continued in force for twenty years by sec. 17 of the act of March 2, 1889, $225,000.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">\u201cA similar appropriation has been annually made for many years back in the Indian appropriation acts.</p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">\"This is the \u2018Treaty Fund\u2019 in dispute, referred to in the 4th paragraph of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">\u201cThese defendants respectfully represent that this \u2018Treaty Fund\u2019 does not differ from the \u2018Trust Fund,\u2019 in the main point that it is money belonging to the Indians and not public money of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AbU\">\u201c Both funds arise from cessions made by the Indians of lands and other rights.

Prior to 1900 the sectarian schools were aided by appropriations from the public moneys, and in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, from the tribal funds just described.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u201cIn 1900, not' only the public appropriations ceased, as has been heretofore shown, but all aid from the tribal funds also ceased, except as to the Osage Treaty and trust funds hereinbefore referred to. At the request of the Osage Indians, their treaty funds have been annually and uninterruptedly applied to the Catholic mission schools under annual contract with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, approved by the Secretary of the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>terior. With the exception of the Osage funds, no \u2018Tribal Funds\u2019 were ap- \u2022 plied to education in denominational schools from 1900 to 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">\u201cIn the meantime application was made to President McKinley by the \u2018Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions\u2019 for the revocation of the \u2018Browning Ruling\u2019 and the use of \u2018Tribal Funds\u2019 for the education of the Catholic Indian children in Catholic schools.</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">\u201cOn September 30, 1896, the then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, D. M. Browning, in answer to the question, \u2018whether parents of Indian children have the right to decide whore their children shall attend school,\u2019 said:</p>\n<p id=\"Alq\">\u201c \u2018 It is your duty first to build up and maintain the Government day schools, as indicated in your letter, and the Indian parents have no right to designate which school their children shall attend.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Acj\">\u201cThis was the \u2018Browning ruling.\u2019 It was ordered abrogated by President McKinley in 1901, and some eight months after, to wit, January 17, 1902, it was formally abrogated by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u201cThe question of the use of the \u2018Tribal Funds\u2019 was referred by President McKinley to the Secretary of the Interior, and by him to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who decided adversely to the appropriation on February 12, 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"A7C\">\u201c 17. On or about January 1, 1904, the matter of the application for the use of \u2018Tribal Funds\u2019 for the education of Indian children in Mission Schools was brought to the attention of President Roosevelt by the \u2018Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions,\u2019 who urged that the Indians should be allowed to use their own money in educating their oto children in the schools of their choice.</p>\n<p id=\"AyO\">\u201c President Roosevelt took up the matter on January 22, 1904, at a meeting in the executive office of the White House, at which were present the Attorney General (Mr. Knox) and Mr. Russell, of the Department of Justice, and Secretaries Hitchcock, Cortelyou and Wilson, and Postmaster General Payne. The President was legally advised that, notwithstanding the declaration of Congressional intent not to make appropriations in the future of public moneys of the American people for sectarian institutions, the previous laws giving the Secretary of the Interior discretion to use certain moneys of the Indians held in trust in any way that he might see fit, including assistance to sectarian schools, were not repealed, and consequently his discretion remained.</p>\n<p id=\"ARV\">\u201cTh\u00e9 President decided that inasmuch as the legal authority existed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>grant the request of the Indians, they were entitled as a matter of moral right to have the moneys coming to them used for the education of their children at the schools of their choice.</p>\n<p id=\"AR7\">\u201cA full and detailed statement of the action of the President in 1904 is set forth in his letter of February 3, 1905, which, with its enclosure, is herein set out at length:</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">**********</p>\n<p id=\"Acd\">\u201c \u2018This new request was submitted to the Department of Justice, and the department decided, as set forth in the accompanying report, that the prohibition of the law as to the use of public moneys for sectarian schools did not extend to moneys belonging to the Indians themselves, and not to the public, and that these moneys belonging to the Indians themselves might be applied in accordance with the desire of the Indians for the support of the schools to which they were sending their children. There was, in my judgment, no question that, inasmuch as the legal authority existed to grant the request of the Indians, they were entitled as a matter of moral right to have the moneys coming to them used for the education of their children at the schools of their choice. Care must be taken, of course, to see that any petition by th\u00e9 Indians is genuine, and that the money appropriated for any given school represents only the <em>pro rata </em>proportion to which the Indians making the petition are entitled. But if these two conditions are fulfilled, it is, in my opinion, just and right that the Indians themselves should have their-wishes respected when they request that their own money \u2014not the money of the public \u2014 be applied to the support of certain schools to which they desire to send their children. The practice will be continued by the department unless Congress should decree to the contrary, or, of course, unless the courts should decide that the decision of the Department of Justice is erroneous.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Am6j\">\u201cThis communication enclosed a letter from the Attorney General setting forth at length the grounds for the conclusion \u2018that, notwithstanding the declaration of Congressional intent not to make appropriations in the future of public moneys of the American people for sectarian institutions, the previous laws giving the Secretary of the Interior discretion to use certain moneys of the Indians held in trust in any way that he might see fit, including assistance to sectarian schools, were not repealed, and consequently his discretion remained. For some of these laws, see 14 Stat. 687; 16 Stat. 362; 21 Stat. 292; 22 Stat. 30; 25 Stat. 895; 26 Stat. 146; <em>id. </em>344.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A5v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\"

educate during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906, Indian pupils at the several Schools carried on by it among the Sioux, Menominee, Osage, Northern Cheyenne, and Quapaw tribes upon the same terms and conditions as stipulated in its contracts for carrying on these schools for the fiscal year 1905, and requested that it be granted a renewal of the contracts in question, payable in each case from the trust and treaty funds of the tribe among which the school is located for the twelve months beginning July 1, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"An7\">\u201cTo this application the Commissioner replied that the- request would receive careful consideration; that the applicability of the trust and treaty funds had been submitted to the proper authorities for a definite determination, and indicated how petitions should be prepared, and the safeguards under which the signatures of the Indians should be made. Petitions were duly filed, signed under all the safeguards, by the Catholic Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"A2L\">\u201cIn the meantime the schools were opened at the usual time and instruction given to the required nunjber of pupils, in the confidence that the contracts applied for would be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"A7B\">\u201cThe Attorney General not having rendered any decision in the matter, the President, by a letter dated December 23, 1905, addressed to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, after quoting a part of his letter of February 3, 1905, hereinbefore referred to, said:</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">\u201c \u2018There are two kinds of Indian funds involved in this matter. One is the trust fund, which requires no appropriation by Congress, and which clearly is to be administered as the Indians themselves request. As regards this fund, you will treat it on the assumption that the Indians have the right to say how it shall be used, so far as choosing the schools to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>their children are to go is concerned; and each Indian in a tribe to be credited with his <em>pro rata </em>share of the funds which you will apply for him to the Government school where that is the school used, or to the church school where that is the school used, instead of segregating any portion of the fund for the support of the Government school and prorating the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"ALm\">\u201c \u2018The other fund consists of moneys appropriated by Congress in pursuance of treaty stipulations. As to these moneys it is uncertain as to whether or not the prohibition by Congress of their application for contract school applies \u2014 that is, whether or not we have the power legally to use these moneys as we clearly have the power to use the trust funds. It appears that certain of the contract schools are now being run in the belief that my letter quoted above authorized the use of the treaty funds. It would be a great hardship, in the absence of any clearly defined law on the subject, to cut them off at this time arbitrarily, and inasmuch as there is a serious question involved, I direct that until the close of the fiscal year these schools be paid for their services out of the moneys appropriated by Congress in pursuance of treaty obligations, on the same basis as the schools paid out of the trust funds \u2014 always exercising the precautions directed in my letter of February 3d, 1905, \u2018 to see that any petition by the Indians is genuine, and that the money appropriated for any given school represents only the <em>pro rata </em>proportion to which the Indians making the petition are entitled.\u2019 But no new contracts are to be entered into for such payments after the close of the present fiscal year, unless there is authorization by Congress or some determination by the courts.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">\u201cAccordingly, the contracts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, hereinafter set forth, were renewed for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906, the new contracts being executed as of July 1, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"AS6\">\u201cThe services have been performed under all these contracts and the money paid in all of them, except under the contract with the \u2018Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions\u2019 for the education of 250 Indian pupils at St. Francis Mission School on the Rosebud Reservation. The payment of the $27,000 which is due under this contract has been withheld pending the decision by this honorable court as to validity of the contract and the appropriation of tribal funds for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"AXG\">\u201c18. And these defendants, specifically answering as to the contract in dispute, say:</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">\u201cThat it is a contract made between F. E.

The contract was approved by Jesse E. Wilson, Acting Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"ABY\">\u201cApplication for the contract was made by the \u2018Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions\u2019 on June 6, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"Apo\">\u201c On March 26, 1906, a petition duly signed and genuinely signed by 212 members of the Sioux tribe of Indians of the Rosebud Agency, South Dakota, was filed, asking that the said contract applied for be entered into with the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"AV1c\">\u201cThe payments under the contract were to be made from the \u2018Sioux Trust Fund\u2019 and the \u2018Sioux Treaty Fund,\u2019 as hereinbefore'described, in the discretion of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"AHN\">\u201cThere are 4,986 Indians on the rolls of the Rosebud Reservation, and the amount of tribal income applicable to education, ip-the discretion of the Commissioner, is\u2014 . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">\u201c$250,047.90, or a per capita of $50,15.

Washington Law Rep., v. 35, p. 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The validity of the contract for $27,000 is attacked on the ground that all contracts for sectarian education among the Indians are forbidden by certain provisos contained in the Indian Appropriation Acts of 1895,1896,1897,1898 and 1899. But if those provisos relate only to the \u00bfppropriations made by the Government out of the public moneys of the United States raised by taxation from persons of all creeds and faiths, or none at all, and appropriated gratuitously for the purpose of education among the Indians, and not to \u201cTribal Funds,\u201d which belong to the Indians themselves, then the contract must be sustained. The difference between one class of appropriations and the other has long been recognized in the annual appropriation- acts. The gratuitous appropriation- of public moneys for the purpose of Indian education has always been made under the heading \u201cSupport of Schools,\u201d whilst the appropriation of the \u201cTreaty Fund\u201d has always been under the heading \u201c Fulfilling Treaty Stipulations and Support of Indian Tribes,\u201d and that from the \u201cTrust Fund\u201d is not in the Indian Appropriation Acts at all. One class of appropriations relates to public moneys belonging to the Government; the other to moneys which belong to the Indians and which is administered for them by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>From the history of appropriations of public moneys for education of Indians, set forth in the brief of counsel for appellees and again at length in the answer, it appears that before' 1895 the Government for a number of years had made contracts for sectarian schools for the education of the Indians, and the money due on these contracts was paid, in the discretion of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from the \u201cTribal Funds\u201d and from the gratuitous public appropriations. But in 1894 opposition developed' against appropriating public moneys for sectarian education. Accordingly, in the Indian Appropriation Act of 1894, under the heading of \u201c Support of Schools,\u201d the Secretary of the Interior was directed to investigate the propriety of discontinuing contract schools and to make such recommendations as he might deem proper. The Secretary suggested a gradual reduction in the public appropriations on account of the money which had been invested in these schools, with the approbation of the Government. He said': \u201cIt would be scarcely just to abolish them entirely \u2014 to abandon instantly a policy so long recognized,\u201d and suggested that they should be decreased at the rate of not less than twenty per cent a year. Thus in a few years they would cease to exist, and during this time the bureau would be gradually prepared to do without them, while they might gather strength to continue without Government aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Accordingly Congress introduced in the appropriation act of 1895 a limitation on the use of public moneys in sectarian schools. This act appropriated under the heading \u201cSupport of Schools\u201d \u201cfor the support of Indian and industrial schools and for other purposes . . . -$1,164,350, . . . provided, that the Secretary of the Interior shall make contracts, but only with the present -contract schools for the education of Indian pupils during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, to an extent not exceeding eighty per 'cent of the amount so used in the fiscal year 1895, and the Government shall as early as practicable make provision for the education of the Indians in Government schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This limitation of eighty per cent was to be expended for contract schools, which were those that up to that time had educated Indians through the use of public moneys, and had no relation and did not refer to \u201c Tribal Funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In the appropriation act of 1896,. under the same-.heading, \u201cSupport of Schools,\u201d the appropriation of public money of $1,235,000 was limited by a proviso that contracts should only be made at places where non-s\u00e9ctarian schools cannot be' provided for Indian children to an amount not exceeding fifty per cent of the amount so used for the fiscal year 1895, and im- . mediately following the appropriation of public money appears the expression, \u201cand it is hereby declared to be the settled policy of the Government to hereafter make no appropriation whatever for education in any sectarian school.\u201d This limitation, if it can be given effect as such, manifestly applies to the\" use of public moneys gratuitously appropriated for such purpose, and not to moneys belonging to the Indians themselves. In the appropriation act of 1897 the. same declaration of policy occurs as a limitation on the appropriation of public moneys for the support of schools, and the amount applicable to Contract schools was limited to forty, per cent of the amount used in 1895. In the act of 1898 the amount applicable to contract schools was limited to thirty per cent, and in the act of 1899 the amount so applicable was limited to fifteen per cent, these words being.added: \u201c.this being the final appropriation for sectarian schools.\u201d The declaration of the settled policy of the Government is found only in the acts of 1896 and 1897, and was entirely carried out. by the reductions provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Since 1899 public moneys are appropriated under the heading \u201cSupport of Schools\u201d \u201cfor the support of Indian and industrial schools and for other educational purposes,\u201d without saying anything about sectarian schools. This was not needed, as the effect of the legislation was to make subsequent appropriations \"for education mean that sectarian schools were excluded in sharing in them, unless otherwise provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>As has been shown, in 1868 the United States made a treaty with the Sioux Indians, under which the Indians made large cessions of land and other rights. In consideration of this the United States agreed that for every thirty children a house should- be provided and a teacher competent to teach the elementary branches of our English education should be furnished for twenty years. In 1877, in consideration of further land cessions, the United States agreed to furnish all necessary aid to assist the Indians in the work of civilization and furnish them schools and instruction in mechanical and agricultural arts, as provided by the Treaty of 1868. In 1889 Congress extended the obligation of the treaty for twenty years, subject to such modifications as Congress should deem most effective, to secure the Indians equivalent benefits of such education. Thereafter, in every annual Indian appropriation act, there was an appropriation to carry out the terms of this treaty, under the heading \u201cFulfilling Treaty Stipulations with and Support of Indian Tribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">These appropriations rested on different grounds from the gratuitous appropriations of public moneys under the heading \u201cSupport of Schools.\u201d The two subjects were separately treated in each act, and, naturally, as they are essentially different in character. One is the gratuitous appropriation of public moneys for the purpose of Indian education, but the \u201cTreaty Fund\u201d is not public money in- this sense. It is the Indians\u2019 money, or at least is dealt with by the Government as if it belonged -to them, as morally it does. It differs from the \u201cTrust' Fund\u201d in this: The \u201cTrust Fund\u201d has been set aside for the Indians and the income expended for their benefit, which expenditure required no annual appropriation. The whole amount due the Indians for certain land cessions was appropriated in one lump sum by the act of 1889, 25 Sta,t. 888, chap. 405. This.\u201cTrust Fund\u201d is held for the Indians and not distributed <em>per capita, </em>being held as property in common. The money is distributed in accordance with the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, but really beb -gs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the Indians. The President declared it to be the moral right of the Indians to have this \u201cTrust Fund\u201d applied to the education of the Indians in the schools of their choice, and.the same view was entertained by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and the Court of Appeals of the District. But the \u201cTreaty Fund\u201d has exactly the same characteristics. They are moneys belonging really to the Indians. They are the price of land ceded by the Indians to the Government. The only difference is that in the \u201cTreaty Fund\u201d the debt to the Indians created and secured by the treaty is paid by annual appropriations. They are not gratuitous appropriations of public moneys, but the payment,, as we repeat; of a treaty debt in installments. We perceive no justification for applying the proviso or declaration of policy to the payment of treaty obligations, the two things being distinct and different in nature and having no relation to each other, except that both are technically appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Some reference is made to the Constitution, in respect to this contract with the Burean of Catholic Indian Missions. It is not contended that it is unconstitutional, and. it could not be. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Bradfield, </em>12 App. D. C. 475; Bradfield v. <em>Roberts, </em>175 U. S. 291. But it is contended that the spirit of the Constitution requires that the declaration of policy that the Government \u201cshall make no appropriation whatever for education in any sectarian schools\u201d should be treated as applicable, on the ground that the actions of the United States were to always be undenominational, and that, therefore, the Government can never act in a sectarian capacity, either in the use of its own funds or in that of the funds of others, in respect of which it is a trustee; hence that even the Sioux trust fund cannot be applied for education in Catholic schools, even though the owners of the fund so desire it. But we cannot concede the proposition that Indians cannot be allowed to use their own money to educate their children in the schools of their own choice because the Government is necessarily undenominational, as it cannot make any law respecting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Court of Appeals well said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cThe \u2018Treaty\u2019 and \u2018Trust\u2019 moneys are the only moneys that the Indians can lay claim to as matter of right; the only sums on which they are entitled to rely as theirs for education; and while these moneys are not delivered to them in hand, yet the money must not only be provided, but be expended, for their benefit and in part for their education; it seems inconceivable that Congress should have intended to prohibit them from receiving religious education at their own cost if they so desired it; such an intent would be one \u2018to prohibit the free exercise of religion\u2019 amongst the-Indians, and-such would be the effect of the construction for which the complainants contend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The <em>cestuis que trust </em>cannot be deprived of their rights by the trustee in the exercise of power implied.
