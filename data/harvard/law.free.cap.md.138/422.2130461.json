Viola O. Boggs in November, 1914:, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in New York County, a bill of complaint against William D. Boggs, her husband, for an absolute divorce on the ground of adultery. In addition to asking for a dissolution of the marriagei, the complainant in that suit also asked for the custody of Thomas Brandon Boggs, an infant, the only child of said marriage, who was born April 18th, 1905, and that provision be made out of the property and income of the defendant for the support of the plaintiff and the said child, and for counsel fee and expenses. At the time that suit was instituted both parties were residents of the State of New York, and in due course the defendant was summoned to answer the complaint, but failing to answer or appear, an interlocutory judgment by default was entered against him on January 25th, 1915, and on May 21st, 1915, a \u201cfinal judgment on default\u201d was entered against him, after testimony had been taken in support of the bill. In that judgment or decree, after reciting that the \u201cdefendant being fully in fault and a decision and interlocutory decree of divorce in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant having been made on the 25th day of January, 1915,\u201d and duly filed, and no subsequent order affecting it having been passed, the court dissolved the marriage and divorced the plaintiff from the defendant, allowing the plaintiff the privilege of remarriage but denying that privilege to the defendant without the court\u2019s permission, and it further decreed that the plaintiff have the custody of the infant child Thomas Brandon Boggs, but allowed the 'father the privilege.of access to the child at stated periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>During the pendency of this divorce proceeding and before tbe final decree, the parties to it entered into; an agreement \u201cfor the purpose of settling out of court the questions of alimony, counsel fees and the custody of said child.\u201d This agreement provided that, in the event the provisions thereof were faithfully performed, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for counsel fees and alimony should be withdrawn. The provisions referred to were in substance as follows: (a) that the defendant would convey for the benefit of the wife and son property in Bergen County, New Jersey, valued at $900, and (b) his interest in a certain agreement valued at $625, and (c) that he would pay for the benefit, of his wife $825, and (d) would return to her a diamond ring, her property, or a pawn ticket therefor and $200, or $400, the value of the ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In consideration of these; provisions the complainant in the divorce suit agreed \u201cto accept the same and to maintain and support herself and one child of said marriage until he is able to support bimself, and tbe said second party agrees not to make any further claim on tbe party of the first part for the support of herself or their said child, without, however, waiving the benefit of the provisions of Sections 1759 and 1771 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or any other law in such case made and provided.\u201d In addition to what has boon set forth, the agreement also contained other provisions;, which need not for the purposes of this case he referred to further than to say that they related to the custody of the child, the separation of the parties, the enforcement of the terms of the agreement, and that it looked to, hut was not necessarily dependent upon, a dissolution of the marriage. It also provided that the complainant should have certain furniture, and that the defendant would indemnify the complainant against the payment of liens and charges owed by him on the properties conveyed to her, and that it was to be construed according to the law of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Some time after the entry of the final decree in the divorce case, the defendant William D. Boggs removed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Maryland, where he appears to have remarried and, at the time of the institution of this suit, owned and operated a farm valued at some twelve or fifteen thousand dollars near Orumpton in Queen Anne\u2019s County, which he appears to have paid for in part with money \u2022 received by him from his father\u2019s estate after the divorce had been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Viola C. Boggs, the plaintiff in this case, continued to live-in Kew York, after she had been divorced from her husband, and for the purpose of supporting herself and her child she took employment as a clerk. The property she received under the agreement referred to- did not yield the amount at which it was appraised in the agreement, so that she actually received from the proceeds of a sale of it and in cash paid by her husband but $1,625 for tbe support of herself and her son. She had no productive property of her own and, her earnings being insufficient to support herself and child, she-applied the money received under the agreement to their support, and when that was expended she pawned her1 jewelry for the same purpose. From time to time during this period. Mrs. Boggs made demand upon the defendant for financial assistance in the maintenance and education of their son and,, upon his refusal to- contribute anything for that purpose, she-sued him in the Circuit Court for Kent County for various-sums aggregating $1,738.78, which she claimed to have expended for the support and education of their infant son between May 23rd, 1915, and April 5th, 1919, in which case-the verdict and judgment were in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Subsequently, on January 6th, 1920, she brought this action against the defendant for necessary expenditures made-by her for the maintenance and education of their infant son from April 6th, 1919, to January 6th, 1920. The declaration as amended is in assumpsit and contains the common counts in the usual form, and in connection with it there was filed a bill of particulars setting out in detail the items comprising the cause of action. A demurrer to the <em>war. </em>as amended was interposed' and overruled, and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>then filed three pleas in bar of the action. The first plea set up' the divorce proceeding to which we have referred; the seeond set up- the divorce proceeding together with the agreement to which reference has also been made, while the third plea set up the action and judgment in Kent County between the same parties in the following language.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201cThat in and by a suit brought in the Circuit Court for Kent County, Maryland, Ko. 27 Trials, Apr. Term, 1919, in which Yiola C. Boggs, plaintiff, sued William D. Boggs, defendant, for the sum of $1,728.78 dollars for the maintenance and support of their infant from May 22, 1915, to April 5, 1919, a verdict was rendered for said defendant, and a judgment for said defendant entered thereon. And that said judgment was rendered on the same cause of action mentioned in the declaration, and still is a subsisting judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The court sustained a demurrer to the first and third pleas and overruled a demurrer to the second plea. The plaintiff replied to the second plea (1) that the agreement was invalid in so far as it related to the support of the child, (2) that it was not kept by the defendant, and (3) that the plaintiff had expended in the support and maintenance of the child all the monies received under it and that, since April 6th, 1919, she had been without means or money to furnish necessaries for his support, maintenance and education. (In referring to these pleadings, where the pleading first filed has been voluntarily amended, it is treated as an original pleading.) While the docket entries are somewhat confused, it is inferred that a demurrer was filed to this replication and overruled. The defendant then joined issue on it and filed the general issue as an additional plea, upon which the plaintiff joined issue. Upon the issues thus made a trial was had which resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The record contains seven exceptions, one of which relates to a supposed disqualification of one of the presiding judges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>two to rulings of the trial court upon the prayers, one to the court\u2019s refusal to permit counsel in his opening statement to \u201crefer to the records in the case in Kent County\u201d and to a remark of one of the judges sitting in the case made in connection with that ruling, while the others refer to matters-of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The questions presented for our consideration by these exceptions, and by the several demurrers to which reference has been madei, may be thus stated: first, whether the appellee is estopped either by the decree in the divorce proceedings in the State of Kew York, or by her agreement made in connection therewith, from maintaining an action for necessaries actually supplied for the support and education of the appellee\u2019s infant son; second, whether this case was, as a result of the action in Kent County between the same parties, <em>res adjudicates, </em>and third, whether one of the Judges who presided in that case was by that fact disqualified from presiding in the present case, and these questions we will consider in the order in which they have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In proceedings for divorce where, upon the application of the wife, she is granted a divorce and the custody of the infant children of the marriage, but the decree granting the divorce makes no provision for their support, there is a sharp conflict in the decisions of the courts of the several States of the Union, as to- whether the father, from whose custody they have been taken, or the mother, into whose custody they have been given, is liable for such reasonable expense as is necessarily incurred for their support and education. One line of cases holds that a decree granting the mother the custody of the children, but making no provision for their maintenance, relieves the father of any further liability for their reasonable support, and this rule and the reasons upon which it is said to rest are very well -defined in <em>Nelson, Divorce cured Separation, </em>Par. 983, in which it is sad: \u201cThe father is not liable for the support of his children where the decree has granted the custody of the children to the wife and contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>no provision for their support. There are several reasons for this. The statute having made it the duty of the court to provide for the custody and maintenance of the children on divorce, it will he presumed that the decree hasi made all the provision that was necessary. The decree is conclusive as to the mutual rights and obligations of the parties, subject to the right to have such decree modified as subsequent exigencies may require. The divorce makes the parties strangers. The father is not liable to a stranger who furnishes the children with necessaries! unless under such'circumstances that a contract will he implied.\u201d This view, however, is not in accord either with the weight of authority or thei trend of the later decisions, and is moreover, in onr opinion, opposed to a sound and just regard for the interest of society and the welfare of the children, who, while not parties to the proceeding, are, nevertheless, profoundly affected by its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The primary liability for the support of the children during the marriage of the parents is imposed by the common law upon the father, and that obligation is by the statute in force in this State made imperative and mandatory. <em>Art. </em>27, <em>Sec. </em>75, <em>Code Pub. Gen. Laws. </em>As a correlative incident of that duty the father at common law was entitled to the custody and to the services of the children he was required to support. These principles are so generally recognized that they may he assumed. But when the marriage relation is dissolved, and the custody of his children taken from the father, the question as to whether1 his obligation to provide for their reasonable support survives his loss of their custody is not so well settled. Reason and the weight of authority say that it does, and that view was adopted by this Court in <em>Alvey </em>v. <em>Hartwig, </em>106 Md. 254. In that case the plaintiff sued the defendant, from whom she had been divorced in a proceeding, of which he was notified by publication, for necessaries furnished their children, whose custody had been by the divorce decree awarded to her. The defense1, as stated in the opinion, was:' \u201cThe contention of the'defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>that the law does not imply an obligation on the part of the defendant, to pay the plaintiff, for her support and maintenance of the minor children of the marriage, where she has obtained a divorce from him and has in the decree, been awarded the care and custody of such children; and the decree is silent as to the maintenance thereof; that the right of the parent to the services of the children and the obligation of maintenance of the same, devolving upon the parent-are reciprocal rights and obligations.\u201d In considering that defence the court in that case said: \u201cAs the duty of a father to support his minor children lies at the root of the controversy in this case we will examine the law on that question first, for there is a difference of opinion in the courts of various states as to this. In some the common law is interpreted as casting the burden of support upon the parents equally, and some casting it primarily upon the father, and only secondarily upon the mother. Chancellor Johnson, in <em>Thompson et al. </em>v. <em>Dorsey et al., </em>4 Md. Ch. Dec. 151, uses this language: <em>\u2018A </em>father is bound to educate and maintain his infant children, and if another person performs this natural duty for him with his knowledge and consent, the father is liable to pay a reasonable sum to such person.\u2019 Chancellor Bland in <em>Addison </em>v. <em>Bowie, </em>2 Bl. 585, says: \u00a3A father is bound to maintain his infant children, if able.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201cBy the Act of 1896, Chapter 13, and 1904, Chapter 44, the wilful neglect to provide for the support of a minor child is also a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u201cBut in this case the appellant claims that even if that be the law in Maryland \u2014 and we think it is beyond dispute \u2014 that he, the appellant, is released from this obligation to support his infant child for the reason that his wife has obtained a divorce from him and has been granted the custody of said child.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u201cWhatever may be the decisions in other states, and while there are undoubtedly conflicting opinions, we cannot give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>our assent to the position taken hy the appellant on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u201cMany courts of high authority have declared most emphatically that it is the duty of' the father to provide reasonably for tbe maintenance of his minor children, and that this liability is in nowise affected by the fact that the custody of said children may have been taken away from him by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. This primary obligation arises not alone from the husband\u2019s common law right to his wife\u2019s estate, but rather from his natural headship of the family, and upon his being by nature and the present constitution of society the bread winner and provider. The law also gives him the primary right to his children\u2019s services and earnings-, which it could not in fairness do- if the mother were in the first place equally bound for tbeir support. There may be and doubtless are many cases, where the right to the custody and services of the children are taken away from the father because of his misconduct. Ilis natural right to this qustody and these services is forfeited by his misconduct, and surely if his misconduct works a forfeiture of his rights- to custody and earnings, he ought not to he absolved from his natural and usual duty of supporting them. To allow* it to- bring about any such result, would simply be allowing the father to- take advantage of his own wrong, for all a father would have to do to avoid his natural obligation to his children would be to desert his family, conduct, himself in such a way as to show that he is an unfit person to have the custody of his children, and then, when on account of his own wrongful doings and unfitness, the court takes the custody of the children away from him, and awards; it to the mother, it relieves him of the obligation which the law of nature surd the law of the land places upon him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">It is true that in that ease, in referring to the contention made there that, since the decree awarding the custody of the children to the mother was silent as to support., the plaintiff was for that reason estopped from maintaining a suit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>their father for such support because he had been deprived of their custody, the court used this expression, \u201cas we view it, if the defendant had been summoned in the divorce case, it would be dear that the plaintiff would be barred in the case at bar,\u201d but we cannot assume that by that language it was meant to decide that, where the defendant in a divorce case is summoned but fails to appear, and no provision is in'ade in the divorce decree for the support of the children, whose' Custody is given to the mother, that the liability for the 'children\u2019s support becomes a litigated and adjudicated question, on the ground that the court had the power, had it chosen to exercise it, to have determined that question, because such a construction would be contrary to the rule stated earlier in the opinion, but the court must by that expression be understood to have meant that where in such cases the liability of the father for the support of the children has been a subject of actual litigation or controversy and the court under such circumstances has ruled in regard to it, that then all parties to the suit are bound by the decree', and that this is the proper construction is, we think, -clear from the following language, which occurs after the expression to which we have referred: \u201cThe doctrine of estoppel is that as between parties to an action each is bound by orders or decree passed with reference to subject matters over which the court had jurisdiction, but because the court may have been silent on some subjects, it will not be presumed to have gone into them all, <em>and intended to pass judgment on points Upon which it was silent, </em>and especially would this be true where the decree of divorce was based upon publication, and where the court which granted the divorce could not by any possibility have had jurisdiction to'compel the father to make an allowance for the support of the children.\u201d These principles are in accordance both with the weight of authority and the trend and direction of the modern development of the law. In referring to the conflict in the authorities in regard to them it has been said:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cOne line of authorities holds that, unless there is some statutory provisions to the contrary, a decree, awarding custody of the children to the mother, hut making no provision for their support, has the legal effect to relieve the father of liability for the reasonable support of the children while in the mother\u2019s custody, unless, it has been held, he had so conducted himself that it became necessary and proper to deprive him of their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u201cA majority of the well-considered cases! denounce and condemn this cold and illogical doctrine, which not only ignores the rights and welfare of the child, hut also enables the husband and father to take advantage of his own wrong, and hold that the legal obligation of a father for the support of his minor children is not impaired by a decree of divorce at the suit of his wife for his misconduct, which gives the' custody of the children to her, hut is silent as to their support. This liability is not limited or controlled by the regulations governing the allowance of alimony to the wife. If, under such circumstances', he refuses or neglects to support them, the mother may recover from him in an original action a reasonable sum for necessaries furnished for their support after such decree; but the right, of action does not lie until the husband refuses to respond to a just claim for the child\u2019s maintenance.\u201d 19 <em>C. J. </em>354.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In the case of <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>125 Tenn. 116, Ann Cases, 1913 C, 294, the court, discussing the question, said: \u201cThe reasons favoring the majority view are that the law of nature and the law of the land require of the father the support of his minor children. This is a definite and fixed obligation, which both the children and society itself are entitled to have enforced against him. If divorce is sought by his wife, the mother of the children, it can only be obtained by her for some wrong or dereliction on the part of such husband and father, shown to have been committed. A divorce so obtained, at the wife\u2019s suit, cannot weaken the father\u2019s obligation to his children. The decree of divorce is founded upon his mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>conduct. To hold that such a decree discharged him from the support of his children would be to allow him to profit by his perversity, or, in. familiar phrase, to take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d To the same effect is the case of <em>Pretzinger </em>v. <em>Pretzinger, </em>45 Ohio St. 457, in which it is said: \u201cIssues of fact were joined between the parties, and, upon submission to the court, they were found for the defendant in error; * * * Izora Pretzinger was divorced from her husband by reason of his misconduct, and his ill-treatment and neglect of her; and was, in consequence, awarded the custody, nurture, education, and care of their minor child, then about eight-years of age. The court decreed an allowance to her as alimony, but it does not appear that an allowance was made to comp\u00e9nsate her for the expense of her son\u2019s maintenance. For several years after the granting of the divorce, she furnished to her son such boarding, clothing, care and attention as were necessary and appropriate to his comfort and condition in life. When the divorce was granted the father' was insolvent, but at the rendition of the judgment in the case at bar he was solvent, and able to support his son. The duty of the father to provide reasonably for the maintenance of his minor children, if -he be of ability, is a principle of natural law. And he is under obligations to support them,, not only by the laws of nature, but by the laws of the land. As said -by Ckaivcellok Kewt : \u2018The wants and weaknesses of children render it necessary that some person maintains them, and the voice of nature has pointed out the parent as the most fit and proper person.\u2019 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Cam. </em>190. And see <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>3 Ohio, 100; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>16 Johns. 281. This natural duty is not to be evaded by the husband\u2019s so conducting himself as to render it necessary to dissolve the bonds of matrimony, and give to the mother the custody and care of the infant offspring. It is not the policy of the law to- deprive children of their rights- on account of the dissensions of their parents, to which they are not parties, or to enable the father to convert his own miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>duct into a shield against parental liability. The divorce may deprive him of the custody and services of his children, and of the rights of guardianship', against his will; but if, by the judgment of the court, and upon competent and sufficient evidence, he is found to be an unfit person to exorcise parental control, while the mother is in all respects the proper person to be clothed with such authority, he cannot justly complain.\u201d And in 9 <em>R. C. L. </em>296 it is said: \u201cAccording to the weight and reason of authority and the trend of the more recent cases, the view prevails that where a divorce is granted at the suit of the wife, and the custody of the minor children is awarded to her but no provision is made in the divorce decree for their support, the wife may maintain an action against the husband to recover for expenses incurred by her for their support; but on the ancient and academic theory that the husband has been deprived by the decree of the custody, society and services of the child, which was the foundation of his common law liability for its support, some authorities hold to a contrary rule, and assert that there is no liability on the part of the father for his children\u2019s future support, except as provided for in the divorce decree or as may be imposed by its modification, either to the wife or to a third person. Assuming that there is any force in the argument based upon the common law doctrine referred to, it has been held that the father by bis own wrong forfeits certain of his common law rights, and that he will not be permitted to plead such wrong as an excuse for relieving himself from the obligation to support bis children. The just and more natural reason, however*, is that it is not the policy of the law to deprive children of their rights on account of the dissensions of their parents, for causes of which they are innocent, and by proceedings to which they are not parties. The legal and natural duty of the father to support liis children is not to be evaded by him on the ground of his own wrongdoing, or even of any dissensions whatsoever with his wife. A natural father would not think of doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>so, and. an unnatural one should not he permitted to do so.\u201d And these views are further supported by a number of eases which are collected in 19 <em>C. J. </em>354, 355, and in 9 <em>R. C. L. </em>480:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">From what has been said it is apparent that the conclusion we have reached is not affected by the provisions of the blew York'statutes to which our attention has been called, even if we assume those statutes are before us for consideration. Those statutes only confer upon the court an authority in the allowance of alimony which it did not exercise in the case under its consideration, and no sufficient reason has been suggested why the decree in that case should, in so far as this case is concerned, have any other effect than would a decree of a court of this State made under similar circumstances. ISTor does a consideration of the cases of <em>Kamp </em>v. <em>Kamp, </em>59 N. Y. 212, and <em>Salomon </em>v. <em>Salomon, </em>101 App. Div. 588, 92 N. Y. Supp. 184, affect this conclusion, since the latter involved only the right of a party to a final decree for divorce to have it reopened and modified under the authority of the statutes in question, while the former related to an application for alimony made eighteen years after the final dissolution of the marriage. In that case, by the decree of dissolution, the relations between the parties to the suit were finally and completely terminated, but not so as to their relation to their children. The decree could not destroy the relation between parent and child, nor should any decree destroy the obligations incident to that relation, unless the children are in some manner represented in the proceeding in which such decree is entered. <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>154 N. Y. App. Div. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">This brings us to a consideration of the agreement and its effect upon the rights of the infant child of the parties to it, because the question before us is the right of the child to support during its infancy and not the right of the wife to alimony. The law in respect to such agreements! was very carefully examined and clearly stated in <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Emer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>son, </em>120 Md. 596. In that case the agreement was made during the pendency of the divorce case, but it was submitted to and approved by the court and its provisions embodied in the decree. In referring to it this Court said: \u201cThe law has generally regarded all agreements made during the pending of the suit for divorce, as void, as being against public policy. Too easy is it for the parties to come to such an arrangement on property division as to amount to collusion on the question of the divorce itself. The practice is common, nevertheless!, for courts to incorporate in their decree provisions as to alimony which have been agreed to by the parties. The court, however, must be satisfied that the agreement is not the result of collusion on the main point of the divorce. The practice is to submit the agreement to the court, and if the court is satisfied that it is a proper settlement it will receive the sanction of a decree. 2 <em>Bishop, Marriage and Divorce, </em>Sec. 702; <em>Nelson, Marriage and Divorce, </em>Sec. 915. Then the validity of the award depends not upon the agreement, but upon the judgment or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u201cIt was said, <em>Moon </em>v. <em>Baum, </em>58 Ind. 194: \u2018It is not competent for the husband and wife to make a valid agreement, as to alimony, during the pendency of the suit for divorce, independent of the sanction of the decree of divorce.\u2019 In <em>Southworth </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>168 Mass. 511, it was said: \u2018That the stipulation for alimony to be decreed in the suit for divorce added nothing to the force of the decree, and did not affect the power of the court to change the rights of the parties by further orders or decrees respecting alimony.\u2019 In <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>14 N. H. 259, the court said: \u2018It may be conceded that a judgment or decree rendered by agreement cannot be set aside or modified without the consent of the parties, except for fraud, when the agreement does not require judicial sanction to give it validity. * * * This principle does not apply because a decree for alimony rests not upon the agreement, but upon the decision of judicial questions raised by the presentation of the agreement.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>While such agreements are not in all cases and under all circumstances necessarily void, yet they are usually regarded with suspicion, and while the court may, in making its decree, take them into consideration, it is not hound to do so, nor will any such agreement he permitted to release or relieve either party thereto of any natural or legal obligation owed to the children of the marriage, when it would not he to the interest of or for the welfare of the children to permit that to he done. <em>Kremelberg </em>v. <em>Kremelberg, </em>52 Md. 563; 19 C. J. 347, 340, 250; 13 C. J. 463; <em>Nelson, Divorce and Separation, </em>par. 975; 15 L. R. A. (N. S.) 746. But in all such cases the court, in determining the validity and effect of such agreements, will treat the welfare of the child as the paramount and controlling consideration, and will not recognize, in so far as the rights of infant children are concerned, the validity of any agreement which is not fair and just and for their welfare and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Applying these principles to the facts before us, the agreement in question here cannot he sustained as a bar to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It was made during the pendency of a proceeding for divorce brought by the wife against the husband on tbe ground of adultery. By its recitals it was made for tbe purpose of settling out of court the very questions upon which the court was asked to rule and its effect was to substitute, for1 the court\u2019s disinterested and impartial judgment, based upon all the material facts and circumstances of the case affecting\" the welfare of the child, an agreement between the adulterous spouse and the mother, who desired the custody of her child hut had not the means to support it. It also bore the marks of collusion because, not only did the husband fail to defend the suit, but be insinuated in a letter to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, written in reply to a demand made by him for assistance in the support of her son, that there was a substantial defense to the divorce proceeding. In that letter he said: \u201cIf your client brings the action against me you mention I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>shall bring an action in the Yew York courts for the possession of my son. Yo one knows as well as she does just what I mean by this. It might be well for you to remind your client of the truth about the charge oil which she obtained her divorce, and upon which the contract and possession of the boy was based.\u201d Certainly'the welfare of the child was likely to receive scant consideration in an agreement entered into under such circumstances, and an examination of the agreement demonstrates the soundness of this conclusion. At a time when the child was but ten years of age', and the mother without means of her own, the agreement set apart for the support of the child property the sale of which yielded $875. Manifestly such an amount was inadequate for the reasonable support and education of the child during its minority, and in fixing it the pa-rties. to the agreement were not guided by a proper consideration of his! welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">For these reasons, therefore, in our opinion, the plaintiff was not estopped, by the decree in the divorce case or the agreement, from maintaining this action for necessaries essential to the child\u2019s welfare, which the mother into whose custody he had been given was unable to&gt; supply. Yor in our opinion was: the: judgment in. the Circuit Court for Kent County a bar to this action. To support a defence of <em>res adjud\u00edcala, </em>it must appear that the right relied on or the wrong complained of in the case in which that defense is! asserted was identical with, the subject matter of the first suit. In <em>Whitehurst </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Md. 514, the rule is stated in the following language: \u201cThe jury are to inquire under the plea of former recovery, or <em>\u2018res adjudicada,\u2019 </em>whether the right asserted, or the wrong complained of, is virtually the same, or identical, substantially with that involved in the first suit.\u201d And Mr. P\u2019oe in his work on <em>Pleading, </em>Section 655, in referring to the same defense, says: \u201cUnder it the question at issue is the virtual identity of the right asserted or the wrong complained of in the former suit with that mentioned in the second, and this identity is to be determined not by the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ings only, but when submitted to\u2019 the jury, by parol proof.\u201d The subject matter of the action in Kent County was not identical with the subject matter of this action. Indeed, the two were entirely distinct. The issue in that case was whether certain sums expended for the son of the parties to tire action prior to April 5, 1919, were reasonable necessaries essential to his support, while this action is for necessaries furnished the same child after April 5, 1919. It may have been that the jury in the former case did not consider expenditures for which recovery was sought reasonably necessary to the child\u2019s support, or that said expenditures had been made at all. A finding therefore that the plaintiff had not furnished necessaries for the child\u2019s support prior to April 5, 1919, could not conceivably decide that she had not supplied such necessaries after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The next point we are called upon to consider is whether one of the judges who presided at the trial of the case in Kent County was by reason of that fact disqualified from sitting in this case. Having decided that the issues in the two cases were different, no reason has been suggested why any such disqualification should exist. Without deciding whether the judge would have been disqualified had the subject matter and issues been the same it is sufficient to say that in our opinion he was not disqualified in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">What we have said disposes of the rulings on the several demurrers t\u00bb the pleadings, and to. the first and fourth exceptions which relate to the supposed disqualification of one of the trial judges and to' the rulings on the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The second exception relates to. the court\u2019s action in refusing a prayer offered at the conclusion of the plaintifPs ease but, as the defendant elected to go on with his case and offered testimony in support thereof, that exception cannot be considered. <em>Barabasz </em>v. <em>Kabat, </em>91 Md. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The third exception relates to the action of the trial court-in refusing to permit counsel for defendant in his opening statement to the jury to refer to the record of the case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Kent County. As that was a collateral matter not relevant to any issue in this ease we find no error in this ruling:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The fifth exception was taken to the ruling of the court in refusing to admit certain typewriting on the cover of the agreement referred to above. This writing formed no part of the agreement and was obviously immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The sixth exception, which is: not connected with the: other exceptions., relates to the exclusion of certain portions of the record in the Kent County ease. Inasmuch as these records appear to have been admitted in evidence, and since tbis particular bill of exceptions is not connected with any other bill of exceptions in the case, it is not clear why it is submitted, for our consideration at all, but it is clear from the record that no injury resulted to the defendant, from the ruling of which he complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The seventh exception relates to an objection to certain testimony of the plaintiff as to payments made by ber for tbe support of ber son before April 6, 1919. As this testimony complemented other testimony in the case and showed the application of the money received by the plaintiff from the father of the child under the agreement above referred to, we find no prejudicial error in the court\u2019s ruling in regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Finding' no reversible error1 in the rulings of the lower court, the judgment in this ease will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs to the appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
