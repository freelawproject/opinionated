The first appeal was from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and the judgment was reversed by this Court for errors in the prayers fixing the measure of damages. This appeal is from a judgment in favor of the defendant, and brings up for review the action of the court below on the prayers construing; the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tract between tbe plaintiff and defendant, and its rulings on tbe evidence! embraced in two bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">In 1914 and 1915 the defendant company was engaged in the manufacture and sale of motor trucks of diffeomt makes and sizes, and maintained a factory at Plainfield, New Jersey, where it built the chassis, and a plant in New York, where the bodies of the trucks were constructed and placed on the chassis. In the fall of 1914 the plaintiff was contemplating starting a truck line for the transportation of miscellaneous freight between Baltimore and Havre de Grace, over the state road then under construction, and with that end in view he got into&gt; communication with Mr. Charles T. Cronin, who represented the defendant in Baltimore, and who gave the plaintiff one of the defendant\u2019s catalogp.es, containing \u201cgeneral, mechanical specifications\u201d of the chassis manufactux-ed by it, and also \u201cgave- him a demonstration of what\u201d a 6% ton Saurer \u201ctruck could do.\u201d The road between Havre de Gx\u2019ace and Baltimore was completed in the spring of 1915, and in June the plaintiff went to see Mr. Cronin again, and Mx*. Cronin took him to the defendant\u2019s factory ixx Plainfield and fx\u2019om there to its plant in New Yoxh, whex*e he met Mr. Fetzer, head of the defendant\u2019s sales department, and Mr. Fulton, vice-president of the defendaxxt. The plaintiff states that he explained to them that he wanted a truck of \u201cfive ton capacity,\u201d and the purpose fox* which he wanted it, and that they x\u2019ecommended a 'Saurer truck, with a llL/s-inch wheel base, and a body like one they showed him and which they were building for axxother maxx to haul green groeexfies in. Mr. Cronin, a witness for the defendant, testified that when he took the plaintiff to Plaixxfield and New York he tried to ixxterest him ixx a Mack trxxck, that \u201cthe Saxxrer truck xxsed approximately 66 2/3 per cent, of the amount of gasoline that the Mack truck used axxd weighed 5,900 pouxxds, while the weight of the Mack was 8500\u201d pounds, and that the plaintiff thought that the Mack truck was too heavy and would require too much gasoline and oil. The plaintiff further testified that shortly after that visit he had an occasion to go t\u00bb New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>York and went to the defendant\u2019s factory again to see the gentlemen he had met there, that the body that they had previously recommended had then been completed and was on the chassis, that he told them he thought it would bei satisfactory, except that it was open in front, that they suggested that they could make a glass front, and insisted on getting up a sketch, which they did while he was there, and later mailed him a- blue print of it, tbat in talking to Mr. Fetzer and bis assistant about tbe body, be asked them particularly about the weight of the body, and they told him they could not tell him positively about that, hut that he could speak to Mr. Callahan, who was getting up the sketch of the body, and who could give him \u201cpositive information\u201d as to what the body would weigh; tbat be then talked to Mr. Oallahan, and tbat he said to the plaintiff, \u201cMr. Oldfield, it will weigh not less than 1250 pounds and not more than 1500 pounds. You can depend on that\u201d; that it was in that connection they told him they would send him a blue print of tbe body, which they did, and on the 28th of June, 1915, the Monday or Tuesday following the receipt of the blue print, be went to Baltimore to see Mr. Bulon, the defendant\u2019s representative there, who had a copy of the Hue print and a contract of purchase already signed by the defendant company; that he agreed to purchase the truck on the terms set out in the contract, which he then signed, and the truck was delivered to and paid for by him on the 16th of August, 1915. The contract, which, with the blue print, was offered in evidence, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae8\">\u201cInternational Motor Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cGeneral Offices,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201cBroadway and Fifty-seventh Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cOriginal.

On cross-examination he1 stated that he had been with the defendant since 1912 and had probably designed as many as five hundred bodies; \u201cthat he would design a body of the typo to fit the chassis that the purchaser ordered or was going to order; that they did not have a standard body; * * * that the plaintiff wanted a body so that he could carry as large a load as possible on the. truck, but it was to be a five-ton truck with a long wheel base; * * * that for a five-ton long! wheel base truck that body was suitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">The plaintiff also offered evidence tending to show that the truck was defective; that the body of the truck weighed 4350 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>pounds and that the chassis weighed 6130 pounds; that the truck did not have a \u201clive load capacity\u201d of 10,000 pounds, and that in consequence thereof he had difficulty and incurred expense in operating' it over the route between Baltimore and Havre de Grace and sustained considerable loss in his business, and after using the truck about fifteen months sold it for $100. The undisputed evidence shows that the \u201clive load capacity\u201d of a chassis or truck means the amount of freight it will carry, exclusive of the weight of the chassis and body.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Leaving out of consideration all that was said by the plaintiff and the representatives of the defendant prior to the execution of the contract in question, and without regard to any statements made by the plaintiff, or representations of the agents of the defendant, leading up&lt; to the execution of the contract, it is apparent that what the defendant contracted to furnish, and the plaintiff agreed to purchase, was a Saurer chassis, with a maximum live load capacity of ten thousand pounds, a wheel base of 111% inches and a body made in accordance with the blue print sent to- the plaintiff and referred to in th^e body of the contract. As it is conceded that the \u201clive load capacity\u201d of a chassis or track means the amount of freight it will carry, exclusive of the weight of the chassis and body, and as the contract <em>expressly </em>guaranteed that the chassis would have a live load capacity of ten thousand pounds-, it is equally apparent that if the chassis or truck in question did not have the capacity so- specified and guaranteed it was not a compliance with the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It is earnestly contended by the appellee that as- the thing sold under the contract was a \u201cSaurer chassis with a maximum guaranteed live load capacity of ten thousand pounds with regular equipment in accordance with standard specifications, which are to- be considered as part of the contract when accepted by the purchaser,\u201d etc., and as the catalogue of the defendant, under the heading, \u201cSaurer five ton, general, mechanical specifications,\u201d contained the clause; \u201ccapacity\u2014 normal carrying capacity inclusive of body, 11,500 pounds,\u201d the contract should be construed to mean that the track sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to the plaintiff would liavo a capacity of 11,500 pounds', inclusive of the body, or in other words', that the truck would have a capacity of 10,000 pounds' in addition to&gt; a body weighing 1500 pounds. To give the contract that construction would not only require us to ignore the conceded meaning of the terins \u201clive load capacity,\u201d used in the contract, but would also require; us to qualify and change the terms, of the express warranty contained therein by adding thereto the proviso, \u201cprovided the body specified herein does not weigh more than 1500 pounds.\u201d And this, too, notwithstanding the specifications contained in the catalogue did not purport to be \u201cstandard specifications,\u201d but \u201cSaurer five ton, general, mechanical specifications\u201d; notwithstanding the catalogue, did not contain any specifications in regard to the body; notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s witness testified that the defendant did not have a, \u201cstandard\u201d body, and notwithstanding the \u201cmechanical specifications\u201d in the catalogue referred to a five-ton chassis weighing 5,990 pounds, with a wheel base of 153% inches, while the contract in suit relates to a truck with a wheel base of 177% inches. Moreover, if, following the reasoning of the appellant, the express' terms of the contract are to give way to the specifications mentioned in the catalogue, then the defendant was dearly in default in fur uishing a chassis that weighed (&gt;,'130 pounds instead of 5,990 pounds, with a wheel base of 177% inches instead of a wheel base of 153% inches. We do not think, however, that the contract is open to such a construction, or that there is any doubt as to its moaning. What the defendant, in plain terms, engaged to furnish, was a Saurer chassis with a, <em>live load </em>capacity of ten thousand pounds, and a body according to tlie blue print prepared and furnished by -it. Li the defendant, who prepared the contract, liad intended to make its warranty of the capacity of tlie chassis or truck dependent upon tlie weight, of the body it was constructing, it. could easily and doubtless would 'have done so by guaranteeing its \u201c'dead load\u201d capacity instead of its \u201clive load\u201d capacity, or bv simply stating that the guaranteed live load capacity was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>subject to the condition that tbe body did not weigh more than, say, 1500 pounds, and the defendant would certainly not have left such an important qualification of its express warranty to doubtful inference from, the \u201cmechanical specifications\u201d in its catalogue, which did not even purport to&gt; apply to a chassis with a wheel base of 111% inches., and which contained no specifications whatever in regard to the body, or the weight of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The view we have expressed is apparently the view adopted by this Court on the former appeal. In the first trial the court below granted the plaintiff\u2019s, first prayer, which instructed the jury that if they found that the plaintiff and defendant executed the contract dated June 28th, 1915, and that in pursuance thereof the defendant delivered the truck mentioned in the evidence to the plaintiff and the plaintiff paid therefor, and further found that the chassis of said truck did not have a maximum live, load capacity of ten thousand pounds as guaranteed in said contract, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Referring to this prayer, Judge Beiscoe, speaking for the court, said: \u201cComing now to the action of the court on the prayers, we find that the. plaintiff\u2019s first prayer properly instructed the jury that if they found the facts set out in the prayer, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d It is true, on the first appeal, there was no exception to the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, and it was not, strictly speaking, subject to review, but it nevertheless, received the favorable consideration of the court. In the second trial, the court below refused to grant the plaintiff\u2019s third prayer, which contained the same instruction, except in connection with defendant\u2019s second prayer, which in effect told the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover unless they found the truck delivered to the plaintiff was not capable of carrying a live load of ten thousand pounds, \u201cexclusive of the weight of a body not exceeding fifteen hundred pounds.\u201d In other words, the defendant\u2019s second prayer instructed the jury that the guaranteed live load capacity of the truck did not include the weight of the body, except to the extent of fifteen hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>pounds. That was not in accordance with the proper1 construction of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">For the reasons stated there was also error in the granting of the defendant\u2019s first prayer and the rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer. The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer was properly rejected because the defendant did not guarantee that the truck was fit or suitable for the work for which it was purchased, and the contract expressly provided: \u201cHo guarantee express or implied other than herein stated is made by the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Ho objection was made in this Court to the granting of the defendant\u2019s third prayer, and the exceptions to the rulings of the court on the evidence were not pressed. We think the evidence referred to was properly excluded, but because of the error in the rejection of plaintiff\u2019s, second prayer, and the granting of his third prayer in connection with defendant\u2019s second prayer, and the granting of defendant\u2019s first and second prayers, the judgment appealed from must he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed with costs and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
