Jenksi had the possession lawfully obtained under the plaintiff\u2019s contract and with their full consent. Neither do plaintiffs help the matter any by calling Jenks a trespasser. He is not a trespasser. His original entry was lawful and by consent and under a written contract which still gives him a right to hold this property. Injunction doe\u00ae not lie to prevent a trespass ordinarily. Unusual circumstances of damage must be shown to authorize its use for that purpose, but in this case there is and can be no trespass. He is in possession under a contract with plaintiffs\u2019 consent.

That contract is not a series of divisible; separate contracts, for the doing of separate; independent acts. It was the manifest intention of the parties that it should be one entire contract and not a series of independent contracts. <em>Brantly, Contr., </em>p. 403; <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>45 N.

This the defendant failed to do,. The contract has not been abandoned or rescinded by the parties, nor have the plaintiffs prevented performance. It follows, therefore, where the contract is entire in its nature, no recovery can he had until performance has, been completed. The same result is reached upon another principle, <em>i. e., </em>if the undertaking's on the one side and those on the other are dependent, the contract cannot be enforced unless performance is, averred by one party or prevented by the other party. Thus the defendant\u2019s legal position is untenable because, on the one hand, he cannot enforce the contract owing to his, failure of performance; and, on the other hand, because of this inability, the complainants have all the advantage which they could have derived from a simple rescission. <em>Brantly, Contracts, </em>p. 403; <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Sangston, </em>5 Md. 21; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>6 Harris &amp; J. 38; <em>American Towing Co. </em>v. <em>Baker-Whitely Co., </em>111 Md. 502; <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>38 Conn. 290; <em>Bleistein </em>v. <em>Studer, </em>3 N.

It cannot be compensated for in damages, as practically no benefit has been received from the contract. <em>Cases collected, Brady </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>125 Tenn. 595; 41 L. R. A. (N.

Thei defendant\u2019s act in removing the structural equipment showed such an intention, and the admission of such an act is sufficient to authorize this honorable Court to annul the contract. <em>Dermott </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Wall. 8; U. <em>S. </em>v.

The rule is this: That a contract for the complete construction of a building for an entire price, payable in instalments as the work progresses, is an entire contract, and a refusal by the contractor to complete the building, entitles the owner h&gt; a return of the instalments paid. <em>Dermott </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Wall. 8; U. <em>S. </em>v.

As the company had failed to make either of the two cash payments due under the contract, Mr. Jenks, as. stated in his answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and in his testimony, made an investigation of the condition of the company and learned that he had been misled by misrepresentations! of Mr. White, both as to the amount of the company\u2019s property and its financial condition, and after consulting hisi counsel, and \u201cfor the purpose of saving, if possible, what he had already spent\u201d on the dryer, he decided, in response to- Mr. White\u2019s urgent appeals not to abandon the erection of the dryer and kiln, to enter into- the following contract with the company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cThis agreement, covering in full the understanding between the parties hereto, is made in duplicate this 3rd day of May, 1917, between Harford P.

After the execution of the contract of the 3rd of May, Mr. Je-nks not only abandoned the prompt completion of the dryer and erection of the kiln, but also disposed of the materia] that had been delivered at the plant for , that purpose, a-nd removed from the dryer a, part of the iron or steel work that had already been erected and, when urged by the company or by Mr. White to complete the dryer and kiln in orde-i- that the company might obtain the benefit of the desired increase in the capacity of the plant, he refused to do so until he had realized from, the operation of the plant and business', over and above the- costs and expenses, the entire contract price of the first half of the dryer and the price: of the kiln, with interest thereon. Upon discovering that. Mr. J'enks did not intend to resume work on the dryer until he had received the amount, indicated, Mr. White', with the view of effecting a settlement with him and getting possession of the company\u2019s property, asked him on several occasions for a statement showing the result of his operation of the plant and business', but, according to Mr. White\u2019s testimony, he refused to give such a statement unless he was assured that the company was prepared to- settle with him. Finally Mr. White received from him a letter, dated December 1st, 1919, containing the following statement of the business to November 15th, 1919, and of the amount claimed by him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cMr. Frank A.

It further appears from the evidence that, during his operation of the plant, Mr. Jenks exacted and received from the company, as further security for the price of the dryer and the ldln, certain hills of sale of its office furniture, machinery, etc. Mr. White testified that these hills of sale had been paid by the company, but had not been released by Mr. Jenks or returned to the company. As no reference is made to them in the statement submitted by Mr. Jenks, we may assume that the amounts thereof are included in one of the items of receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">After receiving the above statement, the Olay Products Manufacturing Company, the Easton Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company and Mr. White, on the 15th of December, 1919, filed their hill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Talbot County against Mr. Jenksi and Elwood Smith, his superintendent of the plant, setting out the facts to which we have referred and praying (1) that the defendants., their agents, etc., be enjoined from interfering\u2019 with the plaintiffs \u201cin the possession\u201d of their property and \u201cin the management and operation\u201d of their1 said plant and business. (2) That the defendants he required to account,to the plaintiffs for all bricks manufactured during the time they had possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the plant; for all monies received and expended during that time, and for all \u201caccounts, bills or other indebtedness due or owing for bricks sold\u201d during that time. (3) That Mr. Jenks be required to return to the plaintiffs the bills of sale and promissory notes given him by the Olay Products Manufacturing Company, and that he be restrained from \u201ccollecting, negotiating, transferring or otherwise using\u201d said notes. (4) That the said contracts of January 27th and May 3rd, 1917, be cancelled, and (5) for general relief. On the day the bill was filed the court below passed an order, iu tbe usual form, granting an injunction as prayed, with leave to the defend-' ants, upon the filing of their answers, to move for a dissolution of the injunction. On the 9th of February, 1920, Mr. Jenks filed his answer to the bill, alleging, in substance, that he had been induced to enter into' the contract of January 27th, 1917, by the misrepresentations of the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs had failed to comply with said contract, and that he had entered into the contract of May 3rd, 1917, \u201cfor the purpose of saving, if possible, a part of what he had already spent for materials and for the construction of said dryer\u201d; that at the time he executed the contract of May 3rd there was due him under the contract of January 27th, $10,275, and that the \u201cpurpose of the contract of May 3rd, 1917,\u201d was \u201cto put\u201d him \u201cin complete control of the said plant and products thereof\u201d so that the proceeds could he applied to the payment of said sum and the interest thereon; that he had given the plaintiffs a complete statement of \u201chis receipts and disbursements\u201d up to November 15th, 1919, showing a balance due him of $12,884.37, and that he was willing at any timo to surrender control of said plant upon the plaintiffs paying what was. justly due him, amounting to1 \u201cabout $13,000\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">It appears from the docket entries set out iu the record that a motion to dissolve the injunction was filed February 11, 1920. After a hearing on the bill, answer and testimony taken before the court, the court below, on the 13th of September, 1920, passed a decree overruling tbe motion to dissolve and making the injunction perpetual, requiring the bills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of sale and promissory notes given by the company to Air. Tents to he \u201ccancelled and returned to1 the plaintiff,\u201d and cancelling the contracts of January 27th and May 3rd, 1917. That decree was subsequently rescinded by the court below because of an error in the calculations on which it wasi based, and on the 6th of November, 1920. the court passed an order, reciting that it. appeared from a further examination of the testimony that there was due from the plaintiffs to the defendant $3,689.66, and ordering \u201cthat the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction\u201d be granted and the injunction disr solved \u201cunless the plaintiffs pay the defendant the sum of $3,689.66 on or before the 16th day of December, 1920.\u201d The appeal in No&gt;. 20 appeals is; by Air. Tents, the defendant, from the order of November 6th, and the appeal in No. 21 appeals is by the plaintiffs from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It is apparent from what has been said that the primary question to be determined is the proper construction of the contracts of January 27th and May 3rd, 1917. Mr. Jenks contends that as. the company failed to make the first two cash payments when they became due under the contract of January 27th, and as that contract declared that all payments and notes should \u201cbecome due\u201d if any payment remained \u201cmore than ten days past due and unpaid,\u201d and as the contract of May 3rd provided that he should have possession and control of the plant and business of the company until the amount due him wasi paid, \u201ceither by profits of the plant * * * or by sale of capital stock,\u201d he was entitled to retain possession of the plant and business, and was not required to erect a dryer and kiln, until he had received from, the net profits of the' plant, or was otherwise paid, the full contract price of the dryer and kiln, and interest thereon from the date of the default of the company under' the first contract. No support for this contention can be found in the language of the contracts,, nor Was there anything in the circumstances under which they were executed to warrant such, an unreasonable construction. The only consideration moving to. the company under the contract of January 27th was the erection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u25a0of the dryer and kiln, by which it expected the capacity of the plant to&gt; be greatly increased. The defendant guaranteed that \u201cthe first three tunnels\u201d of the dryer would have \u201ca capacity of 20,000 bricks per day,\u201d and in order that the company might realize as soon as possible the anticipated benefits from these improvements, thei contract of January 27th expressly provided that the construction of the first, half \u25a0of the dryer should he started not later\u2019 than February 5th, 1917, and the \u201cwork pushed with all possible rapidity,\u201d and that the kiln should he started \u201cone month from the date of the agreement, or as soon before as it is possible for both parties to get ready to do so.\u201d These important provisions of the contract of January 27th were not in terms cancelled by the contract of May 3rd. On the contrary that contract declared, \u201cno part of this agreement shall he construed as in any way modifying, impairing or affecting the agreement of January 27th, 1917.\u201d That the contract of May 3rd was. intended to secure the prompt erection of the dryer and kiln, as well as the payment to the defendant of the amount due him, is further shown by the clause providing\u2019; for the return of the plant to the company on July 27th, 1917, and for a renewal or a continuance of the contract beyond that date in case the defendant was not fully compensated by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Rotwithstanding the contract of January 27th provided that the kiln should be started within one month from that date, the evidence shows that, when the defendant applied to the company on March 5th, 1917, for the first payment on the dryer, the kiln had not been started, and that nothing was ever done by the defendant towards its erection. But even if we assume that any suspension of the work on the dryer prior to May 3rd was due to, and was justified by, the company\u2019s failure to make the payments provided for in the contract of January 27th, the only motive the company could have had in entering into the. contract of May 3rd was to secure the immediate completion of the much desired improvements, contracted for by giving the defendant the additional security afforded by that contract for the amount it had agreed to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>for the same. The defendant had, as we have said, guaranteed the capacity of the dryer, and the company was anxious to secure the increased capacity of the plant that would result from the erection of the dryer and the kiln, but if, as the defendant contends, they were not, under the contract of May 3rd, to he completed until the entire contract price was paid, the company accomplished nothing by turning over1 its plant and business to the defendant, and the only result of the contract of May 3rd, SO' far as the company was concerned, was the imposition upon its business of the additional burden of the defendants salary and Ms profit on all the bricks manufaotnred. That such a result was not contemplated by tlie parties, and that the company never intended to enter into such an agreement, is too obvious to require further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Learned counsel for the defendant insist that .it would be unreasonable to assume that the defendant was willing to make any further outlay in the erection of the dryer or kiln after having discovered that- the company was unable to meet tbe payments provided for in the contract of January 27th. If, this suggestion is not answered by the fact that the contract of May 3rd provided that the defendant was, to retain possession of the plant and business until he was paid the amount due him, we would add that it would he more unreasonable to' assume that the company was willing to turn over its plant and business to him, and to impose upon it an additional burden, without, any assurance that the improvements contracted for would ever he completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThe object to be attained in construing contracts, is to ascertain the meaning and intent of the parties as expressed in the language used\u201d (6 <em>R. C. L., </em>sec. 225, p. 836; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Haney, </em>4 Md. 498; <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>Security Fire Ins. Co. </em>110 Md. 275), and viewing the contracts of January 27th and May 3rd in the light of the circumstances under which they were executed, considering the objects to be attained, and giving to the terms employed their ordinary meaning, we must hold that, upon the execution of the contract of May 3rd, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and upon obtaining possession of the company\u2019s plant and business, the defendant should have proceeded without unnecessary delay with the erection and completion of the dryer and kiln, and that his failure and refusal to do so was a clear- violation of his obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Counsel for the defendant also insist that the facts- alleged in the bill do not bring the case within the jurisdiction of a court of equity; that for the recovery of its real or personal property the company had a complete and adequate remedy at law, and that no sufficient grounds were alleged for the cancellation of the contracts, billa of sale or promissory notes referred to. The defendant acquired possession of the company\u2019s plant and control of its business under the contracts in question for the purpose of erecting tire dryer and kiln therein mentioned, and to secure the payment of the amount the company agreed to pay for the same, and, when he removed from the dryer the iron work that had already been erected, and refused to proceed further with the erection of the dryer and kiln, he forfeited his right to the possession and control of the plant and business. While the company could have recovered its real property in an action of ejectment, and could have resorted to an action of replevin for the recovery of its personal property, the injunctive relief asked for in the hill was not confined to the recovery of its property, hut it also sought to enjoin the defendant from interfering with its management of the plant and its control of the business. That relief was within the power of a court of equity to grant <em>(Lord </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>109 Md. 42) and could not have been obtained in a court of law, and where a court of equity assumes jurisdiction on any equitable ground, it will retain jurisdiction for the purpose of administering full and complete relief. 10 <em>R. C. L., </em>sec. 120, p. 370; 14 <em>R. C. L., </em>sec. 21, p. 322; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>31 Md. 71; <em>Md. Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kimmell; </em>89 Md. 437; <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fink, </em>102 Md. 229; <em>Aetna Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>112 Md. 397. Mr. Pomeroy, in 1 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s </em>Equity, sec. 236 (2nd Ed.), says: \u201cIt may he stated as a general proposition, that wherever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>court of equity has jurisdiction to grant the remedy of injunction for some special purpose, even though the injunction covers only a portion of the controversy, it may go on and decide all thei issues, and make a final decree granting! full relief.\u201d It is said in 9 <em>Corpus Juris, </em>see. 12, p. 1181, that \u201cthe general rule is well settled that the equitable relief of rescission will not be granted for a mere breach of contract,\u201d .and that \u201cin the absence of fraud, mistake, trust, cloud on title, multiplicity of suits, undue influence or some other independent ground of equitable jurisdiction, a court of equity will not cancel a contract on the sole ground that the defendant has; failed to perform his part of the contract, but the plaintiff will be left to his action at law.\u201d But in the case of <em>DuBois Borough </em>v. <em>DuBois City Waterworks. Co., </em>176 Pa. 437, 34 L. R. A. 92, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, after referring to the general rule, said: \u201cAnd while we do not say that a wilful! and obatmctive refusal to- perform a contract, under circumstances which practically prevent the party aggrieved from entering into another, may not afford ground for equitable cancellation, yet some such special ground must appear in order to- take the case out of the general rule that remedy for mere breach must be sought at law,\u201d and in the case of <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Keeseville, A. C. &amp; L. C. R. Co., </em>199 N. Y. 284, the Court of Appeals of Yew York said: \u201cThere is no hard and fast rule on the subject of .rescission, for the right usually depends on the circumstances of the particular ease. * * * It is not permitted for a, slight, casual or technical breach, but, as a general rule only for such as are material and wilful, or, if not wilful, so substantial and fundamental as to- strongly tend to defeat the object of the parties making the contract. * * * If the party who- seeks rescission has an adequate remedy at law, ordinarily he is not entitled to rescind, but in case of repudiation, or of a breach going to the root of the contract, unless the damages can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, a rescission is a matter of right, with restitution instead of compensation.\u201d In the: case at bar the jurisdiction of the court was not invoked for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sole purpose of cancelling, the contracts, hills of sale \u25a0 and promissory notes referred to-, and we are not required to go further than to say that where a court of equity assumes jurisdiction on other grounds, and where, as in this\u00bb case, the defendant has refused to perform an essential part of an entire and indivisible contract, the court, in order to administer full and complete relief, may cancel the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the order from which these appeals were taken the plaintiffs were required to pay the defendant $3,689.66. This sum, it appears, was arrived at by deducting the total receipts from the business during the time the defendant conducted the same from the amount of costs and expenses of the business, his salary of $125 per month and profit on the bricks manufactured during that time, and the sum expended by him in the partial erection of the dryer, prior to the contract of May 3rd, and was allowed on the theory that the plaintiffs, after discovering that the defendant did not intend to complete the dryer until he was paid or received the contract price of same, acquiesced in his refusal to do so and permitted him, to continue in possession of the plant and control of the business until the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The contracts of January 27th and May 3rd constitute one entire and indivisible contract in which the company agreed to pay the defendant for the- erection of the dryer and kiln the sum therein stated and a salary of $125 per month during the time he operated the plant and conducted the business. <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>36 Md. 567. Having refused, without any legal excuse for doing so, to perform the contract, the defendant was not in a position to recover, in either <em>general </em>or <em>special assumpsit, </em>any part of the compensation agreed upon, or for the work done in part performance of the contract. Gi<em>ll </em>v. <em>Vogler, </em>52 Md. 663; <em>North Bros. &amp; Straus </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>94 Md. 305. After the- company turned over1 its plant and business to him it repeatedly urged him to- complete the dryer and kiln so that it could get the benefit of the increased demand for brick, and when tire company discovered that he did not intend to resume work on or to complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the same until lie received the entire contract price and interest thereon, it made several efforts to get a statement from him of what he had received and expended under the contract, with the view of reaching a settlement with him and recovering possession of its plant and control of its business. The record contains a letter from Mr. White to the defendant, dated December 23rd, 1918, asking him for an \u201citemized list\u201d of his expenditures during the year 1918, stating that it was necessary to have a \u201cclean up\u201d with him on the dryer, and asking him how soon he could finish the dryer after the \u201cnecessary balance\u201d was placed in his \u201chands,\u201d and the evidence is to the effect that the defendant refused to render a statement unless he was assured that the company was prepared to pay the entire amount he claimed to be due him. Under these circumstances the delay in bringing the suit does not amount to such acquiescence on the part of the company in the conduct of the defendant as deprives it of its right to recover control of its buainessi or requires it to pay any part of the consideration of the contract which the defendant failed and refused to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">According to the statement rendered by the defendant in his letter of December 1st, the total receipts amounted to $24,740.32, the expenses paid by Smith, Reddie and the defendant amounted to about $17,624.18, and the defendant\u2019s profit on the bricks manufactured, provided for in the contract as a part of the \u201ccosts\u201d of operating the plant, amounted to about $4,254.38. It therefore appears that after deducting from the total receipts all the costs and expenses, (including; profit on bricks) of the business, there was on the 15th of ZSTovember, 1919, a balance to the credit of the business, and due the company, of about $2,861.76. The company did not get control of the business under the injunction granted until about a month later, and the evidence does not. clearly show the exact amount received and paid out on account of the business during that time, but, in order to arrive at. a correct account as of the date the company recovered control of the business, it is only necessary to add to the statement, rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>by the defendant such amounts as were received, and such costs and expenses as were paid by the defendant (including profit on brides manufactured) between the 15th of November and the date the company recovered possession of the plant, and if the parties can agree as to these additional items there will he no necessity for a decree for an accounting. There is no evidence in the case of such negligence on the part of the defendant as would make him liable for the uncollected claim against Jewell referred to in the hill and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It follows from what has been said that we entirely agree with the views expressed by the learned court below in the opinion filed with the decree of September 13th, 1920, except in regard to the allowance to the defendant of the salary of $125 a month and the amount expended by him in the partial erection of the dryer, and if the case had been submitted on the pleadings and evidence for final decree we would remand it for a decree in accordance with the views we have stated. \u25a0 But as the case was heard in the court below on a motion to dissolve the injunction previously granted, and was not submitted for final decree, we must reverse the order\u2019 appealed from and remand the case in order that the court below may pass an order overruling the motion to di&amp;solve and continuing the injunction until final hearing. <em>Hoffman Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Cumb. C. &amp; I. Co., </em>16 Md. 511; <em>Cumb. C. &amp; I. Co. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>20 Md. 130, 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>In Nos. </em>20 <em>and </em>21 <em>Appeals order reversed and cause remanded in order that an order may be passed in accordance with the foregoing opinion, the costs in this court and in the court below to be paid by Hatrford P.
