Daly, of Baltimore City, Maryland, who had been in the employ of the Standard Oil Company in Baltimore City as bookkeeper for several years, filled out and delivered to William R. Spear, of Baltimore City, who was the agent and employee of the Standard Oil Company in Baltimore City, and who had charge of the annuities, benefits and insurance department of that company, an application for insurance under the g^oup policy issued to that company by the said Assurance Society. Mr. Daly had for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>year or more been engaged to Miss Helen C. McKenzie, of Baltimore City, and when he applied to Mr. Spear, whom he had known for a number of years! and who knew of his engagement to Miss McKenzie, for the insurance, he asked Mr. Spear if he could not name Miss McKenzie as the beneficiary of his insurance, and Mr. Spear told him that under \u201cthe schedule printed under the application\u201d it would not be possible, the company would not permit it, \u201cbecause the insurance was intended for the employee's dependents,\u201d and a fiancee could not be considered a dependent, but after his marriage he could make the change, and that in the meantime he could name either his mother or father, who according to the schedule were the preferred beneficiaries under the company\u2019s plan of insurance. Mr. Daly accordingly named his father, Patrick Daly, of Wilmington, Delaware, as the beneficiary, and the following policy or certificate of insurance was issued by the Assurance Society and delivered to him by Mr. Spear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgV\">\u201cThe Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cHo. 5342425 \u2014 Insurance Amount for $1,140.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201cHereby certifies that the Standard Oil Company (Hew Jersey) (hereinafter called the Employer) has contracted to insure the life of Charles A.

The insurance is to be payable if death occurs while in the employment of said employer and during the continuance of the policy and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, as follows: $150 for funeral expenses and the remainder in twelve equal monthly payments to the beneficiary entitled thereunder to receive the same. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201cBeneficiary \u2014 -Patrick, father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cSubject to the right of the employee, with the consent of the Employer, to change the beneficiary to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of the preference beneficiaries designated in the Standard Oil Company\u2019s life insurance plan stated on the second page hereof and in accordance therewith, which change will be effective upon entry in said insurance register.

Tingh, President.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-_\">\u201cApproved: A. O. Bedford, Chairman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">It appears from the evidence that Miss McKenzie had a policy of insurance on her life, and that she and Mr. Daly had agreed that she should make him the beneficiary in her policy, and that he should make her the beneficiary in his; that she had her policy written accordingly, and that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Mr. Daly got his certificate he gave it to her to keep and. told her the reason his father was named as beneficiary was because he was not then contributing to her support, but that as soon as they were married he would have it changed. They were married on the 3rd of September, 1918, and about a. week later, as soon as they returned from their wedding trip, he went to see Mr. Spear and asked him to' make the change in his certificate by making his wife the beneficiary. Mr. Spear testified that he could not make the change at that time because he had not received the blanks for changing beneficiaries from the New York office; that the company\u2019s plan of insurance was practically new at that time and he had not received all the blanks', and that he told Mr. Daly that as soon as the blanks were received from the New1 York office he would give him one to fill out and sign; that the blanks were received sometime later, he could not tell just when, and that not having made a note of Mr. Daly\u2019s request, he overlooked it, forgot it, and did not give him a blank; that he, witness, was very busy at that time and was working day and night trying to get all the employees insured before the first of the year, and was also1 busy helping to malee out war questionnaires, and that that was the reason he overlooked Mr. Daly\u2019s request; that Mr. Daly was entitled to' have the beneficiary changed because' his status had changed; that the company requires an employee to change his beneficiary after\u2019 he marries because under its plan of insurance the wife comes before the parents; that according to the usual course of procedure, if the employee makes the request for the change he, witness, fills out the blank, which is signed by the employee and by him, and forwarded to' the New York office, and the New York office forwards one copy of it to the Assurance Society and retains the other; that if the employee does not make the request, for the change, and the company finds out he is married, the company requires him to make the application in the manner stated, because according to its schedule the wife comes before other authorized beneficiaries; that the applications for change of beneficiary are put through ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cording to the blanks signed by the employee and by him. Shortly after he applied to Mr. Spear to make the change in his certificate, Mr. Daly was! taken sick on the 5th of October, 1918, with the \u201cflu\u201d and double pneumonia, and he died on the 16th of that month without having received the blank from Mr. Spear. After his death the Assurance Society, in accordance with the terms of the certificate, paid to Mrs. Daly $150 for funeral expenses, but as she and Patrick Daly, the father of the insured, both claimed and demanded the balance due under the certificate, the society filed in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City a bill of interpleader against them, and the court passed a decree requiring them to inter-plead, and the Assurance Society to pay into court to the credit of the cause the balance of said fund, amounting to $990, less a fee of $50 to its counsel. After a hearing upon the pleadings and evidence adduced by the parties, the court below passed a decree directing the clerk of the court to pay said sum of $990, less the fee of $50 referred to, and the cost of the proceedings, to Patrick Daly, the father of the deceased, and from that decree Mrs. Daly has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Where the certificate or policy of insurance issued to the insured expressly reserves to him the right to* change the beneficiary named therein, whatever interest the beneficiary has in the certificate or policy is subject to that right of the insured, and where the contract of insurance, or, in case of benefit societies, the policy, constitution or by-l\u00e1ws of the association prescribe the manner in which the change of beneficiary shall be made; such requirements must be followed by the insured in order to&gt; effect the change desired. These principles are generally recognized and are in accordance with the decisions in this State. 14 <em>R. C. L., </em>see. 545, p. 1376 and sec. 555, p. 1390; <em>Supreme Conclave, Royal Adelphia </em>v. <em>Cappella, </em>41 Fed. Rep. 1; <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>3 App. D. C. 308; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>89 Md. 390; <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Brumbly, </em>96 Md. 674; <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Balto. L. Ins. Co., </em>133 Md. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>It is said, however, in <em>Supreme Conclave, Royal Adelphia </em>v. <em>Capella, supra, </em>which is regarded as a leading case on the subject, that there are three exceptions to the general rule requiring exact compliance with the regulations in regard to the manner in which a change of beneficiary shall be made: \u201cFirst \u2014 If the society has waived a strict compliance with its own rules, and, in pursuance of a request of the insured to change his beneficiary, has issued a new certificate to him, the original beneficiary will not be heard to complain that the course indicated by the regulations was not pursued. Second \u2014 If it be beyond the power of the insured to comply literally with the regulations, a, court of equity will treat the change as having been legally made. Third- \u2014 -If the insured has pursued the course pointed out by the laws of the association, and has done all in his power to change the beneficiary, but, before the new certificate is actually issued, he dies, a court of equity will decree that to be done which ought to be done, and act as though the certificate had been issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In the case referred to there was a bill of interpleader, and after stating these exceptions to the general rule, the court said: \u201c'We think the case under consideration falls within these exceptions. Five days before the death of the insured, he signed and acknowledged before a notary a written application for a change in his certificate in the form prescribed by the by-laws, stating that the- original certificate to Anna Oappella was in her possession, and beyond his control. This application was delivered to the secretary of the Chapter Conclave at Milwaukee, who affixed the seal of the conclave, and forwarded it to the supreme secretary. It is true, he did not surrender the original certificate, as required by the regulations ; but he had done all in this connection which was within his power, or which he could reasonably be required to do. * * * Were the non-surrender of the certificate set up by the company in a common-law action brought by Kratzsch, it is possible the court might be compelled to hold that he had failed to establish his title; but when the company waives this defense, or at least disclaims any interest in the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>of the controversy, the objection comes with ill grace from one who is solely responsible for such non-surrender.\u201d In the case of <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Harper, supra, </em>which also arose on a bill of interpleader, and where the application for change of beneficiary was made out by the insured, who died before the papers could be transmitted to and acted on at the prindp-al or home office of the order, in the opinion delivered by Mr. Chibe J ustice Aevey, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, said: \u201cUpon the evidence in this case no doubt can exist as to- the intention of Wood, the member. He intended to change the beneficiary in tbe certificate of membership-, and he did all in his- power to accomplish that purpose. He did not live long enough to have all the forms- prescribed actually complied with; but the particulars in which the defect existed'were purely \u00a9f a formal nature, and such as the order eo-uld and did properly dispense with. The revocation and new appointment were substantially made; and it was the right of the member to have the substituted certificate issued as he directed, and though death interposed before all the forms could he complied with, the right of substitution of beneficiary previously exercised was not lost.\u201d After repeating the exceptions to the general rule which we have quoted from <em>Supreme Conclave, Royal Adelphia </em>v. <em>Cappella, supra, </em>the court, referring to- that ease, said further: \u201cIn the course- of the opinion of the court in that ease, the learned justice refers to the case of <em>Association </em>v. <em>Kirgin, </em>28 Mo. App. 801, where \u2018the insured having met with a fatal accident, called a friend and requested him to take his certificate to the association and surrender it, paying a fee of fifty cents, and request them, to issue a new one payable to his wife. This was done, and a minute of the transaction was made on the records of the association for that day. On the following day the insured died. It was held that in doing this, he had done all that the laws of the order required to be done on his part in order to have a new certificate issued; that his right to make the change was absolute; and that the association had no- right- to refusei his request; and, further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that the fact that the certificate was issued after his death was immaterial, since the certificate wag not the right itself, but merely the evidence of the right.\u2019 To the same effect are the oases of <em>Kepler </em>v. <em>Supreme Lodge, Knights of Honor, </em>45 Hun. 274, and <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Belief Assn., </em>63 N. H. 566. These authorities would seem to be founded upon principle, and we entirely concur in the propositions maintained by them.\u201d In <em>Jory </em>v. <em>Supreme Council American, Legion of Honor, </em>105 Cal. 20, 26 L. R. A. 733, the original certificate was in possession of the beneficiary named therein, who refused to give it up&gt;, and the insured was unable to surrender it as required by the by-lawa, and the court held that as thei money had been paid into court, and the society was not resisting payment to the new beneficiary, and as the insured had done all he could do to effect the change, the new beneficiary was entitled to the fund. In the case of <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Supreme Council, etc., </em>149 Mass. 512, where the certificate was not delivered, as required by the laws of the corporation, to the supreme secretary, by reason of the fraud and collusion of the original beneficary and a subordinate secretary, the court held that, the insured having done all he could do to effect a, change of beneficiary, the new beneficiary was entitled to the fund and said: \u201cThe controversy is solely between these two claimants. It is a matter in which the corporation had no interest. It desires only that a decree may be rendered that shall conclude these claimants as to any demands upon it.\u201d In the case of <em>Luhrs </em>v. <em>Luhrs, </em>123 N. Y. 367, notwithstanding the new certificate was not in fact issued until after the death of the member of the order, the court held that the new beneficiary was entitled to the fund. In the case of <em>Lahey </em>v. <em>Lahey, </em>174 N. Y. 146, the association failed and neglected to issue a new certificate on the ground that it had no power to issue a new certificate while the original was outstanding, notwithstanding it had been advised that the original certificate was in the possession of the beneficiary named therein, who refused to surrender it. The court held that the case was not one in which the benefit association was interested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>but one only between the claimants!, and, notwithstanding the statute of Yew York authorized a change of thei beneficiary in the certificate of such a society, with \u201cthe consent of the society,\u201d and notwithstanding the by-laws of the society required the application for a change of beneficiary to be made by filling out the blank on tbe back of the original certificate, the court held that the new beneficiary named in a written application to the society to change thei beneficiary was entitled to the fund. In that ease thei court refers with approval to the case of <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Nally, </em>74 Ga. 669, 58 Am. Rep. 458, in reference to which it said: \u201cIn <em>Nally </em>v. <em>Nally, * </em>* * an unmarried man took out a policy of insurance on his life, one condition of which was that thei policy was issued and accepted upon the express condition that the assured might, with the consent of the- company, at any time, assign it, or, before assignment, change the beneficiaries., or make any other change. The person named asi the beneficiary was the sister of the assured, and to her he delivered the policy, lie subsequently married. * * * The- sister had thei policy and would not give it up-. The agent was uncertain whether a change could he madei without the policy, but promised, to notify the company, and have the change made if possible-The officers agreed to attend to the- matter, hut. overlooked it. After the death o-f thei assured, the company filed a bill to require the wife- and sis-ter to interplead, and have the question determined as to who- was entitled to- the money. It was: held that the glift to- the sister was not perfected, so as, to ho absolute and irrevocable-, and tbe assured bad the right to change the beneficiary of the policy, and whether such change was to he effected by parol or in writing was a matter entirely between tbe assured and tbe company.\u201d A number of cases to the same effect as those to which we have referred are collected in a note to 34 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>277, and among them is the case of <em>John Hancock Mut. L. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>While, </em>20 R. I. 457, 5, in which, theno-te says, \u201cthe proceeds of a policy of life insurance in which the assured reserved the right to change the beneficiary with the consent of the company were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>decreed to one whom the assured had designated by an appropriate paper forwarded to the company\u2019s office, although, owing to the neglect of the company, no attention had been given to the paper, and no change ever recorded in its hooks.\u201d The same principle is recognized in 14 <em>R. C. </em>L., sec. 556, p. 1392, where it is said: \u201cWhile it is true as a general rule, as stated in the preceding\u2019 paragraph, that a change in beneficiaries cannot be made except by a substantial compliance with the regulations of the society, yet courts of equity recognize exceptions to this general principle. Equity does not demand impossible things, and will consider as done that which should have been done, and, when a member has complied with all of the requirements of the rules for the purpose of making a substitution of beneficiaries within his power, he has done all that a court of equity demands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In the case at bar the insurance we are considering is what is termed industrial insurance. It is paid for by the employer, and the beneficiaries are not only limited to specified classes, but the insured or employee is required to select the beneficiary in accordance with a preference schedule prescribed by the employer\u2019. The insured is not only expressly authorized by the certificate or policy issued to him, and by the policy issued by the society to- his employer, to change the beneficiary, but according to the plan of insurance adopted by his employer, and which is referred to in the contract between the employer and the assurance society, where his status is changed by marriage, he is required to change the beneficiary by naming his wife as the person to receive the benefits of his policy. In pursuance of the right expressly reserved to him in his certificate, and in accordance with the plan of insurance adopted by his employer, Mr. Daly, the insured, applied to Mr. Spear, the agent of the employer, who had charge of the insurance department of the employer, to make the change in his certificate by making his wife the beneficiary, and the only reason it was not done at once was because Mr. 'Spear did not have the blanks which were to be furnished him for that purpose. He promised the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to give him a Hank as soon as he got them, but this he neglected or failed to do \"because be overlooked it. There can he no doubt- of the insured\u2019s desire and intention to change the beneficiary or that he did all in his power to effect the change, and the only reason a more formal application waa not made, and noted on the insurance register of the society, was because the society or the employer had failed to furnish its or their agent the blanks used for that purpose, or because its or their agent failed to give him a blank in accordance with his promise to do so. Under s-uoh circumstances the claim of Patr\u00edele Daly, whose interest in the policy was subject to the right of the insured to change the beneficiary, should not be allowed to prevail over that of his widow, for whom the insured clearly intended the fruits of his policy, and to whom it should he awarded by a court of equity upon the principle we have stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It is urged on the part of the appellee that, as the policy provided that the change of. beneficiary should be effective upon the entry of the same upon the insurance register of the society, and as the statute of New York required the assent of the society to such a change, no change of beneficiary could be accomplished without such entry and assent. ' But in this case the suit is between the claimants, and the society has declared its willingness to pay the fund to the one the court decides is entitled to it. Heither the society nor the employer is resisting the claim of the widow, and under the plan of insurance adopted by the latter and recognized by the society the insured was required to make the change in favor of his wife. The statute referred to by the appellee., if offered in evidence, is not found in the record, although set out in the appellee\u2019s brief. But assuming that it is before us, in the ease of <em>Lahey </em>v. <em>Lahey, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York quoted that or a similar statute of New York, and the case being between the claimants of the fund, the court- held that notwithstanding the society had refused to issue a new certificate, the attempted change of beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>was effective, and that the new benefiiciary was entitled to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Where the insurance society is resisting the claim of a proposed beneficiary, or is a party to the suit, a different rule has been held to apply <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>Supreme Colony, etc., </em>190 Mass. 67), and in the case of <em>Freund </em>v. <em>Freund, </em>218 Ill. 189, the court refused to adopt the equitable doctrine to which we have referred, but we think it is amply supported by authority, and that it is the one that should be applied to the facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed with costs to the appellant, and cause remanded in order that a decree may be passed in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
