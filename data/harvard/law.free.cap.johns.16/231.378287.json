They ought, therefore, to have the affidavits, that they may judge whether there is any reason for altering or amending their report. This Court; sitting in review over the decision of these commissioners; ought not to take into consideration facts which were not before the commissioners before they made their final report. The affidavits cannot be received.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
