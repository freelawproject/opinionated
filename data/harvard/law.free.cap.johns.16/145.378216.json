The judgments were entered up and docketted on the <em>quarto die post </em>of <em>January </em>term last, being the 8th day of <em>January; </em>and on the 9th day of <em>January, </em>the writs of execution were issued, tested on the <em>31st </em>day of <em>October, </em>being the last day of the preceding term, and returnable, the <em>fi. fa. </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the 9th, and the <em>ca. sa. </em>on the 13th day of <em>January, </em>in <em>Januctry term. The ca. sa. </em>was returned and filed in the clerk\u2019s office on the 14th of <em>January, </em>and a suit was thereupon commenced against the bail.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-4\"><em>P.

L. </em>318. sess. 36. c. 3. s. 2. 1 N. <em>R. L. </em>AO 1.)\u2018\u2022The act is not imperative; and at common law, an execution may be <em>tested before </em>the judgment. (1 <em>Sell\u00f3nos Pr. </em>550.) <em>Sellon </em>says,- if writs are sued out in term, they are <em>generally </em>tested the first day of such term. (1 <em>Sellon\u2019s Pr. </em>89.) It does not. appear to be indispensable, in all cases, that a writ issued in term, should be tested in term. The reason for testing these writs of the preceding term was, that the office of Chief Justice was vacant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> At any rate, the plaintiffs are entitled to amend.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\"> <em>Vide ante, p. 1.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b154-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aku\">The <em>teste </em>of these writs was irregular. Where writs are issued in vacation, they may be tested of the preceding term ; if issued in term, they must be tested of some day in the same term. (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>318.)
