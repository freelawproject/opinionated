Lawrence </em>died about fourteen years ago, having had six children, some of whom died in the life time of their father. <em>Mary Lawrence </em>and <em>Clarissa Wenman, </em>two of the lessors of the plaintiff, are the daughters of <em>A. Lawrence, </em>and <em>Mary Ann, </em>the wife of <em>L. G. Coutant, </em>she and her husband being also lessors, and <em>John L. Quick, </em>the other lessor, are the children of <em>Nancy, </em>one of the daughters of <em>A. Lawrence,, </em>who died during the life of her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">The counsel for the defendants insisted, that under the power in the will of <em>D. Lawrence, </em>the premises in question went to his executors for the benefit of the residuary legatees ; and that the reversionary estate, after the death of <em>M. Hilton, </em>could not descend to <em>A. Lawrence, </em>as the only son and heir at law of the testator, and, therefore, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court, on the point above stated.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-8\"><em>M. S. Wilkins, </em>for the plaintiff, contended, that <em>A. Law-</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5j\"><em>rence </em>being the eldest son of the testator, the estate vested in him as heir at law, and upon his death, descended to the lessors of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-9\"><em>D. B. Ogden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7R\">The testator devised to his daughter <em>M. </em>for life, and made no disposition of the reversion. A person who claims by <em>descent </em>must show himself heir to the person <em>last seised. (Co. Litt. </em>11.6.) The estate for life being a freehold, the seisin was in the daughter, during her life; and <em>A. L. </em>the eldest son, could not, therefore, be seised. <em>(Co. Litt. 15. a.) </em>He who claims the reversion, as heir, must make himself heir to <em>D. L. </em>the testator. <em>(Ratcliffe's case, </em>3 <em>Co. </em>42. <em>Cro. Car. </em>410.) The Court decided in <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Shraeder, ( </em>13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>260.) that a person claiming the reversion, must deduce his title immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ately from the person last actually seised ; and that a tenancy by the <em>curtesy, </em>or for life, suspended the descent, so that the eldest son or heir at law is not so seised as to constitute \u00e1 new stock of descent, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The seisin here, being in the tenant for life, oil the determination \u00f3f that est\u00e1te, the reversion must go to the heirs o.f <em>D. L. </em>the testator. The lessors of the plaintiff could recover, therefore, hut a very, small proportion ; not more than two thirty-third parts of one thirty-third part, there being numerous children, and grandchildren. ( <em>Watkins on Descents, </em>149.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>in reply, said, that the case of <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Shtaeder, </em>was founded on that of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Gomez, ' </em>(3 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>214.) which was not within the statute of descents, and did not apply. The doctrine contended for x by the defendant\u2019s counsel is, that where there is an estate for life, directly devised, and nothing is said as to the reversion, the reversion in fee is no where. When D, <em>L., </em>the testator, died, <em>A.L. </em>his son, was his heir at law, on whom* according to the statute of descents, the reversion in fee was cast, and through whom the lessors trace their descent from <em>D. L. </em>The lessors of the plaintiff have, therefore, shown themselves to be heirs of the person last seised.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Gilb. on'Tenures, </em>15,16.

We are of opinion that they cannot. It is a maxim of the common law, which <em>De Grey, </em>Ch. Justice, says, in <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Newman', </em>(3 <em>Wil. </em>526 ) has subsisted for ages, as appears by <em>Bracton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(lib. 2. fol. 65.) <em>Britton, (cap. </em>119. 271.) and <em>Fleta, </em>(lib. 6. cap. 1. s. 14.) that lands in fee simple must descend to the heir of the whole blood of the person last actually seised thereof. Lord <em>Coke, </em>in his commentary on the 8th section of <em>Littleton, 15.a. </em>states the law to be, that, if the father make a lease for years, and the lessee entereth and dieth, and the eldest son dieth during the term, before entry and receipt of the rent, the youngest son of the half blood shall not inherit, but the sister; because, the possession of the lessee for years is the possession of the eldest son, so as he is actually seised of the fee simple, and consequently, the sister of the whole blood is to be heir. But, he observes, in the case aforesaid, if the father made a lease for life, or a gift in tail, and dieth, and the eldest son dieth in the life of a tenant for life, or tenant in tail, the younger brother of the half blood shall inherit, because the tenant for life, Or the tenant in tail, is seised of the freehold, and the eldest son had nothing but a reversion expectant upon that freehold or estate tail, and, therefore, the youngest son shall inherit the land, as heir to his father, who was last seised of the actual freehold, (3 <em>Co. Rep. </em>42. <em>Ratcliff^s </em>case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">This doctrine has received the sanction of this Court on two occasions 3 in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>(3 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>214.) and in Bates v. <em>Shraeder, </em>(13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>200.) In the first case, <em>Esther Hendricks </em>died seised of a real estate in 1775, leaving a husband and two sons and three daughters ; the husband became seised by the curtesy, until his decease in 1798 3 the eldest son died in 1784, intestate, and without issue; the youngest son entered after the death of his father; the sisters brought their ejectment, and the Court held, that the case was governed by the common law, and that the statute of descents did not apply; that the descent to the eldest son was suspended by the existence of the estate of the tenant by the curtesy, and that the eldest son was not seised so as to form a new stock of descent, or to constitute <em>apossessio fratris ; </em>and that the mother was the person last seised, from whom the descent must be claimed 3 and as she died before our statute of descents, her surviving son was adjudged to be entitled to the estate, to the total exclusion of his sisters,</p>\n<p id=\"AQk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In the case of <em>Bates </em>v. Shraeder, the same doctrine prevailed. The counsel for the plaintiff seemed to suppose, that this doctrine was not correct, because the reversion would he in no one, during the interval between the death of <em>Daniel Lawrence </em>and his daughter <em>Mehitabel; </em>it was an inchoate estate in <em>Abraham, </em>dependant on his surviving the tenant for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">This being the law, unless the lessors can make a title, as heirs to <em>Daniel Lawrence, </em>they cannot recover, and they have failed to show what proportions they are entitled t\u00a9 as such heirs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
