The statute of <em>jeofails </em>does not extend to such a case, and the judgment is, on this ground, erroneous. (1 <em>Sell. Pract. </em>392.)</p>\n<p id=\"A5Gt\">The rule in regard to joining different counts in the same declaration is somewhat perplexed; but a review of all the adjudged cases warrants, at least, this conclusion, that where the counts require different judgments, they cannot be joined. <em>(Tidd. Pr. </em>11. in nolis. 1 <em>Chitty Plead. </em>199. <em>Courtney </em>v. <em>Collet, </em>Lord <em>Raym. </em>272. 2 <em>Saund. </em>117. e. n. 2.) The judgment in trespass <em>vi et armis, </em>and for all other torts committed with force and violence, is, beside damages, <em>quod defendens capiatur pro fine </em>; and in all actions of trespass on the case, for torts, which imply no force, the judgment is <em>quod sit in misericordia. </em>Trover is of the latter description, and, therefore, cannot be joined with trespass <em>vi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>et </em>armis. We regret that the law is so, but the authorities show,\u2019that this may be taken advantage of on a writ of error, as well as on demurrer, or on arrest of judgment. <em>( Chitty on </em>Plead. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u2022 Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
