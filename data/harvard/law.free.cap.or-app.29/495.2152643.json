That ordinance provides that the county may charge the costs of assessment and taxation to each of the taxing districts within the county on a pro rata basis computed upon amount of revenue assessed and collected per district. It further provides that each district must either pay the fee annually or authorize the county to hold back the fee from revenues prior to disposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Plaintiffs generally contend that the ordinance is unconstitutional because assessment and taxation is made a matter of state concern by the Oregon Constitution and the legislature has not authorized the collection of fees for the performance of those functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\">Defendant concedes that assessment and collection are matters of state concern, but that paying the costs of those functions is a matter of county concern subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>to county legislation under the Washington County Home Rule Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">It is therefore the responsibility of the court to determine whether the state or county interest predominates and thus whether the activity is subject to state or to county legislation. <em>State ex rel Heinig v. Milwaukie, et al, </em>231 Or 473, 373 P2d 680 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"> Oregon Constitution Art IX, \u00a7 1, explicitly requires legislation regulating statewide uniform assessment and taxation. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\"The Legislative Assembly shall, and the people through the initiative may, provide by law uniform rules of assessment and taxation. All taxes shall be levied and collected under general laws operating uniformly throughout the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The first sentence designates the substantive law of assessment and taxation not only as a subject of state concern, but as a subject of state mandated responsibility. That assignment of responsibility is implicitly a grant of authority to legislate the mechanism for its accomplishment. The second sentence requires that the statutes enacted for the accomplishment of the mandate be uniform. The constitutional mandate for \"general laws\u201d for levy and collection of taxes includes beyond reasonable question the authority to assign by statute administrative responsibility to such agencies of government as the legislature deems appropriate. It would go without saying, were it not here challenged, that the authority to assign administrative responsibility includes authority to assign fiscal responsibility for those administrative functions, because the legislature cannot assure itself that the functions will be performed unless it can be certain that the performance will be securely financed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In implementation of Art EX, \u00a7 1, the legislature has provided for a uniform system of property taxation by enactment of ORS chapters 305-312, assigning to the counties primary responsibility for assessment, ORS ch 308, and collection, ORS ch 311, subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>supervision of the Department of Revenue, ORS 305.090.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"> Nowhere in the code does there appear express authorization for the county to pass on the cost as a fee to the taxing districts, their constituents, or any other user of the system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, individual sections demonstrate what is otherwise implicit: that the counties must bear the cost of doing the job assigned to them. If a county fails to make regular assessments, the Department of Revenue may take remedial measures and the county must \"bear the full expense,\u201d ORS 308.061(1). The county tax collector must collect the taxes of all other districts within the county as well as those of the county itself, pursuant to ORS 311.255, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">\"All ad valorem taxes and all special assessments, fees or other charges required by law to be placed upon the tax roll, which have been lawfully levied and certified to the assessor by any taxing agency or district authorized by law to levy such taxes, assessments, fees or charges, shall be collected by the same officer and in the same manner and at the same time as taxes for county purposes are collected.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The county must provide to the tax collector at its expense sufficient deputies and clerical assistance to enable him to collect the taxes he collects, pursuant to ORS 311.065, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\"Each county tax collector shall be entitled to such deputies and clerical assistance as may be necessary properly to transact the business and perform the work of his office. Such deputies and clerical assistance shall be furnished by the county court at the expense of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Finally, the statutes provide a means by which the county may raise money to perform its duties, that is by the levy of property taxes pursuant to ORS 310.020 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\">\"The county court or board of county commissioners for each county in the state shall, in July of each year, levy a tax upon all taxable property in the county sufficient in amount to defray the expenses of the county for the current fiscal year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The overall import of the relevant statutes, then, is that the legislature has performed its constitutional mandate by providing a uniform system of taxation and, as an integral part of that system, has assigned to the counties as agents of the state the responsibility of assessment and collection and given to them authority to defray their operating expenses by taxation. As a reasonable mechanism for accomplishing the constitutional mandate, it is within the authority of the legislature to have enacted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Washington County concedes, as it must, that the state may constitutionally require the counties to assess and collect taxes on behalf of districts within their boundaries, but it asserts that the method of collection, including operational cost recoupment, is a matter of county concern, outside the terms of Art IX, \u00a7 1, and therefore subject to the legislative power of the county under its home rule charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Home Rule Clause of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>permits county legislation in matters of county concern such as internal organization and assignment of duties among county officers, but it does not diminish in any way the responsibility of the county as administrative agent of the state for performance of assigned state functions, <em>see </em>Etter, <em>Home Rule in Oregon, </em>46 Or L Rev 251, 279-80 (1967), such as tax assessment, collection and disbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">The allowance of county-by-county variation at the discretion of each county financing the taxation system would be contrary to the constitutional requirement that levy and collection be done \"under general laws operating uniformly throughout the State.\u201d Although defendant county cites language from <em>Heinig </em>that \"uniformity in itself is no virtue,\u201d the issue of virtue or vice does not arise where, as here, the constitution explicitly requires uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The general laws requirement clearly extends to the costs of the taxing system. The tax assessment and collection system is a neutral fiscal conduit between the taxpayers and the taxing districts which serve them. Both ends of the conduit are entitled to uniform treatment under general law. Thus taxing districts are entitled to uniformity of access to and benefit from the taxing system regardless of which county they happen to be located in. Statewide uniformity would be impossible if each county were to decide for itself whether and how to recover operational costs from the user districts. For example, similar districts would have their revenues reduced by collection costs or not depending upon the county in which they are located. The amount of the charges could vary from one home rule county to another depending upon the fee formulae adopted. Access to the system would be obstructed if home rule counties chose to adopt fee formulae (e.g., per transaction, per taxpayer, per computer usage, etc., rather than per amount of revenue) which would take so much of a small levy as to render the levy nonproductive.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Neither the words nor the purpose of the Home Rule Clause require tolerance of a 36-piece administrative and fiscal crazy quilt in place of a system operating uniformly under general laws as mandated by the specific constitutional clause on taxation. This is not to say that user charges are constitutionally impermissible, but rather that cost bearing for the system is a subject for state, not county, legislation. Nor is this to say that variation to fit local conditions would necessarily be impermissible, but rather that this is a subject for general laws, not county ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">Therefore, we hold that the legislative assignment of administrative and fiscal responsibility for ad valorem tax assessment and collection to the counties is valid as a matter of dominant state concern under Oregon Constitution, Art IX, \u00a7 1, that the Home Rule Clause, Art VI, \u00a7 10, does not authorize the county to transfer its fiscal responsibility thereunder, and that Washington County Ordinance No. 187 is unconstitutional as beyond the authority of the county to enact.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In light of this disposition, it is not necessary to reach the issue joined by the plaintiff City of Banks and the defendant county as to whether the cost recovery constitutes a user fee or an impermissible tax upon other units of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Washington County Ordinance 187 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\"The Board of County Commissioners of Washington County, Oregon, ordains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\"SECTION 1.
