Oscar Allen came into the store, ordered a bottle of gin, and laid some change on the counter to pay therefor. While the deceased was counting this money, which was not enough, appellant walked into the store with two dollars in his hand and gave the same to the deceased, who started to place same in the cash register, whereupon Oscar Allen produced a pistol and called upon the deceased to \u201cGive me all your money.\u201d Deceased put up his hands and appellant, Charlie Allen, said, \u201cLet him have it.\u201d Oscar Allen then shot Enna through the breast from which wound he died in about five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">There are no bills of exception in the record, and no testimony was offered by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>We think the testimony is sufficient under the law of principals to show that appellant aided, encouraged and abetted his brother in killing this unoffending man.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">HAWKINS, P.
