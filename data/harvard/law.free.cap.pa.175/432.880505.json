Before Gordon, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-3\">This scire facias was brought July 18, 1893, upon a mortgage given by Emanuel Kuntz and Catharine his wife, to Grier Brothers, \u2014 dated and executed on Saturday, November 29,1890, and recorded December 1, 1890, \u2014 on house and lot of the wife in Du Bois, to secure payment of $1,530, within three years, with interest payable annually from the date thereof. On March 21, 1891, Grier Brothers assigned the same to Esther Maginnis. On July 23, 1892, she assigned it to Du Bois Deposit Bank. The interest for the first year was paid about the time it was due. The mortgage was given to secure debts of Emanuel Kuntz due to Grier Brothers. It covered three matters; first, judgment No. 137, May term, 1889, Andrew Pentz, Jr., Assignee, v. Emanuel Kuntz, for 233.63; second, a note of Emanuel Kuntz, dated March 15, 1889, for $961.61 at four months after date ; third, the one half of the book account of Hamer &amp; Kuntz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-4\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">The defense is made principally upon the part of Catharine Kuntz, one of the mortgagors, who claims to be the legal owner of the mortgaged premises, and it is attempted to be made out almost entirely upon her own testimony to the effect that a fraud was practiced upon her, by or through John H. Bierly, who she testifies claimed on the 29th of November, 1890, the date the mortgage was executed, that he was acting for and in behalf of Grier Brothers; that she had no conversation with Grier Brothers, but communicated with them through said Bierly, who came to her, as from them, with their message or communication, and returned again to them with her replies. She testifies that Grier Brothers sent word to her by Bierly that, unless she gave a mortgage upon her property to secure their claims against her husband, they would proceed with a criminal prosecution against him, and would desist from it if she acceded to their request; that he (Bierly) further agreed, if she would give the mortgage, she should have and be permitted\u2019 to collect a certain promissory note belonging to his (Bierly\u2019s) wife in the hands and possession of Allison O. Smith, Esq., an attorney of this bar, for $7,500, which was protested and collectible; that the parties to it were responsible and that out of the proceeds therefrom she was to pay off the mortgage, pay a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>indebtedness of several thousand dollars due from him (Bierly) to her husband, Emanuel Kuntz, and for which note he then and there gave her an order on said A. O. Smith; that to avoid the criminal prosecution and relying upon the agreement, by which she was to obtain the note, she consented to give the mortgage, and executed the same; that her subsequent efforts to secure the $7,500 note was unavailing, the custodian under instructions from Bierly refusing to give it to her without Mrs. Bierly\u2019s consent, and that instead of it being given to her it was given to said Bierly; that in short she was cheated and defrauded by said Bierly, acting for and in behalf of Grier Brothers, and should not now be called upon to pay the mortgage debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">On the other hand, James Grier and George E. Grier, the only two members of the firm of Grier Brothers residing in or who were in Du Bois on the 29th day of November, 1890, when it is alleged this mortgage was given, deny all knowledge of any fraud or imposition practiced upon the mortgagors; they testify that Bierly had no authority to act for them and did not in fact do so, that, he purported in the two conversations had with James Grier to be acting for Mr. and Mrs. Kuntz. James Grier testified that when Bierly came to him he demanded payment of their entire claim, consisting of book account and note against the husband and a claim against Hamer &amp; Kuntz; that upon Bierly\u2019s second visit, he (Bierly) represented that Mrs. Kuntz objected to paying Hamer\u2019s debts, and he thereupon consented to throw off one half of that claim if the balance was paid, and that nothing was said that day about a mortgage. He testifies further that in a day or two their attorney, Mr. Cole, came to see them about a mortgage, which he agreed to accept, and that subsequently the matter was adjusted by mortgage through Mr. Cole, and included the claims mentioned and the Pentz judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">Outside of the testimony of Bierly on cross-examination there is nothing in the evidence showing any participation or knowledge on the part of Grier Brothers of any fraud or imposition upon Mrs. Kuntz. They had absolutely nothing to do with either Mr. or Mrs. Kuntz in the transaction, so far as their testimony in the case is concerned. The only connection they had with it was they got the benefit of the giving of the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>gage, and the only testimony connecting them with the negotiations is that of Bierly, who on his examination in chief, called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, testified that he came to Du Bois to assist in adjusting certain differences at the request and expense of Emanuel Kuntz, the husband, and that neither of the Grier Brothers said anything to him about the criminal prosecution on the mortgage. On cross-examination, however, he contradicted himself flatly, admitted that James Grier had talked of the mortgage and the criminal prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\">The testimony of Mrs. Kuntz, as well as that of Mr. Bierly, is long, and we don\u2019t pretend to give you in detail what they \u2022swore to. It cannot be denied that there is evidence tending to establish the fact that Mrs. Kuntz was imposed upon by Mr. Bierly, and the evidence shows him to be a man lacking in integrity and truthfulness. But the question remains, is the testimony such as to make out such a case of fraud as to avoid and annul the mortgage and entitle the defendants to a verdict. As we look at it, the evidence establishes the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">1. That in what Mrs. Kuntz did she acted voluntarily, without any coercion, compulsion or restraint on the part of anybody. \u25a0She is an intelligent woman, experienced and capable of taking \u25a0care of herself and of her interests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">2. That she was well acquainted with Mr. Bierly, who had been in business with her husband, and was his intimate friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">3. That as far back as September 30, 1890, she was dickering with Bierly for this same $7,500 note and got an order from him on the custodian of it for it, with the understanding that out of the proceeds she should pay substantially the same claims for which the mortgage was given (not however including the Pentz judgment), and including the debt of Bierly to Kuntz, and the evidence bears out the allegation that in thus endeavoring to get possession of the Mrs. Bierly note, both in September and in November, 1890, she was acting in the interest of her husband, if not of herself, and with a view of securing the payment of debts due by and to him. \u2666</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">4. That had the $7,500 note been produced and collected as contemplated there would have been no allegation of fraud practiced - upon her, and that her present complaint is on account of Bierly\u2019s subsequent conduct and her failure to secure the note in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>5. That Grier Brothers had nothing to do with any representations made to her or agreements with her, and that if she was imposed upon, as claimed, they had no part in or knowledge of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">6. That as to the criminal prosecution referred to, there is not sufficient evidence to establish as a fact that any felony or other crime was committed, neither is there any evidence of any threats of prosecution or anything said about it by Grier Brothers, such as could affect the validity of the mortgage or the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">We therefore say to you, as a matter of law, that the defense set up in this case is not sufficient and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover. Not only has the defense failed to make out a ease of fraud such as to avoid this mortgage, but, if it existed, they have failed to connect Grier Brothers with it. In the admission of testimony we opened the door wide, against objection from plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to the admission of the evidence which defendants offered to establish their case, upon condition that it should not affect the plaintiff unless Grier Brothers were connected with it, and, with every opportunity thus afforded them, their proof in our opinion does not measure up to the requirements of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,756.44.

There is no question in the case that requires discussion. The assignments of error are both dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
