At that time Allegheny avenue was a public street laid out on the confirmed plan of the city of Philadelphia of a width of one hundred feet, but not opened. The description in the deed was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-14\">\u201c All that certain lot or piece of ground situate in the Twenty-eighth Ward of the City of Philadelphia, Beginning at the South West Corner of Thirtieth Street and Allegheny Avenue thence extending Westward along-the South side of Allegheny Avenue one hundred and two feet eleven and three-eighths inches to the South East side of Nicetown Lane, thence South West along the same one hundred and seventy-three feet five inches and three-quarters, thence South Eastward by ground now or late Edgar P. Michener, forty two feet seven inches and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>one-eighth thence by land now or late of Hattie E. Cooper Eastward parallel with the said Allegheny Avenue two hundred feet to the said Thirtieth Street and thence Northward along the West side of said Thirtieth Street one hundred and fifty feet to the place of beginning.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\">Joseph Souder, a witness for plaintiffs, was asked on cross-examination this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">Q. The property extending only to the south line of Allegheny avenue, I ask you what property was taken by the opening of Allegheny avenue for public use for the purpose of a street ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">Objected to. Objection overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">A. I presume in a case of that kind it is customary to give the equity of an unopened street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">The Court: The question is whether the property within the lines of the Hancock estate there \u2014 any portion of it \u2014 was taken by the streets. He wants to know whether the street infringed upon Mr. Hancock\u2019s line. A. Not upon that line; no, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-8\">By Mr. Wayland for defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">Q. Then, in point of fact, no land was taken from the Hancock estate by that opening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-10\">Objected to. Objection overruled. Exception for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-11\">The Court: The question is whether any land called for by the deed was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">A. Nothing called for by the deed was taken. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-13\">George W. Hancock, a witness for plaintiffs, on cross-examination was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-14\">Q. Your testimony therefore is based upon something which is not, in point of fact, contained in the deed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-15\">Objected to. Objection overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-16\">A. My testimony is based on that official plan. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-17\">Isaac L. Miller, a witness for plaintiffs, was asked on cross-examination this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-18\">Q. If as matter of law, by reason of the implied covenant arising in the deed between the parties, the grantor in this deed bound himself to keep it open as a street for the benefit of the grantee or his successors, what would be the value of that strip in the bed of the street charged with the right of passage over it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-19\">Objected to. Objection overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-20\">A. Not anything. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The court charged the jury in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\">[That question arises notwithstanding their deed carried them to the middle of the street, because it is clear that although they took the title to the middle of the street, they took it subject to' the public easement, that is, subject to the right of the public to pass over the street at pleasure, it being like any other public highway in the city of Philadelphia, a street along which anybody had a right to walk or to drive or to ride, and the public enjoyed an absolute right to the uses of the street for the purposes of a passage along it.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">[The question is, therefore, whether the actual or legal right which carried the plaintiffs\u2019 legal title to the middle of the street was of any practical value subject to this public right. Of. course they could not build upon it, they could not use it for any purpose except in common with the citizens of Philadelphia ; they might use it as a highway. The real question, therefore, at the bottom of the case is whether what was taken was of any value to them. It is said that if the street should at any time be vacated, the right to the soil in that vacated street would revert to the present owners, the Hancocks. That is very true.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">[But that does not alter the case. The question is whether that is susceptible of a peculiar valuation, such a contingent and uncertain right as that, whether you can say that is of any such value that you can safely estimate it in money. Unquestionably, they took the strip for which damage is now claimed, which is a part of Allegheny avenue, subject to the public right of passage over it, subject to its being a highway of the city of Philadelphia, and the question is whether property so situated is of any appreciable value upon which a jury can place a valuation.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">[If it is of no value to the plaintiffs, any more than it is to the rest of the public, of course you are not to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for any value. If it was of any value in any point of view to the plaintiffs over and above the general right of-enjoyment which they had, an enjoyment in common with the entire public, then you can find a verdict for the plaintiffs if you can arrive at such a valuation by any fair reasoning, and -by examination of the facts in the case.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">[The question is, whether the legal right which a man has to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the fee to the property bordering on a street which is called for as a boundary in his deed, which is subject to the public right of the people to use it as a street at all times, is of any real appreciable value upon which you can safely fix a pecuniary price. If it is, you can find such a sum for the plaintiffs. If it is not, you should find a verdict for the defendant.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-3\">[I have been requested by the plaintiffs to charge you to the effect that there is nothing in the case, as it has been presented to the jury, which shows or warrants the finding of the fact that the property of the Hancock estate is subject to a right in favor of anybody else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">Of course, I must refuse that point, because the evidence is plain and uncontradicted that by the opening of Allegheny avenue, a fact that is set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 statement, the half of Allegheny avenue bounding on the property, for the taking of which the plaintiffs claim to recover damages, became subject to the right of way by the general public as a street, and, as I said, the question is whether property so situated is susceptible of any such valuation as would justify you in finding damages for plaintiffs. That is a question of fact for you.] [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">The plaintiffs moved for a new trial, which was refused, Thayer, P. J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">As the plaintiffs\u2019 deed calls for the south line of Allegheny avenue as a boundary, it is very plain that they could not thereby claim an inch of ground beyond it if Allegheny avenue had not been opened. A grantee of land acquires no title in a plotted street until it is opened. The mere plotting of a street does not divest any man of his title, or add anything to any man\u2019s title. It operates, to be sure, as a notice to all owners upon the line of the contemplated street, not to place any buildings or erections in its path, and that if they do they will be allowed no damages for -them when the street is opened. But until the street is opened, the title to the soil over which it is laid out remains precisely as it was before, and no new rights are acquired in consequence of it, except, indeed, as to a grantor who will be estopped by a grant of land, bounded by a plotted street, from depriving the grantee of the use of the street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>When the street is actually opened, then by the well settled law the title of an owner fronting upon it goes to the middle of it \u2014 to the filum vise, but the ownership thus acquired is subject to the general right of passage over it, which is vested in the public at large at the very instant of the opening. So that the moment the bordering owner acquires his title to the soil, the public acquire their title to the user. As no part of the plaintiffs\u2019 ground was taken for the street when it was opened, but another person\u2019s ground, it is not a little difficult to see how they were injured by the opening, for it was only by the opening that they acquired their title to the soil to the middle of the street. Had it not been opened, they would have acquired nothing in the soil, which would in that event have continued in the grantor. Nevertheless, as it seems to have been held in Lehigh Street, 81* Pa. 85 \u2014 a somewhat apocryphal volume\u2014 that a party may technically claim damages for such an opening, the jury being left to be the judges of the extent of his damages, that case was accordingly strictly followed in the trial of this case, it being left to the jury to say what damages the plaintiffs had sustained. They naturally found that they had sustained no damages whatever, their land being worth as much after the opening as before, and we see no reason to disturb such a sensible verdict. Rule refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-8) rulings \u00f3n evidence, quoting the bill of <em>exceptions; </em>(4-9) above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aff\"><em>Henry J. </em>Hancock, for appellants. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APD\">In the absence of title papers a lot bounded by a street extends to the middle of it: Grier v.
