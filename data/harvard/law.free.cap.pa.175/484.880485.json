Luckenbach represented:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">1. That in pursuance of a written contract made between your petitioner and his mother, Maria Luckenbach, he cared for, kept and maintained her during the whole period of her lifetime which covered her widowhood, to wit: From the death \u25a0of her husband, George Luckenbach, November 4, 1878, to her death October 4,1892, making thirteen years and eleven months, \u25a0at rate of $4.50 per week, which contract is set forth hereinafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">2. That said Maria Luckenbach, having died as aforesaid, .and her son, Edwin B. Luckenbach, having administered upon her estate, your petitioner began an action against said administrator for the recovery of compensation for the maintenance .and support of his mother, to wit: No. 82, December term, 1892, in the court of common pleas of Northampton county, and on May 18, 1893, recovered a verdict against said administrator for $3,358.75 and costs of suits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">3. That your petitioner is informed and believes that said Maria Luckenbach left no assets, except some little furniture not exceeding in value $50.00, and that there is no property \u2022coming'to said administrator, and belonging to said decedent in her own right, of which the said sum of $3,358.75 and costs, \u2022or any part thereof, can be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-7\">4. That there are, however, assets of the estate of George Luckenbach, husband of said Maria Luckenbach, out of which the said judgment and costs can be either partly or wholly paid, and out of which equitably the said judgment and costs should be paid, so far as said assets will reach, under the following \u2022circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\">According to the will of said George Luckenbach, duly probated in the register\u2019s office in this county (a copy of which is hereto annexed), said testator gave the dwelling house in which testator lived on Market street, Bethlehem, to his wife for life, with the following proviso: \u201cBut if it should prove at any time during her life that she should find it necessary, or more convenient, to'make sale thereof for her maintenance and well-keeping, in such case my executor shall have full power to make sale of the above-named dwelling house, and to give legal deed and title thereto, and the proceeds of such sale shall be safely invested and loaned out on bond and mortgage, and the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>accruing therefrom, and the capital, if necessary, to be employed! and used for the benefit, maintenance, and comfort of my wife,, during her life,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">Said testator further provided for the conversion into money of two frame dwelling houses owned by him, and appropriated the interest thereof to said support and maintenance, if found necessary, and, finally, after giving a small legacy to his granddaughter, directed that \u201call and whatsoever is left and remaining, after the decease of my beloved wife shall be equally divided share and share alike, between my three children Edwin R.,. Julius B., and Maria, my daughter,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">That said Maria Luckenbach having no estate of her own, and being in duty bound to provide a fund out of which the-compensation provided for in the contract of January 28,1888,. for maintenance and support, then accrued and still accruing,, could be paid your petitioner, on November 28, 1891, availed! herself of the privilege conferred on her in said first above recited, clause of her husband\u2019s will, and duly executed and had served on J. Samuel Krause, executor of said will, a paper in which she declared that she found it necessary and more convenient to make sale of the dwelling house on Market street, in which she lived, and desired and directed him to make sale thereof for her maintenance and well-keeping, a copy whereof is hereto\u00bb annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">5. That on the receipt of said declaration of Maria Luckenbach, the said executor gave due notice of the sale of said property, to be held at the \u201c Sun Hotel,\u201d Bethlehem, on January 9,. 1892, said notice being given by advertisement in the newspapers and by handbills, a copy of which is hereto annexed.. The said premises were then and are now worth nearly, if not quite, the full amount of the judgment recovered by your petitioner for maintenance as above recited, and are situated in a portion of the town where land is readily disposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">6. That shortly before the day of sale, Edwin R. Luckenbach (tbe present administrator of Maria Luckenbach), and his sister Maria, designing to thwart the efforts of their mother to pay the above honest and meritorious claim of her son, and to prevent your petitioner\u2019s getting the compensation agreed on for supporting her, began a litigation in your honorable court, to-restrain said executor from selling said house and lot, Market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>street, as directed by their mother, Maria Luckenbach, and while said litigation was pending, and before its determination by decree, said Maria Luckenbach died on October 4, 1892, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-3\">7. That your petitioner was not a party to said proceeding or litigation, and he is advised that the same has no binding effect on him whatever, that his rights in the matter are the same as if the said litigation had never been begun, and that he is entitled to have the directions of his mother to sell said property, for her maintenance and well-keeping, carried out and proceeded. with by the executor, as of the time when these directions were so as aforesaid irregularly interrupted, to wit in the month of January, 1892, when his mother was alive, and with the same force and effect as if no such interruption had been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">8. That the estate of George Luckenbach remains unsettled and the premises so ordered by Maria Luckenbach to be sold for her maintenance and well-keeping, remain unsold as part assets of said estate, and your petitioner is informed and believes that said executor is willing to sell them for the purpose indicated by said Maria Luckenbach, and to pay over the proceeds to the administrator of Maria Luckenbach, in liquidation of said judgment, as far as they may reach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">9. Your petitioner therefore prays that a rule may be entered on all parties in. interest, to show cause why a decree should not be made directing said executor to make sale of the house and lot, Market street, Bethlehem, Pa., described in said will of George Luckenbach, and said order of Maria Luckenbach, according to the provisions of said will, and that J. Samuel Krause, executor of George Luckenbach, pay out of the proceeds of such sale to Edwin B. Luckenbach, administrator of Maria Luckenbach, as may be necessary and sufficient to satisfy the debt, Interest and costs of the judgment of Julius B. Luckenbach in the court of common pleas of Northampton county, No. 32, December term, 1892, or if not enough be realized to satisfy the whole of said judgment, then to pay over the proceeds as far as they may reach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">The answer set forth that this matter was adjudicated in the case of Luckenbach\u2019s Appeal, 170 Pa. 586; that there was a revocation of the order to sell, and that, in the former case, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the parties were brought in. It also set forth, at length, the opinion of the Supreme Court in the above case, and the former petition. The facts appear by the report of that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-4\">The court in an opinion by Schuyeer, P.

All that was then decided was that the present appellant not being a legatee but only a creditor of a legatee under the will of George Luckenbach, the orphans\u2019 court had no jurisdiction to order a sale of the land under the act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 73, and the residuary legatees to whom the land would come after the widow\u2019s death, had a right to be heard on the crucial fact of a direction by the widow to her husband\u2019s executor to sell the land for her maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">This fact, which is the foundation of appellant\u2019s asserted rights against the land, has never been ascertained. What is said in the opinion in 170 Pa. 586, that \u201cthe widow requested the executor to make sale, and then revoked the request,\u201d was said with reference to the status of the case as it was then before the court. The residuary legatees alleged a revocation by the widow of the direction to sell, and as they had not had a hearing on that question the case had to be treated as if their allegation was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The debts of the widow not being charged on the land by the testator, the appellant as was heretofore decided has no claim against the land as a substituted legatee, or as the creditor of a legatee. But he avers a right arising from the direction of the widow that the property should be sold to pay him for her maintenance. This is the foundation of the whole case and appellant is entitled to a hearing and determination of the essential fact. By the terms of George Luckenbach\u2019s will his widow was to have the income of his real estate, and \u201cif it should prove at any time during her life that she should find it necessary or more convenient to make sale thereof for her maintenance and well keeping \u201d the executor was directed to sell, and the income of the proceeds or the capital if necessary was to be employed for her benefit, maintenance and comfort. This gave her the option to determine the style of her living, and the necessity of sale. No one else could decide that for her, and no one had any standing to dispute her decision in regard to it. Her exercise of the option was complete by a direction to the executor to sell. It was of course revocable by her but it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>revoked merely by lier death. It was not the sale that was to be during her life, but that \u201c she should find it necessary or more convenient to make sale.\u201d Her part was done when she directed the sale, and the carrying out of the order by the executor in her lifetime was immaterial. No delay on his part could change her rights or those of others which depended on them. This was decided in Reek\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 432, which went farther on this point than we are required to do here, for it was held under the provisions of the will in that case that the necessity for the use of the principal might be determined by the court after the widow\u2019s death although she had made no demand for it. Miller &amp; Bowman\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 404, and Mellon v. Reed, 123 Pa. 1, 15, cited hy appellee, decided only that the wills in question made no conversion, but only gave a contingent authority to convert. That is all there is here, with the additional fact that the contingency, to wit the direction of the widow to sell, is averred to have happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The petition does not ask for relief in the specific form in which alone it can he granted. But whatever might be tbe effect of this objection in ordinary cases we think the appellant is entitled to indulgence by reason of the special circumstances. His first petition prayed a decree directing the executor to make sale of the house and lot described in the will of George Luckenbach \u201c and said order of Maria Luckenbach,\u201d and thereupon to pay, etc. This was the proper form for the relief asked, and the court upon it decreed a sale, but based the decree on the ground that the petitioner had succeeded to the rights of the widow and the case was therefore within the act of 1834. For this reason, and because the residuary legatees had not been heard on the question of the revocation of the widow\u2019s order to sell, the decree was reversed. It was not unnatural for the petitioner to infer from this that the prayer of his petition was disapproved, but such was not the intention. The reversal was a decision against the decree, not against the relief asked. The present petition sets forth the necessary facts, and only the formal prayer is wanting. The petitioner therefore should have leave to amend his prayer for relief, and that being done, the court should proceed to determine the fact whether the widow exercised her power under the will to direct a sale, and did not revoke it. If this should be determined in appellant\u2019s favor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>executor should then make the sale, and bring the proceeds into court to meet the appellant\u2019s claim, with the same effect as if done in the widow\u2019s lifetime. The land notwithstanding the decree in partition must be subject to prior debts and charges as in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">Decree reversed at the costs of the appellee and record remitted for further proceedings in accordance with tins opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
