And plaintiff further avers that by reason of the said increased flow of water as aforesaid, the usual outlet of the said stream is insufficient to carry off the said water in times of ordinary rains, and the waters so discharged into said stream are obstructed and impeded, and made to back up and overflow the premises of plaintiff and render them valueless and uninhabitable, to the great damage of the plaintiff as hereafter stated. And plaintiff further avers that the said defendant has caused to be collected and discharged into the said stream the contents of private cesspools and privies and stables, and the filth of the upper part of Bloom street and Yorks hill, which filth so collected and discharged in times of ordinary rain, and at all other times, is precipitated upon the lands and property of the plaintiff, causing noxious odors and poisonous vapors, and rendering the premises of the plaintiff uninhabitable, by reason of the pollution of the air; that the odors and vapors and noxious gases so generated pollute the air in, upon and about the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and destroy the comfort of plaintiff\u2019s home, and impair the health of himself and family, causing sickness and discomfort of his said family, and the plaintiff has heen and still is greatly annoyed and incommoded in the use, possession and enjoyment of his said property, and is by the commission of the grievances aforesaid hy the defendant as aforesaid otherwise greatly injured and damnified, to wit, at the county aforesaid, to the damage of the plaintiff $5,000, and therefore he brings suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\">Evidence was offered at the trial which tended to support the averments of the statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>May 18, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in refusing to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-4\"><em>James Scarlet </em>and <em>H.

By means of a covered sewer and a paved alley, the surface drainage of nearly twenty acres has been turned into this stream and one or more cellar drains have been connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>with it. The stream thus became an open sewer, adopted and used as such, by the borough authorities; and the duty of the borough to keep its channel open and to remove accumulations \u25a0of filth, ashes, or other material that obstructed the flow of the water and threw it out of its banks upon the lands of adjoining lot owners was as clear as though the sewer had been constructed, instead of having been adopted, by the action of the municipal authorities. The right of action by a lot owner grows, not out of the adoption of the stream as a sewer which was an act wholly within the power of the municipality; but out \u25a0of its negligence in not keeping the sewer in at least as good condition as it found it. There is therefore no question of prescriptive right in this case. There can be no prescriptive right to neglect so plain a municipal duty. If the borough had entered upon some portion of the plaintiff\u2019s lot in the construction of a sewer in 1860, the right of action for that trespass would be at this time effectually barred by the lapse of time. But when a sewer, huilt it may be one hundred or more years ago, gets into bad repair, the liability of the municipality for the injury inflicted upon lot owners arises when the injury occurs and may be sued for within six years thereafter. The judgment -of nonsuit proceeded therefore upon an erroneous idea of the relation of the parties and of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. We are inclined to think enough appears in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration to show that, the injury complained of is charged to the \u25a0failure on the part of the municipality to clean out and keep open the channel of the stream so as in ordinary floods to afford a passage for its water as freely as the natural channel did before the action of 1860 was taken by the borough. This is \u25a0the measure of duty which the municipality owes the plaintiff, and if an amendment is needed in order to place the plaintiff\u2019s claim fully on the record, it can easily be made. But upon the evidence this case presented a question of fact for the jury. That was a question of negligence on the part of the municipality. If the borough has simply drained into this stream and then given no attention to the effect of its action on the stream, or on lot holders along its hanks, and the stream has been choked, or its channel obstructed in consequence of the character or quantity of the material drained into it, and injury has resulted to the plaintiff, the negligence of the borough authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ties in not removing such obstruction and keeping the channel open is the true ground on which the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover must rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Was the stream obstructed or filled up as the result of the adoption of this stream as an open sewer, and the drainage into it ? Did the borough neglect to keep the channel open, and permit the overflow and accumulations complained of? Was the plaintiff injured in consequence of this negligence? If the jury so found their only remaining duty was the ascertainment of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The judgment of nonsuit entered in this case is now reversed and set aside and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
