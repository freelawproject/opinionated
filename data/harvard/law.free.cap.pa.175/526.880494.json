P- Cumberland Co., May T., 1896, No. 4, on case stated for plaintiff.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AxIs\">Before Green, Williams, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ADC\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-9\">Case stated to determine the marketable title to real estate sold by plaintiff to defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-10\">From the record it appeared that plaintiff claimed an estate in fee under a codicil to the will of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">The facts appear by the opinion of the court, Biddle, P. J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-12\">The act of April 8, 1833, provides that all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity unless it appears by a devise over, or by words of limitation, or otherwise in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate. By a codicil to his will, dated February 16, 1885, Cary W. Ahl provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-13\">\u201c I now bequeath to my beloved wife, Catharine W. Ahl, the new house, with the property thereto belonging, being about 16 acres, and she may will it, I mean the old homestead, to any of my children at her own discretion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-14\">It will be noticed that there is no devise over at Mrs. Ahl\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>death, and we find nothing either in the will or in the various codicils thereto which indicates an intention on the part of testator other than that which the codicil before us discloses.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1S\">May 18, 1896 :</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">That an estate in fee simple became vested in Mrs. Ahl is quite clear. The case of McIntyre v. McIntyre, 123 Pa. 329, is directly in point. The language there was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">\u201c I will and bequeath to my daughter, Mary McIntyre, the one half of the land that I possess above the road \u2014 that is the north end. She will not have power to sell, but may leave the same to her children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">The court ruled (a) that the attempted restraint upon alienation contained in the first part of the second sentence was void, as being in conflict with the fee given by the preceding sentence, and (b) that the concluding words, \u201cmay leave the same to her children,\u201d were precatory only and did not defeat the otherwise operative effect of the devise. Many other adjudications to the same effect might be cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">In Boyle v. Boyle, 152 Pa. 108, Mr. Justice Williams reviews the Pennsylvania cases on the subject, and lays down the general doctrine that mere precatory words, or words of command, or words of explanation, are not enough to establish an intention that is not to be gathered from a consideration of the operative words upon the face of the instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-9\">This principle is decisive of the case in hand, and it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants for the sum of $15,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-11\"><em>W.
