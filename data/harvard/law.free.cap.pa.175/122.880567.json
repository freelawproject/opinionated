Mann was the only passenger upon one of the defendant\u2019s horse cars, which was being driven west on Master street; one man being both driver and conductor. Without any invitation upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>part of' the driver the deceased went upon the front platform and took the driver\u2019s seat, a high stool, narrow at the base, without arms or other protection. When the car turned the switch at Seventh and Master streets, the deceased was thrown from the stool and killed. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved for a nonsuit.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A72\">April 13, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">Judge Biddle : \u201c What excuse is there for any man on boarding an empty car to take the driver\u2019s seat and run the risk of that position ?

There was literally no excuse for the deceased taking the driver\u2019s seat on the front platform and exposing himself to the risks of such a position. The car was empty and it was the clear duty of the passenger to take his seat on the inside. He was not obliged to go on the front platform for want of room inside, nor was he there by invitation of the driver. The danger was increased by his occupying the driver\u2019s stool, which was high and with no arms or other protection, and narrow at the base. The case does not come within any of the decisions in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>was held not to be negligence for a passenger to ride on the platform. In those cases the cars were crowded and the occnpaney of the platform was invited or permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
