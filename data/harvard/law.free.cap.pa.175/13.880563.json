Nelson Lewis, was made the principal beneficiary in case of a failure of children. No provision was made therein for any second wife. There was no clause of revocation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">A schedule was attached to said deed of trust, headed \u201c Schedule of the property and estate assigned, transferred and set over unto the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company upon the uses and trusts mentioned and set forth in the foregoing indenture.\u201d This included cash, shares of stock and bonds. No mention was made of the annuity or rent charge given to him by the will, which is the subject of the present controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">Lewis\u2019 first wife died. He married again. In October, 1890, he made a second deed of trust to the same trust company, by which he conveyed to it, in trust, all his interest in certain warehouses and lots of ground in the city of Baltimore, state of Maryland, and in and to any sums, principal or income, which might arise thereout. By this deed a spendthrift trust was created for himself during his life. Upon his decease the income was to be paid to his second wife during her widowhood. There was a remainder over of a certain sum to his counsel, in compensation of services which had been rendered to him, and to certain nieces of his wife, or to his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">By the will of Elisha Lewis, Sr., the warehouses in the city of Baltimore were devised to Albert Nelson Lewis, in fee, subject to the payment to Elisha Lewis, \u201c his heirs and assigns,\u201d of the sum of $1,000 per annum, in equal quarterly installments of $250 each so long as the warehouses should not rent for less than $6,000 per annum. This annuity, in case the rental fell to less than the designated sum, was to be reduced to $900 per annum. This annuity, and those given to the other children, were declared \u201c to be a lien and charge upon the said warehouses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\">On the 18th day of September, 1878, A. Nelson Lewis, finding that the rental had fallen to a sum considerably less than $6,000 per annum, filed his petition in the circuit court of Baltimore, making Elisha Lewis and his then wife, and the three other annuitants named in said will, Mary Lewis, William Melville Lewis and Augustus Jarrett Lewis (now called Jarrett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thomas Lewis) respondents. By said petition he demanded a decree of construction of his father\u2019s will, and that his right, and those of the annuitants, should be ascertained and defined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\">January 27, the Baltimore court decreed that no personal liability for the payment of the annuities attached upon Albert Nelson Lewis beyond the value of the property devised to him and the income and rent to be derived therefrom. It was decreed that by said will there was vested a fee simple in said premises in said Albert Nelson Lewis, \u201csubject to a charge and lien thereon in favor of said annuitants to secure to them the payment of their said annuities,\u201d and that the annuitants were entitled to have the rents and profits applied to the payment of their said annuities as in the decree specifically set forth. It was ordered that said Albert Nelson Lewis should account and pay, in each year, out of the gross rental of the premises, after paying taxes and public charges and assessments and necessary expenses of maintenance, to each of the annuitants, the sum of $1,000 per annum if the said rents should suffice to pay the same, and if the same should be insufficient, that then the net balance of the rents should be equally and ratably divided in fee simple among the annuitants. It was decreed \u201cthat the interest of each annuitant in said property, and the right of each to receive his or her annuity from the same as above de- \" creed, do and shall constitute a lien and charge upon the said property and upon the income thereof, which right, lien and charge upon said property is hereby decreed to be the absolute property of each annuitant descendible to his or her heirs at law as real estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">It was further decreed that Albert Nelson Lewis should not receive for his own use any part or portion of said rents or income \u201c during any year of its rental, unless and until there shall have been paid from said rents and income the current annuities for- that year.\u201d It was further ordered \u201c that in the event of the sale of said property, the proceeds of the same shall first be applied to the payment of each annuitant, his or her heirs and assigns, of a sum of money sufficient to produce, at six per cent interest, an income of $1,000 per annum, if said proceeds shall be sufficient; and if insufficient, then that said proceeds shall be first applied to pay to each annuitant, his or her heirs or assigns, a sum of money sufficient, at six per cent,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to produce au income of $900 per annum, and after fully paying and satisfying said annuitants, their heirs and assigns, as above decreed, the residue of said proceeds, if any, shall be the property of said Albert Nelson Lewis, his heirs or assigns, owners of said property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">After said decree Albert Nelson Lewis continued to pay to the annuitants so much money, not exceeding the sums named in the will, as were realized out of the rents of the warehouses. The latter were subsequently sold, and some $9,000 were realized as the share of the proceeds payable to Elisha Lewis, Jr. This fund was paid to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, and the present bill was filed for the purpose of determining whether it held the same under the first or under the second deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The court entered a decree that the proceeds of the sale of the Baltimore property should be retained and accounted for by the trustees in accordance with the provisions of the deed of trust of October 18, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>J.
