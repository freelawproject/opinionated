His leg was broken, and he was taken to a hospital where he remained fourteen weeks. The evidence in behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that he. knew nothing of the condition of the pavement; that he was walking with due care and diligence; that the entire pavement was covered with ice and snow which lay in ridges and hills four or five inches high; that this condition of affairs existed for at least from ten to fourteen days prior to the accident; that it had snowed heavily from 6:25 p. m. of January 14, 1893, to 12:15 A. m. of January 15, 1893, and lightly from 7:45 A. M. to 9:45 A. M. of January 15, 1893, which snow had not been removed; that it had snowed on or about January 6 or 7, 1893, and also on January 10 or 11,1893, neither of 'which' snow falls had been removed. It was further proved that the police authorities on two occasions, viz, on about January 9, 1893, and on about January 12, 1893, notified the occupants of the premises to remove the ice and snow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-4\">D\u00e9fendant\u2019s points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">3.

The jury was carefully instructed that the city was not liable for a mere ordinary slippery condition of the sidewalk resulting from the sudden formation of ice, but that if the snow and ice existed in ridges and little hills and the pavement was permitted to remain in that condition for a length of time sufficient to charge the city with knowledge of the situation, and the obstruction was not removed, there might be liabilityfor an accident happening in those circumstances. There was plenty of testimony to establish the plaintiff\u2019s contentions in this respect, and it was therefore the duty of the court below to submit the case to the jury, which was done in a very careful. and cautious manner. The liability cannot be removed by a mere notice to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
