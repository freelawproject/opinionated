You are acquainted with, tbe members of tbe firm of Trymby, Hunt &amp; Co. ? A. Yes, sir; I know them well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">Q. At the time that the purchases were made from Trymby, Hunt &amp; Co., you, Michael B. Andress and Mr. Craven composed the Gordon Heights Club? A. We were a committee appointed by some members ; yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">Q. Were you present when this note was.received by Mr. Trymby of Trymby, Hunt &amp; Co. ? A. Yes, sir. I handed that note to Mr. Edward Trymby myself at my office, Fifth and Chestnut.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">Q. Tell the court and jury what took place at that time ? A. I prepared this note some two weeks and the receipt before Mr. Trymby took it. I wrote to Mr. Trymby to come and get it and he sent his bookkeeper. That gentleman stopped there after it, and he read it, and as it stated \u201c in full settlement \u201d he thought he would not have anything 'to do with it. He said he would not take it. I saw Mr. Andress a couple of days afterwards and told him what the bookkeeper said, that he had better see Mr. Trymby, and he went to Mr. Trymby\u2019s store, so he stated to me, and I saw him afterwards, and he said Mr. Trymby would call on me and see me about this, and Mr. Trymby called on me and said Mr. Andress had been there and made everything satisfactory, and he signed this receipt and took that note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">Q. State what was said ? A. He said he had made arrangements with Mr. Andress and everything was satisfactory, that he would take this note, that he wanted money and he would discount it and raise the money. I do not know exactly whether he said he would take it as collateral, but he said everything was satisfactory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-10\">By Mr. Levy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">Q. What did Mr. Andress tell you that the agreement was between him and Trymby, Hunt &amp; Co. ? A. Mr. Andress said that he had to guarantee this, that he would not take it in any other way, or something to that effect. That we had to pay something on account and fix it up when it came due, and renew it and pay it as it went.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-12\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-13\">1. The plaintiffs\u2019 written agreement showing the receipt by them of the promissory note of a third party in full settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of their claims cannot be altered or contradicted, except upon proof of fraud, accident or mistake in its execution. <em>Answer : </em>Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-4\">2. There is no evidence in this case that warrants an alteration of the written agreement. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $658.87.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1) ruling on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions ; (2, 3) above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-7\"><em>E. Cooper </em>Shapley, <em>Edward W. Magill </em>with him, for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">The judge erred in admitting Charles C. Haines as a witness on behalf of plaintiffs. This proceeding is not against the surviving partners or joint promisors. It is against the deceased. Therefore, the exceptions in the act of 1887 do not apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">If it be held'that a suit against the executor of the deceased and the survivors jointly is within the exception, then the testimony of Haines is not admissible to affect Andress\u2019 estate, because <em>(a) </em>the statement by Haines of what Trymby told him Andress said is not admissible, and (5) the conversation between Andress and Haines is not a matter' that occurred between a surviving partner or joint promisor, and the other party on the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">The plaintiffs' written agreement showing the receipt by them of the promissory note of a third party in full settlement of their claims, cannot be altered or contradicted, except upon proof of fraud, accident or mistake in its execution: Phillips v. Meily, 106 Pa. 536; Hoffman v. R. R., 157 Pa. 174; Kellogg v. Richards, 14 Wend. 116.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">The cases which allow receipts to be explained are cases of recitals in deeds : Hamilton v. McGuire, 3 S. &amp; R. 355; Bolton v. Johns, 5 Pa. 145. Or of mistakes in amount: Jones v. Patterson, 1 W. &amp; S. 321; Bell v. Bell, 12 Pa. 235 ; Gue v. Kline, 13 Pa. 60; Shoemaker v. Stiles, 102 Pa. 549. Or some other mistake of fact: Russell v. Church, 65 Pa. 15; Wolf v. City, 105 Pa. 25 ; Megargel v. Megargel, 105 Pa. 475. Or where the receipt is a mere acknowledgment of delivery or payment: Dutton v. Tilden, 13 Pa. 46 ; Grove v, Donaldson, 15 Pa. 128; Batdorf v. Albert, 59 Pa. 59. Or there was fraud in the procuring of it: McGrann v. R. R., 111 Pa. 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In the present case no fraud, accident or mistake was alleged, but the only proposition was to show that the note of a third party, which was agreed to be taken \u201c in full settlement,\u201d was not so taken: Harris v. Hay, 111 Pa. 562; Greenleaf on Ev. sec. 305; Fuller v. Crittenden, 9 Conn. 406; Langdon v. Langdon, 4 Gray, 186; Furbush v. Goodwin, 5 Foster (25 N. H.), 425 ; Wood v.

Levi, </em>for appellees. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1N\">Even if there was not any evidence of any actual fraud, accident or mistake committed at the inception of the agreement as evidenced by said \u201c receipt,\u201d if the same was subsequently attempted by defendants to be used fraudulently for a different purpose than that for which it was. agreed to be used, oral evidence is admissible to show what the real agreement between the parties was: Rearick v. Rearick, 15 Pa. 66 ; Billinger v. Eckert, 16 S. &amp; R. 424; Stine v. Sherk, 1 W. &amp; S. 195; Frey v. Heydt, 116 Pa. 611; Renshaw v. Gans, 7 Pa. 119; Sehettinger v. Hopple, 3 Grant, 54; Woolan v.

Oliver, 4 Rawle, 141; Rearich v. Swineheart, 11 Pa. 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">Appellees\u2019 answer to appellant\u2019s objection, that the testimony of Charles C. Haines \u201cis only that of a single uncorroborated witness,\u201d is that a preponderance of proof is all that is required : Gehres v. Crawford, 9 Atl. 508; Bugger v. Creswell, 12 Atl. 829; Dick v. Ireland, 130 Pa. 299; Bank v. Thompson, 144 Pa. 393; Brewster\u2019s Eq. Pr. sec. 5452; Brawdy v. Brawdy, 7 Pa. 157; McIntyre v. Kennedy, Childs &amp; Co., 29 Pa. 448; Weakly v. Bell, 9 Watts, 273; 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 9th Am. ed. p. 627; Haines v. Pearce, 41 Md. 221; 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 96; Bank v. Huston, 11 W. N. C. 389 ; Wodock v. Robinson, 148 Pa. 503.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">Appellees\u2019 reply to appellant\u2019s point that Haines is not a competent witness for plaintiffs under the act of 1887 is that, said witness is not a party to the record except in a nominal sense, to wit, said Haines was not served with process, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>did he file any voluntary appearance as one of the defendants therein, and the jury was only sworn as to Alexander Magill, executor of the estate of said Michael B. Andress.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJ\">April 6, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\">Appellees submit that the act contemplates an immediate and direct interest in the outcome of the very suit, and not an indirect, contingent and remote interest therein. The existence of a possible right of recovery over against Haines by way of contribution, upon payment of judgment by Magill as executor of Michael A. Andress, is not enough: Dixson v. McGraw Bros., 151 Pa. 98; Spotts\u2019 Est., 156 Pa. 281.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b32-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We find nothing in this record that would justify us in sustaining any of the assignments of error. The questions involved were rightly decided, and neither of them requires discussion. The witness, Charles C. Haines, called by the plaintiffs, is on the record as one of the defendants, but was not served. His interest, so far as he could have had any, was adverse to the plaintiffs. They elected to make him their witness; and, in the circumstances, there appears to be no valid objection to his competency. We think he was rightly admitted. Defendant\u2019s requests for charge, recited in the second and third specifications, were rightly refused. The case depended on the question of fact whether the note specified in plaintiffs\u2019 receipt of June 8, 1892, was given and accepted as absolute payment of the bill of goods therein mentioned. That question was fairly submitted to the jury, upon sufficient evidence, and found in favor of the plaintiffs. The judgment entered on their verdict, should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
