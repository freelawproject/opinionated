The individual defendants were members of a subordinate lodge known as The Good Samaritan Lodge No. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of the Junior American Protestant Association, which subordinate lodge is also a defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">During the year 1890, the constitution and by-laws of the plaintiff, as they then existed, were amended and the name changed to that of the plaintiff, and it was provided that the change take effect on the 1st day of January, 1891. The committee on reorganization had embodied in its report a recommendation that a charter be procured, and at the time of tin-vote taken on the adoption of the amended constitution and by-laws a resolution was passed authorizing the officers to obtain a charter. The charter was procured, and the plaintiff thereafter conducted its business, other than lodge and beneficial, as a corporate body. The lodge and beneficial affairs were managed by the same officers and under the same rules as they were before incorporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">. Article XVIII. of the constitution read as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">\u201c Any alteration or amendment of this constitution or rules of order must be offered in writing at a stated meeting, and, if seconded by three representatives, shall be entered upon the minutes. Notice of the proposed alteration or amendment shall be sent by the National Grand Secretary to the subordinate lodges, informing them that the same shall be taken up for consideration at the next session of the Grand Lodge, and if two-thirds of the representatives present vote in favor of it, it shall become part of this constitution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">The defendants and certain other lodges refused allegiance to the Grand Lodge after the amendment of the constitution and change of name. Before that time there were 32 subordinate lodges with the total membership of 3116, \u2014 18 of the lodges with a membership of 2136 composed the active membership of the plaintiff in 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">Notices were given the defendants and other seceding lodges to comply with the laws of the association or to surrender the property acquired as a subordinate lodge of the plaiiyfciff. They refused to renew their allegiance with the plaintiff or to surrender the property acquired as a subordinate lodge thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">The bill in this case was then filed, praying for an account and a decree that the property be transferred to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">The case was referred to Henry A. Fuller, Esq., as examiner and master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The defendants based their defense upon two grounds: first, that the amendment of the constitution and change of name had never been legally effected; and second, that they had surrendered the property for which an account was asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-3\">The master found that the adoption of the amended constitution and change of name had been legally consummated and that the defendants had not surrendered the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">He found in favor of the plaintiff upon all the issues raised by the bill and answer; but held that the charter obtained was -an amendment to the constitution and. by-laws, and was not -adopted in accordance with article XVIII. of the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">He decided that the proposition to incorporate and the matters incident thereto should have been introduced at one meet\u25a0ing, and, after notice, should have been acted upon at another meeting, in accordance with this article of the constitution; therefore the charter was not binding upon the defendants and the plaintiff had no legal standing to maintain this action, and recommended that the bill be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The following is the oxdy portion of the master\u2019s voluminous .report which was excepted to:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">Is plaintiff\u2019s charter binding upon defendants ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">This question has a very serious aspect., The proposition to procure a charter was not made until the meeting in October, 1890, when it was adopted. And the charter itself con\u2022tains important innovations which were never proposed at any meeting. Was that an infringement of article XVIII? In \u2022others words, does that charter amount to an alteration or amendment of the constitution ? If it does, then certainly it is not binding upon the defendants, and the plaintiff has no standing in this case. Now the answer to this question seems to me very plain. The transition from an unincorporated association without a fixed place for the transaction of business, and without a board of directors, to a corporation with a fixed place and a board of five directors, was unquestionably an alteration of the constitution. It is argued that the designation of place and \u2022of hoard might be invalid without invalidating the entire charter or defeating the right of the plaintiff corporation to maintain this suit. But without such designation no charter would have been granted. The designation of some place for the transaction of business and of some board of directors was a</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>condition precedent to incorporation, hence vital to the very existence of the plaintiff. And even if this were otherwise, there still remains the fact of incorporation, which of itself certainly is a material alteration. Before it can be binding, the-proposition to incorporate and the matters requisite to procure-a charter should be introduced at one meeting and put to vote at another meeting, as prescribed in the constitution. This plaintiff is a distinct entity in law from the unincorporated association to which defendants owed allegiance. Its corporate existence has never received their assent, nor was it brought about in a-manner to be binding without their assent. By necessary inference this plaintiff has no legal standing to maintain this bill. I am therefore of opinion, and so report, that the same be dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.
