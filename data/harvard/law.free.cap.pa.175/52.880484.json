Spencer, to comply with the said sale, or without any notice having been given to them by any of the said parties that if they did not comply with the said sale they would be held responsible for any deficiency of price on second sale, the said sheriff returned the said writ of levari facias as set forth in said statement of claim, and an alias writ under the same judgment was duly issued as set forth in this statement, and the property again exposed for sale on December 4,1893, by said plaintiff. At that sale the highest sum bid was $98,000, and at that sum the property was struck down to Benjamin O. Satterwaite, Esq., as attorney, who signed the sheriff\u2019s sale book as such, giving his check for $100 as deposit, and who your affiant believes and avers and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause was acting as attorney for the two lien claimants before mentioned, Thomas D. Trott and Thomas W. Wright- &amp; Son. Under an order of court made in the cause, the sheriff also accepted the attorney for affiants who had bid the sum of $91,070 for affiants, as a second bidder, in case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>first bidder did not comply with the terms of sale. The first bidder did not comply with the terms of sale, and in due course your affiants made settlement with the sheriff, paid all of his costs, including those mentioned in the statement, and took title in the name of one John F. Smiley, who was acting therein as agent for affiant\u2019s firm.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aq5\">April 6, 1896</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-3\">Affiant believes and avers and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause, not only all of the foregoing facts, but also that the present suit has been brought by the sheriff at the request of, and for the sole use of, the said two lien claimants, Thomas D.
