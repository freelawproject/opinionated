From and including April, 1893, to and including December, 1895, the defendant mined and prepared coal from this land of different sizes each month except \u2022 during the months of August, September, October and November, 1895, when no coal was mined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\">11. The defendant admits that it has not for each and every month of the time mentioned paid for at least one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal at the rate of 25 cents per ton. Assuming that the defendant was bound each month to pay for at least one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal at the rate of 25 cents per ton, plaintiffs prepared and offered in evidence a tabular statement showing the minimum quantity of coal to be paid for monthly at the rate of 25 cents per ton, the monthly weights of coal above pea actually returned and paid for by defendant, the deficiency and excess, as the case may be, in weights between the amount plaintiffs contend defendant was bound to pay for at the rate of 25 cents per ton and the amount actually returned, the amount paid from time to time, calculation of interest, etc. The correctness of the figures and accuracy of the calculations are admitted by the defendant, and I find that if the defendant was bound monthly to pay for at least one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal at the rate agreed upon for coal above the size of pea coal, that is at the rate of 25 cents per ton, that it is indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of 13,207.45 with interest from the 20th of January, 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">12. The defendant kept account not only of the total number of tons, but also of the number of tons of each size of coal mined and prepared by it. In some months it produced more than three thousand three hundred and thirty-three and thirty-three and one third hundredths tons of coal above the size of pea coal; in some months it produced less, and in some months none at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>all. In. keeping its accounts it credited the plaintiffs each month with one twelfth of forty thousand tons. When the total tonnage was less than this it apportioned to each size actually produced such number of tons of that size as was proportioned to the amount actually produced, and as would be sufficient with that apportioned to the other sizes to make up the one twelfth of forty thousand tons, and credited the plaintiffs with the number of tons thus ascertained for each size at the rate called for by the agreement for such size. When coal not yet mined was thus credited and paid for, and more than one twelfth of forty thousand tons was produced in any month, a.similar proportionate deduction was made from each size actually produced, and charged to the coal which had previously been paid for but not mined, not however reducing the amount actually paid for in each month below the one twelfth of forty thousand tons. When no coal at all was produced the plaintiffs were credited with one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal of different sizes in the same proportion as it had been produced in the month when it was last produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">18. It is admitted and agreed by the parties that the price of pea coal and buckwheat coal at the breaker varied from month to month, and the proportions of the same made, shipped and returned varied from month to month, and that for the months in which there was no return of pea and buckwheat coal, the defendant applied the prices of the last preceding months in which such coal was produced and returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">14. The several returns of the defendant* in so far as they varied from the plaintiffs\u2019 contention as to the amount of coal at the rate of 25 cents per ton the defendant was bound to pay for, were received by the plaintiffs under protest. But the correctness of the returns, so far as they show the amount of coal produced, the proportionate quantity of each size, and the price per ton allowed for each size, is not in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">15. Acting upon the theory that the mininum of forty thousand tons called for by the lease included coal of all sizes mentioned therein, the defendant made its payments accordingly. The correctness of the 'figures of the account showing the number of tons of coal of each size, and of the prices to be paid for the respective sizes, and the amounts paid from month to month, according to the defendant\u2019s theory as well as the accuracy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the calculations based thereon, are admitted by the plaintiffs, and it is not necessary for me to find specific items in detail, and I find as a fact that from and including April, 1893, to and including December, 1895, with the exception of a small item of interest which will be presently mentioned, the defendant has-paid the plaintiffs for all the coal which it mined during said time, and that it has paid the plaintiffs during said time monthly for at least one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal of different sizes, including pea and smaller sizes of coal, as well as coal above the size of pea coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-3\">16. In making payments of the royalties from month to month the defendant did not always promptly pay the whole amount, which it admitted to be due, and it admits that there is due from it to the plaintiffs the sum of $46.57 interest on the delayed payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\">17. This suit was brought December 5, 1895, but the parties agree that the returns for the month of December, 1895, shall be taken into the case and considered with the other previous months, and that during said month a proportion of buckwheat coal was made but was used under the boilers in driving the-engines, etc., under the 19th article of the agreement, and was not reported to the lessors for the reason that it was not subject to royalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">CONCLUSIONS OS\u2019 LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">1. As already stated the question at issue between the parties is entirely one of law, and turns upon the construction to be given the agreement of January 2, 1882. Upon part of the plaintiffs it is contended that the minimum annual quantity of forty thousand tons of coal, which by the terms of said agreement the lessees or parties of the second part thereunder covenanted to annually mine and to pay for in equal monthly parts, was agreed to be coal for which the price or royalty, under the terms of said agreement, would be 25 cents per ton, that is to say, coal above the size of pea coal, while upon part of the defendant it is contended that when for any month it pays one twelfth of forty thousand tons of coal of the various sizes as produced at the rates specified for the respective sizes, it need pay for no more, unless it has mined more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">Without any unnecessary repetitions of the language of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>agreement it is proper at the outset to observe that the agreement between tbe parties clearly contemplates that \u201c tbe operation of mining shall be so conducted, as to prevent loss of the coal in any of the veins of coal in and under said lands, and to that end the two upper veins shall be mined out first \u201d (article 3) ; that a minimum quantity shall \u201c be paid for, whether it be mined and taken away or not, until all the coal in and under said land, and contained in the several veins, which is available by prudent and skillful mining, shall be mined and taken from the same \u201d (article 7) ; that \u201c the parties of the second part are to conduct their mining operations throughout in a proper and workmanlike manner, and as may be most advantageous to the parties \u201d (article 10) ; that the \u201c parties of the second part are to take from these lands the same proportionate quantity of lump coal that they take from their other operations in the valley,\u201d and that, \u201cfor the purpose of ascertaining the amount of coal to be accounted for and paid for under this agreement as to broken and prepared coal \u201d certain tests shall, if required by either or any of the parties, be periodically made of the coal as it comes from the mines, and is weighed at the head of the breaker, and that \u201c when all of the various kinds and sizes of coal resulting therefrom after going through these processes shall be weighed separately and an account of each and all the kinds and sizes taken, and the product in weight of the different kinds and sizes shall be taken as the product resulting or to result from each one thousand tons of coal thereafter mined, as it comes from the mines and is weighed at the head of the breaker \u201d (article 4).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\">2. It is clear that under the agreement the lessees were bound to mine and take away at least a certain number of tons of coal within specified times, and to pay for such minimum quantity within specified times, whether the same was mined and taken away or not. This is manifest from the second, seventh and eighth articles of the agreement which have already been quoted. And there is no question that that annual minimum quantity after January 1, 1885, was forty thousand tons, and that as appears from article eighth the coal to be mined, taken away and paid for was to be paid for monthly, and that \u201c the full amount of coal mined and taken away monthly shall be accounted and paid for, and in no case less than the proportionate minimum amount herein provided for,\u201d except for the causes named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>8. The question in the ease is, what kind of coal was contemplated by the parties when they agreed upon forty thousand tons as an annual minimum which the lessees agreed to mine and pay for in proportionate monthly amounts. Its solution is not without difficulty. The agreement does not state it in express words. If the language of the agreement were transparent there would be no room for the office of construction, for there should be no construction where there is nothing to construe : Lewis v. United States, 92 U. S. 621. It is essential to ascertain the intention and meaning of the parties. There is nothing before me from which this can be ascertained except the written agreement between them. Their intention must therefore be ascertained from the instrument itself. But this intention must be gathered from the whole instrument. As one sentence may vary the meaning of another sentence, so the true meaning of a paragraph may depend upon the proper interpretation of another paragraph. The intentions of the writer have not been expressed until he has entirely finished, hence to interpret those intentions reference must be had to the whole writing : 11 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency of Law, 514.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-3\">It is too plain for argument that the parties to this agreement contemplated and intended that coal of different sizes should and would be produced. It speaks of lump coal, or coal as it comes from the mines, unbroken and unscreened, and of broken and prepared coal, of pea coal, and coal larger as well as coal smaller than pea coal, and provides how prepared coal shall be screened and assorted. It provides that the weight of each size shall be ascertained, and how it shall be ascertained, and requires the lessees \u201c to render an account of all coal mined and taken from said land during each and every month, and to make and \u2022 prepare two monthly statements showing the amount of each of the various sizes of coal taken from said lands; and the weight of all coal weighed at the head of the breaker during said month, and to be paid for under this agreement,\u201d This is made still more prominent by those parts of the agreement which provide that different prices shall be paid for different sizes of coal and fixing the price for all coal above the size of pea coal at 25 cents a ton, for pea coal a price proportioned to the price it is worth at the works with what the larger size is worth at the same place, and for the smaller sizes, ten per cent of their value when they sell for forty cents a ton or more at the mine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>I fail to find any words or languagein the agreement expressly defining the kind of coal which is to constitute the annual minimum amount agreed upon, and if there were nothing else in the case I think it would be fairly inferred that the parties intended that the minimum number of tons to be paid for were intended to be made up of the different sizes of coal produced in tbe proportion that they are produced by the ordinary, usual and careful mining and preparation of coal in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">Objection is made to such rule that while it would work well in case the lessees produced in each month three thousand three hundred and thirty-three and thirty-three and one third hundredths or more tons, above the size of pea, in case they produced less than that amount of said size, or in case none at all were produced as in the present case for August, September, October and November, 1895, the application of the rule would be impossible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">This objection overlooks entirely the fact that it may be shown by expert testimony what the proportion of the coal would be if produced as required by the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">It is a fact well known, a fact known to the parties when they signed this agreement, as is evidenced by the agreement itself, that in the ordinary, careful mining and preparation of anthracite coal, coal of different sizes is produced. The proportion to each other of the different sizes produced may not always be the same, but when, as in the present case, three sizes are expressly, and it might be said, arbitrarily recognized and established, namely pea coal, coal above the size of pea coal, and coal smaller than pea coal, and pea coal is by express contract defined to be \u201c coal of a size that passes over a mesh in the screen of one half an inch in the clear, and that passes through a mesh in the screen that is three fourths of an inch in the clear,\u201d and the parties agree that for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of coal to be accounted for and paid for, a thousand tons of coal as it comes from the mines shall in each quarter- year, at the request of either party, be run through the breaker and screens at the works in the ordinary manner and at the usual rate of speed, by some competent person, etc., and that \u201c all of the various kinds and sizes of coal resulting therefrom after going through these processes shall be weighed separately and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>an account of eacli and all the kinds and sizes taken, and that the product in weight of the different lands and sizes shall be taken as the product resulting, or to result from each one thousand tons of coal thereafter mined, as it comes from the mines, and is weighed at the head of the breaker, and broken and screened as provided for the three months following,\u201d there is no difficulty in ascertaining what the actual proportion is, or what the proportion to be ascertained in the manner agreed upon would be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-3\">There is no expert testimony on this question before me, and there is no evidence that the test provided for by the agreement has been made, but it is proper to state that as I understand the plaintiffs\u2019 position they make no objection to the correctness of the proportion of the different sizes of coal accounted for by the defendant according to its construction, but that they do object that such proportions cannot be ascertained by expert testimony, or by the test agreed upon in article 4, or by the method adopted by the defendant or by any other means, during months when no coal was mined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">But there are other provisions of the agreement to be considered. Chief among these is article second, which requires the lessees, among other things, to pay $5,000 as an advance payment on the coal to be mined and taken out under the agreement, and which provides that said amount \u201cis to be allowed and accounted for out of the coal mined, taken away and disposed of prior to the 1st day of January, 1884, and article 5 which provides that the lessees shall pay the sum of 25 cents per ton for all coal above the size of pea coal, and article 7 which is as follows : \u201c The said parties of the second part in consideration of the premises, agree to mine anu take away from said land from the two upper veins, or other veins underlying the same, by or before the first day of January, A. D. 1884, twenty thousand tons, the amount paid for in advance ; by the first day of January, A. d. 1885, thirty thousand tons; and in each and every year thereafter forty thousand tons, at the least, as a minimum quantity, and that amount to be paid for whether it be mined and taken away or not, until all the coal in and under said land, and contained in the several veins, which is available by prudent and skillful mining, shall be mined and taken from the same ;\u25a0 and should they fail to mine and take away annually Yol. clxxv \u2014 -18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the amount of coal hereinbefore agreed to be mined and taken away, except for causes in these articles hereinafter named and provided, they shall nevertheless pay for that amount and number of tons, and they may mine and take away an amount equal to the excess paid for by them at any time thereafter, but without interfering with or decreasing the minimum amount to be mined and paid for annually, and without further payment therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">It is contended by the learned counsel for plaintiffs, that inasmuch as the agreement disposes of all the coal on the land at a price to be paid for at some rate or other, the only purpose of fixing a minimum quantity could be to assure the lessors of the payment of the consideration in such a way as to provide them with a certain annual income, and, because the $5,000 paid down are to be allowed and accounted for out of the coal mined and taken away prior to January 1,1884, and the lessees \u201c agree to mine and take away from said land from the two upper veins, or other veins underlying the same, by or before the first day of January, A. D. 1884, twenty thousand tons, the amount paid for in advance,\u201d and the lessees agree to pay 25 cents per ton for all coal above the size of pea coal, that the only way to assure to the lessors a fixed annual income would be to require the lessees to pay for the minimum number of tons at the rate of 25 cents per ton. Of course a fixed minimum number of tons at 25 cents per ton would assure to the lessors a certain minimum annual income. But is that what the parties intended ? It seems to me that the contention for a certain or fixed minimum annual income is only stating the question at issue in another form. That the minimum number of tons to be paid for at some price or other was intended to assure some annual income to the lessors is conceded, but the amount of that income depends entirely upon the character of the coal which is to be paid for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">It is argued, however, that inasmuch as the advance payment of $5,000 paid for twenty thousand tons, this necessarily fixes the rate for each ton at 25 cents, and that the expression \u201c the amount paid for in advance \u201d is equivalent to the expression \u201cat the rate of 25 cents per ton,\u201d and that this equivalent should be carried to each ton of the minimum required to be paid for subsequently. From a mathematical standpoint there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>is no difficulty in saying that if twenty thousand tons cost $5,000, one ton will cost 25 cents, but what is there in the agreement to show that this coal was paid for at that rate per ton and not as whole consideration for the whole or lump amount? The agreement expressly says that the $5,000 is an advance payment on the coal to be mined and taken out, and that the lessees should be allowed until January 1, 1884, to mine and take away said coal, and that the amount should be allowed and accounted for out of coal mined and taken away prior to January 1,1884, and that the lessees agree to take away said twenty thousand tons before January 1, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-3\">It may be true that if the expression \u201c the amount paid for in advance \u201d is equivalent to the expression \u201c at the rate of 25 cents per ton,\u201d and that if this equivalent expression were substituted into article 7, it would make that article read to the effect that the lessees were to pay for the number of tons therein mentioned at the rate of 25 cents per ton, but I do not see my way clear to do this. We cannot read into a written instrument what is not there. There is no evidence before me to show what was the mutual or contemporaneous construction of the agreement that the lessees should mine and take away from the two upper veins or other veins underlying the same twenty thousand tons, \u201c the amount paid for in advance,\u201d but judging from the agreement itself this amount of coal was to be taken from the two upper veins if in the judgment and discretion of the lessees it could be properly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">It does not seem to have been the purpose of the parties, by article 7, to fix the rate per ton of coal already paid for or to be paid for in the future. So far as the twenty thousand tons are concerned, they were paid for by the down payment mentioned in article 2. Article 2 fixes the price to be paid for the twenty thousand tons, while the rate per ton to be paid after these twenty thousand tons had been mined, or after the time within which they were to be mined, had expired, is fixed by article 5, and the time and manner of payment is fixed by article 8. The parties appear to have intended a difference between the amount and manner of payment for the twenty thousand tons, and the manner and amount to be paid for subsequent coal. In the last sentence of article 8 it is provided that \u201c until the 1st day of January, 1884, they (the lessees) are to pay for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>coal mined and taken away by them beyond and in excess of the twenty thousand tons paid for by the $5,000 of down money, or just the amount they shall mine and take away monthly, in monthly payments as above provided, whether it be more or less than any quantity stipulated for herein, for general and subsequent payments.\u201d And the purpose of article 7 was evidently to limit the period within which the twenty thousand tons could be taken away without further payment than had already been made, and to require the lessors to mine and take away each year after that period, a certain number of tons of coal, and to pay for the same, whether mined and taken away or not. None of the provisions of article 7 providing for the payment of coal whether mined or not, and none of the provisions of article 8 relating to the manner in which the payments are to be made, relate to the twenty thousand tons to be mined in satisfaction of the $5,000 down payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\">Returning to the main question, as bearing directly thereon, it is proper to keep in mind that there are two parties to this agreement. The rights of the lessors cannot be larger or greater than the duty or obligation of the lessees. It is too plain for argument that under this agreement the minimum amount of money which the lessors are entitled to receive for royalties, in case less than the specified number of tons of coal are mined, will necessarily be the maximum amount of money which the lessees are obliged to pay. And yet, if the construction contended for by the plaintiffs be correct, the lessees might be obliged to pay for more than the minimum called for by the express language of the agreement. As said before in the ordinary and careful mining and preparation of coal, such as is contemplated by this agreement before me, coal of different sizes is necessarily produced. The agreement expressly provides for different prices for at least three sizes. For the size above pea coal as defined by the parties the price is arbitrarily fixed at <em>25 </em>cents per ton. The price for pea and smaller sizes is put upon a sliding scale, and depends to some extent upon the value of the sizes at the mine when produced. Under the terms of the agreement, as I understand it, the lessees are obliged to pay for the smaller sizes at the rates agreed upon. If plaintiffs\u2019 contention be correct, and the lessees produce less than forty thousand tons of coal larger than pea, they are obliged to pay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>not only for the full amount of forty thousand tons of that size, but also for the full amount of the smaller sizes which they necessarily produce with it. It might easily occur, not only that the whole number of tons produced would exceed forty thousand, but also that the amount which the lessees would be obliged to pay would exceed the amount they are required to pay for forty thousand tons at the rate of 25 cents per ton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-3\">Twice in the 2d article and twice in the 7th article the parties have specified the minimum number of tons to be mined, after the expiration of the time fixed for the mining of the twenty thousand tons paid for by the down payment of $5,000, and in no instance and nowhere have they expressly stated at what rate or in what proportion these tons were to be paid for. The absence of the words \u201cat the rate of 25 cents per ton\u201d is significant, and I cannot resist the conclusion that the parties did not intend that the minimum of forty thousand tons should be paid for at the rate of 25 cents per ton, but that they did intend that the forty thousand tons minimum should be made up of coal of the three sizes already mentioned, in such proportion as it is or can be produced by the ordinary, usual and careful mining and preparation of coal according to the terms of said agreement, and that the different sizes making up the whole number of tons should be paid for at the rate fixed or prescribed by the agreement for each size.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">In conclusion, I find that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the sum of #46.57. And now, March 21, 1896, it is ordered that the prothonotary of said court forthwith give notice hereof to said parties or their attorneys, and that if no exceptions hereto be filed in the office of the prothonotary within thirty days after service of such notice, judgment be entered hereon by said prothonotary in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant for the sum of $46.57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entry of judgment as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-6\"><em>Alexander </em>Earnham, <em>J.

This language must be taken as meaning that the proportionate amount to be paid for each month in any event is three thousand three hundred thirty-three' and one third tons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">The answer of de minimis cannot avail here. A principle should stand whether applied to large or small interests. Nor is the royalty on pea coal and the smaller sizes in this case a matter de minimis. The defendant\u2019s returns show this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">In view of the aspect of the case, as presented by the judge, two questions become pertinent:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">1. Is parol evidence admissible, to show, by what he styles \u201cexpert testimony,\u201d or by reference to other collieries, or to the average production of the region or by proof of any ldnd, what the proportions and prices of minimum deficiencies should be for this colliery, during periods of time when either less than the minimum, or no coal at all, is mined ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">2. If such evidence is admissible, upon whom does the burden of proof lie ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">The first question is of the greatest importance, for if the proper proportions and prices can be thus shown during such periods, the several provisions for the payment on the minimum annual production in monthly proportions might be held as capable of being carried into effect, and the provisions in question as being self sustaining. The contract is made for this property and mine works alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">The second question is: If such evidence is admissible, upon whom should tire burden of proof fall ? The plaintiffs made out their case when they showed, prima facie, that the defendant\u2019s returns were made upon a principle manifestly wrong. The plaintiffs\u2019 contention not having been rebutted by material evidence, the defendant should have been taken as not contesting by any available defense, and the judgment should have been accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">The purpose of' securing a fixed minimum of money is apparent as a necessary logical conclusion from the provision for a fixed minimum of coal to be mined. It is a conclusion to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>we are impelled by the considerations that naturally exist in connection with a requirement as to a minimum quantity.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ah33\">April 27, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-3\"><em>George S. </em>Ferris, of Ferris, <em>Flick Urquhart, </em>for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWI\">cited as to the construction of the lease: Phila.
