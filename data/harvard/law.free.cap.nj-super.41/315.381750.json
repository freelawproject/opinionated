He was arraigned before the Bergen County Special Sessions Court 011 July 8, 1942, and pleaded <em>non wait </em>to the charges alleged against him in five numbered accusations, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">No. 14949 \u2014 \u201cdid wilfully, feloniously and forcibly take from the person of one Frank Perry, certain goods and chattels, to wit: Currency, of the value of Thirty-six Dollars, lawful money of the United States of America, the goods and chattels of the Frank Perry Time Market, by putting him, the said Frank Perry, in fear, in violation of Title 2, Chapter 166, Section 1 of the Revised Statutes of 1937, against the peace of the State, the Government and dignity of the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cThe Prosecutor of the Pleas of said County of Bergen further alleges that the said Thomas Stephenson, alias James Chester, and Prank E.

The sentence is to run consecutively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">The sentence in your case on the carrying concealed weapons allegation will be that you be committed to the State\u2019s Prison, at hard labor, for a period of not less than two years nor more than three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">The sentence in your case upon the larceny of auto and larceny allegations will be that you be committed to the State\u2019s Prison, at hard labor, for a period of not less than two years nor more than three years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">Were there separate allegations for robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">Sir. Breslin: Allegations, yes, sir, all separate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">The Court: There are two robbery and two armed robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">Mr. Breslin: That is right, two counts of robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">The Court: He pleaded guilty to robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">Mr. Breslin: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">The Court: Sentence in the matter of the two allegations charging you with robbery will be that you be committed to State\u2019s Prison, at hard labor, for a period of not less than five years nor more than seven years on the two robbery allegations. All sentences are to run concurrently with the sentences imposed in the two armed robbery allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">Those sentences were entered as follows: (a) armed robbery (No. 14949) \u2014 10 to 15 years, (b) armed robbery (No. 14950) \u2014 10 to 15 years, (c) robbery (No. 14949) \u2014 5 to 7 years, (d) robbery (No. 14950) \u2014 5 to 7 years, (e) larceny (No. 14951) \u2014 2 to 3 years, (f) larceny (No. 14952) \u20142 to 3 years, (g) carrying concealed weapons (No. 14953) \u20142 to 3 years; the two armed robbery sentences (a) and (b) to run consecutively, while sentences (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) to be served concurrently with sentences (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">At the time, two statutes applied to sentencing in cases of robbery while armed. <em>R. S. 2 </em>:166-1 provided punishment \u201cby a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding fifteen years, or both.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5, in pertinent part, provided that \u201cAny person who shall commit or attempt to commit any * * * robbery * * * when armed with * * * any revolver * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>shall, <em>in addition to the punishment provided for the </em>crime, be punished on a first conviction by imprisonment for not more than five years * * *. No such <em>additional </em>punishment shall be imposed unless the indictment shall have averred that the person was armed with or had in his possession any such instrument and conviction was had thereon.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The State concedes that the defendant was not accused, indicted, tried or convicted as a multiple offender and that the defendant at the time of the original sentence came under the provision for punishment on a first conviction under <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">When sentencing a defendant on a count charging a violation of <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 and <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5, the trial court should state the minimum and maximum terms imposed under <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 and also state the minimum and maximum terms imposed in his discretion under <em>R. S. </em>2 .T76-5. It is improper to lump together the sentences on a count alleging a violation of <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 and <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5. <em>State v. </em>Cianci, 18 <em>N. J. </em>191 (1955), <em>certiorari </em>denied 350 <em>U. S. </em>1000, 76 <em>S. Ct. </em>555, 100 <em>L. Ed. </em>- (1956); <em>State v. Tumbiolo, </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>231 <em>{App. Div. </em>1953), certification denied 14 <em>N. J. </em>495 (1954), <em>certiorari </em>denied 347 <em>U. S. </em>948, 74 <em>S. Ct. </em>647, 98 <em>L. Ed. </em>1095 (1954). Therefore, if sentences (a) and (b) for armed robbery are deemed to be sentences which lump the terms imposed under <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 and <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5, they are improper and must be corrected. On the other hand, if these particular sentences are deemed to be terms imposed under <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5 alone, they are improper because each sentence exceeds the five year maximum \u201cin addition to the punishment provided for the\u201d robbery, and they must be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It is agreed that the original sentences were imposed following defendant\u2019s plea of <em>non vult </em>to the charges contained in accusations 14949, 14950, 14951, 14952 and 14953. In accusation 14949 one robbery is charged, with a further averment that the defendant was armed with revolvers at the time; in accusation 14950 one robbery is charged, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>a further averment that the defendant was armed with revolvers at the time; and no robbery was charged in the other accusations, namely, 14951, 14952 and 14953.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The defendant argues that he was sentenced to a term of five to seven years on the robbery charged in accusation 14949 (see sentence (c) above), and to a term of five to seven years on the robbery charged in accusation 14950 (see sentence (d) above), to run concurrently with the two sentences for being armed at the time of each of these robberies (see sentences (a) and (b) above), and that the two sentences for robbery (see (c) and (d) above) under <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 are correct and legal and have already been fully served; thus leaving for correction only sentences (a) and (b) , which were made under <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5 and are illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The crucial question is whether, as argued by the State, the two five to seven-year sentences for robbery (sentences (c) and (d) above) originally imposed, were void because imposed for crimes of robbery which were not charged against this defendant, under the mistaken idea on the part of the sentencing judge that there were four robberies in all charged in accusations 14949 and 14950, namely, two robberies while armed, and two other robberies without any charge that defendant was armed at the time; or whether, as argued by the defendant, the original sentencing court intended the sentences of 10 to 15 years for \u201carmed robbery\u201d (sentences (a) and (b) above) to be sentences under <em>R. S. </em>2:176-5 only, and intended the two five to seven-year sentences, (c) and (d), to be sentences under <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 for each of the two robberies charged in accusations 14949 and 14950.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The language of the sentence should be given its ordinary legal meaning and should be so construed as to give effect, if possible, to the intention of the judge who imposed it. <em>In re Sabongy, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>334, 346 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1952). The county judge hearing the motion determined from the transcript of the proceedings at the time of the original sentencing that the judge, in imposing the sentence of 10 to 15 years for armed robbery on each of the two armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>robbery allegations, assumed he had the power to lump the penalties therefor under <em>R. S. </em>2:166-1 and 2:176-5, as did the sentencing judges in the <em>Gianci </em>and <em>Tumbiolo </em>cases above, and that he did so. Further, that the two sentences of five to seven years imposed for \u201cthe two allegations charging\u201d the defendant \u201cwith robbery,\u201d which were to run concurrently \u201cwith the sentences imposed in the two armed robbery allegations\u201d were imposed for two non-existing charges of robbery under a mistaken idea, arising from the colloquy with the prosecutor, that accusations 14949 and 14950 each contained two charges, each charging a separate and distinct robbery, one of which was accompanied by an averment that the defendant was armed at the time, and the other a simple charge of robbery not accompanied by such an averment. The trial judge concluded that the two sentences of five to seven years for robbery, imposed in the original sentencing, were void because they were imposed for crimes which were never charged, and that the two 10 to 15 year sentences for armed robbery were illegal and must be corrected. Our examination of the record satisfies us that these determinations and the conclusion of the judge who heard the motion are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">It having been determined that the two sentences of 10 to 15 years for \u201carmed robbery\u201d are illegal, the court was then obliged to consider what sentences should have been imposed therefor, and in so doing was called upon to determine not only the term of years for each such sentence, but also whether it should be served consecutively to or concurrently with the other terms which had been validly imposed. <em>State v. </em>Weeks, 6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>395, 399-400 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The corrected sentences now under attack provide \u201ca minimum term of 10 years and a maximum term of 15 years each for robbery alleged in said accusations No. 14949 and No. 14950, to be served in the New Jersey State Prison consecutively, and an additional sentence of a minimum term of five years and a maximum term of five years in the New Jersey State Prison for having been armed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>time of each of said offenses of robbery as alleged in said accusations No. 14949 and No. 14950, said additional sentences to be served concurrently and concurrent with the sentences heretofore imposed for robbery, with full credit to the defendant for time served, work and good behavior time credits earned during the time of said service under the original sentences corrected herein.\u201d And, further, that \u201cthe sentences heretofore imposed under accusations No. 14951 and No. 14952 for larceny, and No. 14953 for carrying concealed weapon, shall not be disturbed except as modified by this Order to the extent that they shall be considered to have been served concurrently with the prior sentences as corrected herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"> While these corrected sentences meet the requirements of <em>State v. Cianci, </em>above, and <em>State v. Weelcs, </em>above, they must be set aside because they were imposed in the absence of the defendant. A sentence passed in the absence of the defendant is void. <em>Manda v. State, </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>259, 265 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); <em>cf. R. R. </em>3:5-4; 15 <em>Am. Jur.} Criminal </em>Law, \u00a7 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The order under appeal is reversed and the cause remanded to the Bergen County Court for the imposition of correct sentences.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
