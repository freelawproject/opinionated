A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">The plaintiff Louis P. Greenberg, an architect, sued the defendant Benjamin Ackerman for damages resulting from alleged defamatory statements charged to have been made \u201cfalsely, maliciously and with intent to and for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff in his good name, fame and credit.\u201d Admittedly, the statements were made on December 1, 1955 by the defendant while a witness in the trial of the case of <em>Pestunowitz v. Hochberg </em>in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, in which case Pestunowitz as general contractor sued the owners for the unpaid balance due on the construction price of a building, for which the plans had been drawn by the plaintiff herein, Louis P. Greenberg. In that case Ackerman, whose company had supplied structural steel, was called as a, witness for the plaintiff Pestunowitz, and in the course of his testimony, in response to the questions of counsel, made three allegedly defamatory statements about the architect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Greenberg, which remarks are the basis o\u00ed the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The defendant Ackerman moved for summary judgment under <em>R. R. </em>4:58 on the ground that there existed no genuine issue as to any material fact. The motion was granted. On appeal the plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s statements were not privileged because they were the product of ill will and malice, and that the question of their relevancy was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">It is settled that the testimony of a witness given in the course of a judicial proceeding, having some relation thereto, is absolutely privileged and thus affords complete protection against defamation actions regardless of ill will or malice. <em>Rainier\u2019s Dairies v. Raritan Valley Farms, Inc., </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>552, 558 (1955); <em>Prosser on Torts (2d ed.), </em>\u00a7 95, <em>p. 606. </em>Here, there is no question that the statements were made during the course of a judicial proceeding. Thus, the only question for determination is whether they had some relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">It is, we think, significant that the statements which are the basis for this proceeding were made by the defendant as answers to questions propounded to him both on cross and on redirect examination. Further, at no time did either counsel object to any part of the answers as not being responsive or as being in any other <em>way </em>objectionable. 33 <em>Am. Jur., Libel &amp; Slander, </em>\u00a7 181, <em>p. </em>174.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The testimony here under review was:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">On cross-examination (by counsel for the defendant) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201cQ. Were you familiar with the provision in the specification which specified that all work shall be executed in the most thorough, substantial, neat and workmanlike manner and to the entire satisfaction on written acceptance of the architect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">* &amp; :!; sis * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">A. I don\u2019t remember because there was no sui&gt;ervision on the job. I never seen the architect on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">Q. The answer is \u2018No.\u2019 A. All my business was done with Mr. Morris Pestunowitz, the contractor, and that was a very loosely drawn plan. In the trade we call that a \u2018lousy\u2019 plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cQ. At that time what did you say to Mr. Pestunowitz and what did he say to you about this deviation from the contract? A. If I recall right I said, \u2018Morris, this is a crummy plan and the deviation about the lintels is not too clear, they wouldn\u2019t suit the job, you have to provide to carry that window sash.\u2019 There was no provision. The two channels the architect called for, you could not hold the window head. I said, \u2018Morris, suppose I straighten them out and give them something of equal strength or strength enough and put an extra angle on. It, will cost me more money but we have to do it to get the job good.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Oil re-direct examination (by counsel for the plaintiff) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cQ. In regard to the discrepancies you observed in the plans that you testified to in respect to the lintels, why didn\u2019t you contact Mr. Greenberg? A. There was no supervision. These architects draw up a standard specification and half the time they don\u2019t know what goes into them. They throw a plan together, the specifications from another job of this type. It\u2019s usually customary for a sloppy architect to do that. He had no supervision; he wasn\u2019t interested in the job. If I brought the details down to him he would throw me out and say, \u2018Why bother me. Work it out with the contractor.\u2019 They don\u2019t get paid enough to bother with these incidentals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The plaintiff argues that the pertinency and relevancy of the defendant\u2019s answers were questions of fact for the jury, relying on <em>Finkelstein v. </em>Geismar, 91 <em>N. J. L. </em>46 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918), affirmed 92 <em>N. J. L. </em>251 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918), and <em>La Porta v. Leonard, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>663 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1916). Neither of these cases supports the plaintiff\u2019s contention, for neither is in point. The <em>Finlcelslein </em>case raised the question of whether or not in a proceeding involving qualified privilege the defamatory remarks were motivated by ill will or malice. There being a factual dispute on this issue it was held that the action of the trial court in sending the case to the jury was proper. In the <em>La Porta </em>ease, the alleged defamatory remarks were made during the course of trial by one counsel about his adversary. The defendant not only denied making the remarks, but contended that he was privileged. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. On appeal the Court of Errors and Appeals reversed, but it expressed its opinion that the alleged defamatory statements made by the defendant had no relevancy to the issues nor to the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>conduct of the case before the trial court. Thus, the ease cannot be interpreted as stating as a general rule that the question of relevancy when raised in conjunction with the defense of privilege in a defamation case must as a matter of law be sent to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In other jurisdictions it has been held that where the facts are undisputed the question of the pertinency or relevancy to the issues of defamatory remarks made during a judicial proceeding is a question of law for the court. <em>Matthis v. Kennedy, </em>243 <em>Minn. </em>219, 67 <em>N. W. 2d </em>413, 418 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1954); <em>Scott v. Statesville Plywood &amp; Veneer Co., </em>240 <em>N. C. </em>73, 81 <em>S. E. 2d </em>146, 149 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1954); <em>Ginsberg v. Black, </em>192 <em>F. 2d </em>823 (7 <em>Cir. </em>1951), <em>certiorari </em>denied 343 <em>U. S. </em>934, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>770, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>1342 (1952); 53 <em>C. J. S., Libel &amp; Slander, </em>\u00a7 228, <em>p. </em>346.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In the posture of the proofs before us, we need not rule on whether or not the question of relevancy is in all circumstances a matter of law for the court. The primary issue in the <em>Pestunowitz </em>case was whether or not the building had been constructed in conformity with the plans and specifications drawn by the architect, the plaintiff herein, Louis P. Greenberg. The defendant\u2019s remarks, while not concise, were in explanation of why certain steel work did not conform to the architect\u2019s plans, and hence were relevant to the main issue. Moreover, they were made in answer to questions propounded by counsel and were not objected to. Accordingly, they were absolutely privileged. <em>Rainier\u2019s Dairies v. Raritan Valley Farms, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">There being no genuine issue as to any material fact, the trial court\u2019s action in entering summary judgment was proper. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>67, 75 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
