Thus, defendant waived his rights under the rule. This waiver extinguishes any error and precludes defendant from raising the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On March 20, 1992, Nidhal Jarbo and her brother-in-law, Hani Naemi, were working at the family store, the Eight Mile Express. Defendant was a regular customer of the store. As Ms. Jarbo left the store to go to the bank, she observed the defendant outside the store with what appeared to be a gym bag. When she returned to the store about fifteen or twenty minutes later, the police were present; Hani Naemi had been shot dead in the cooler.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Police suspected defendant, but released him because there was not sufficient evidence to charge him with the crime. Shortly thereafter, defendant was imprisoned on an unrelated parole violation. While imprisoned in the Muskegon Correctional Facility, defendant shared a cell with Norman Mackin. Mr. Mackin testified that sometime in February 1993, defendant divulged to him his role in an unsolved Detroit murder. The details provided by Mr. Mackin were sufficient to permit the police to tie defendant to the murder of Mr. Naemi.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">At trial, defendant\u2019s theory was that, as defendant\u2019s cellmate, Mr. Mackin had access to the grievance papers that defendant was drafting in an attempt to have the fact that he was a suspect in the Detroit murder removed from his record. Defendant alleged that these papers would have provided Mr. Mackin with enough information to fabricate a story implicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ing defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury rejected this theory and convicted defendant on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Defendant appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals, arguing, among other things, that the trial court had violated MCR 6.414(H) by refusing the jury\u2019s request, received fifteen minutes into deliberations, for the testimony of four witnesses, including that of Mr. Mackin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals agreed, concluding that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request had impermissibly foreclosed the possibility of having the testimony reviewed at a later time. The Court of Appeals then applied a harmless error analysis, finding that it could not conclude that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. Consequently, it reversed defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Both parties appealed to this Court, which granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal and denied defendant\u2019s applications. 461 Mich 880 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The court rule at issue in this case, MCR 6.414(H), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">If, after beginning deliberation, the jury requests a review of certain testimony or evidence, the court must exercise its discretion to ensure fairness and to refuse unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>requests, but it may not refuse a reasonable request. The court may order the jury to deliberate further without the requested review, so long as the possibility of having the testimony or evidence reviewed at a later time is not foreclosed.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In the present case, about fifteen minutes after the jury began to deliberate and shortly before breaking for lunch, the jury sent out a note requesting \u201cDale Collins\u2019 testimony, Mackin\u2019s testimony, pictures and illustrations, Presley\u2019s testimony and Rice\u2019s testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The following colloquy between the trial court and the attorneys ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\"><em>The Court: . . . </em>Now, obviously what I will do when they come back is I will sit them down in the jury box and respond, as to Dale Collins\u2019 testimony, Mackin\u2019s testimony, Presley\u2019s testimony and Rice\u2019s testimony, as I indicated in the beginning, they are to rely on their collective memories, there\u2019s no testimony they can read from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\"><em>The </em>Court: And as to the pictures and illustrations that have been admitted into evidence, are they already in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\"><em>Mr. Cox</em><footnotemark><em>[7]</em></footnotemark><em>: </em>They\u2019re in the folder right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\"><em>The Court: </em>All right.

Dealt with the note pretty much at lunch, prior to breaking for lunch. The court received a note at 12:50, right before it was time for the jurors to go to lunch, and we indicated we would bring them back at 2:00 and address the note. The note reads as follows: Dale Collins\u2019 testimony, Mackin\u2019s testimony, pictures and illustrations, Presley\u2019s testimony and Rice\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">And what we decided prior to lunch, Counselors, all of us together I think, is that we would\u2014all of the admitted exhibits had been placed in a folder which we will submit to the jury after the jury\u2014the court.calls the jurors out and sits them in their seats and indicates to them that as to all of the testimony that they\u2019ve requested, as I indicated in the beginning, there are no\u2014the transcripts are not typed and will not be typed for some weeks and months to come.

Any input, any\u2014anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\"><em>Mr. Larson: </em>Satisfaction with that part of it, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">The second part, may I go into that? They asked for illustrations and things of that nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\"><em>The Court: </em>M\u2019hm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\"><em>Mr. Larson: </em>You\u2019re going to instruct them that other than the evidence that has been admitted\u2014I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re requesting other notes or pictures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, what I will say to them with regard to the request for the pictures and illustrations, all of the exhibits that have been admitted into evidence and have been placed into a folder and we\u2019ll send them with you into the jury room. Is that all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\"><em>Mr. Larson: </em>That\u2019s fine, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">The trial court then had the jury brought into the courtroom and instructed them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The note reads as follows: Dale Collins\u2019 testimony, Mackin\u2019s testimony, pictures and illustrations, Presley\u2019s testimony and Rice\u2019s testimony. Let me indicate to you that, first of all, I\u2019ll deal with the request for the pictures and illustrations. The counselors have placed all of the exhibits that have been admitted into evidence in a folder, and when you return to the jury room, you\u2019ll be able to take all of the exhibits that have been admitted into evidence with you for your review as requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">With regard to the remainder of the note, which again asks for various people\u2019s testimony, again, that being Dale Collins, Mack [sic] and Presley and Rice\u2019s testimony, one of the things the court explained to you in the beginning, that the transcripts will not be typed for some weeks and months way into the future and you must listen very carefully because you must rely on your collective memories to resolve any issues with regard to that!<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">So that is the court\u2019s response to your question. You now may return to the jury room and resume your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The prosecution concedes that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury violated MCR 6.414(H).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Howe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ver, the prosecution argues that defendant waived the issue when defense counsel expressed satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s refusal of the jury\u2019s request and its subsequent instruction to the jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The rule that issues for appeal must be preserved in the record by notation of objection is a sound one. <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 762-765; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). Counsel may not harbor error as an appellate parachute. <em>People v Pollick, </em>448 Mich 376, 387; 531 NW2d 159 (1995), quoting <em>People v Hardin, </em>421 Mich 296, 322-323; 365 NW2d 101 (1984). \u201cDeviation from a legal rule is \u2018error\u2019 unless the rule has been waived.\u201d <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725, 732-733; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In two recent cases with similar facts, the Court of Appeals has agreed with the argument advanced by the prosecution in the present case. In <em>People v Fetterley, </em>229 Mich App 511, 518-519; 583 NW2d 199 (1998), the trial court denied the jury\u2019s request for a transcript of the testimony of one of the witnesses. The court explained that it did not have a transcript and instructed the jury to remember the testimony as best it could. Both attorneys indicated that they had no objection to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id., </em>519. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that this constituted an error requiring reversal pursuant to MCR 6.414(H), the Court of Appeals explained, \u201cdefense counsel expressly acquiesced to the court\u2019s handling of the jury\u2019s request. A defendant may not waive objection to an issue before the trial court and then raise it as an error\u201d on appeal. <em>Id., </em>520. The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Appeals made a similar conclusion in <em>People v Crawford, </em>232 Mich App 608, 620; 591 NW2d 669 (1998), where, again, the matter was discussed between trial counsel and the trial court, and counsel agreed with respect to how the jury would be instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">When asked by the trial court in the present case for a response to its proposed instructions, defense counsel expressed satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s decision to explain that the transcripts were not available and that the jury must rely on its collective memory. Because defense counsel approved the trial court\u2019s response, defendant has waived this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Waiver has been defined as \u201cthe \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carines, supra </em>at 762, n 7, quoting <em>Olano, supra </em>at 733. It differs from forfeiture, which has been explained as \u201cthe failure to make the timely assertion of a right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOne who waives his rights under a rule may not then seek appellate review of a claimed deprivation of those rights, for his waiver has extinguished any error.\u201d <em>United States v Griffin, </em>84 F3d 912, 924 (CA 7, 1996), citing <em>Olano, supra </em>at 733-734. Mere forfeiture, on the other hand, does not extinguish an \u201cerror.\u201d <em>Olano, supra </em>at 733; <em>Griffin, supra </em>at 924-926.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">It is the difference between waiver and forfeiture that makes the present case distinguishable from the cases of <em>People v Howe, </em>392 Mich 670; 221 NW2d 350 (1974), and <em>People v Smith, </em>396 Mich 109; 240 NW2d 202 (1976). While the present case deals with waiver, <em>Howe </em>and <em>Smith </em>addressed situations in which the error was forfeited. <em>Griffin </em>provides a clear example of the effect of this difference. In <em>Griffin, </em>the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>concluded that the defendant waived any objection to a jury instruction because his counsel affirmatively approved the instruction. <em>Griffin, supra </em>at 923-924. This approval extinguished any error. <em>Id. </em>However, counsel's approval of the instruction did not preclude the court from reviewing a codefendant\u2019s challenge to the instruction. Codefendant\u2019s counsel, rather than affirmatively approving the instruction, failed to object to the instruction. The failure to object qualified as a forfeiture, and the court reviewed the instruction for plain error. <em>Id., </em>924-926.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Justice Kelly, in her dissent, ignores this crucial distinction. She characterizes the majority opinion as holding \u201cthat defense counsel\u2019s <em>failure to object </em>when the judge announced her decision foreclosed reversal by this Court,\u201d and she would analyze the issue under the standard for unpreserved, forfeited error. <em>Post </em>at 222, 224 (emphasis added). This is clearly incorrect. Defense counsel in the present case did not <em>fail to object. </em>Rather, counsel <em>expressly approved </em>the trial court\u2019s response and subsequent instruction. This constitutes a waiver that <em>extinguishes </em>any error. Thus, this case does not concern unpreserved error where no timely objection was made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Justice Cavanagh, in his dissent, would conclude that the error could not be waived.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree with this approach. \u201cWhether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant\u2019s choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.\u201d <em>Olano, supra </em>at 733. It is presumed that waiver is available in \u201c \u2018a broad array of</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>constitutional and statutory provisions\u2019 . . . <em>New York v Hill, </em>528 US 110, 114; 120 S Ct 659; 145 L Ed 2d 560 (2000), quoting <em>United States v Mezzanatto, </em>513 US 196, 200; 115 S Ct 797; 120 L Ed 2d 697 (1995). While the defendant must personally make an informed waiver for certain fundamental rights such as the right to counsel or the right to plead not guilty, for other rights, waiver may be effected by action of counsel. <em>Id., </em>528 US 114-115.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">\u201cAlthough there are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client, the lawyer has\u2014and must have\u2014full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.\u201d As to many decisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial, the defendant is \u201cdeemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \u2018notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\u2019 \u201d Thus, decisions by counsel are generally given effect as to what arguments to pursue, . . . what evidentiary objections to raise, . . . and what agreements to conclude regarding the admission of evidence .... Absent a demonstration of ineffectiveness, counsel\u2019s word on such matters is the last. <em>[Id. </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">A defendant does not have a right to have a jury rehear testimony. Rather, the decision whether to allow the jury to rehear testimony is discretionary and rests with the trial court. MCR 6.414(H); <em>Howe, supra </em>at 675.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In our opinion, the decision whether to oppose the trial court\u2019s refusal of the jury\u2019s request for testimony is akin to an evidentiary decision. Because counsel has full authority to manage the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>duct of the trial and to decide matters of trial strategy, we conclude that in this instance, waiver could be effected by the action of defense counsel. <em>Hill, supra, </em>528 US 115; see also 3 LaFave, Israel &amp; King, Criminal Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 11.6, p 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the present case, counsel clearly expressed satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s decision to refuse the jury\u2019s request and its subsequent instruction. This action effected a waiver. Because defendant waived, as opposed to forfeited, his rights under the rule, there is no \u201cerror\u201d to review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">We conclude that, although the trial court violated the court rule by foreclosing to the jury the possibility of later reviewing the requested testimony, this error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>does not warrant reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions because defense counsel specifically approved the trial court\u2019s refusal of the request and its subsequent instruction to the jury. Defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights under the rule has extinguished any error. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-5\">Taylor, Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for natural life without the possibility of parole for the felony-murder conviction. He was also sentenced to the mandatory term of two years\u2019 imprisonment on the felony-firearm conviction. His sentence of 20 to 40 years\u2019 imprisonment on the underlying armed robbery conviction was vacated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> MCR 6.414(H) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">If, after beginning deliberation, the jury requests a review of certain testimony or evidence, the court must exercise its discretion to ensure fairness and to refuse unreasonable requests, but it may not refuse a reasonable request. The court may order the jury to deliberate further without the requested review, so long as the possibility of having the testimony or evidence reviewed at a later time is not foreclosed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\"> At a subsequent <em>Ginther </em>hearing (see footnote 14) defense counsel explained that the grievance papers were not introduced into evidence because Mr. Mackin was able to testify regarding facts about the incident that were not contained in the grievance reports. <em>People v Ginther, </em>390 Mich 436; 212 NW2d 922 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\"> In response to the jury\u2019s request, the trial court explained that the transcripts would not be typed for weeks and instructed the jury to rely on their collective memories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">5 This rule is consistent with case law.

The trial court also gave the following cautionary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">And even though [the court reporter\u2019s] taking down what\u2019s being said, ladies and gentlemen, you\u2019re going to have to listen very carefully because you will not have transcripts to refer to during these proceedings. Those transcripts aren\u2019t typed for some weeks and months into the future. So again, you\u2019re going to have to listen very, very carefully during these proceedings.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> While it is true that trial transcripts often are not prepared until well after trial, we caution against instructing the jury in this manner as such instruction forecloses to the jury the possibility of later reviewing the requested testimony, e.g., by having the court reporter read back the testimony, and consequently, violates the court rule. However, we also note that, given that the jury made the request for the testimony of four witnesses only fifteen minutes into deliberations, the trial court could have properly refused the request and instructed the jury to continue deliberat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ing had it done so in a manner which did not foreclose the possibility of having the testimony reviewed at a later time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> Contrary to Justice Kelly\u2019s assertion, our opinion does not contradict the principles established by the cases she cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">First, the crucial distinction between waiver and forfeiture makes much of the case law on which she relies inapposite. <em>People v Dorrikas, </em>354 Mich 303; 92 NW2d 305 (1958), and <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586; 194 NW2d 314 (1972), both concerned situations where counsel had failed to object, not situations in which counsel had affirmatively approved the trial court\u2019s action. Moreover, both cases note that it is only in unusual circumstances that the Court will consider unpreserved error. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 591; <em>Dorrikas, supra </em>at 316-317. In <em>People v Shirk, </em>383 Mich 180, 189-193; 174 NW2d 772 (1970), counsel actually preserved the error by objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>People v Harrison, </em>386 Mich 269; 191 NW2d 371 (1971), involved the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial. The defendant\u2019s trial was adjourned on six separate occasions, including one occasion in which the trial was adjourned until the expiration of the defendant\u2019s \u201cappeal time\u201d in another case. <em>Id., </em>274 The defendant was advised by his attorney that the remaining charge against him would be dropped if he did not file an appeal from his other conviction. <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant failed to demand trial or move to have the charge against him dismissed, the Court allowed the issue to be considered because the trial court\u2019s action served to chill the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to appeal. <em>Id., </em>275-276. (Defendant had a right to appeal under the Michigan Constitution. See Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20.) The present case does not implicate similar constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Finally, <em>People v Lenkevich, </em>394 Mich 117; 229 NW2d 298 (1975), concerned self-defense instructions. The Court did consider the erroneous instruction, despite the fact that counsel expressed satisfaction with the jury instruction. However, the instruction was relevant to one of the very elements required to be established to sustain the plea of self-defense: that the defendant must have had no way by which she could have retreated to a place of safety. The Court rejected this element and held that when an attack occurs in one\u2019s home by an assailant who has a right to be on the premises, the assailed need not \u201cretreat to the wall\u201d before defending herself. <em>Id., </em>121. The instruction given in the present case does not concern an element of the crime or an affirmative defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> Justice Cavanagh also suggests that the trial court\u2019s error was compounded when the trial court refused to permit the jurors to take notes. We observe that MCR 6.414(C) places the decision regarding note taking with the trial court and states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">The court <em>may </em>permit the jurors to take notes regarding the evidence presented in court. If the court permits note taking, it must instruct the jurors that they need not take notes and that they should not permit note taking to interfere with their attentiveness. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> Many other states also treat this decision as a discretionary one. See generally 75B Am Jur 2d, Trial, \u00a7\u00a7 1685-1688, pp 467-472; anno: <em>Bight to have reporter\u2019s notes read to jury, </em>50 ALR2d 176.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> Defendant argues, and Justice Cavanagh agrees, that defense counsel\u2019s acquiescence denied defendant his right to effective assistance of counsel. However, we point out that at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, both defendant himself and his appellate counsel questioned defendant\u2019s trial counsel about various claimed errors. At no point was there questioning directed to the issues surrounding the jury\u2019s request to review testimony. Defendant, assisted by appellate counsel, had the opportunity at this hearing to raise any and all perceived errors of his trial counsel and chose not to address the issue of his counsel\u2019s actions in response to the jury request to review certain testimony. This choice indicates that defendant and his appellate counsel did not believe that the waiver at trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Defendant\u2019s failure to explore at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing trial counsel\u2019s conduct concerning the trial court\u2019s refusal to reread the requested testimony is strongly suggestive that trial counsel\u2019s conduct was the product of trial strategy. Although defense counsel sought to attack Mackin\u2019s credibility during trial, and the rereading of his testimony might have reinforced that defense strategy, it is also true that having the jury revisit Mackin\u2019s testimony would reexpose the jury to his very damaging testimony. Thus, it is entirely understandable why trial counsel was not questioned about this issue at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing\u2014the very place where one would otherwise have expected the issue of claimed ineffective assistance of counsel to have been thoroughly explored.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b378-6\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9D\">(dissenting).

I join in that.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">However, a truly meaningful admonition, one more likely to alter the course of future trials, would lie in finding that the error requires reversal. A miscarriage of justice is invited when a jury is pressed to arrive at a verdict, after indicating it has serious unanswered questions concerning key evidence presented.

The inherent power of this Court to prevent fundamental injustice is not limited by what appellant is entitled to as a matter of right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Contrary to this principle, the majority asserts that defendant, acting through his attorney, relinquished his right to appellate review of this issue. In doing so, the majority relies on federal precedent relating to appellate procedure. It produces no Michigan law to support its assertion that, if defense counsel waives defendant\u2019s right to trial error, this Court cannot review it, even if a fundamental injustice results. This conclusion improperly limits our power to ensure justice is done; it contradicts several of our earlier opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the plain language of MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">When a judge instructs a jury in a manner that prejudices a defendant, the fact that defense counsel expresses satisfaction with the instruction given does not preclude review by this Court. <em>People v Lenkevich, </em>394 Mich 117, 122-123; 229 NW2d 298 (1975). \u201c \u2018Defendant has a right to have a properly instructed jury pass upon the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">During voir dire, the judge told the jury that she would not allow them to review transcripts of testimony. Despite this instruction, the jury requested testimony. In response, the judge denied the request and reminded them of her earlier instruction. She did not, as the rule allows, send them back to deliberate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the opportunity to review the testimony if they could not resolve the need.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Moreover, she did not refuse an \u201cunreasonable request.\u201d In fact, it appears that she thought any request would be unreasonable because of the time it would take to have transcripts typed. As the majority points out, the court reporter could have read the relevant testimony to the jury. The judge did not inform the jury of this fact. Instead, she told them that it would be impossible for them to review the transcripts as they would not be available for \u201cweeks and months.\u201d The prosecutor argues that there is no duty for the judge to inform the jury sua sponte of this possibility. This is true, but there is a duty to refrain from foreclosing the possibility of having the testimony read. The trial judge clearly breached this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In <em>People v Howe, </em>this Court stated that when a jury requests that testimony be read back, both the reading and extent of the reading is a matter confided to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and that the jury will at times require testimony read back to it to resolve a disagreement or correct a memory failure. This Court explained that the trial court must exercise its discretion to assure fairness and to refuse unreasonable requests, but it cannot simply refuse to grant the jury\u2019s request for fear of placing too much emphasis on the testimony of one or two witnesses. 392 Mich 676. <em>Howe </em>held that it was an abuse of discretion to fail to properly consider a reasonable request by the jury to rehear testimony of the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>two witnesses to the events surrounding the death of the victim. <em>Howe </em>also stated that failure to object was irrelevant when the actions of the judge bypassed the adversary function where, after the judge informed counsel of the jury\u2019s request, he immediately denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In the instant case, the judge abused her discretion, in violation of Howe, by failing to properly consider the jury request to rehear testimony. Before a request was made, the judge told the jury that she would not allow testimony review. She also exercised her discretion not to permit the jury to take notes. MCR 6.414(C). Regardless, the jury requested the testimony of four of the eighteen witnesses. The judge told counsel that she would deny the request, then asked whether there was any input, and proceeded to respond in the manner that she had indicated. This left the jury to rely on its \u201ccollective memories\u201d in order to determine the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It was, however, reasonable for the jury to request a review of Mackin\u2019s testimony. Mackin, the jailhouse informant, was crucial to the prosecution. In fact, his testimony was the only direct evidence against defendant. Mackin\u2019s claim that defendant confessed his crime allowed the prosecution to press charges against defendant after four years of investigation. Because he was the prosecution\u2019s key witness, defendant\u2019s strategy was to impeach his credibility and argue that he had received his information about the crime from sources other than defendant. This testimony, alone, occupied over one hundred pages of trial transcript. Moreover, his credibility was highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>questionable. He offered several motivations for his decision to testify against his former cellmate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">It was similarly reasonable for the jury to request testimony of the officers whose testimony related directly to Mackin\u2019s credibility. Lieutenant William Presley had interviewed Mackin and took his initial statement. Officer Collins also spoke with him on several occasions, and was present when the family was allowed to plead with him to testify. Both Rice and Collins were questioned regarding whether information about the crime was communicated to other agencies. This testimony related to the defense theoiy that Mackin had seen defendant\u2019s parole records and had learned about the crime in that manner rather than through defendant\u2019s alleged confession to Mackin. The jury requested testimony only of the witnesses who provided direct testimony in support or contravention of the respective theories presented by the prosecution and defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>People v Smith, </em>this Court unanimously reaffirmed <em>Howe </em>and held that where the judge completely foreclosed the opportunity of having testimony reread, reversal was necessary. In <em>Smith </em>there was no jury request to have testimony reread. However, before the jury deliberated, the judge told them that he would not reread any testimony and told them not to ask for it. 396 Mich 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In the instant case, the judge similarly foreclosed the jury from reviewing testimony. Even so, the jury\u2019s apparent need to review testimony led it to make the request. This was erroneously denied and, under <em>Smith, </em>reversal is necessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The majority distinguishes our controlling case law by stating that <em>Howe </em>and <em>Smith </em>dealt with \u201cforfeiture\u201d of trial error, whereas the instant defendant \u201cwaived\u201d the error. This \u201cwaiver,\u201d according to the majority, extinguishes any error (citing <em>Olano, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Though defense counsel may have acquiesced to the proposed ruling from the judge regarding the testimony read back, the judge should not have put counsel in the position of having to object to a suggestion that violated the court rule. <em>Olano, </em>507 US 742 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Moreover, defense counsel was placed in a position to object after the judge had twice unilaterally stated that she would not allow the testimony to be read back. Acquiescence under these circumstances is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Even if we were to presume that defense counsel accepted the denial of the jury request, the majority fails to properly analyze the case under the principles stated in <em>Olano; </em>the federal case on which it relies. In <em>Olano, </em>the trial court erroneously allowed two alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>nate jurors to attend, but not participate in, deliberations along with the regular jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 727. This violated the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c) as quoted in <em>Olano, supra </em>at 730.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court described the case as involving a deviation from, and violation of, a \u201crule\u201d rather than a violation of a \u201cright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 739. The case was then analyzed under waiver principles. \u201cWaiver\u201d was defined as the \u201cintentional relinquishment ... of a known <em>right.\u201d Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The instant majority provides that defendant did not have \u201ca right to have a jury rehear testimony.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 218. Such phrasing of the right at issue necessarily leads the majority to its conclusion. However, the <em>Olano </em>Court did not analyze whether the defendants had a \u201cright to have only twelve jurors in the room during deliberations.\u201d Instead, the Court seemed to imply that a violation of the court rules is a violation of general due process rights protected by the rules. While I agree that there are varying rights and different waiver requirements, I cannot join in the view that defendant did not have a right to have the trial court follow the court rules enacted by this Court. Under our case law in this area, and under these facts, this right was not waivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Consistent with <em>Olano, </em>I would approach this as a violation of MCR 6.414, which directs that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>court may \u201cnot refuse a reasonable request\u201d and may not foreclose later review of the testimony. The Court explained that a court must first determine whether the right waived is waivable. <em>Id. </em>at 733. Waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment ... of a known right.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cWhether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant\u2019s choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.\u201d [Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">MCR 6.414(H) is the result of a judgment by this Court that the \u201ctrue administration of justice\u201d calls for the court to allow the jury to have testimony read back to resolve disagreement or correct a memory failure. <em>Howe, </em>392 Mich 676, quoting <em>State v Wolf, </em>44 NJ 176, 185; 207 A2d 670 (1965). The staff comment provides that subrule (H) was adopted to incorporate the procedure governing jury requests for review adopted in <em>People v Howe. </em>An informed and accurate debate in the juiy room is fundamental to our system of justice. A jury should not be denied a reasonable opportunity to review critical testimony. It is of major concern that we have no knowledge of the extent of the jury\u2019s confusion. It is possible that jurors who did not remember testimony of key witnesses may have allowed themselves to be persuaded by those who claimed to remember. This is even more probable when they have been advised by the judge that they cannot review the desired testimony. <em>Smith, </em>396 Mich 111. Moreover, the problem was compounded by the judge\u2019s refusal to allow the jurors to take notes. Because the truth-seeking function of the jury was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tainted by the violation of the court rule in this case, I would hold that the error was nonwaivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Next, under <em>Olano, </em>the defendant must show \u201cplain\u201d error. In defining plain error, the Court explained that the error must be clear under current law. 507 US 734. As explained, the judge\u2019s instruction violated the clear current law as stated in MCR 6.414(H), <em>Howe, </em>and <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Olano </em>then provides that the defendant must show that the plain error affected substantial rights. 507 US 734; <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 774; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). The majority in <em>Carines </em>explained this rule by stating that a reviewing court should reverse only when the defendant is actually innocent or the error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>As explained, the refusal to allow the jury to review the testimony of key witnesses was a violation of defendant\u2019s right to have the jury base its verdict on a clear understanding of the facts. Defendant was convicted on the basis of Mackin\u2019s testimony. Otherwise, there was only evidence that he was in the vicinity of the store. In this close case, the jury had a legitimate interest in hearing again the testimony of the key witnesses. This is the sort of error that compromises the fairness, integrity, and truth-seeking function of a jury trial. Therefore, reversal is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">At this Court, defendant argues that the \u201cfailure to quarrel with the trial judge\u2019s determination not to allow the rehearing of testimony\u201d should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>raised at defendant\u2019s initial <em>Ginther </em>hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, defendant asserts, he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Defendant also implies that his appellate attorney was ineffective in failing to raise this issue and in failing to effectively cross-examine trial counsel at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The majority provides that the crucial factor distinguishing this case from <em>Howe </em>and <em>Smith </em>is defense counsel's acquiescence to the court rule violation. <em>Ante </em>at 215. Therefore, had defense counsel remained silent, thus forfeiting the error, or had he objected, thus preserving the error, then under controlling case law he would be granted a new trial. Given the devastating result of defense counsel\u2019s acquiescence under the majority analysis, defendant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298; 521 NW2d 797 (1994). Therefore, at the very least, defendant is entitled to a <em>Ginther </em>hearing on this issue. The majority, however, is convinced that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue, along with defendant himself failing to raise the issue at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, is determinative in deciding that trial counsel was not ineffective. The majority also provides that defendant\u2019s and appellate counsel\u2019s \u201cbelief\u201d that the waiver did not constitute ineffective assistance is sufficiently persuasive to prove that trial counsel was not ineffective. <em>Ante </em>at 219, n 14. I cannot join in such deference to these inferred beliefs. Defendant is not trained in law, and appellate counsel\u2019s negligence does not prove effective assistance of another attorney. The majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>lack of desire to address this issue is similarly persuasive. Therefore, I would grant defendant relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In this case, as in <em>Howe, </em>the jury requested testimony of only the key witnesses. The prosecutor\u2019s case relied heavily on Mackin\u2019s testimony. Had it not been for that testimony, defendant would never have been arrested and charged. We know that defendant was questioned on the basis of the circumstantial evidence, but that the police did not have enough evidence to hold him until Mackin came forward. The jury requested only the testimony of those who could support defendant\u2019s theory that Mackin lied. Denial of a reasonable request to review this key testimony violates both our court rule and case law. This violation severely undermined the truth-seeking function of the jury. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s violation of MCR 6.414(H), <em>Howe, </em>and <em>Smith, supra, </em>requires reversal. <em>Olano, supra. </em>Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\"> At one point, Mackin indicated that he was testifying because the victim\u2019s family deserved justice. He also explained that he wanted a retrial of the charges against him, pictures of the scene of the crime for which he was convicted and protection in the federal prisoner system.
