We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that the trial court applied an erroneous legal standard in assessing the validity of defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Moreover, we conclude that the waiver was valid. Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision suppressing defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On May 21, 1994, defendant flagged down Detroit Police Officers Nevin Hughes and Linda Dickinson, who were on routine patrol in a marked vehicle, and blurted out that he had just confessed to a 911 operator that he had killed his mother, Teriza Daoud. As it turns out, in 1985, the victim\u2019s body had been discovered in a Dumpster in Toledo, Ohio. The victim\u2019s body was \u201chog-tied\u201d with electrical cord and burned. An autopsy report indicated that the victim died as a result of multiple blunt-force injuries to her head. The victim had also been exposed to some source of carbon monoxide before her death. Ironically, the case had remained unresolved until defendant\u2019s decision to approach the police nine years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In response to defendant\u2019s roadside outburst, Officers Hughes and Dickinson pulled their patrol car to the curb, approached defendant and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Officer Dickinson testified at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination that defendant proceeded to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and tell the officers that he \u201ctook a lug wrench and he cut it in half and he hit his mother several times in the head and then he choked her and then he wrapped her up in a blanket, tied her up with some wire and he took her out to a[n] area near a school in Troy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The officers drove defendant to the Detroit Police Department\u2019s 9th Precinct station where defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights a second time. Defendant again waived those rights and repeated what he had previously told the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In response to defendant\u2019s statement that the murder took place in Troy, Officer Dickinson immediately notified the Troy Police Department. Troy Police Detective Mitch Lenczewski testified at the preliminary examination that he and Sergeant Mark Tuck<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> went down to the Detroit Police Department on May 21 and interviewed defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant was advised of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights a third time. Defendant then gave a taped confession in which he explained that he repeatedly struck his mother in the head and choked her to get her to stop screaming. After killing her, defendant wrapped his mother\u2019s body in blankets and placed it in the trunk of his uncle\u2019s car. He then drove the car to a nearby school, and parked it there. Defendant returned to his mother\u2019s house, took her car, and drove it to the Oakland Mall in Troy to make it look like she had been shopping there.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">After getting a ride from some \u201cguys\u201d at the mall, defendant returned to the school where he had left his uncle\u2019s car. Defendant bought a gasoline container, filled it, and drove to Toledo with the victim\u2019s body in the trunk. There, defendant threw his mother\u2019s body into a Dumpster and set it afire. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Defendant then returned to Michigan and, with apparent success, went about concealing his crime. Following the interview with Detective Lenczewski, defendant signed a waiver form and provided a written statement in which he again confessed to his mother\u2019s murder. All defendant\u2019s statements were admitted at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">After defendant was bound over for trial on June 10, 1994, he filed a notice of intent to raise an insanity defense. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that defendant be examined by the Center for Forensic Psychiatry. Following a September 1994 competency hearing, the trial court determined that defendant was incompetent to stand trial and committed him to the Michigan Department of Mental Health for treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon defendant\u2019s request, the trial court further ordered that defendant be examined \u201crelating to the issue of competency to understand his constitutional and <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to making a statement to the police . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Defendant was eventually examined by three experts, Drs. Robert Mogy, Charles Clark, and Thomas Grisso, all of whom submitted reports. <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearings were held on September 25, 1996, and February 7, 1997, during which the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>heard testimony from all three doctors pertaining to the validity of defendant\u2019s confession. The doctors disagreed with respect to defendant\u2019s ability to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Dr. Mogy believed that defendant was delusional in that he believed that God controlled the police and would set him free if he confessed and that this delusion made him unable to appreciate the fact that the police would use his statements against him. In contrast, Dr. Clark testified that there were no clear indications that defendant\u2019s confession was the product of any delusion or that defendant did not understand that the police would use his statement against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In light of the contradictory opinions rendered by Drs. Mogy and Clark, Dr. Grisso was hired to perform yet another examination. Dr. Grisso testified that defendant literally understood that the police intended to put him in jail; however, due to his religious \u201cdelusions and preoccupations,\u201d defendant was unable to use that information and \u201crelate it to his own situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Relying on the testimony given by Drs. Mogy and Grisso, the trial court suppressed defendant\u2019s statements on the ground that defendant did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The trial court found that defendant was delusional at the time of his contact with police, in that he \u201cbelieved that he had no need of any protective rights as God would be releasing him from jail as a reward for confessing to his mother\u2019s murder.\u201d The court reasoned that this delusion \u201cprevented rational comprehension of the specific topic at issue\u2014his right to counsel and his right against self-incrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The prosecution sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeals. That Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to the extent that it purported to suppress all defendant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court explained that defendant\u2019s initial statements made <em>before </em>he was transported to the police station were not the product of custodial interrogation and thus were outside the scope of <em>Miranda. </em>However, the Court left standing the trial court\u2019s decision suppressing defendant\u2019s later recorded confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">This Court granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 461 Mich 873 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In <em>People v Cheatham, </em>453 Mich 1, 30; 551 NW2d 355 (1996), this Court set forth the standards for our review of the trial court\u2019s decision in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">Although engaging in de novo review of the entire record, see <em>People v Walker (On Rehearing), </em>374 Mich 331, 338; 132 NW2d 87 (1965), this Court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cunless that ruling is found to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>[People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448; 339 NW2d 403 (1983).] Credibility is crucial in determining a defendant\u2019s level of comprehension, and the trial judge is in the best position to make this assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Although we review for clear error the trial court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, we agree with the prosecution that the meaning of \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d is a question of law. We review questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of law de novo. <em>McDougall v Schanz, </em>461 Mich 15, 24; 597 NW2d 148 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">HI. ADMISSIBILITY OF CONFESSIONS: AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The United States Supreme Court originally followed the common-law rule pertaining to the admission of confessions: that a confession was admissible as long as it was freely and voluntarily made. See <em>Hopt v Utah, </em>110 US 574, 584-585; 4 S Ct 202; 28 L Ed 262 (1884).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Then, in <em>Bram v United States, </em>168 US 532, 542; 18 S Ct 183; 42 L Ed 568 (1897), the Court for the first time found the voluntariness requirement to be grounded in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s command that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d However, the voluntariness requirement was limited to cases <em>in federal </em>court. In <em>Twining v New Jersey, </em>211 US 78, 114; 29 S Ct 14; 53 L Ed 97 (1908), the Court held that \u201cexemption from compulsory self-incrimination <em>in the courts of the states </em>is not secured by any part of the Federal Constitution\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Beginning with <em>Brown v Mississippi, </em>297 US 278; 56 S Ct 461; 80 L Ed 682 (1936), the Court introduced due process as a basis for excluding involuntary confessions in criminal proceedings occurring in state courts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was held that fundamental unfairness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>violation of due process exists \u201cwhen a coerced confession is used as a means of obtaining a verdict of guilt.\u201d <em>Lisenba v California, </em>314 US 219, 236-237; 62 S Ct 280; 86 L Ed 166 (1941). Under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the test for admissibility was the same as that under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s compelled self-incrimination provision, requiring \u201c \u2018that the confession is made freely, voluntarily, and without compulsion or inducement of any sort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haynes v Washington, </em>373 US 503, 513; 83 S Ct 1336; 10 L Ed 2d 513 (1963), quoting <em>Wilson v United States, </em>162 US 613, 623; 16 S Ct 895; 40 L Ed 1090 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The Court eventually returned its focus to the privilege against self-incrimination. In <em>Malloy v Hogan, </em>378 US 1, 6; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964), the Court overruled <em>Twining </em>and held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s exception from compulsory self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court acknowledged that the <em>Brown </em>Court \u201cfelt impelled, in light of <em>Twining, </em>to say that its conclusion did not involve the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Court reasoned that any distinction \u201cwas soon abandoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Thus, the <em>Malloy </em>Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>today the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal prosecution is tested by the same standard applied in federal prosecutions since 1897, when, in <em>Bram v United States, </em>168 US 532; 18 S Ct 183; 42 L Ed 568 [(1897)] the Court held that \u201c[i]n criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the constitution of the United States commanding that no person \u2018shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>168 US at 542; 18 S Ct at 187. Under this test, the constitutional inquiry is not whether the conduct of state officers in obtaining the confession was shocking, but whether the confession was \u201cfree and voluntary; that is, [it] must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence. . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>168 US at 542-543; 18 S Ct at 186-187; see also <em>Hardy v United States, </em>186 US 224, 229; 22 S Ct 889, 891; 46 L Ed 1137 [(1902)]; <em>Ziang Sung Wan v United States, </em>266 US 1, 14; 45 S Ct 1, 3; 69 L Ed 131 [(1924)]; <em>Smith v United States, </em>348 US 147, 150; 75 S Ct 194, 196; 99 L Ed 192 [(1954)]. In other words the person must not have been compelled to incriminate himself. <em>[Id. </em>at 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">IV. <em>MIRANDA v ARIZONA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Against this backdrop, the Court in <em>Miranda </em>addressed what it believed to be the inherent coercion present in all custodial interrogations. Beginning with the premise that, because of the \u201ccompulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from [a] defendant can truly be the product of his free choice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 458, the Court fashioned a set of \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d in order to \u201cpermit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized. Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the privilege and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the following measures are required. He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. <em>[Id. </em>at 467, 478-479.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The Court further explained that \u201c[t]he defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court elaborated on what is required for an effective waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. In <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), the Court explained that \u201c[t]he inquiry has two distinct dimensions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach referred to in <em>Moran </em>requires an inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. This includes evaluation of the suspect\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his <em>[Miranda] </em>rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights. <em>[Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707, 725; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979); see also <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We read <em>Fare </em>as setting forth an objective standard for determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are validly waived. See <em>United States v Yunis, </em>273 US App DC 290, 302; 859 F2d 853 (1988). While, as explained below, determining whether a defendant provided a knowing and intelligent waiver necessarily involves an inquiry into the suspect\u2019s level of understanding, this can only be done by examining the objective circumstances surrounding the waiver.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the prosecution has the burden of establishing a valid waiver by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157, 168; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>A. VOLUNTARY PRONG OF THE <em>MIRANDA </em>WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Determining whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was voluntary involves the same inquiry as in the due process context. In <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 169-170, the Supreme Court explained that there is \u201cno reason to require more in the way of a \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the Fourteenth Amendment confession context.\u201d Thus, whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is voluntary depends on the absence of police coercion. <em>Id. </em>at 170. The <em>Connelly </em>Court explained that \u201c \u2018the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception . . . <em>I\u201d Id., </em>quoting <em>Moran, supra </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In the instant case, there is no question that defendant\u2019s decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and, concomitantly, his decision to confess, was completely voluntary. Consequently, as in <em>Cheatham, </em>our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>task here is to determine whether defendant\u2019s waiver was also \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">B. KNOWING AND INTELLIGENT PRONG OF THE <em>MIRANDA </em>WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In contrast to the voluntary prong, determining whether a suspect\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent requires an inquiry into the suspect\u2019s level of understanding, irrespective of police behavior. See <em>United States v Bradshaw, </em>290 US App DC 129, 132-134; 935 F2d 295 (1991); <em>Derrick v Peterson, </em>924 F2d 813, 820-821 (CA 9, 1990). However, as we explained in <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 28, \u201c[t]o knowingly waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, a suspect need not understand the ramifications and consequences of choosing to waive or exercise the rights that the police have properly explained to him.\u201d See also <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 574; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987) (\u201cThe Constitution does not require that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of <em>[Miranda </em>rights]\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[l]ack of foresight is insufficient to render an otherwise proper waiver invalid.\u201d <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 29. Rather,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>[t]o establish a valid waiver, the state must present evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the accused understood that he did not have to speak, that he had the right to the presence of counsel, and that the state could use what he said in a later trial against him. <em>[Id.; </em>see also <em>People v Garwood, </em>205 Mich App 553, 558; 517 NW2d 843 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We agree with the plurality in <em>Cheatham </em>that the requirement of a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights essentially forces courts to make \u201c \u2018sweeping inquiries into the state of mind of a criminal defendant who has confessed, inquiries quite divorced from any coercion brought to bear on the defendant by the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22 (Boyle, J.), quoting <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 167.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In light of the fact that the Fifth Amendment itself protects only against <em>compelled </em>self-incrimination, the requirement of a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is puzzling.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the Ninth Circuit observed in <em>Derrick, supra </em>at 821;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">[T]he Court requires that there be improper state action under the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment before a confession can be suppressed, but requires no such state action in the <em>Miranda </em>context, even though the constitutional provision underlying the <em>Miranda </em>warning\u2014the [F]ifth [A]mendment\u2014is applied to the states through that same [Fourteenth [A]mendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Before the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dickerson v United States, </em>530 US 428; 120 S Ct 2326; 147 L Ed 2d 405 (2000), this apparent incongruity was easily reconcilable, given that the Supreme Court itself had acknowledged in <em>at least fifteen </em>post-<em>Miranda </em>decisions that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not themselves rights protected by the Fifth Amendment, but instead are prophylactic rules designed to protect the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Dickerson, </em>however, the Court abruptly changed course, holding that <em>Miranda </em>is a \u201cconstitutional decision\u201d announcing a \u201cconstitutional rule.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Although the Supreme Court has now decided that the <em>Miranda </em>rights are constitutionally mandated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Court has yet to address the apparent inconsistency between the voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis. Until it does so, our duty is to accept and attempt to apply <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, including the requirement of a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. Like the <em>Derrick </em>court, \u201cwe . . . are obligated to bifurcate the <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis into an inspection of (1) whether the waiver was \u2018voluntary\u2019 and (2) whether the waiver was \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018intelligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Derrick, supra </em>at 821; see also <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 26 (Boyle, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">V. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><em>Cheatham </em>represents our most recent attempt to apply the knowing and intelligent prong of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver. The trial court, in its opinion suppressing defendant\u2019s confession, interpreted our decision in <em>Cheatham </em>as requiring that a suspect be able to \u201capply [his <em>Miranda </em>rights] to himself and understand his relationship with the police.\u201d As a result, the trial court reasoned that defendant\u2019s delusional belief that \u201cGod would be releasing him from jail as a reward for confessing to his mother\u2019s murder\u201d prevented him from making a knowing and intelligent decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law because it misread <em>Cheatham </em>and, consequently, focused on <em>why </em>defendant was confessing rather than considering whether defendant could in fact understand and waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Our conclusion in this regard is supported not only by the trial court\u2019s written opinion focusing on defendant\u2019s purported delusions, but by the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>comments during defendant\u2019s <em>Walker </em>hearings. At one point during Dr. Mogy\u2019s testimony, the trial court commented that \u201c[t]he only issue is [defendant\u2019s] <em>motivation </em>to make the statement.\u201d The court even suggested that only someone who was delusional would come forward and admit to a murder after nine years.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although defendant may have believed that he would not go to jail, such a belief has nothing to do with whether defendant was able to understand \u201c \u2018that he need say nothing at all and that he might then consult with a lawyer if he so desired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 29, quoting <em>United States v Hall, </em>396 F2d 841, 846 (CA 4, 1968). In this regard, we agree with the following statement by the Supreme Court of Illinois:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">To waive rights intelligently and knowingly, one must at least understand basically what those rights encompass and minimally what their waiver will entail. The mental state that is necessary to validly waive <em>Miranda </em>rights involves being cognizant at all times of the State\u2019s intention to use one\u2019s statements to secure a conviction and of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>one can stand mute and request a lawyer. <em>[In re WC, </em>167 Ill 2d 307, 328; 212 Ill Dec 563; 657 NE2d 908 (1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Because the trial court applied the wrong legal standard in determining defendant\u2019s ability to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision suppressing defendant\u2019s confession. Viewing the objective circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s waiver, the waiver was clearly knowing and intelligent. Detective Lenczewski gave undisputed testimony that, while advising defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he had defendant read along from a department-issued card. Detective Lenczewski further testified that he stopped after each warning, asked defendant if he understood, and continued after defendant stated that he in fact understood. The exchange ended with defendant\u2019s direction to \u201cget on with it.\u201d Such a remark clearly evidences defendant\u2019s awareness of the events that were transpiring. Defendant eventually waived his rights and proceeded to give a detailed confession.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Turning to the opinions proffered by the various expert witnesses, although Dr. Clark admitted that it was possible that defendant was suffering from a delusion that affected his ability to understand his actions, he believed such a notion to be \u201cquite speculative.\u201d Dr. Clark found no objective evidence that defendant was not capable of understanding his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Indeed, Dr. Clark believed that it would be a \u201cmystery\u201d why defendant would tell the police what he did if defendant did not understand to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>what use the police would put his statements. Dr. Clark placed particular emphasis on a remark defendant made at his arraignment\u2014that the court should \u201cgo ahead and send me to jail\u201d\u2014because that statement was made relatively close in time to his confession.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Dr. Grisso testified that, while defendant\u2019s delusion prevented him from appreciating the consequences of his actions, he clearly had a \u201cstraight forward understanding ... of what the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are saying.\u201d With regard to defendant\u2019s understanding of the role of the police, Dr. Grisso testified that defendant would \u201cunderstand that the police intend[ed] to jail him.\u201d In his report submitted to the court, Dr. Grisso explained that defendant knew what the police were supposed to do but, because of his mental illness, \u201cdid not believe that [] it would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">As stated, a knowing and intelligent waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights does not require that a suspect \u201cunderstand the ramifications and consequences of choosing to waive or exercise the rights that the police have properly explained to him.\u201d <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 28. Rather, a very basic understanding is all that is necessary for a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The Supreme Court has made clear that a defendant need not have a wise or shrewd basis for waiving <em>Miranda </em>rights for the waiver to be valid. In <em>Connecticut v Barrett, </em>479 US 523, 525-526; 107 S Ct 828; 93 L Ed 2d 920 (1987), the Court considered a case in which a defendant orally confessed to a crime, but refused to make a written statement without the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ence of counsel. In the course of concluding that <em>Miranda </em>did not require suppression of the defendant\u2019s oral statements, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he fact that some might find [the defendant\u2019s] decision [to confess] illogical is irrelevant, for we have never \u2018embraced the theory that a defendant\u2019s ignorance of the full consequences of his decisions vitiates their voluntariness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530 (citation omitted). Similarly, in <em>Spring, supra, </em>the Court considered a case in which the police interrogated the defendant without telling him all the crimes at which the interrogation was aimed. In concluding that this lack of information did not affect the validity of the defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the Court held that \u201cthe additional information could affect only the wisdom of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, not its essentially voluntary and knowing nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Thus, it is clear that the United States Supreme Court does not equate a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights with a wise or lawyer-inspired decision to waive those rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s determination of whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d should <em>not </em>involve any determination whether the decision to waive those rights is actually a wise decision in terms of the defendant\u2019s self-interest. Rather, the <em>only </em>inquiry with regard to a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is, as stated, whether the defendant understood \u201cthat he did not have to speak, that he had the right to the presence of counsel, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>state could use what he said in a later trial against him.\u201d <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Here, even Dr. Mogy, who testified at length about defendant\u2019s supposed belief that \u201cGod was going to free him,\u201d acknowledged that defendant \u201cdid, at some point, seem to be aware that he could go to jail for making these statements.\u201d Dr. Mogy\u2019s basic position was that defendant simply ignored the consequences of confessing because of his delusions, not that defendant could not understand those consequences. Indeed, Dr. Mogy acknowledged that defendant could understand the literal aspects of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In its opinion, the trial court expressly found \u201cthe testimony and reports of Dr. Mogy and Dr. Grisso to accurately reflect the nature of [defendant's mental state\u201d at the time that defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The trial court also noted that \u201cDr. Grisso testified that while <em>[defendant did have an intellectual understanding of the rights </em>he was read, his delusions prevented him from appreciating those rights as they applied to his own situation\u201d (emphasis added). Finally, the trial court stated that \u201cthis case presents a defendant with the intellectual capability of understanding the rights which [were] read to him.\u201d Thus, it is plain that the trial court found that defendant understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights. That should have ended the trial court\u2019s inquiry because a basic understanding is all that is required for a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. The trial court erred in suppressing defendant\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">For the reasons stated, the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that defendant\u2019s claimed delusional belief that God would set him free prevented him from knowingly and intelligently waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Moreover, as in <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 31, there is no evidence that, \u201c \u2018at the time the warnings were given and during the subsequent questioning, Defendant manifested expressly or by implication from [his] words and actions any lack of comprehension of what was said to [him] or of what was occurring\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision suppressing defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<judges id=\"b803-5\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> <em>Miranda v </em>Arizona, 384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).

The dissent suggests that, because <em>Connelly </em>involved only the voluntary prong of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver, its statement of the burden of proof is not applicable in cases involving the question whether a <em>Miranda </em>waiver was knowing and intelligent. However, <em>Connelly </em>expressly stated that \u201c[w]henever the State bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>defendant claims was obtained <em>in violation of our Miranda doctrine, </em>the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 168 (emphasis added). This statement does not strike us as one of limited applicability. The lower federal courts certainly have not hesitated in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard when determining whether a <em>Miranda </em>waiver was knowing and intelligent. See, e.g., <em>United States v Palmer, </em>203 F3d 55, 60 (CA 1, 2000); <em>United States v Doe, </em>60 F3d 544, 546 (CA 9, 1995); <em>Wernert v Arn, </em>819 F2d 613, 616 (CA 6, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The dissent also suggests that a higher standard is mandated by the Supreme Court\u2019s assorted references to the prosecution\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d in proving a waiver. Perhaps the dissent has overlooked the fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Connelly </em>acknowledged its prior decisions referring to the prosecution\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d and still adopted a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Connelly, supra </em>at 167-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">As a final matter, we note that this Court also applied the preponderance of the evidence standard to the <em>Miranda </em>waiver\u2019s knowing and intelligent prong in <em>Cheatham, supra </em>at 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> The Court in <em>Spring </em>actually referred to waiver of \u201cthe Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We assume that the Court misspoke because it is illogical to talk about a waiver of the right against compelled self-incrimination. As Professor Joseph Grano explains, the idea of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege would only make sense if the Fifth Amendment conferred a substantive right of silence. However, the Fifth Amendment confers not a right of silence per se, but a right not to be compelled to answer questions. See Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp 141-142.

PROSECUTORIAL BURDEN</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The majority announces that \u201cthe prosecution has the burden of establishing a valid waiver by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 634. Although I am willing to proceed under the assumption that the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence because the prosecution failed to prove its case even by a preponderance, I do not believe that the applicable burden is as clearly established as the majority implies.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The preponderance test employed by the majority springs from <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157, 168; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986), a United States Supreme Court case discussing the voluntary waiver of constitutional rights protected by <em>Miranda. </em>Traditionally, constitutional waiver cases place a \u201cheavy\u201d burden on the prosecution. <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938); see, also, <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 581; 107 S Ct 851; 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>L Ed 2d 954 (1987) (Marshall, J., dissenting), and <em>Connecticut v Barrett, </em>479 US 523, 531; 107 S Ct 828; 93 L Ed 2d 920 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring). Our Supreme Court has also recognized that, \u201c \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights, and that we \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">To date, the United States Supreme Court has never expressly declared that a preponderance standard should be applied in knowing and intelligent waiver cases. In <em>Connelly </em>itself, Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent reiterated the fact that <em>Connelly </em>was a voluntariness case, <em>Connelly </em>at 187-188, and explained why the imposition of a preponderance standard was undesirable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">In holding that the government need only prove the voluntariness of the waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court ignores the explicit command of <em>Miranda: </em>\u201cIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, and we re-assert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.\u201d ... In recognition of the importance of the Due Process Clause and the Fifth Amendment, we always have characterized the State\u2019s burden of proof on a <em>Miranda </em>waiver as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cheavy.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 184-185.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Although <em>Connelly\u2019s </em>imposition of the preponderance standard arguably extends to knowing and intelligent waiver cases, the proposition is certainly open to debate. In announcing the preponderance standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>in <em>Connelly, </em>the Supreme Court examined cases involving the exclusion of evidence, and built upon other cases examining voluntary waiver. <em>Connelly </em>at 167-169. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent recognition that <em>Miranda </em>was a constitutional decision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lends some support that <em>Connelly's </em>rationale should not be extended to knowing and intelligent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The majority is correct that the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[w]henever the [s]tate bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the defendant claims was obtained in violation of our <em>Miranda </em>doctrine, the [s]tate need prove waiver only by preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Connelly </em>at 168. The entirety of the Supreme Court\u2019s statement was as follows, however, \u201cWe now reaffirm our holding in <em>Lego: </em>Whenever the State bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the defendant claims was obtained in violation of our <em>Miranda </em>doctrine, the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Connelly </em>at 168, referring to <em>Lego v Twomey, </em>404 US 477; 92 S Ct 619; 30 L Ed 2d 618 (1972). In <em>Lego, </em>the inquiry focused solely on voluntariness. There, the Supreme Court held: \u201cthe prosecution must prove at least by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession was voluntary. Of course, the States are free, pursuant to their own law, to adopt a higher standard. They may indeed differ as to the appropriate resolution of the values they find at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>C. FACTUAL ISSUES v LEGAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Although the majority recognizes that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact must be reviewed for clear error, nowhere does the majority apply the standard it announces. Instead, the opinion proceeds with an open-ended analysis after concluding that \u201cthe meaning of \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 is a question of law.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 629. After broadly categorizing the entire discussion as a legal issue, the majority then conducts an independent review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings. See <em>id. </em>at 639-644.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Given the broad range of issues that may be considered factual, I am not prepared to summarily conclude that all questions remotely related to the knowing and intelligent inquiry are legal in nature. Rather, it is incumbent upon us to laboriously separate the factual issues from those issues that are purely legal, and to separate legal conclusions from factual inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">1. FACTUAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In the present case, the trial judge weighed the credibility of the competing witnesses and found \u201cthe testimony and reports of Dr. Mogy and Dr. Grisso to accurately reflect the nature of Defendant\u2019s mental state at the time,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no question that Defendant, at the time of his arrest, was psychotic.\u201d The trial court also expressly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">The nature and subject matter of Defendant\u2019s delusions prevented rational comprehension of the specific topic at issue\u2014his right to counsel and his right against self-incrimination. His delusional process required self-incrimination to effectuate freedom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>As previously noted, in Miranda-waiver cases, findings of fact made by the trial judge are entitled to deference unless clearly erroneous. In order to overturn a trial judge\u2019s findings as clearly erroneous, we must be left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake.\u201d <em>People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 449; 339 NW2d 403 (1983). I am left with no such conviction in this case. Clearly, the trial judge weighed the competing testimony, considered the credibility of the expert witnesses, and made a reasoned interpretation after thorough deliberation. Nothing in the record convinces me that the trial court made a mistake. I would, therefore, hold that the trial judge\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">2. LEGAL ISSUES AND PREMISES</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Because the trial judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, the key legal question in this case is whether the defendant could knowingly and intelligently waive his rights despite the delusion causing him to believe that God would set him free as a reward for confessing. As stated previously, questions of law are reviewed de novo. Yet, the concept of de novo review does not relieve this Court of its duty to operate within the constitutional parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">It is well settled that our examination of <em>Miranda-based </em>knowing and intelligent waiver cases must proceed with a consideration of the totality of the circumstances. See <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986). The United States Supreme Court has expressly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>[T]he determination whether statements obtained during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to forgo his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel. <em>[Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707, 724-725; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In <em>Fare, </em>the Supreme Court examined whether a juvenile defendant waived his Fifth Amendment rights as protected by <em>Miranda </em>even though he asked to see his probation officer. In holding that the waiver determination must be made pursuant to a totality of the circumstances inquiry, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">There is no reason to assume that such courts\u2014especially juvenile courts, with their special expertise in this area\u2014will be unable to apply the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis so as to take into account those special concerns that are present when young persons, often with limited experience and education and with immature judgment, are involved. Where the age and experience of a juvenile indicate that his request for his probation officer or his parents is, in fact, an invocation of his right to remain silent, the totality approach will allow the court the necessary flexibility to take this into account in making a waiver determination. <em>[Id. </em>at 725.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The Supreme Court then went on to apply the totality of the circumstances test, and concluded that \u201cno special factors indicate that respondent was unable to understand the nature of his actions\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no indication that he was of insufficient intelligence to understand the rights he was waiving, or what the consequences of that waiver would be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The majority summarily cites <em>Fare </em>for the proposition that courts should examine <em>Miranda </em>waivers objectively. Although the totality of the circumstances test has an objective component, I believe that <em>Fare </em>clearly explained that courts have the flexibility to consider special factors that may affect waiver. Mental illness fits naturally within the totality of the circumstances test, and it may be a factor tending to indicate that the defendant cannot \u201cunderstand the rights he [is] waiving, or what the consequences of that waiver would be.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">D. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In the present case, the prosecution argues only: (1) that the trial court clearly erred in its factual findings, and (2) that the law does not require that the defendant be able to comprehend how <em>Miranda </em>applies to his own situation. As stated previously, I am unconvinced that the trial judge clearly erred. Similarly, I believe that the prosecutor has proceeded under a flawed legal interpretation of <em>Miranda. </em>The prosecution has offered nothing to persuade me that mental illness should not be factored into the totality of the circumstances equation. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s case must fail, even by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Nothing in the majority opinion persuades me that only a literal understanding of <em>Miranda </em>is required. Not only does the majority build its case upon a shaky foundation, but it supports its substantive legal arguments with premises that are only tangentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>relevant. I see two primary problems with the analysis offered by the majority: (1) it quotes case law only selectively, and (2) it assumes that cases involving mentally ill defendants may be easily analogized to cases involving persons with low intelligence quotas.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">A. WHAT THE CASE LAW SAYS BUT THE MAJORITY DOES NOT</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The majority begins its knowing and intelligent waiver analysis by stating that, though determining whether a suspect\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent requires a degree of subjective inquiry,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> suspects need not understand the consequences of waiver. <em>Ante </em>at 637. Yet the quotations the majority selects are taken from opinions that leave open the possibility that the defendant\u2019s level of comprehension about the consequences of waiver will be relevant. None of the authority cited by the majority holds that a waiver will be valid per se if the defendant is able to literally comprehend <em>Miranda, </em>even though that defendant may be unable to apply the literal meaning of <em>Miranda </em>to his own situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The majority erroneously concludes that the trial court misapplied <em>Cheatham </em>by requiring that the defendant be able to understand how his <em>Miranda </em>rights applied to his situation. The majority quotes <em>Cheatham </em>for the proposition that, \u201c \u2018[t]o knowingly waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, a suspect need not understand the ramifications and consequences of choosing to waive or exercise the rights that the police have prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>erly explained to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 636, quoting <em>Cheatham </em>at 28. However, when the aforementioned quotation is taken in the context of the entire <em>Cheatham </em>opinion, the quotation does not so easily support the majority\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that the <em>Cheatham </em>Court did not hold that courts need not ever determine whether a defendant understood the consequences of his actions. Rather, <em>Cheatham </em>held only that defendant Cheatham sufficiently understood his rights, and that he had the capacity to provide a valid waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Unlike the present case, <em>Cheatham </em>focused on the defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity, and the analysis of that intellectual capacity was implicitly tied to the defendant\u2019s understanding of his own circumstances. The <em>Cheatham </em>excerpt quoted by the majority was taken from the middle of <em>Cheatham\u2019s </em>totality of the circumstances analysis. When read in context, it is apparent that the Court was examining both whether the defendant literally understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as well as whether he understood the meanings of the words as applied to his own situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Similarly, the majority\u2019s citation of <em>Colorado v Spring, supra, </em>provides little support for the proposition that the defendant must only possess a literal understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in order to provide a knowing and intelligent waiver. While the <em>Spring </em>Court explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he Constitution does not require that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 574, it also stated, \u201cIn this case there is no allegation that Spring failed to understand the basic privilege guaranteed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the Fifth Amendment. Nor is there any allegation that he misunderstood the consequences of speaking freely to the law enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. Thus, <em>Spring </em>implicitly recognizes that, if a defendant does misunderstand the consequences of speaking freely to law enforcement officials, then his <em>Miranda </em>waiver could be considered invalid under the knowing and intelligent prong. A conclusion that a defendant need not understand every consequence of confessing is different than a conclusion that the defendant must understand the most basic consequences of confessing. This case presents exactly the type of situation envisioned but not presented in Spring\u2014the defendant misunderstood the consequences of speaking freely to the police. He lacked a basic comprehension of what could actually occur if he waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The trial court\u2019s analysis comports with Supreme Court observations that a defendant must possess at least a basic understanding of his rights under the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Moran </em>at 421. Although the defendant may have been able to understand what it means to be silent, to have a lawyer present, and to have his statements used against him, his decision to confess was directly tied to his delusion that God would control the police and set him free. It is, therefore, questionable whether the defendant ever truly comprehended the actual meaning of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">As I wrote in <em>Cheatham, </em>\u201cthe ultimate focus for purposes of the knowing and intelligent prong remains on the level of the suspect\u2019s comprehension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. I further agree with Justice Mallett\u2019s <em>Cheatham </em>assessment that \u201c[t]he validity of a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>does not depend on a verbatim recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>litany, but rather depends on an actual understanding on the part of the individual of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the consequences of waiving them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. Even the <em>Cheatham </em>lead opinion recognized that the knowing and intelligent prong of <em>Miranda </em>focuses \u201con the knowledge of the accused irrespective of improper police behavior,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 18, and that courts must evaluate whether the defendant has the capacity to understand the warnings given to him under all the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">B. WHAT THE MAJORITY SAYS BUT THE CASE LAW DOES NOT</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The majority secondarily finds support for its holding from the proposition that \u201ca defendant need not have a wise or shrewd basis for waiving <em>Miranda </em>rights for the waiver to be valid.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 642. The majority accurately points to precedent providing that the defendant cannot successfully challenge a waiver as invalid on the basis that he failed to realize that his decision was imprudent. <em>Id. </em>at 642-644.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, I fail to see how wisdom is relevant to this defendant\u2019s confession. This case differs from the cases offered in support of the majority opinion in that the defendant\u2019s waiver defense springs not from a lack of wisdom, but from an inability to fully understand that the dictionary meaning of the <em>Miranda </em>warning would actually apply to his own circumstances. The trial court held that his delusions about the consequences of his actions brought about his confession. No</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>amount of information or wisdom would have altered the delusion compelling the defendant to confess. Even a fully informed person or a person with a genius level intelligence quotient can suffer from a delusional perception of reality. Mental illness and shrewdness are simply not equivalent concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">ni</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The prosecutor has failed to carry its burden that this defendant provided a knowing and intelligent waiver. Similarly, the majority has failed to persuade me that its conclusions are supportable. I am not prepared to sign an opinion that narrows <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>knowing and intelligent prong to the point of near extinction, especially when the opinion only pretends to hide behind well-established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">I would hold that the totality of the circumstances test allows a determination whether an individual defendant\u2019s mental illness precludes him from knowingly and intelligently waiving his rights. Here, the defendant\u2019s delusional episodes vitiated his ability to knowingly and intelligently waive his rights. I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b816-9\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> I expressly disagree with the majority\u2019s editorialism that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">[i]n light of the fact that the Fifth Amendment itself protects only against compelled self-incrimination, the requirement of a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is puzzling. <em>[Ante </em>at 637.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">I further disagree with the dicta following the majority\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 645. As I pointed out in <em>People v Cheatham, </em>453 Mich 1, 30, 57; 551 NW2d 355 (1996), the overarching consideration in <em>Miranda-weiver </em>cases is not deterrence, but rather the protection and vindication of constitutional rights. See also <em>Dickerson v United States, </em>530 US 428; 120 S Ct 2326; 147 L Ed 2d 481 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">I am not puzzled by the Supreme Court\u2019s bifurcation of the <em>Miranda-</em>waiver analysis, because the voluntariness prong protects aspects of the defendant\u2019s rights distinct from the aspects protected by the knowing and intelligent prong. The voluntariness prong of <em>Miranda </em>seeks to protect defendants against the compulsion envisioned by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986). The knowing and intelligent prong ensures that a suspect understands the substantive protections of the Fifth Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, I do not share the majority\u2019s hesitation to follow case law requiring that a defendant be able to understand his rights as a prerequisite to waiving them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\"> See <em>Dickerson, </em>n 1 <em>supra </em>at 120 S Ct 2334, n 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\"> Curiously, the majority levies the charge that I somehow interpret the majority opinion as suggesting \u201cthat a suspect\u2019s subjective mental state plays no role in a determination whether there was a knowing and intelligent <em>Miranda </em>waiver.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 634, n 10.
