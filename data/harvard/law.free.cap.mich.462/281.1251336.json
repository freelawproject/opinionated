The Court of Appeals also found that the admission of testimony regarding statements made by defendant to a forensic psychologist in contemplation of interposing an insanity defense was error requiring reversal. We hold that any error stemming from the introduction of defendant\u2019s statements to the forensic psychologist was harmless and that defendant was not denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>counsel. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arose from events that occurred sometime around 10:30 P.M. on the night of November 29, 1993, when Steve Burge was shot , in the face and doused with gasoline at the front door of a residence he shared with Margo DeVita (now known as Margo McPherson) and her two children. Margo<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that she had temporarily cohabited with defendant on two prior occasions under circumstances that she described as platonic. However, during the second of these periods, which lasted about a month, defendant began making unwelcome sexual overtures, and personal items went missing from Margo\u2019s bedroom. After an incident when defendant tried to imprison Margo in his house, she moved in with her mother until she was able to lease a unit in a duplex house. Steve, Margo\u2019s boyfriend, later moved in with her. In the months before the killing, Margo observed defendant drive past this house on numerous occasions, and, once, defendant stopped in and offered to pay Margo\u2019s rent if Steve would move out.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Margo testified that on the night of November 29, 1993, someone kicked the front door open while she was half-asleep on the couch and Steve was watching football on television. Margo ran to her children in another room, and later came out to find Steve stum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>bling back through the front door, dripping with gasoline and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to the cheek. Through the window, Margo saw a man of defendant\u2019s build, wearing a mask and light colored surgical gloves, struggle with her neighbor, Danny Parenteau, and then run away. After Steve was transported to the hospital, Margo observed an unfamiliar hat with hair attached to it in her living room, a gas can in front of her house, and a mask near the gas can. She reported to the police her suspicions that defendant was the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Danny Parenteau testified that on the night in question, he was watching football on television when he heard a gunshot from the house across the street. Danny ran outside and observed Steve and another man struggling inside the front door of Steve\u2019s house. Steve forced the other man out of the house, and, when Danny approached to assist, he noted that Steve was covered with blood. As Steve collapsed, he shoved the other man away. Danny realized that this other man, who had also fallen to the ground, was armed with a gun, so Danny seized this man\u2019s wrist and called to his brother, Russell, for help. The man smelled of gasoline, was wearing white, see-through gloves, and fired off several shots that Danny was able to direct away from himself. Russell came to help, but took cover behind a tree when the assailant shot toward him. As this was occurring, Danny observed Steve get back up, while holding his throat, and make it through his front door before again collapsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Danny tried to drag or carry the armed man, but when Danny stumbled and lost his grip, he ran for cover for fear of being shot. The man was not wean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ing a mask at this point and he ran to a car, which Danny recognized as one that he had observed cruise past Margo\u2019s house on four or five occasions. Danny was able to identify defendant at a police lineup as the man with whom he had struggled. Russell Parenteau, who lived with Danny, corroborated his brother\u2019s account and added that the assailant ran to a car that was parked next to the home of another neighbor, John Talarico.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">John Talarico testified that he lived next door to Steve and Margo and that, on the night in question, he heard gunshots just after he got out of the shower, so he looked out his window and saw a gunman wrestle with Danny and shoot toward Russell. From a distance of fifty feet, John observed the gunman\u2019s face and identified him as defendant. Defendant departed in a car that John recognized as one that he had observed cruise slowly by on several occasions, once with its lights out.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Donald Lumm, a neighbor who lived around the comer from Margo and Steve, testified that on the night of November 29, 1993, he was in his kitchen when he heard several shots. Donald then heard squealing tires and, through his kitchen window, saw a vehicle \u201ctake off really quick.\u201d Donald identified a photograph of defendant\u2019s car as the one he saw that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Steve died from what was determined to be a single gunshot wound to the right side of his jaw, with the bullet traveling down through his neck. From the scene, the police recovered: a white towel soaked in gasoline, a hat with a wig sewn to it, several .38 caliber bullet casings, a mask found between the sidewalk and curb, and a fingertip from a \u201crubber\u201d glove. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The front screen door was broken outward and covered with blood, but there was no visible damage to the interior door. There was also blood outside the house, around the door area and on the grass. A subsequent search of defendant\u2019s house turned up a large quantity of the type of gloves used by meat packers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hairs were retrieved from the mask and hat, which were later determined to be similar in all respects to a sample of defendant\u2019s hair. Fingerprints recovered from tape attached to the mask were later determined to be those of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The police began staking out defendant\u2019s house on the night of the killing, and defendant was stopped in his automobile and taken into custody at 7:30 A.M. the following morning. The officers detected a strong smell of gasoline from defendant\u2019s vehicle and hat. After an attempted arraignment, where there was some discussion regarding count five in the multiple count warrant, defendant was overheard to make the following unsolicited statement: \u201cThey count five. They say I killed five people. I only kill one. Why do they count five now?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Defendant, whose native language is Arabic, testified at trial through an interpreter, although he frequently answered questions in English. His testimony described his relationship with Margo, during the twelve days she first lived with him as that of a husband and wife, just as it was when she again stayed with him. Margo allegedly began stealing from defendant and only moved out the second time after defendant assured her that he would be her boyfriend and would come to visit her everyday and pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>rent. However, when defendant came over after working late one night, he found Margo in the company of \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cDon.\u201d The three of them were drunk and Margo was wearing only a slip. After that, defendant stopped going to Margo\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">According to defendant, around 3:00 P.M. on the day of the incident, Margo came to defendant\u2019s home and demanded that he sign over his house, and car to her. She also commanded him to give her all the money he had in the bank, and to vacate the house, taking only his clothes, but leaving the furniture. Defendant refused, so Margo took his car. She returned later, along with her children, in a different car, claiming that defendant\u2019s car was broken and that Steve had taken it to get it fixed. Margo drove defendant to her house, and he played with Margo\u2019s children while waiting for Steve to return with defendant\u2019s car. Margo\u2019s daughter brought a mask into the room and defendant and the children played with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The events that defendant next described are somewhat muddled by the circumstances that gave rise to the trial court and the Court of Appeals determinations that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, defense counsel failed to clarify who defendant was identifying as his story unfolded. Defendant mispronounced certain names, and the interpreter made certain incorrect translations of what defendant said. However, as it was told to the jury, somebody named \u201cCherry\u201d arrived, then within ten minutes Steve came home and denied being in possession of defendant\u2019s car. Margo then said that John had defendant\u2019s car. Then John, Jim, and \u201cRose\u201d (and apparently \u201cDon\u201d) entered the residence, with John and \u201cDon\u201d being armed with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the inteipreter described as \u201ca small gunshot, black\u201d and a shotgun. These men ordered defendant to pay a $3000 drug debt owed by Margo, and defendant tried to talk them into postponing payment until the next day. John ordered defendant to sign a piece of paper, but defendant crushed it and threw it back in John\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The juiy heard that John drew his gun while Margo yelled \u201ckill him outside.\u201d Steve tried to grab John\u2019s hand, and defendant began fistfighting with \u201cJimmy.\u201d Defendant\u2019s blows caused Jimmy to bleed and run away, so defendant then engaged \u201cRose\u201d in a fight that began inside and continued outside on the concrete. Defendant heard a shot and then \u201cCherry\u201d came out and said \u201cJohn kill Steve.\u201d Then John emerged from the house holding a black gun that had a nine-shot capacity. John ran \u201cto Don Andrews,\u201d then \u201cDon\u201d came out of the house and tried to hit defendant with his shotgun, so defendant began fighting \u201cDon\u201d and \u201cRose\u201d simultaneously. Defendant disabled \u201cDon\u201d with a kick between the legs, then made his way down the street where he found his car and effected an escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Defendant then recounted that he went home and had a beer. Feeling hungry, he went out for a kabob, and stopped at a store. After returning home, he drank a second beer, then slept until it was time to get up for work. He was stopped and arrested on his way to work the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Although defendant did not raise insanity as a defense at trial, he was cross-examined, over a defense objection to inadequate foundation, regarding whether he gave a version of the relevant events to Dr. Mae Keller, a clinical psychologist who had interviewed him pursuant to a notice that he intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>interpose an insanity defense. Defendant was further questioned regarding a different version that he had supposedly given to Keller. Keller was then permitted to testify, over a defense objection on the basis of privilege, as a rebuttal witness that defendant described routine activities on the day and night in question, and that these activities did not include even being at Margo\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Following defendant\u2019s sentencing, the Court of Appeals granted his motion to remand for a <em>Ginther</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing on defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. At that hearing, defendant testified that: \u201cCherry\u201d was Steve\u2019s girlfriend,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cJimmy\u201d was Cherry\u2019s brother and Margo\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cDon\u201d was prosecution witness Danny Parenteau, \u201cRose\u201d was prosecution witness Russell Parenteau, and \u201cJohn\u201d was prosecution witness John Talarico. Errors by the interpreter at trial were noted. Defendant had not said that John entered holding a \u201cgunshot,\u201d but had stated that John entered, then \u201cDon\u201d entered holding a small black machine gun. Also, defendant had not said that John was running \u201cto Don Andrews,\u201d but had said that John was running \u201cto Don and Rose\u2019s,\u201d meaning that John ran toward the house of Danny and Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not notice that defendant was saying \u201cRose\u201d instead of \u201cRuss\u201d and \u201cDon\u201d instead of \u201cDan,\u201d and that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>possible that he had become accustomed to his client\u2019s accent. Further, defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that from his first contact with defendant until the end, defendant made major adjustments in his story. Originally defendant claimed not to have been present at Margo\u2019s on the night of the killing. The evolving events, as defendant claimed to remember them, formed the basis for the defense theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The trial court found that defense counsel had been ineffective on the basis of a number of factors. The Court of Appeals affirmed a subsequent order granting a new trial on the basis of counsel\u2019s failure to present defendant\u2019s side of the story in clear terms, as well as the admission of the testimony of the forensic psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">We first address the admission of testimony regarding statements made by defendant to a forensic psychologist in contemplation of interposing an insanity defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Legislature has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">Statements made by the defendant to personnel of the center for forensic psychiatry, to other qualified personnel, or to any independent examiner during an examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>shall not be admissible or have probative value in court at the trial of the case on any issue other than his or her mental illness or insanity at the time of the alleged offense. [MCL 768.20a(5); MSA 28.1043(1)(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">This is a clear expression by the Legislature that these statements cannot be admitted at trial except on the issue of insanity, and it is also clear that, under the precedent that the trial court was obligated to follow, no exception to this rule existed for impeachment. See <em>People v Jacobs, </em>138 Mich App 273, 276-278; 360 NW2d 593 (1984). Hence, the admission of testimony regarding these statements was error,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the question remains whether this was error that now requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Defense counsel objected to the testimony of the forensic examiner on the ground that the communication was privileged. The communication was, in fact, privileged from admission for any purpose other than defendant\u2019s mental illness or insanity at the time of the alleged offense. MCL 768.20a(5); MSA 28.1043(1)(5); <em>Jacobs, supra </em>at 276-278. However, had the proper statutory provision and controlling case law been brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, the trial court surely would not have admitted the now challenged statements and testimony. Hence, the trial court\u2019s decision was nothing more than an erroneous evidentiary ruling at trial. Nonetheless, the dissent would bootstrap this mistake into constitutional error by asserting that the statutory scheme requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defendant to cooperate with the examiner on pain of losing the insanity defense placed him in a coercive situation. That is, claims the dissent, defendant was forced to choose between his constitutional right to assert a substantial defense<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or to give up his constitutional privilege to be free from compelled self-incrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With all respect to the dissent, we fail to see when defendant was actually put to such a choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">It is well settled that the right to assert a defense may permissibly be limited by \u201cestablished rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence,\u201d <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 302; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973). This Court has previously recognized that limitations placed on raising the insanity defense, pursuant to the procedures established in MCL 768.20a; MSA 28.1043(1), do \u201cnot unconstitutionally infringe on a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense.\u201d <em>People v Hayes, </em>421 Mich 271, 283; 364 NW2d 635 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">If the established rules of procedure found in MCL 768.20a; MSA 28.1043(1) do not impermissibly limit a defendant\u2019s right to assert the insanity defense, it follows that no aspect of defendant\u2019s decisions regarding: (1) providing notice of intent to raise the defense; (2) cooperating with the examiner; or (3) abandoning the insanity defense, was the product of impermissible coercion. The eventual erroneous ruling by the trial court, which occurred well after both the exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>nation and defendant\u2019s decision to abandon the insanity defense, could not have reasonably been anticipated by assessing the extant rules of procedure. If the mere possibility that a court will apply the law incorrectly gives rise to a justified reluctance to provide full disclosure to the examiner or to avail oneself of an available defense, then defendant\u2019s right to present an insanity defense would have been equally infringed even if the trial court had later correctly refused to admit any testimony regarding his statements to the examiner. This is so because any coercion to defendant\u2019s detriment was complete by the time the court ruled on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Likewise, we cannot accept the dissent\u2019s position regarding the effect on future defendants of affirming defendant\u2019s convictions. The dissent assumes that a failure to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction will have a chilling effect on access to the insanity defense. The dissent reaches this conclusion despite our present conclusion that the admission of testimony regarding the forensic interview constituted error. Hence, its conclusion appears necessarily to be premised upon future disregard by the trial courts of this Court\u2019s present holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The dissent also asserts that this error violated due process because defendant was lured into speaking with the forensic psychologist by a statutory promise that his statements would not be used against him at trial, and the admission of those statements broke that promise. We agree with the proposition that if a criminal defendant relies on a promise from the state and the state breaches that promise, the state must provide a remedy for any resulting due process violation. See, e.g., <em>People v Gallego, </em>430 Mich 443; 424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>NW2d 470 (1988). Fundamental notions of due process dictate that if the resulting breach contributes to a defendant\u2019s conviction, reversal is warranted. See <em>People v Wyngaard, </em>226 Mich App 681, 695; 575 NW2d 48 (1997) (Markman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, if every error in the application of a rule of evidence or criminal procedure was treated as a breach of a governmental promise, just as if it had been specifically made to an individual defendant as part of a plea bargain or to secure testimony, all trial errors would violate due process. While we are not oblivious to the similarity between this statute\u2019s protection and a specific promise that a defendant\u2019s statements will not be used against him, we conclude that the two are sufficiently distinguishable to justify a rejection of the proposition that every trial error effectively presents a constitutional violation. In any event, as we shall explain, our resolution of whether the error here rises to the level of a constitutional violation does not affect the outcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Consequently, this is preserved nonconstitutional error,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and our harmless error analysis entails the application of the rule this Court announced in <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 495; 596 NW2d 607 (1999). \u201cThe object of this inquiry is to determine if it affirmatively appears that the error asserted \u2018undermine [s] the reliability of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d Such error does not require reversal unless, in the context of the untainted evidence, \u201cit is more probable than not that a different outcome would have resulted without the error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The first step in determining whether this error was harmless is to assess its potential prejudice to defendant. The prosecutor, of course, introduced this evidence to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility. To the extent that this was accomplished, it was achieved by the jury\u2019s appreciation of a logical syllogism that goes something like this: (1) defendant lied to the forensic psychologist about the incidents in question; (2) this shows that defendant has a propensity for untruthfulness, particularly with regard to this incident; therefore, (3) the jury should not believe defendant\u2019s trial testimony with regard to this incident. However, the prejudice of the tainted evidence cannot be measured in a vacuum. Rather it must be measured in context. By defendant\u2019s own testimony, after being present at the killing of Steve Burge, he went home and did not call the police. He made no arrangements for his own personal security, but, rather, engaged in a number of routine activities such as going out to eat, stopping for groceries, getting a night\u2019s sleep, and rising and going to work. Putting aside its limited believability, the best interpretation of this testimony that is consistent with defendant\u2019s innocence is that defendant did not want to be drawn into the investigation of this killing and was going to pretend that he was not there. Consequently, there is very little additional prejudice to defendant from the jury learning that, at a subsequent point, he claimed that he was not present when Steve was killed. This is so because most of this prejudice was already present from defendant\u2019s own untainted testimony, and defendant\u2019s false statement to the forensic psychologist was consistent with the interpretation of defendant\u2019s postkilling conduct that was the most favorable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>By contrast, the untainted evidence pointing to defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. In an unsolicited statement, defendant essentially admitted the crime, saying: \u201cThey count five. They say I killed five people. I only kill one. Why do they count five now?\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Two eyewitnesses positively identified defendant as the assailant, and, by his own testimony, he was present when Steve was killed. Defendant claimed that he was the intended robbery or extortion victim of the real killers, but took no precautions for his safety, did not call the police, and engaged in routine behaviors immediately after the killing. Margo testified about a pattern of stalking by defendant that was corroborated by her neighbors. Defendant\u2019s attempt to explain his frequent presence, by claiming that his promise to visit her everyday was the only way he could get Margo to move out of his house, defies common sense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Defendant\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with the physical evidence, while the testimony of Margo and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>her neighbors does not conflict.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The fingertip of a rubber or latex glove found at the scene is consistent with Margo\u2019s testimony that the masked assailant wore light colored surgical gloves, as well as the fact that there was a struggle during which Danny kept defendant from pointing his weapon at him. The possession by, and availability to, defendant of such gloves supports the prosecutor\u2019s case. It is undisputed that Steve was not only shot in the jaw, but doused with gasoline. Defendant was arrested the next morning reeking of gasoline. The recoveiy of a hat with a wig sewn to it, along with a mask that had tape on it bearing defendant\u2019s fingerprints, is consistent with the theory that defendant arrived at Margo\u2019s house dressed in a manner calculated to conceal his identity. Defendant\u2019s claim that Margo\u2019s daughter brought the mask into the room and that defendant played with it, does not explain the wig-hat or why the mask was recovered by the police from the sidewalk in front of the house. Nor does anything in defendant\u2019s account explain why he would calmly accompany Margo to her home, then bide his time in idle play with her children waiting for the return of his car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>after Margo had supposedly demanded he give her his house, his furniture, and his money, and had stolen his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">If someone named Cherry had come out of the house and said \u201cJohn kill Steve,\u201d that statement would have been inaccurate when made. Steve was alive and still conscious when the police arrived, and he remained alive for another twenty hours. It was decidedly convenient for defendant that Cherry would make this inaccurate statement, thus permitting defendant to be removed from the place of the killing, yet still be able to identify John as its perpetrator. Defendant\u2019s story that Steve was shot inside the house while defendant was outside fighting others does not explain the large amount of blood found outside the house and on the broken exterior door. Defendant\u2019s story that John emerged from the house carrying a gun that had a nine-shot capacity imputes knowledge to defendant that is unlikely under the circumstances that he recounted. Defendant\u2019s claim to have prevailed in a fistfight with three men, two of whom were armed, is less than credible. Likewise, it appears to be a significant coincidence that defendant not only had his car keys with him, but was able to immediately locate his car when fleeing from armed assailants. By his account, his car had been taken from him earlier in the day and he was driven to Margo\u2019s house in a different car.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>On one side of the scale, we have the consistent testimony of several eyewitnesses, the physical evidence, and defendant\u2019s unsolicited admission. On the other side, we have defendant\u2019s version of events that would be unbelievable even if not contradicted. Given the damage that defendant\u2019s own story did to his credibility, and the enormity of the untainted evidence, we conclude that any error stemming from the jury learning that defendant had, at some point, denied being at the scene to a psychologist was harmless. Defendant has not established that it is more probable than not that a different outcome would have resulted without the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In fact, the evidence in this case is so substantial that, even if we were to analyze this as constitutional error under a due process theory (e.g., that defendant was enticed to give up his privilege to be free from compelled self-incrimination and speak to the forensic examiner by the statutory assurance that his statements could not be used for the purpose for which they were ultimately admitted), we would, nevertheless, conclude that the error was harmless.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>clear to us that the prejudice from the improperly admitted evidence, in view of the untainted evidence, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">ni</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We next address the Court of Appeals holding that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to clarify his testimony so that it was presented in a way that was more comprehensible to the jury. Specifically, defendant contended, inter alia, that his trial counsel should have asked follow-up questions that would have clarified the action described by defendant and made it clear to the jury that the true offenders, as described by defendant, included all of the most damning of the prosecutor\u2019s eyewitnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">For a defendant to establish a claim that he was denied his state or federal constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, he must show that his attorney\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that this was so prejudicial to him that he was denied a fair trial. <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 687; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984); <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298, 303; 521 NW2d 797 (1994). As for deficient performance, a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that his counsel\u2019s action constituted sound trial strategy under the circumstances. <em>People v Mitchell, </em>454 Mich 145, 156; 560 NW2d 600 (1997). As for prejudice, a defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different . . . <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 167. We conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to elicit elaborative testimony from defendant was neither deficient nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">As defense counsel\u2019s testimony at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing established, defendant\u2019s story, as he claimed to remember it, evolved during the course of his representation from not having been at the scene of the crime, to being present, but not being the shooter. Defense counsel conceded that defendant\u2019s latest version of events did not comport with the physical evidence. Under these circumstances, no reasonably competent attorney would have thought it advisable for defendant to relate his story in sufficient detail to enable its veracity to be checked by comparing it to the physical evidence or subjecting it to precise cross-examination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The dissent states that, at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, defense counsel \u201cadmitted having failed to prepare or review with defendant specific questions he would ask.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 312. Actually, defense counsel denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>failing to review with defendant the questions he would be asking, and only conceded that he \u201cdid not specifically write out the questions [he] was going to ask . . . Moreover, defense counsel testified that he visited defendant in jail a tremendous number of times to enlist defendant\u2019s aid in preparing the defense. Defense counsel expressly stated, \u201cwe prepared [defendant] as best we could\u201d and he estimated spending ten to twelve hours specifically preparing defendant to take the stand.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A defendant\u2019s decision whether to testify on his own behalf is an integral element of trial strategy. For a variety of reasons, many defendants, under the advice of counsel, do not take the stand, presumably concluding that the advantages of doing so would be outweighed by the disadvantages. It is likely that a great many of those who do not take the stand would be less hesitant to do so if, like defendant, they could plausibly tell the jury that they did not commit the crime with which they are charged, while advancing an alternative exonerating theory in general and somewhat unintelligible terms, thus effectively precluding detailed cross-examination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Even if this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>not counsel\u2019s express plan, it would have been dangerously inept of him to intentionally provide defendant with the opportunity to offer more details such as the magazine capacity of John\u2019s gun. The supposed language barrier<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in this instance provided defendant with a way for the jury to see him deny committing this crime, yet plausibly not let them hear his story in a manner in which its incredible nature was completely clear to them.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The dissent states that defense counsel did not testify that he thought defendant\u2019s story was a fabrication<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that defense counsel found that defendant\u2019s story \u201cmade sense and rebutted the theory of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 312. The closest that defense counsel\u2019s testimony came to that proposition was when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Well, it\u2019s troubling, you know, when you\u2019re trying to prepare a defense and the client tells you one thing and the physical evidence clearly points in a different direction, and there are certain things you have to own, I mean, you have to bite the bullet when comes to certain things, but, ultimately, you know, what he told us seemed to make sense, some sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">We cannot agree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of this testimony in light of defense counsel\u2019s acknowledgment that defendant made \u201cmajor adjustments\u201d in his story and that the theory of the defense was based on events of the evening as defendant <em>ultimately </em>\u201cclaimed to remember them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Moreover, finding that counsel was deficient presumes that, as of trial, defendant\u2019s version of events was as developed as it was by the time of the <em>Ginther </em>hearing. Given counsel\u2019s testimony about the evolving nature of defendant\u2019s story, it is just as likely that, having sat through trial, defendant merely tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>to cover as many details presented in the prosecutor\u2019s case as possible, and he experienced trouble keeping his story and names straight. With the passage of time, and the assistance of a transcript, perhaps defendant was able to refine this story. This does not demonstrate that counsel was deficient at the time of trial for not knowing what defendant would later \u201cremember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Finally, we fail to see how defense counsel's conduct could have been prejudicial to defendant, given not only the enormity of the evidence against defendant as discussed in part n, but also the fact that defendant\u2019s clarified testimony (as elicited at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing) is hardly more believable than the somewhat garbled version presented at trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>not more believable that John was holding a machine gun than a shotgun, and, given that .38 caliber casings were found at the scene, defendant\u2019s best alternative was to have the jury hear this weapon described as \u201ca small gunshot, black.\u201d The jury was not in possession of transcripts, so they would not necessarily have understood defendant\u2019s mispronunciations in the same way as the transcriber (e.g., hearing \u201cRose\u201d when defendant was referring to \u201cRuss\u201d). The defense theory was clear that a number of people who were present during the killing were trying to shift the blame to defendant. Under defendant\u2019s version of events, these unclearly identified persons, out of necessity, would have included John Talarico, Danny Parenteau, and Russell Parenteau. Confusion by defendant about the exact identities of those trying to rob or extort him at gunpoint was consistent with his theory, and more believable than the potential \u201cdetails\u201d that defendant later demonstrated that he was capable of adding.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Court of Appeals noted that defendant\u2019s testimony offered the only direct rebuttal of the prosecutor\u2019s theory. However, effective rebuttal is accomplished only if defendant\u2019s testimony <em>is believed. </em>The problem with defendant\u2019s clarified version is that it is so unbelievable that defendant was arguably better off letting the jury speculate about what he was really trying to say, and hoping the jurors would rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s opening statement regarding what the facts would show. Consequently, defendant did not demonstrate that, by failing to clarify his testimony, his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that this was so prejudicial that he was denied a fair trial. Rather, defendant\u2019s trial was fundamentally fair and the verdict is reliable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We hold that any error stemming from the admission of the testimony regarding statements given to a forensic psychologist by defendant in compliance -with MCL 768.20a; MSA 28.1043(1) was harmless. We also hold that defendant was not denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel on the basis of his counsel\u2019s failure to ensure that his testimony about what occurred was presented to the jury in a different manner. Defense counsel\u2019s performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial in this regard. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and, because defendant raised issues in his cross appeal not addressed by the Court of Appeals, we remand this case to that Court for consideration of the unaddressed issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Weaver, C.J., and Taylor and Corrigan, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> The jury convicted defendant on six counts: (i) second-degree murder, MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549, as a lesser included offense to a charge of first-degree, premeditated murder, MCL 750.316(l)(a); MSA 28.548(l)(a); (h) felony-firearm based on count i; (in) felony-murder based on arson or attempted arson; (iv) felony-firearm based on count rv; (v) felony-murder based on breaking and entering a dwelling with the intent to commit arson; and (vi) felony-firearm based on count v.

We find that to be a highly improbable interpretation of \u201cI only ldll one.\u201d We view it to be objectively more probable that reasonable triers of fact would interpret defendant\u2019s statement as an expression of incredulity at being charged with what he thought were five murder counts after having only killed one person.

What more defies common sense is that defendant would adhere to such conditions after Margo had moved out and had established residence elsewhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b457-5\"> The dissent latches onto an argument made by defense counsel at trial that, although Margo testified that the assailant kicked open her front door from the outside, the only damage was to the storm door, which was bent outward. Prom this, defense counsel argued that the door was damaged by someone trying to get out, and not by someone forcing their way in, and that this supported defendant\u2019s version of events. However, Margo never testified that her interior door had been locked, there is no reason to presume that the doorknob was not turned before the kick was delivered, and Margo specifically stated on cross-examination that the door was not damaged when it was kicked open. Moreover, the fact that the exterior storm door was broken outward is consistent with Danny Parenteau\u2019s testimony that he saw Steve fighting a man inside the front door of Steve\u2019s house and that Steve forced the man out through that door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> The dissent discounts the overall implausibility of defendant\u2019s testimony because, among other things: (1) a witness who saw someone shot in the face might have exclaimed that the person had been killed; (2) it is believable that defendant could have serendipitously found his car to effect an escape; and (3) defendant might have engaged in routine conduct after the killing out of shock, mental imbalance, or distrust for the police. However, we do not view these aspects of defendant\u2019s story as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>conclusive evidence of his guilt. A brick is not a wall, and the credibility of defendant\u2019s story cannot be measured by viewing its elements in isolation. Instead, we consider the entire panoply of improbable or highly coincidental elements in defendant\u2019s testimony to be significant. This is particularly so in light of the more reasonable explanations that were offered by the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses, which were consistent with the physical evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\"> Constitutional error is either structural and subject to automatic reversal, or it is nonstructural and requires reversal only if the improperly admitted evidence, in light of the properly admitted evidence, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Arizona v Fulminante, </em>499 US 279, 309-310; 111 S Ct 1246; 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991); <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 404-406; 621 NW2d 538 (1994).

While a defendant may have the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, this does not encompass the right to assistance of counsel in committing perjury. In fact, an attorney\u2019s refusal to knowingly assist in the presentation of perjured testimony is not only consistent with his ethical obligations, but cannot be the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US 157, 174-175; 106 S Ct 988; 89 L Ed 2d 123 (1986).

In fact, defense counsel only conceded appellate counsel\u2019s theory that it was <em>possible </em>that acclimation was the reason why he did not notice the mispronunciations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> The dissent does not accept that the prosecutor\u2019s ability to cross-examine defendant was impaired by the fact that defendant\u2019s direct testimony was not detailed. The prosecutor could possibly have exposed the weaknesses in defendant\u2019s story by asking the clarifying questions that, according to the dissent, defense counsel should have asked. However, defense counsel was aware of the fact that defendant\u2019s story was inconsistent with the physical evidence, whereas the prosecutor would have been on a fishing expedition. Although the prosecutor was not prohibited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>clarifying defendant\u2019s testimony, many experienced trial attorneys would agree that it is rarely sound practice to ask questions before the jury without first knowing the answer. Defense counsel may well have viewed the prosecutor as being reasonably competent when deciding on the merits of eliciting elaborative testimony from defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> In addition to Margo\u2019s trial testimony that defendant understood and spoke English reasonably well, at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, defense counsel testified: \u201cwhen I first met with [defendant], he spoke to me in English, but I was always concerned that he didn\u2019t understand the nuances of our language.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> The dissent claims that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to clarify defendant\u2019s version of events \u201callowed the prosecution to argue effectively that defendant\u2019s testimony was a figment of his imagination, undermining his credibility in the eyes of the jury.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 313. In fact, the prosecutor did ridicule defendant\u2019s testimony as ludicrous and unintelligible. Although the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of what the jury heard is valid, it is questionable whether defendant could have possibly fared better had the prosecutor and jury been privy to defendant\u2019s \u201cclarified version\u201d at trial. The preliminary examination testimony reveals that Russell and Danny were watching Monday Night Football in the company of eight other friends and family members (including their mother, their sister, their sister\u2019s boyfriend, and their sister\u2019s children) when the first shot was heard. Would defendant have been better off if the prosecutor, having fully comprehended defendant\u2019s version, called each of these individuals to testify in rebuttal that Danny and Russell were not at Margo\u2019s when the first shot was heard? Would defendant have been better served if the clarified version had been presented and the prosecutor had noted in closing argument how impossible it would have been for the various members of this neighborhood to have conspired to frame defendant, including coming up with consistent stories and planting incriminating physical evidence, in the few minutes before the police arrived and while Steve was still conscious and speaking? As ludicrous and unintelligible as defendant\u2019s testimony was, a more palatable alternative was not available to defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\"> The dissent misinterprets our position as arguing \u201cthat the reason defense counsel did not clarify his client\u2019s testimony is because he believed it was fabricated.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 312. Actually, we do not go so far as to presume that fact, but merely acknowledge that, when faced with a constantly evolving story from one\u2019s client, a reasonably competent and ethical attorney might well elect to consciously maintain uncertainty with regard to his client\u2019s explanation, and avoid highlighting details of that explanation that are inconsistent with the physical evidence or that are otherwise highly suggestive of the explanation\u2019s falsity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The dissent seeks our comment on the fact that the jury deliberated for two and a half days before convicting defendant on only six of the ten charges. To the dissent, this demonstrates that the jury was reluctant to convict defendant. The dissent further reasons that this means that the evidence against defendant on the counts of which he was convicted was not overwhelming, and that what the dissent perceives to be counsel\u2019s errors were necessarily prejudicial. <em>Post </em>at 313-314, 327-328. We are not persuaded by the dissent\u2019s reasoning. All that the record reveals is that, after two and a half days of deliberation, the jury informed the court that it had reached verdicts on the first six charges, but was deadlocked eleven to one, and ten to two on the charges of assault with intent to commit murder regarding Danny and Russell Parenteau, along with the concomitant charges of felony-firearm. After receiving the verdicts on the first six counts, the court declared a mistrial on the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We know of no sound method or good reason for attaching significance to the amount of time jurors spend deliberating. Perhaps they agreed on the first six charges in an hour and spent the rest of the time debating the counts on which they eventually could not reach consensus. Given that this jury must have rejected defendant\u2019s version of events in order to convict him of the first six charges, if we were forced to speculate regarding the significance of the jury becoming deadlocked, we would most likely conclude that the jury could not agree on whether it had been proven that defendant had formed the specific intent to murder Danny and Russell Parenteau. Although this is admittedly speculation, which deserves no more credence than the dissent\u2019s speculation, it exposes the error in the dissent\u2019s determination that the jury was reluctant to convict defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Our present holding is not premised on overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to murder Danny and Russell, and there is nothing from which to conclude that the jury was reluctant to convict on the counts where it did so. Moreover, the limited success of achieving a mistrial on four counts could easily be viewed as a testament to the efficacy of counsel\u2019s chosen strategy, rather than as evidence of deficient performance that was prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> The dissent concludes that \u201callow[ing] defendant\u2019s convictions to stand malees a mockery of the law\u2019s concern for a fair trial and damages public respect for the judicial process.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 328. Respectfully, such hyperbole is hardly supported by a thorough review of the record. No trial is error free, and, in our judgment, \u201cpublic respect\u201d for the judicial process is justifiably diminished when criminal convictions are set aside on the basis of mistakes that do not truly prejudice the defendant or damage the integrity of the criminal justice system.

He must show that the ineffective assistance so prejudiced him that he was deprived of a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>To demonstrate the requisite prejudice, a defendant must prove that, but for errors of counsel, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>was a reasonable probability of a different outcome.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">A. OBJECTIVE STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Adil Toma has poor command of the English language and an Arabic accent. He testified with the aid of an interpreter, and his testimony was often disjointed and confusing. Frequently, it was unclear who defendant was referring to in his recitation of events and whether they were the same as those the prosecution alleged were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defense attorney failed to clarify who defendant implicated in the shooting. He allowed defendant to identify people only by their first names. Defendant said that Steve Burge\u2019s girlfriend was \u201cCherry,\u201d and Margo DeVita\u2019s boyfriend was \u201cJimmy.\u201d None of the prosecution witnesses mentioned these names. They all stated that Margo\u2019s boyfriend was Steven Burge. Defendant\u2019s attorney never explained that the persons defendant referred to as \u201cRose\u201d and \u201cDon\u201d were prosecution witnesses Russell and Danny Parenteau.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Defense counsel did not ask defendant or the interpreter to correct mispronunciation of the names. He failed to ask follow-up questions of defendant to clarify his testimony and to correct errors of translation, in the interest of making the testimony coherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Counsel\u2019s failure to clarify his client\u2019s testimony was not a matter of trial strategy. In <em>Lloyd, supra, </em>defense counsel was found not ineffective for choos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ing one of two incompatible defenses, although both were weak, due to significant evidentiary problems. <em>Id. </em>at 448. Here, by contrast, there was only one viable defense theory. And, trial counsel failed adequately to aid defendant in its presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The majority argues that the reason defense counsel did not clarify his client\u2019s testimony is because he believed it was fabricated. The testimony, clarified, would have been even more damaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">However, at the Ginther<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hearing, defense counsel did not testify that he thought defendant\u2019s version of the events was a lie. The explanation he gave for failing to clarify the mispronunciations of names was that, having spoken with defendant at length, he may have become accustomed to his pronunciation and accent. Thus, it did not occur to him that clarification for the jury was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">At the <em>Ginther </em>hearing, the defense attorney stated that defendant\u2019s version of the events made sense and rebutted the theory of the prosecution. He admitted having failed to prepare or review with defendant specific questions he would ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Defendant\u2019s testimony, if clarified, could not have been more damaging than it was in its garbled and unintelligible state. I disagree that failing to clarify the testimony could have been a strategy to effectively preclude detailed cross-examination by the prosecution. Defense counsel\u2019s presentation of incomprehensible testimony did not prevent the prosecution from asking questions on cross-examination to clarify defendant\u2019s theory of the case. The prosecution was in no way deterred from exposing defendant\u2019s posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tion as, in the words of the majority, \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the physical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s shortcomings allowed the prosecution to argue effectively that defendant\u2019s testimony was a figment of his imagination, undermining his credibility in the eyes of the jury. The presentation of his client\u2019s testimony was indispensable to the creation of the defense\u2019s theory of the case. Counsel's role in its presentation failed to meet the objective requirements for reasonable assistance of counsel when compared to professional norms. In fact, he was responsible in large part for the unintelligibility of defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">B. REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF A DIFFERENT OUTCOME</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Defendant\u2019s description of the night\u2019s events was coherent and internally consistent when it was clarified at the <em>Ginther </em>hearing. The people defendant listed as present are largely the same as the prosecution listed. Defendant\u2019s version of the events names the four key prosecution witnesses and explains their motivation to lie and implicate him in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The jury deliberated for approximately two and a half days, became deadlocked, and asked to hear defendant\u2019s testimony again. Ultimately, it did not find defendant guilty of the two counts of assault with intent to commit murder, nor of the felony-firearm charges based on those assaults.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These facts support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>a finding that the errors of counsel were outcome determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">At the <em>Ginther </em>hearing and on appeal, the prosecution argues that defense counsel\u2019s errors did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict, because the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. I disagree. This was no \u201copen-and-shut\u201d case. Not only did the errors of counsel prevent defendant from intelligibly presenting his theory of the case, they actually bolstered the prosecution\u2019s case. They permitted the people to argue that defendant was imagining or fabricating his version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">This is not a case where the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. Instead, it is one in which there was a complete failure of the adversarial process, rendering it inevitable that the prosecutor\u2019s proofs would seem overwhelmingly persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">C. FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICIAL PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Federal law, explicitly, and Michigan law, by implication in reliance on federal law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> allow for reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>without considering whether ineffective assistance of counsel amounted to outcome-determinative prejudice. This occurs when the errors of defense counsel render the proceeding fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In this case, the errors violated defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to testify<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">[F]ailure to afford the petitioner a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against the charge . . . was a denial of due process of law.

When a person\u2019s mental illness reaches that extreme, the law provides that criminal responsibility does not attach. To put it alternatively, the statutes provide that all insane people are mentally ill but not all mentally ill people are insane.\u201d . . . Thus, if a defendant is found to be mentally ill, he may be found not guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or, if he lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, not guilty by reason of insanity. <em>[People v Smith, </em>119 Mich App 91, 95-96; 326 NW2d 434 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">A defendant wishing to establish insanity at the time of the offense must notify the court and the prosecuting attorney of that intention thirty or more days before trial. MCL 768.20a(l); MSA 28.1043(1)(1). The notice serves to forewarn the prosecutor. <em>People v Blue, </em>428 Mich 684, 690; 411 NW2d 451 (1987).

Such preclusion does not violate a defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to present a defense. <em>People v Hayes, </em>421 Mich 271, 283; 364 NW2d 635 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">That right is not absolute, but is subject to the \u201cestablished rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 302; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973). \u201cThe defendant is required to fully cooperate so that the examining psychologist can accurately determine the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and criminal responsibility at the time of the offense. . . . When . . . the integrity of the evidence of insanity is threatened, the preclusion sanction is warranted.\u201d <em>Hayes, supra </em>at 282-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The limitations of \u00a7 20a do not unconstitutionally infringe upon a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense <em>if courts comply with them. </em>If they do, defendants have notice of the definitive boundaries of the limitations. Section 20a forbids forensic examiner testimony on issues other than insanity, or on any issue at all, if the insanity defense is not ultimately raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The truth-seeking function of trial courts would be substantially impaired if a defendant could raise an insanity defense, then assert the psychologist-patient privilege and preclude an examiner\u2019s testimony. <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>pie v Howe, </em>445 Mich 923, 925; 520 NW2d 338 (1994) (Boyle, J., dissenting). By raising an insanity defense, the defendant has placed his mental state at issue and waived the privilege in that regard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">However, the integrity of evidence of insanity is likewise threatened if the examining forensic psychologist is permitted to testify about matters other than the issue of defendant\u2019s insanity. If that were allowed, a defendant would be justified in refusing to provide full disclosure to the examiner, fearful that incriminating information revealed would be used against him at trial. If the statute is ignored, the protections it affords are lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">When, as here, a court allows an examiner to impeach on an issue other than a defendant\u2019s mental state, it violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>due process of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To permit such testimony is to place the defendant between Scylla and Charybdis. The defendant must either forfeit his constitutional right to assert the insanity defense<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or forfeit his constitutional right not to incriminate himself.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These alternatives are equally perilous.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In <em>Colorado v </em>Connelly,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court considered the confession of a mentally ill defendant who voluntarily admitted to having perpetrated a murder. It found that admission of the confession did not deny him due process, because there was no \u201cessential link between coercive activity of the State, on the one hand, and a resulting confession by a defendant, on the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Connelly confessed without the state exerting any coercion or other action on him. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Here, by contrast, the state placed defendant in a coercive situation. The statute required him to fully cooperate with the examiner in a forensic interview in order to pursue his insanity defense. MCL 768.20a(2) and (4); MSA 28.1043(1)(2) and (4). Then, the court permitted the examiner to testify about matters other than defendant\u2019s mental state at the time the crime was committed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">A plea of insanity is in the nature of confession and avoidance. By asserting it, defendant admits the charge but denies criminal culpability. But such admission extends only to the consideration of such plea; beyond that it has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>efficacy in a criminal case. [2 Underhill, Criminal Evidence (5th ed, Supp 1970), \u00a7 450, p 370.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The admission of defendant\u2019s involuntary confession violated his right to due process of law. \u201cThe aim of the requirement of due process is ... to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false.\u201d <em>Lisenba v California, </em>314 US 219, 236; 62 S Ct 280; 86 L Ed 166 (1941). \u201c[F]ailure to afford the petitioner a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against the charge . . . [is] a denial of due process of law.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, supra </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Restricting the use of statements made to a forensic examiner to those pertinent to a defendant\u2019s sanity is a measure to ensure a fair and reliable adjudication of the issue. The potential chill to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to present an insanity defense outweighs any potential gains to the truth-seeking process in discouraging or disclosing perjured testimony. <em>James v Illinois, </em>493 US 307, 317; 110 S Ct 648; 107 L Ed 2d 676 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s opinion that the statutory preclusion of the forensic examiner\u2019s testimony involved only a privilege and that its violation was only an evidentiary error. This reasoning ignores the nature of the rights protected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The situation was coercive in that defendant\u2019s statements were coaxed from him in an interview that was a prerequisite to his ability to raise the insanity defense. By dint of the statute, the government promised that the evidence produced would be admitted only for a limited purpose. To permit it to use defendant\u2019s incriminating statements breaks the promise and implicates the Fifth Amendment prohibition against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>compelled self-incrimination.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>People v Wyngaard, </em>226 Mich App 681, 695; 575 NW2d 48 (1997) (Markman, J., dissenting), <em>People v Reagan, </em>395 Mich 306; 235 NW2d 581 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">m. CONSTITUTIONAL ERROR ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A-4\">A. ISSUE PRESERVATION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cTo preserve an evidentiary issue for appellate review, a party must object timely at trial and specify the same ground for objection as is asserted on appeal.\u201d <em>People v Considine, </em>196 Mich App 160, 162; 492 NW2d 465 (1992). \u201c[Requiring a contemporaneous objection provides the trial court an opportunity to correct the error, which could thereby obviate the necessity of further legal proceedings and would be by far the best time to address a defendant\u2019s constitutional and nonconstitutional rights.\u201d <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 764-765; 597 NW2d 130 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In this case, defense counsel objected to the testimony of the forensic examiner on the ground that the communication was privileged. The testimony was in fact privileged and inadmissable. MCL 768.20a(5); MSA 28.1043(1)(5); <em>People v Jacobs, </em>138 Mich App 273, 276-278; 360 NW2d 593 (1984). That defense counsel did not name the pertinent statute when voicing the objection did not render it lacking in adequate specificity to preserve the issue. The trial court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>sufficiently put on notice of the grounds for objection to prevent the error by precluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">B. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">An error that violates the federal constitution obliges us to look to federal precedent for the harmless error rule. The United States Supreme Court has set forth a two-part inquiry. First, a court must ask if the error is a structural defect in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defies analysis by harmless-error standards. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">At the other end of the spectrum . . . are trial errors that occur during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This requires the beneficiary of the error to prove, and the court to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction. <em>[People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 404-406; 521 NW2d 538 (1994) (internal quotations marks, brackets and citations omitted); see also <em>Arizona v Fulminante, </em>499 US 279, 307-309; 111 S Ct 1246; 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991); <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 23-24; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In this case, the error in admitting the testimony of the forensic psychologist was preserved, nonstructural constitutional error. The prosecution bears the heavy burden of showing that the admission of the forensic examiner\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">[T]he Court has been faithful to the belief that the harmless-error doctrine is essential to preserve the \u201cprinciple that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u201d <em>[Fulminante, supra </em>at 308 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">[W]hether . . . the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt ... in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, . . . and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>[Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 684; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">C. APPLICATION OF THE HARMLESS ERROR DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The error in this case was an egregious denial of the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to due process of law. Despite the majority\u2019s claim that the overwhelming weight of the evidence was in the prosecution\u2019s favor, I would hold that it nonetheless failed to carry the burden required by <em>Anderson, supra. </em>There is a distinct, reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">That defendant promised to visit Margo DeVita daily to persuade her to leave his house and that that explains his frequent presence at her apartment does not defy common sense. Defendant is essentially alleging that Margo was obsessive and dependent on him for money and would not leave without assurances of his continued presence and her continued financial security.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Margo testified that someone kicked open her front door from outside. Yet, the only damage to the front door is consistent with someone inside trying to get out.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The majority makes much of defendant\u2019s testimony that he heard \u201cCherry\u201d say \u201cJohn kill Steve,\u201d an inaccurate statement to the extent that Steve remained alive for hours after being wounded. However, the statement\u2019s inaccuracy does not discredit defendant\u2019s testimony. According to defendant, Cherry witnessed Steve being shot in the face and bleeding profusely. In such a circumstance, any witness might exclaim that the person had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The majority is skeptical of defendant\u2019s testimony that he struggled with men near Margo\u2019s house, broke away, got into his car parked next door at John\u2019s house, and drove off. However, according to defendant, Margo had told him that John had his car, correcting her earlier story. Defendant likely knew that John lived next door to Margo, and so it is quite plausible that he would find his car there and use it to effect his escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Finally, the majority finds unbelievable defendant\u2019s testimony that he engaged in routine behavior after escaping, rather than calling the police. But, defendant easily could have avoided calling the authorities out of fear of repercussions from the real killers because of shock or mental imbalance or because he distrusted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I refute the majority\u2019s interpretation of defendant\u2019s unsolicited statement: \u201cThey count five. They say I killed five people. I only kill one. Why do they count five now?\u201d This does not necessarily amount to admission of the crime. The statement could be interpreted in an innocuous manner, especially given defendant\u2019s poor command of the English language. The outburst could have been an expression of his incredulity that he could be charged with three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>counts of murder and two counts of assault with intent to commit murder when only one man died.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">A forensic examiner is a professional, likely a coherent and persuasive witness. For such a witness to testify that a defendant, in interviews before trial, contradicted his testimony in front of the jury would be greatly destructive of the defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This is particularly true here, because defendant was deprived of effective assistance of counsel, his theory of the case having been presented in a vague and confusing manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Allowing the forensic examiner\u2019s testimony more likely than not resulted in the jury largely disbelieving defendant\u2019s testimony. As the jury was, in essence, presented only with the prosecutor\u2019s proofs, it is inevitable that the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt would seem overwhelming. Even so, the jury did not convict defendant on the two counts of assault with intent to murder and the felony-firearm counts supported by those assaults. See <em>supra </em>note 4. If the evidence of guilt was truly overwhelming, it is curious that the jury failed to convict on all charged counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>It was defendant\u2019s testimony alone that rebutted the prosecution\u2019s case. On the basis of the jury\u2019s two and a half days of deliberation, one could reason that the juiy was reluctant to convict. Therefore, it is questionable whether the error in admitting the forensic examiner\u2019s testimony could have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to raise a defense. US Const, Ams VI, XTV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 17, 20. Yet, access to the defense of insanity is chilled if, in asserting it, defendants expose themselves to impeachment for every inconsistency between their trial testimony and their forensic interviews. The Court of Appeals correctly reversed defendant\u2019s convictions on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Unlike the majority, I find that defendant is entitled to a reversal of his convictions, because he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel. The majority errs in finding that the trial court\u2019s admission of the forensic examiner\u2019s testimony to impeach the defendant was not constitutional error. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To allow defendant\u2019s convictions to stand makes a mockery of the law\u2019s concern for a fair trial and damages public respect for the judicial process. I would affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b486-8\">Young, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> In relevant part, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy . . . the Assistance of counsel for his defence.

However, the counts of first-degree murder and felony-murder based on two different underlying felonies were cumulative, alternative theories of conviction for the murder of Steven Burge. Double jeopardy would permit conviction on only one of the three counts. Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>only one of the three counts of felony-firearm based on the underlying murder theories could be upheld. Ultimately, the jury could have convicted the defendant on only six charges: (1) murder or felony-murder, (2) felony-firearm based on the murder, (3) assault with intent to commit murder (Danny Parenteau), (4) felony-firearm based on that assault, (5) assault with intent to commit murder (Russell Parenteau) and (6) felony-firearm based on that assault. The jury convicted the defendant on two of the six noncumulative counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> This Court recently noted that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment incorporated and made applicable to the states numerous protections contained in the Bill of Rights.\" <em>People v Sierb, </em>456 Mich 519, 526; 581 NW2d 219 (1998).
