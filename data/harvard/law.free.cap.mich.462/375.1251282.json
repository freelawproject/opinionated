FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s decedent, nine-year-old Jeremy Massey, was a foster child in Detroit. On June 28, 1998, Jeremy participated in an outing sponsored by the Children\u2019s Center of Detroit at Camp Niobe in Lapeer County. Tragically Jeremy drowned while in the swimming area at the camp. Maureen Massey filed a lawsuit in Wayne County as personal representative of Jeremy\u2019s estate. The lawsuit named as defendants the Children\u2019s Center and one of its employees, Lisa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Dilg, and Camp Niobe and some of its employees, including Mandell.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The camp and Mandell filed a motion for change of venue, arguing that venue in Wayne County was improper and that, pursuant to MCL 600.1629(l)(a); MSA 27A.1629(l)(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> venue in Lapeer County was proper because the camp was located and conducts business in Lapeer County and the drowning took place in Lapeer County. Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the criteria under s\u00fabd (l)(a) and (b) of the statute did not apply, but that venue in Wayne County was proper pursuant to subd (l)(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>plaintiff resided there and the Children\u2019s Center did business there.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The trial court denied the motion to change venue on the basis that both the plaintiff and the Children\u2019s Center were in Wayne County. Camp Niobe and Man-dell filed an application for leave to appeal, a motion for immediate consideration, and a request for a stay with the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals granted immediate consideration and denied the application and stay \u201cfor lack of merit in the grounds presented.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The camp and Mandell then filed a motion for immediate consideration, an application for leave to appeal, and a motion for stay with this Court. This Court granted immediate consideration and granted a stay and leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling in response to a motion to change improper venue under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Shock Bros, Inc v Morbark Industries, Inc, </em>411 Mich 696, 698-699; 311 NW2d 722 (1981). Clear error exists when the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>People v Kurylczyk, </em>443 Mich 289, 303; 505 NW2d 528 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">m. PRINCIPLES OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">In examining a statute, it is our obligation to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>inferred from the words expressed in the statute. <em>White v Ann Arbor, </em>406 Mich 554, 562; 281 NW2d 283 (1979). One fundamental principle of statutory construction is that \u201ca clear and unambiguous statute leaves no room for judicial construction or interpretation.\u201d <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993). Thus, when the Legislature has unambiguously conveyed its intent in a statute, the statute speaks for itself and there is no need for judicial construction; the proper role of a court is to apply the terms of the statute to the circumstances in a particular case. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). Concomitantly, it is our task to give the words used by the Legislature their common, ordinary meaning. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">IV. THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">MCL 600.1629; MSA 27A.1629 in full provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">(1) Subject to subsection (2) <em>in an action based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for </em>personal injury, property damage, or <em>wrongful death, all of the following apply:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">(a) <em>The county in which the original injury occurred and </em>in which <em>either </em>of the following applies is a county in which to file and try the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">(i) <em>The defendant </em>resides, -has a place of business, or conducts business in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">(ii) The corporate registered office of <em>a defendant </em>is located in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">(b) If a county does not satisfy the criteria under subdivision (a), the county in which the original injury occurred and in which <em>either </em>of the following applies is a county in which to file and try the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">(i) <em>The plaintiff </em>resides, has a place of business, or conducts business in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>(ii) The corporate registered office of <em>a plaintiff </em>is located in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">(c) If a county does not satisfy the criteria under subdivision (a) or (b), a county in which <em>both </em>of the following apply is a county in which to file and try the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">(1) <em>The plaintiff </em>resides, has a place of business, or conducts business in that county, or has its corporate registered office located in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">(ii) <em>The defendant </em>resides, has a place of business, or conducts business in that county, or has its corporate registered office located in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(d) If a county does not satisfy the criteria under subdivision (a), (b), or (c), a county that satisfies the criteria under section 1621 or 1627 is a county in which to file and try an action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(2) Any party may file a motion to change venue based on hardship or inconvenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">(3) For the purpose of this section only, in a product liability action, a defendant is considered to conduct business in a county in which the defendant\u2019s product is sold at retail. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">V. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The parties agree that the original injury for purposes of construing \u00a7 1629 was the drowning and that the drowning occurred in Lapeer County. The camp and Mandell argue that they satisfy subd (l)(a) of \u00a7 1629 because the original injury occurred in Lapeer County and they reside, have a place of business, or conduct business in Lapeer County. The plaintiff argues however that when subd (l)(a) is carefully analyzed the argument for mandatory venue in Lapeer County fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Subd (l)(a) provides that, using the place of original injury (Lapeer County) as the referent, the inquiry is then if either of the following apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(i) <em>The defendant </em>resides, has a place of business, or conducts business in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(ii) The corporate registered office of <em>a defendant </em>is located in that county. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Accordingly, subd (l)(a)(i) requires that \u201c[t]he defendant\u201d reside, have a place of business, or conduct business in the county.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, we have a case with four defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The camp and Mandell would satisfy subd (l)(a)(i) if either were the only defendant. Moreover, the Children\u2019s Center and Lisa Dilg would not satisfy subd (l)(a)(i) even if they were the only defendant. These circumstances are fatal to the camp\u2019s and Mandell\u2019s reliance on subd (l)(a)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Having determined that subd (l)(a)(i) does not apply, we next must determine if subd (l)(a)(ii) required venue be established in Lapeer County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Under this subdivision, venue would be required to be in the county where the original injury occurred if a defendant is a corporation and its registered corporate office is in the same county. \u201cA,\u201d as the above makes clear, should be understood to cover a case with more than one defendant and one of them is a corporation. In the case at bar none of the defendants has asserted that it is a corporation or that it has its corporate registered office in Lapeer County. Accordingly, subd (l)(a)(ii) is also inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The statute next instructs that, if a county does not satisfy the criteria in subd (l)(a), one must look to subd (l)(b). Under subd (l)(b), Lapeer County would be the proper venue if \u201c[t]he plaintiff\u201d resided there, or had a place of business there or conducted business there or if \u201ca plaintiff\u201d had a registered corporate office there. None of these criteria are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The statute next instructs that if a county does not satisfy subd (l)(a) or (l)(b) that one must look to subd (l)(c). Under subd (l)(c), the county in which the original injury occurred is no longer a consideration. Rather, if there is a county wherein \u201c[t]he plaintiff\u201d resides, or has a place of business, conducts business or has its registered office, <em>and </em>at the same time \u201c[t]he defendant\u201d resides or has a place of business or conducts business or has its registered corporate office, then such a county is a county in which to try an action. Plaintiff argues that Wayne County comes within subd (l)(c). We cannot agree. There is no question that plaintiff resides in Wayne County. However, subd (l)(c)(ii) also requires that \u201c[t]he defendant\u201d reside, have a place of business, conduct business, or have its registered office in Wayne County before Wayne County would be \u201ca county in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>which to file and try the action . . . MCL 600.1629(l)(c); MSA 27A.1629(l)(c). As before, \u201cthe\u201d does not mean \u201ca\u201d and thus the requirements of subd (l)(cXii) are not satisfied merely because one or more of the defendants reside or have a place of business or conduct business in Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The statute next instructs that if a county does not satisfy subd (l)(a), (l)(b), or (l)(c) one must look to subd (l)(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">If a county does not satisfy the criteria under subdivision (a), (b), or (c), a county that satisfies the criteria under section 1621 or 1627 is a county in which to file and try an ' action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Thus, we are instructed to consult MCL 600.1621; MSA 27A.1621, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">Except for actions provided for in sections 1605, 1611, 1615, and 1629, venue is determined as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">(a) The county in which a defendant resides, has a place of business, or conducts business, or in which the registered office of a defendant corporation is located, is a proper county in which to commence and try an action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Sections 1605,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1611,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1615<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> do not apply here. This means we must look to \u00a7 1629, which by its terms refers us to \u00a7 1621 or \u00a7 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Applying \u00a7 1621 leads to the conclusion that Wayne County was a proper county in which plaintiff was free to file her lawsuit because at least one defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(The Children\u2019s Center) has a place of business and conducts business in Wayne County. Alternatively, applying \u00a7 1627 (which, with several exceptions, provides that venue shall be in a county where all or a part of the cause of action arose) also supports a Wayne County venue because plaintiff asserts that part of her cause of action arose in Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In summary then, because MCL 600.1629; MSA 27A.1629 referred us to MCL 600.1621; MSA 27A.1621 or MCL 600.1627; MSA 27A.1627 and Wayne County satisfies the venue criteria of \u00a7\u00a7 1621 and 1627, venue in Wayne County was proper. Thus, the trial court properly denied the camp\u2019s and Mandell\u2019s motion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Young and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\"> MCL 600.1629; MSA 27A.1629 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">(1) [I]n an action based on tort . . . seeking damages for . . . wrongful death, all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">(a) The county in which the original injury occurred and in which either of the following applies is a county in which to file and try the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">(i) <em>The defendant </em>resides, has a place of business, or conducts business in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">(ii) The corporate registered office of <em>a defendant </em>is located in that county.

Nor does it say \u201cone of the defendants.\u201d Rather, it says \u201cthe defendant.\u201d Thus, in order for the camp\u2019s and Mandell\u2019s position to prevail, we would have to read \u201cthe\u201d as if it said \u201ca.\u201d This we decline to do. \u201cThe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d have different meanings. \u201cThe\u201d is defined as \u201cdefinite article. 1.

In my view, the answer to the difficult venue question presented in this case lies in \u00a7 1641 of the Revised Judicature Act, which provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if causes of action are joined, whether properly or not, venue is proper in any county in which either cause of action, if sued upon separately, could have been commenced and tried, subject to separation and change as provided by court rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">(2) If more than 1 cause of action is pleaded in the complaint or added by amendment at any time during the action and 1 of the causes of action is based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, venue shall be determined under the rules applicable to actions in tort as provided in section 1629.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Section 1641 applies to claims involving the joinder of multiple \u201ccauses of action.\u201d Whether plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case involves the joinder of multiple \u201ccauses of action\u201d under \u00a7 1641 depends on the proper construction of the statutory phrase \u201ccause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">When examining a statute, our primary task is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). This task begins by examining the language of the statute itself, as the words of a statute provide \u201cthe most reliable evidence of its intent.\u201d See <em>id., </em>quoting <em>United States v Turkette, </em>452 US 576, 593; 101 S Ct 2524; 69 L Ed 2d 246 (1981). If statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the Legislature will be presumed to have intended the meaning plainly expressed, and the language must be applied as written. \u201cNo further judicial construction is required or permitted.\u201d <em>Sun Valley, supra </em>at 236. Only where the statutory language is ambiguous may a court properly go beyond the words of the statute to ascertain legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>The interpretation of individual words and phrases within a statute is governed by MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such as may-have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u201cCause of action\u201d is a legal term of art. Therefore, it must be understood according to its \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). Depending on the context in which it is used, the term \u201ccause of action\u201d could mean (1) a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>claim against a particular defendant, (2) a legal theory, or (3) a lawsuit. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed), p 214, gives three alternate definitions corresponding to these three general ideas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">1. A group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for suing; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person; claim (4) &lt;after the crash, Aronson had a cause of action&gt;.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">2. A legal theory of a lawsuit &lt;a malpractice cause of action. Cf. right of ACTI0N&gt;.\u2014Also termed (in senses 1 &amp; 2) <em>ground of action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">* <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">3. Loosely, a lawsuit cthere are four defendants in the pending cause of action&gt;.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Section 1641 describes \u201ccauses of action\u201d that are \u201cjoined.\u201d For purposes of joinder, this Court has repeatedly defined \u201ccause of action,\u201d as being \u201cthe fact or combination of facts giving rise to or entitling a party to sustain an action.\u201d See <em>Multiplex Concrete Machinery Co v Saxer, </em>310 Mich 243, 253; 17 NW2d 169 (1945); <em>Brewster Loud Lumber Co v General Builders\u2019 Supply Co, </em>233 Mich 633, 638; 208 NW 28 (1926); <em>Otto v Highland Park, </em>204 Mich 74, 80; 169 NW 904 (1918). Because \u00a7 1641 speaks in terms of the joinder of causes of action, this definition of \u201ccause of action,\u201d which is generally consistent with the word \u201cclaim,\u201d best represents the \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d of the statutory term in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Understanding \u201ccause of action\u201d to mean \u201cthe combination of facts giving rise to or entitling a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sustain an action,\u201d e.g., <em>Multiplex Concrete Machinery, supra </em>at 253, supports the conclusion that separate claims against various defendants amount to separate \u201ccauses of action.\u201d In this case, because each of plaintiffs claims involves the alleged negligence of a different person or entity, each claim involves a different \u201ccombination of facts\u201d entitling plaintiff to \u201csustain an action,\u201d and, therefore, each amounts to a separate \u201ccause of action.\u201d The conclusion that each claim amounts to a separate \u201ccause of action\u201d is further supported by the fact that defendant could have elected to sue any one of the defendants alone without joining her claims against the other defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Section 1641 is not a substantive venue provision. Standing alone, it does not instruct a litigant where to file an action. Rather, it demands reference to the various substantive venue statutes. Section 1641 explains that when a case involves joined \u201ccauses of action,\u201d the entire case may be brought in any county in which it would have been proper to bring one of the various joined causes of action, if that cause of action had been sued upon separately. To determine whether a particular county would have been a proper venue for one of the various joined causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>action sued upon separately, one must refer to whichever substantive venue statute is applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Subsection 1641(2) provides an exception to the general rule set forth in subsection 1641(1) that venue for the entire case is proper in any county in which one of the joined causes of action could have been brought separately. In cases involving joined causes of action, where at least one cause of action is \u201cbased on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death,\u201d venue must be \u201cdetermined\u201d according to the rules of \u00a7 1629. Section 1629 is the substantive venue statute applicable to causes of action sounding in tort and wrongful death. Subsection 1641(2) creates a preference for \u00a7 1629 over the other substantive venue statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Consider, for instance, a complaint that joins a cause of action sounding in tort with a cause of action sounding in contract. The proper venue for the tort cause of action would be determined by reference to \u00a7 1629, which is the substantive venue provision applicable to tort actions. The proper venue for the contract cause of action would be determined by reference to \u00a7 1621, which is the substantive venue provision applicable to contract actions. Under the general rule set forth in subsection 1641(1), either of these venues would be permissible for the entire case. Under the exception set forth in subsection 1641(2), however, only the venue determined proper by reference to \u00a7 1629 would be permissible for the entire case. Thus, the practical effect of subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1641(2) is that, in cases involving the joinder of multiple causes of action, venues determined by reference to \u00a7 1629 take precedence over venues determined by reference to the other substantive venue provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Applying the rules of \u00a7 1641 and \u00a7 1629 to the facts of this case, it becomes evident that the trial court did not clearly err in determining that Wayne County is a proper venue. If plaintiff had brought suit against only the Children\u2019s Center, then venue would have been proper in Wayne County under \u00a7 1629. Subsection 1629(l)(a) would not apply, because the original injury occurred in Lapeer County and the Children\u2019s Center is a Wayne County organization. Subsection 1629(l)(b) would not apply because the original injury occurred in Lapeer County and plaintiff is a Wayne County resident. Wayne County would satisfy the criteria of subsection 1629(l)(c), however, because no county satisfied the criteria of subsections (l)(a) or (l)(b), plaintiff is a Wayne County resident, and the Children\u2019s Center has its place of business in Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">On the other hand, if plaintiff had brought suit against only defendant Camp Niobe, venue would have been proper only in Lapeer County under subsection 1629(l)(a), because the original injury occurred in Lapeer County and Camp Niobe has its place of business in Lapeer County. Because plaintiff elected to bring this suit against <em>both </em>the Children\u2019s Center and Camp Niobe (as well as a number of the individual agents of those entities), this case involves the joinder of multiple \u201ccauses of action.\u201d Under the general rule set forth in \u00a7 1641, venue would be proper in any county in which one of the joined causes of action could have been brought separately. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>In this case, as set forth above, that would include both Wayne County (for the cause of action against the Children\u2019s Center) and Lapeer County (for the cause of action against Camp Niobe). Because each of these possible venues is \u201cdetermined\u201d by application of the substantive rules of \u00a7 1629, the exception set forth in subsection 1641(2) would have no practical effect in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-5\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> The Court of Appeals, in <em>Schultz v Silver Lake Transport, Inc, </em>207 Mich App 267, 275; 523 NW2d 895 (1994), reached a different conclusion on this issue. There, the Court of Appeals held that a negligence suit against several defendants residing in different counties did \u201cnot involve the joinder of separate claims, but a single claim against multiple defendants.\u201d <em>Schultz </em>did not cite any authority for its conclusion that a tort claim brought against several defendants for damages arising from a single accident does not involve the joinder of separate claims. Nor did the Court of Appeals explain its conclusion. Accordingly, I would reject the conclusion reached in <em>Schultz, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> The substantive venue statutes are \u00a7\u00a7 1605, 1615, 1621, 1627, 1629, and 1635.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
