More specifically, the question in these cases is whether the city of Detroit or individual police officers face civil liability for injuries sustained by passengers in vehicles fleeing from the police when the fleeing car caused an accident. As explained below, we hold that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">First, we hold that the police owe a duty to innocent passengers, but owe no duty to passengers who are themselves wrongdoers whether they help bring about the pursuit or encourage flight. A passenger who seeks to recover for injuries allegedly caused by a negligent police pursuit bears the burden of proving personal innocence as a precondition to establishing the duty element of a cause of action. Because the record does not allow us to conclude as a matter of law whether plaintiffs were innocent as a matter of law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are required to address additional grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>on which defendants assert they are entitled to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Second, we hold that the city of Detroit is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because one cannot reasonably conclude under a narrow reading of the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105), that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries resulted from the operation of the police vehicles. We agree with <em>Fiser v Ann Arbor, </em>417 Mich 461; 339 NW2d 413 (1983), that an officer\u2019s physical handling of a motor vehicle during a police chase, can constitute \u201cnegligent operation ... of a motor vehicle\u201d within the motor vehicle exception. However, plaintiffs\u2019 injuries did not, as a matter of law, result from the operation of the police cars where the police cars did not hit the fleeing car or physically cause another vehicle or object to hit the vehicle that was being chased or physically force the vehicle off the road or into another vehicle or object.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we overrule <em>Fiser </em>and <em>Rogers v Detroit, </em>457 Mich 125; 579 NW2d 840 (1998). Contrary to <em>Rogers, </em>we also hold that an officer\u2019s decision to pursue does not constitute the negligent operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Third, we conclude the individual police officers are immune from liability because their actions were not \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Thus, we overrule <em>Dedes v Asch, </em>446 Mich 99; 521 NW2d 488 (1994), and hold that the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d as used in the employee provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2), means the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause preceding an injury, not \u201ca proximate cause.\u201d Because the conduct of the individual police officers in these cases were not \u201cthe proximate cause,\u201d i.e., the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause, of the passengers\u2019 injuries, the officers are entitled to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">I. REVIEW OF OUR CASE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Our first opinion addressing police chase liability was <em>Fiser, </em>supra, where this Court considered a lawsuit filed by a plaintiff who was injured when his car was hit by a car driven by someone who was fleeing the police. The plaintiff sued the city of Ann Arbor and the police officers involved in the chase. The trial court granted summary disposition to the city and the police officers. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court reversed with respect to the city and two of the police officers, holding that the excessive speed of the fleeing vehicle could be said to have resulted from the fact that the driver was being pursued by the police and that it was this high speed that caused the fleeing driver to lose control. <em>Id. </em>at 475. The Court further held that the issues of negligence and proximate causation of his injuries was for the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">More recently in <em>Rogers, supra, </em>we considered two consolidated police chase cases. Both cases involved car chases in which the fleeing vehicle crashed into vehicles occupied by innocent parties. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>argued that the conduct of the police officers could not be a proximate cause of the injuries. The majority held that it was for the factfinder to determine whether the actions of the police officers in operating the pursuing vehicles were causes in fact of the plaintiffs injuries, i.e., the jury could effectively conclude that the police were causing the flight. <em>Id. </em>at 129. The <em>Rogers </em>majority reaffirmed <em>Fiser </em>and expanded on it by holding that the municipal defendants could be held hable for their officer\u2019s decision to commence pursuit or to continue the pursuit. <em>Id. </em>at 143-145.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Thus, pursuant to <em>Fiser, </em>police officers face a conundrum wherein they have a sworn duty to apprehend suspected lawbreakers yet simultaneously face legal liability if anyone but the fleeing driver is injured when they give chase. Under <em>Fiser </em>this liability is imposed even where the police car does not hit the fleeing car or physically cause another vehicle or object to hit the fleeing car or physically force the fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle or object. Pursuant to <em>Rogers, </em>even more remarkably, liability may attach for the mere decision to give chase to a suspected lawbreaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">n. FACTS AND LOWER COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In <em>Cooper, </em>plaintiffs Marlon Cooper and Martell Morris, both fourteen years of age, were passengers in a stolen Jeep Cherokee driven by Damian Collins, who was also fourteen years old. The Detroit police initially noticed that Damian Collins appeared too young to drive and that the Jeep\u2019s steering column was broken. The officers, who were in a partially marked police car, attempted to stop Collins by turning on their car\u2019s lights, briefly using the siren, show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ing Collins a police badge, and instructing him to pull over. Instead of stopping, Collins sped away. The police pursued him. After a chase through a residential neighborhood, Collins crashed the Jeep he was driving into a house. Collins was killed, while Cooper and Morris were seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The parents of Cooper and Morris filed a lawsuit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against the individual officers and the city of Detroit. The defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7), (8), and (10). After argument, the trial court granted summary disposition for both the officers and the city. The trial court held that the officers were entitled to governmental immunity because plaintiffs had failed to state a claim in avoidance of the employee provision of the governmental immunity act. The trial court also concluded the officers owed no duty to plaintiffs. The trial court further held that the city was entitled to governmental immunity because the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim within the motor vehicle exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the officers were not entitled to governmental immunity because plaintiffs\u2019 claims avoided the employee provision of the governmental immunity act and also that the officers owed a duty to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The Court of Appeals also held that the city was not entitled to governmental immunity because plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell within the motor vehicle exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In Robinson, Courtney Henderson, age fifteen, was walking to his summer job when neighbor Marcelle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Blakeney offered him a ride. Henderson sat in the back seat; Marlon Smith, age eighteen, was in the front passenger seat. The Detroit police observed Blakeney weaving from lane to lane. When the police activated the lights on their police car, Blakeney began to flee rather than stop. The police turned on the siren and began to pursue the vehicle. This pursuit ended when Blakeney\u2019s car collided with a nonpolice vehicle. Henderson died in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Plaintiff, as personal representative for Henderson\u2019s estate, filed a lawsuit against the city of Detroit and the police officers involved in the pursuit. Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7), (8) and (10). The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition. The trial court ruled that the officers were entitled to governmental immunity because plaintiff had failed to state a claim in avoidance of the employee provision of the governmental immunity act. The trial court also held the officers owed no duty to Henderson. The trial court ruled that the city was not entitled to governmental immunity because plaintiff\u2019s claim fell within the motor vehicle exception. The trial court nevertheless concluded that summary disposition in the city\u2019s favor was proper in light of its duty ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">After a conflict panel was convened, the Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, holding that the police owe no duty to a voluntary passenger in a fleeing driver\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>This Court granted leave in both Robinson<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <em>Cooper</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and ordered the cases to be submitted together. After oral argument, we set the case over to the present term and asked the parties to file additional briefing regarding whether <em>Fiser, Rogers, </em>and <em>Dedes </em>were properly decided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">m. THE QUESTION OF DUTY</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In <em>Fiser, supra </em>at 469-473, this Court implicitly held, in the context of a police pursuit, that the police owe a duty to innocent bystanders. In <em>Jackson v Oliver, </em>204 Mich App 122, 126-127; 514 NW2d 195 (1994), the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Fiser </em>and held that in the context of a police pursuit the police do not owe the fleeing suspect, i.e., a wrongdoer, a duty to refrain from chasing the suspect at speeds dangerous to the suspect. The <em>Jackson </em>panel\u2019s holding was premised on public policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Out of concern for public safety, police must sometimes allow fleeing suspects to get away. However, it would be absurd to conclude that the police, out of concern for the safety of a fleeing criminal suspect, must cease pursuit of the fleeing suspect or risk possible civil liability. <em>[Id. </em>at 126.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The cases at bar concern a scenario not considered in either <em>Fiser </em>or <em>Jackson, </em>i.e., whether the police owe a duty to a passenger in a fleeing vehicle. The Court of Appeals in <em>Cooper </em>held that the police had a duty to passengers, while the conflict panel in <em>Robinson </em>resolved this issue consistently with <em>Jackson, </em>holding that the police do not owe a duty to passengers in a fleeing driver\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We conclude that it is irrelevant whether a wrongdoer is a driver or a passenger or whether an innocent person is inside or outside the vehicle. Consistent with the reasoning in <em>Fiser </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>whatever their location, there is a duty to innocent persons, but not to wrongdoers. In other words, the police owe a duty to innocent persons whether those persons are inside or outside the vehicle. Conversely, the police owe no duty to a wrongdoer, whether the wrongdoer is the fleeing driver or a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Our conclusion that police officers giving chase owe a duty to innocent persons is consistent with the statutes governing operation of emergency vehicles. MCL 257.603(3)(c); MSA 9.2303(3)(c) authorizes emergency vehicles to exceed prima facie speed limits, but only as long as \u201clife or property\u201d is not endangered. Similarly, MCL 257.632; MSA 9.2332 exempts police officers from speed limits when chasing violators of the law, but does not exempt the police from the consequences of a \u201creckless disregard of the safety of others.\u201d Further, MCL 257.653; MSA 9.2353, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>which requires drivers to pull over upon the approach of an emergency vehicle with flashing lights, specifically states that the statute does not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of persons using the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The statutory references to endangering life and the safety of others demonstrates that the Legislature has placed a duty upon police officers toward innocent persons when they are giving chase.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We place on the plaintiff the burden of proving that a passenger was an innocent person and that the police therefore owed the passenger a duty. Where no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the status of a passenger, summary disposition may be appropriate. However, when a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning whether a passenger is innocent or a wrongdoer, and thus whether the police owed a duty, the question is appropriately resolved by the trier of fact. See, e.g., <em>Holland v Liedel, </em>197 Mich App 60, 65; 494 NW2d 772 (1992) (although the issue whether a duty exists is generally a question of law for the court to decide, where the determination of duty depends on factual findings, those findings must be made by the jury). In the cases at bar, the issue of the passengers\u2019 status has not been sufficiently devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>oped, thereby making summary disposition on the basis of duty inappropriate at this time. Thus, we turn to consideration of defendants\u2019 additional defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">IV. THE motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Plaintiffs contend the city of Detroit may be liable pursuant to the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity. This statute provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">Governmental agencies shall be liable for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the negligent operation by any officer, agent, or employee of the governmental agency, of a motor vehicle of which the governmental agency is owner .... [MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In <em>Fiser, supra </em>at 469, this Court held that a police officer\u2019s pursuit of a fleeing vehicle could fall within the motor vehicle exception as the \u201cnegligent operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d The Court so held even where the police vehicle did not hit the fleeing car or physically cause another vehicle or object to hit the fleeing car or physically force the fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle or into some other object.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">In <em>Rogers, supra </em>at 145-146, the majority went beyond <em>Fiser </em>and concluded that negligent operation of a motor vehicle encompasses not only the pursuit itself, but also a police officer\u2019s decision to commence a pursuit. The dissent would have held that the phrase \u201cnegligent operation of a motor vehicle\u201d encompasses the manner in which a police vehicle is driven during a pursuit, but does not encompass an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>officer\u2019s decision to pursue a fleeing vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 158-161 (Taylor, J., with Weaver, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">As indicated in footnote 9, we have been asked on numerous occasions to revisit <em>Fiser. </em>See, e.g., <em>Frohman v Detroit, </em>181 Mich App 400, 414-415; 450 NW2d 59 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">When a situation occurs, such as in the instant case, where an officer performs his legal duty by attempting to catch a fleeing lawbreaker, conducts the pursuit in what one may minimally call a negligent manner, and does not strike any vehicle with his vehicle, it is a remarkable legal principle that he can be said to have \u201ccaused\u201d the resultant accident. To prevent the accident, all the fleeing driver need have done is stop. For the law to incorporate the presumption that a person will violate the law and to thereby hold that the officer\u2019s pursuing the violator is a proximate cause of an accident involving the fleeing person makes society the insurer of a risk no private corporation is required to assume under the law. Furthermore, the ordinary person in society has no such obligation or even a right to pursue such a lawbreaker, whereas a police officer has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKg\">We conclude that in police pursuit cases an initial legal decision should be made to determine whether the nature of the pursuit is such as to create a question which must be submitted to a jury. We invite the Supreme Court or Legislature to establish a bright line test which provides that a decision to engage in pursuit, as a matter of law, cannot be the basis of a claim of negligence. Only when the officer\u2019s driving itself is a direct cause of an injury would the question of negligence be submitted as a fact question to the jury. The determination should not turn on how the officer was conducting the pursuit but rather on what effect the manner in which the officer drove his vehicle had on the cause of the accident. Fiser\u2019s legal fiction, that a police pursuit of a lawbreaker should give rise to a legal expectation the lawbreaker will flee, should be re-examined, especially in light of <em>Ross [v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984)] ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>We begin our analysis with the basic principle, of which there is no longer any dispute, that the grant of immunity in MCL 691.1407(1); MSA 3.996(107)(l)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is broad and that the statutory exceptions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> thereto are to be narrowly construed. <em>Kerbersky v Northern Mich Univ, </em>458 Mich 525, 529; 582 NW2d 828 (1998); <em>Horace v City of Pontiac, </em>456 Mich 744, 749 ff; 575 NW2d 762 (1998); <em>Wade v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>439 Mich 158, 166; 483 NW2d 26 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In this regard, we note that <em>Fiser </em>was decided before this Court\u2019s seminal governmental immunity opinion in <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co, supra, </em>where we held that statutory exceptions to governmental immunity are to be narrowly construed. Previously, of course, this Court had given the exceptions broad readings. As explained in <em>Horace v City of Pontiac, </em>two cases decided by this Court before <em>Ross </em>that had given a broad reading to the defective public building exception to governmental immunity were no longer good law once <em>Ross </em>determined that statutory exceptions were to be narrowly construed. <em>Id. </em>at 750, n 3. <em>Fiser </em>meets a similar fate. <em>Fiser </em>may have been proper when decided, but it is no longer \u201cgood law\u201d after <em>Ross. </em>Contrary to <em>Ross, Fiser </em>requires a broad reading of the motor vehicle exception to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that a police vehicle, merely by the fact of pursuit, proximately caused a subsequent accident when the police vehicle did not hit the fleeing car or force it off the roadway or into another vehicle or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In <em>Robinson, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the city was negligent \u201cthrough the conduct of one or more of its police officer employees in failing to operate the police vehicle at all times in such manner as to avoid placing the general public in danger . . . .\u201d In <em>Cooper, </em>plaintiffs alleged that the city was liable because the pursuing officer \u201c[flailed and neglected to operate the vehicle owned by Defendant city of Detroit in a safe, prudent and reasonable manner at all times and to obey all traffic laws and regulations.\u201d Notably absent from the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations is the assertion that the police vehicles hit the fleeing car or otherwise physically forced the fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The motor vehicle exception requires that a plaintiff\u2019s injuries result from the operation of a government vehicle. MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105). Because there is no case law that has previously examined the phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d we turn to the dictionary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <em>American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Ed, </em>p 1054, defines \u201cresult\u201d as: \u201cTo occur or exist as a consequence of a particular causef;] To end in a particular way[;] The consequence of a particular action, operation or course; outcome.\u201d Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the fact that the motor vehicle exception must be narrowly construed, we conclude that plaintiffs cannot satisfy the \u201cresulting from\u201d language of the statute where the pursuing police vehicle did not hit the fleeing car or otherwise physically force it off the road or into another vehicle or object.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We also agree with the dissenting opinion in <em>Rogers </em>that the decision to pursue a fleeing motorist, which is separate from the operation of the vehicle itself, is not encompassed within a narrow construction of the phrase \u201coperation of a motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, allowing a police officer\u2019s decision to pursue to be construed as the \u201coperation of a motor vehicle\u201d and therefore fall under an exception to governmental immunity, conflicts with the police officer\u2019s duty to apprehend criminal suspects. The officer should be able to rely on MCL 257.602a; MSA 9.2302(1) and MCL 257.653; MSA 9.2353, which mandate that a motorist not wilfully fail to obey a police officer\u2019s direction to stop. We thus reject the holding in <em>Rogers </em>that a police officer\u2019s decision to pursue a fleeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>vehicle falls within the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">V. THE EMPLOYEE PROVISION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The plaintiffs also sued the individual police officers, seeking to hold them personally liable. The tort liability of governmental employees is governed by the employee provision of the governmental immunity act, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Each . . . employee of a governmental agency . . . shall be immune from tort liability for injuries to persons or damages to property caused by the . . . employee . . . while in the course of employment . . . while acting on behalf of a governmental agency if all of the following are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">(a) The . . . employee ... is acting or reasonably believes he or she is acting within the scope of his or her authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">(b) The governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">(c) The . . . employee\u2019s . . . conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage. As used in this subdivision, \u201cgross negligence\u201d means conduct so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results. [MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">There is no question that (a) and (b) are met in both of these cases. As to subsection (c), in <em>Dedes, supra </em>at 107, this Court effectively interpreted \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d in subsection (c) to mean \u201ca proximate cause.\u201d The Court further explained that \u201cthe\u201d proximate cause does not mean \u201csole\u201d proximate cause. <em>Id. </em>We overrule <em>Dedes </em>to the extent that it interpreted the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d in subdivision (c) to mean \u201ca proximate cause.\u201d The Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ture\u2019s use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d clearly evinces an intent to focus on one cause. The phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d is best understood as meaning the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause preceding an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Because the Legislature is presumed to understand the meaning of the language it enacts into law, statutory analysis must begin with the wording of the statute itself. <em>Carr v General Motors Corp, </em>425 Mich 313, 317; 389 NW2d 686 (1986). Each word of a statute is presumed to be used for a purpose, and, as far as possible, effect must be given to every clause and sentence. <em>Univ of Mich Bd of Regents v Auditor General, </em>167 Mich 444, 450; 132 NW 1037 (1911). The Court may not assume that the Legislature inadvertently made use of one word or phrase instead of another. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931). Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the Court must follow it. <em>City of Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641, 649; 97 NW2d 804 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">These rules of statutory construction are especially germane in the cases now before us because Michigan strictly construes statutes imposing liability on the state in derogation of the common-law rule of sovereign immunity. <em>Johnson v Ontonagon Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>253 Mich 465, 468; 235 NW 221 (1931); <em>Detroit v Putnam, </em>45 Mich 263, 265; 7 NW 815 (1881). This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that governmental immunity legislation \u201cevidences a clear legislative judgment that public and private tortfeasors should be treated differently.\u201d <em>Ross </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The majority in <em>Dedes </em>interpreted the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d to mean \u201ca proximate cause.\u201d It did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>this on the basis of an analysis that not to do so would produce a marked change in Michigan law, and that the Legislature, in its \u201clegislative history,\u201d gave no indication that it understood that it was making such a significant change. This approach can best be described as a judicial theory of legislative befuddlement. Stripped to its essence, it is an endeavor by the Court to use the statute\u2019s \u201chistory\u201d to contradict the statute\u2019s clear terms. We believe the Court had no authority to do this. After all, the judiciary has always adhered to the principle that the Legislature, having acted, is held to know what it has done, i.e., to know the difference between \u201ca proximate cause\u201d and \u201cthe proximate cause.\u201d Yet, in this circumstance, it is not necessary to rely on theoretical surmises to conclude this, as the Legislature has shown an awareness that it actually knows that the two phrases are different. It has done this by utilizing the phrase \u201ca proximate cause\u201d in at least five statutes<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and has used the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d in at least thirteen other statutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Given such a pattern, it is particularly indefensible that the <em>Dedes </em>majority felt free to read \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d as if it said \u201ca proximate cause.\u201d The error will not be compounded, as today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>this Court corrects the flawed analysis of the <em>Dedes </em>majority.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Nevertheless, the fact that the Legislature sometimes uses \u201ca proximate cause\u201d and at other times uses \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d does not, of course, answer the question what \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d means other than to show that the two phrases should not be interpreted the same way. Our duty is to give meaning to the Legislature\u2019s choice of one word over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We agree with the following analysis found in the dissent in <em>Hagerman v Gencorp Automotive, </em>457 Mich 720, 753-754; 579 NW2d 347 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">Traditionally in our law, to say nothing of our classrooms, we have recognized the difference between \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca.\u201d \u201cThe\u201d is defined as \u201cdefinite article. 1. (used, esp. before a noun, with a specifying or particularizing effect, as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of the indefinite article a or an) . . . .\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dic</em>tionary, p 1382. Further, we must follow these distinctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>between \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d as the Legislature has directed that \u201c[a]ll words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language .... MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). Moreover, there is no indication that the words \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d in common usage meant something different at the time this statute was enacted ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Further, recognizing that \u201cthe\u201d is a definite article, and \u201ccause\u201d is a singular noun, it is clear that the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d contemplates <em>one </em>cause. Yet, meaning must also be given to the adjective \u201cproximate\u201d when juxtaposed between \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ccause\u201d as it is here. We are helped by the fact that this Court long ago defined \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d as \u201cthe immediate efficient, direct cause preceding the injury.\u201d <em>Stoll v Laubengayer, </em>174 Mich 701, 706; 140 NW 532 (1913). The Legislature has nowhere abrogated this, and thus we conclude that in MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c) the Legislature provided tort immunity for employees of governmental agencies unless the employee\u2019s conduct amounts to gross negligence that is the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of the injury or damage, i.e., the proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Applying this construction to the present cases, we hold that the officers in question are immune from suit in tort because their pursuit of the fleeing vehicles was not, as a matter of law, \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d of the injuries sustained by the plaintiffs. The one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries was the reckless conduct of the drivers of the fleeing vehicles.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Accordingly, summary disposition for the defendant officers was proper because reasonable jurors could not find that the officers were \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d of the injuries. <em>Moll v Abbott Laboratories, </em>444 Mich 1, 28, n 36; 506 NW2d 816 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">VI. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In overruling <em>Fiser/Rogers </em>and <em>Dedes </em>we have given serious consideration to the doctrine of stare decisis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Stare decisis is generally \u201cthe preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, stare decisis is not to be applied mechanically to forever prevent the Court from overruling earlier erroneous decisions determining the meaning of statutes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Courts have cited numerous factors to consider before overruling a prior case. For example, <em>Helvering v Hallock, </em>309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\"><em>[S\\tare decisis </em>is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We must also recognize that stare decisis is a \u201cprinciple of policy\u201d rather than \u201can inexorable command,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that the Court is not constrained to follow precedent when governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Further, as Justice Powell stated concurring in <em>Mitchell v W T Grant Co, </em>416 US 600, 627-628; 94 S Ct 1895; 40 L Ed 2d 406 (1974), \u201c[i]t is thus not only our prerogative but also our duty to re-examine a precedent where its reasoning or understanding of the Constitution is fairly called into question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Courts should also review whether the decision at issue defies \u201cpractical workability,\u201d whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision. See, e.g., <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, </em>505 US 833, 853-856; 112 S Ct 2791; 120 L Ed 2d 674 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided. We believe the decisions at issue here were. As previously explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>we conclude that <em>Fiser </em>has fallen victim to a subsequent change in the law, that <em>Rogers </em>reflects a misunderstanding of the statute that establishes the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, and that <em>Dedes </em>misconstrued a plainly worded statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">However, as this discussion makes clear, the mere fact that an earlier case was wrongly decided does not mean overruling it is invariably appropriate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Rather, the Court must proceed on to examine the effects of overruling, including most importantly the effect on reliance interests and whether overruling would work an undue hardship because of that reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The \u201cpractical workability\u201d of <em>Fiser </em>has also been suspect. As set forth in footnote 9, the Court of Appeals has repeatedly questioned <em>Fiser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As to the reliance interest, the Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is in practice a prudential judgment for a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We conclude that these cases have not become so embedded, accepted or fundamental to society\u2019s expectations that overruling them would produce significant dislocations. It is apparent that the fleeing drivers, as they sought to evade the police, were undoubtedly not aware of our previous case law, nor is it likely that they drove as they did in reliance on the theory that they or the person injured as a result of their fleeing might have recourse against the municipality or individual police officers. In fact, it seems incontrovertible that only after the accident would such awareness come. Such after-the-fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>awareness does not rise to the level of a reliance interest because to have reliance the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person or entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event. Such a situation does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Further, it is well to recall in discussing reliance, when dealing with an area of the law that is statutory (which <em>Fiser/Rogers </em>and <em>Dedes </em>do), that it is to the words of the statute itself that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions. This is the essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are. Thus, if the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to expect, that is, rely, that they will be carried out by all in society, including the courts. In fact, should a court confound those legitimate citizen expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself that has disrupted the reliance interest. When that happens, a subsequent court, rather than holding to the distorted reading because of the doctrine of stare decisis, should overrule the earlier court\u2019s misconstruction. The reason for this is that the court in distorting the statute was engaged in a form of judicial usurpation that runs counter to the bedrock principle of American constitutionalism, i.e., that the lawmaking power is reposed in the people as reflected in the work of the Legislature, and, absent a constitutional violation, the courts have no legitimacy in overruling or nullifying the people\u2019s representatives.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>does such a compromising by a court of the citizen\u2019s ability to rely on a statute have no constitutional warrant, it can gain no higher pedigree as later courts repeat the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In summary, we are compelled to overrule <em>Dedes </em>because our responsibility is to interpret the words of the Legislature and <em>\u201cthe </em>proximate cause\u201d does not mean <em>\u201ca </em>proximate cause,\u201d and because this distinction is critical in determining responsibility for the injuries suffered by passengers in fleeing vehicles. We are equally compelled to overrule <em>Rogers </em>because we do not believe that the phrase \u201coperation of a motor vehicle\u201d encompasses the mere decision itself by the police to pursue a fleeing suspect, as opposed to the specific conduct of the police during such pursuit. Finally, we believe it is necessary to overrule <em>Fiser </em>because a narrow reading of the phrase \u201cbodily injury . . . resulting from the negligent operation of a motor vehicle\u201d does not properly characterize a situation in which a police vehicle pursuing a fleeing suspect has neither hit the fleeing car nor physically forced the vehicle off the road or into another vehicle or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We return the law, as is our duty, to what we believe the citizens of this state reading these statutes at the time of enactment would have understood the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity and the employee provision of the governmental immunity act to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Thus, the police owe a duty to innocent passengers and pedestrians but not to passengers who are engaged in encouraging or abetting the fleeing. If an innocent person is injured as a result of a police chase because the police physically force a fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle that person may seek recovery against a governmental agency pursuant to the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity. Plaintiffs in the cases at bar do not have causes of action against the city of Detroit under this exception because the injuries did not result from the police physically hitting the fleeing car or physically causing another vehicle or object to hit the fleeing car or physically forcing the fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Innocent persons who are injured as the result of police chases may sue an individual police officer only if the officer is \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d of the accident, i.e., the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of the accident. Because the officers in the cases at bar were not \u201cthe proximate causes\u201d of the injuries, the plaintiffs have no causes of action against the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The result in <em>Robinson </em>is affirmed. <em>Cooper </em>is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-7\">Weaver, C.J., and Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> As noted in footnote 6, there was some evidence suggesting that Henderson was not innocent. However, because the test we announce is new, and Henderson\u2019s estate was never on notice of its obligation to produce any evidence to the contrary, we take the more prudent course and decline to find as a matter of law that Henderson was a wrongdoer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> Conversely, if an innocent person is injured as a result of a police chase because a police car physically forces a fleeing car off the road or into another vehicle or object, such person may seek recovery against a governmental agency pursuant to the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity and also against'the officer operating the police vehicle if the individual police officer is \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> 107 Mich App 367; 309 NW2d 552 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\"> Plaintiffs also brought a lawsuit against the personal representative of the estate of Damian Collins.

One pictures the legislators of our various States periodically clamoring and elbowing each other in their zeal to get at the pearls of wisdom embalmed in the latest decisions and advance sheets of their respective supreme courts\u2014\u25a0 and thenceforth indicating their unbounded approval by a vast and permanent silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">Yet there are several dark shadows in this picture. For one, it suggests a legislative passion for reading and heeding the decisions of our supreme courts which we suspect may be scarcely borne out by the facts. For another, pushed too far such a doctrine suggests the interesting proposition that it is the legislatures which have now become the ultimate courts of last resort in our various States; that if they delay long enough to correct our errors those errors thus become both respectable and immutably frozen; and, finally, the larger and more dismal corollary that if enough people persist long enough in ignoring an injustice it thereby becomes just.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> Cases that come to mind with regard to reliance that, even if wrongly-decided, we might nevertheless decline to overrule could well be our recent ruling regarding term limits <em>Massey v Secretary of State, </em>457 Mich 410; 579 NW2d 862 (1998), or this Court\u2019s initial advisory opinion with regard to automobile no-fault insurance. <em>In re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441; 208 NW2d 469 (1973).

Or does the \u201cjudicial activist\u201d label only attach to those who correct erroneous decisions that do not comport with the accuser\u2019s policy preference, whatever that policy may be?</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">hi my experience, the justices of this Court struggle diligently to render principled decisions. The justices are not, however, infallible. Subsequent events and further reflection frequently reveal errors in the reasoning of an opinion or unforeseen consequences. In such cases, our responsibility demands that we reconsider the prior decision. See <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 514. \u201cWhen it becomes apparent that the reasoning of an opinion is erroneous, and that less mischief will result from overruling the case rather than following it, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>becomes the duty of the court to correct it.\u201d <em>Graves, supra </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">This Court has fulfilled its duty. In <em>People v Kazmierczak, </em>461 Mich 411; 605 NW2d 667 (2000), for example, we overruled <em>People v Taylor, </em>454 Mich 580; 564 NW2d 24 (1997), because <em>Taylor </em>misread and misapplied controlling United States Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. <em>Taylor </em>\u201cconfused the concept of probable cause and how it may be shown with the concept of search warrant exceptions and when they exist.\u201d <em>Kazmierczak, supra </em>at 420. To allow that fundamentally flawed two-year-old decision to stand would have violated the public interest because lower courts would have been compelled to dismiss legitimate criminal charges on the basis of a misapplication of United States Supreme Court precedent in the <em>Taylor </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Similarly, in <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484; 596 NW2d 607 (1999), we overruled <em>People v Gearns, </em>457 Mich 170; 577 NW2d 422 (1998), because the <em>Gearns </em>test for harmless error clearly conflicted with MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096. We acknowledged and corrected the clear error in <em>Gearns </em>because the statute controls judicial review of preserved, nonconstitutional error. <em>Lukity, supra </em>at 495. To allow <em>Gearns </em>to stand would have violated the public interest because it would have resulted in the reversal of valid criminal convictions in contravention of legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Our decisions since January 1999 reflect our adherence to our respective oaths to support the constitution and faithfully discharge the duties of our office. Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 1. To preserve the legitimacy of the judicial branch, this Court must not exceed the limits of its constitutional authority. I agree that too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>rapid change in the law threatens judicial legitimacy, as it threatens the stability of any institution. But the act of correcting past rulings that usurp power properly belonging to the legislative branch does not threaten legitimacy. Rather, it restores legitimacy. Simply put, our duty to act within our constitutional grant of authority is paramount. If a prior decision of this Court reflects an abuse of judicial power at the expense of legislative authority, a failure to recognize and correct that excess, even if done in the name of stare decisis, would perpetuate an unacceptable abuse of judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In <em>McDougall v Schanz/Sobran v McKendrick, </em>461 Mich 15; 597 NW2d 148 (1999), for instance, we were required to recognize the limits of our constitutional authority. Our prior decisions had \u201cfailed to consider the constitutionally required distinction between \u2018practice and procedure\u2019 and substantive law and thus overstated the reach of our rule-making authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Our duty to adhere to the constitution compelled us to reject our prior characterization of all statutes that resemble rules of evidence as relating solely to practice and procedure in favor of an analysis that distinguishes between procedural rules of evidence and evidentiary rules of substantive law. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. We could not follow past precedent when to do so would exceed the scope of this Court\u2019s constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The present case likewise requires that we respect the constitutional division of powers between the Legislature and the judiciary. This Court has the authority to construe statutes, not to redraft them. This task can be difficult because the Legislature sometimes uses language that is reasonably suscepti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ble to more than one meaning. This Court properly exercises its constitutional authority in construing such ambiguous statutes in light of their language and legislative purpose. When, however, under the guise of statutory construction, this Court ignores the language of the statute to further its own policy views, it wrongly usurps the power of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In her dissent in <em>Dedes v Asch, </em>446 Mich 99, 123-124; 521 NW2d 488 (1994), Justice Riley explained that this Court exceeds the limit of its constitutional authority when it substitutes its policy choice for that of the Legislature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">If the Legislature acted unwisely in enacting the statute or failing to adequately debate its merits, the judiciary may not act to save the Legislature from its folly. As long as they do not violate the constitution, legislative controversies are to be resolved by the various democratic safeguards and checks in the constitution: ballot box, initiative, referendum, or constitutional amendment. The majority, however, stifles and denigrates these processes by reaching beyond the plain language of the act and crafting a new statute reflective of its sensibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In my view, our decision today restores judicial legitimacy by overruling decisions that wrongly usurped the power of the Legislature.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\"> The dissent builds on a theme first expressed in this case in Justice Cavanagh\u2019s statement dissenting from the resubmission order. 461 Mich 1201-1204 (1999). He suggested that the actions of \u201cthe majority\u201d evidenced a lack of judicial restraint. In support of this position, he identified six opinions in which this Court allegedly disregarded the principle of stare decisis: <em>Ritchie-Gamester v City of Berkley, </em>461 Mich 73; 597 NW2d 517 (1999), <em>McDougall v Schanz/Sobran v McKendrick, </em>461 Mich 15; 597 NW2d 148 (1999), <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750; 597 NW2d 130 (1999), <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484; 596 NW2d 607 (1999), <em>People v Borchard-Ruhland, </em>460 Mich 278; 597 NW2d 1 (1999), and <em>McCready v Hoffius, </em>459 Mich 1235 (1999). The claims that the majority lacks respect for the doctrine of stare decisis are ill-founded and cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In his dissenting statement, Justice Cavanagh used former Justice Brickley, the senior member of the Court at that time, as a barometer of principled decision making. In his words, Justice Brickley brought to the cases \u201cunwavering objectivity and reason, unconstrained by any predetermined notions.\u201d 461 Mich 1204, n 4. After distinguishing Justice Brickley in this manner, Justice Cavanagh noted that Justice Brickley had joined \u201ca few\u201d of the opinions cited as examples of \u201cthe majority\u2019s\u201d lack of restraint. In fact, Justice Brickley actually joined the majority opinion in five of the six cases cited and concurred in the result in the sixth. <em>Lukity, supra </em>at 503 (Brickley, J., concurring) (\u201cI concur in the majority opinion, and write separately to acknowledge its discussion of the proper standard for reviewing whether error is harmless\u201d); <em>McDougall, supra </em>at 37; <em>Carines, supra </em>at 773; <em>Borchard-Ruhland, supra </em>at 295; <em>McCready, supra </em>at 1235-1236; <em>Ritchie-Gamester, supra </em>at 95 (Brickley, J., concurring). Justice Brickley\u2019s actual voting record undermines the veiled suggestion that a new group of intemperate justices seized control of this Court after the \u201cascendancy\u201d of \u201cthe majority\u201d on January 1, 1999. 461 Mich 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Further, it is clear that the principle of stare decisis is inapplicable in three of the six cases alleged to violate stare decisis. In <em>Corines, supra, </em>we declined to follow <em>People v Vaughn, </em>447 Mich 217; 524 NW2d 217 (1994), a plurality opinion that had no precedential force, in <em>Borchard-Ruhland, supra, </em>we declined to follow dicta in an earlier case, and in <em>McCready, supra, </em>in lieu of granting rehearing we remanded for further argument of a constitutional issue that was not addressed in the lower courts. It is axiomatic that principles of stare decisis do not apply to plurality opinions, dicta from previous cases, or to cases considered anew on motions for rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> This willingness to reexamine precedent is actually an important component of the development of the common law. The common law is not immutable; rather, it is flexible and adaptable to changing conditions. <em>Bugbee v Fowle, </em>277 Mich 485, 492; 269 NW 570 (1936). \u201c[C]hanging conditions may give rise to new rights under the law, and, also, where the reason on which existing rules of the common law are founded ceases, the rules may cease to have application.\u201d <em>Beech Grove Investment Co v Civil Rights Comm, </em>380 Mich 405, 430; 157 NW2d 213 (1968) (plurality opinion), quoting 15A CJS, Common Law, \u00a7 2, pp 43-44. In <em>Ritchie-Gamester v City of Berkley, </em>n 1 <em>supra, </em>we exercised our authority over the development of the common law and adopted reckless misconduct as the minimum standard of care for coparticipants in recreational activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b632-8\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atx\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that \u201cthe police owe a duty to innocent passengers, but owe no duty to passengers who are themselves wrongdoers . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 444.

Its attempt to move our law one step forward by overruling three established decisions leaves it, in my estimation, trailing three steps behind the times.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The majority overrules the proximate cause analysis of <em>Fiser v Ann Arbor, </em>417 Mich 461; 339 NW2d 413 (1983), and <em>Rogers v Detroit, </em>457 Mich 125; 579 NW2d 840 (1998). It holds that \u201can officer\u2019s decision to pursue does not constitute the negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 445. Also, the majority overrules <em>Dedes v Asch, </em>446 Mich 99; 521 NW2d 488 (1994). In so doing, it holds \u201cthat the phrase \u2018the proximate cause\u2019 as used in the employee provision of the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1407(2); MSA 3.996(107)(2), means the one most immediate, efficient, and direct cause preceding an injury, not \u2018a proximate cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>pp 445-446.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The majority\u2019s decision to overrule three distinct, well-reasoned lines of cases is unparalleled. I am not alone in adjudging such casual regard for prior Michigan jurisprudence and the principles of stare decisis disheartening and unwarranted. One might perceive from the majority\u2019s review of the issues in <em>Fiser, Rogers, </em>and <em>Dedes, </em>that the outcome of this case turns simply on who had the better argument. It does not. The majorities\u2019 positions in those cases became the law of the land. As a consequence, the real question in this case is whether today\u2019s majority has justified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>its decision with the extraordinary showing that this Court has consistently demanded before overruling precedent. In my view, the majority has not come close to making such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">As aptly stated by Justice Marshall in another context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">The overruling of one of this Court\u2019s precedents ought to be a matter of great moment and consequence. Although the doctrine of stare decisis is not an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d <em>Burnet v Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co, </em>285 US 393, 405 [52 S Ct 443; 76 L Ed 815] (1932) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting), this Court has repeatedly stressed that fidelity to precedent is fundamental to \u201ca society governed by the rule of law,\u201d <em>Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc, </em>462 US 416, 420 [103 S Ct 2481; 76 L Ed 2d 687] (1983). See generally <em>Patterson v McLean Credit Union, </em>491 US 164, 172 [109 S Ct 2363; 105 L Ed 2d 132] (1989) (\u201c[I]t is indisputable that stare decisis is a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon \u2018an arbitrary discretion.\u2019 The Federalist, No. 78, p 490 [H. Lodge ed. 1888] [A. Hamilton]\u201d); <em>Appeal of Concerned Corporators of Portsmouth Savings Bank, </em>129 NH 183, 227; 525 A2d 671, 701 (1987) (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201c[S]tare decisis ... \u2018is essential if case-by-case judicial decision-making is to be reconciled with the principle of the rule of law, for when governing legal standards are open to revision in every case, deciding cases becomes a mere exercise of judicial will, with arbitrary and unpredictable results,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Thornburgh v American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, </em>476 US 747, 786-787 [106 S Ct 2169; 90 L Ed 2d 779] [1986] [White, J., dissenting]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Consequently, this Court has never departed from precedent without \u201cspecial justification.\u201d <em>Arizona v Rumsey, </em>467 US 203, 212 [104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164] (1984).

What has changed since this Court decided <em>Fiser, Rogers, </em>and <em>Dedes </em>is not the law, not the circumstances, but the makeup of the Court, itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In <em>Rogers v Detroit, </em>this Court revisited its decision in <em>Fiser v Ann Arbor </em>and reaffirmed the principle that a plaintiff may recover from the government for injuries caused by individuals fleeing police officers. The plaintiff must show that a police pursuit constituted negligent operation of a police vehicle. As evidenced by the differing opinions written by members of this Court, the decision was arrived at after consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>erable deliberation and debate. Now, a new majority has decided that <em>Fiser </em>\u201chas fallen victim to a subsequent change in the law, that <em>Rogers </em>reflects a misunderstanding of the statute that establishes the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The majority reasons that <em>Fiser </em>has not been good law since 1984, when we decided <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984). <em>Ross, </em>it concludes, requires a narrow reading of the motor vehicle exception. <em>Ante, </em>p 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, <em>Fiser </em>did not fall \u201cvictim to a subsequent change in the law.\u201d Instead, it has fallen victim to a change in this Court. In <em>Rogers, </em>we explicitly considered the defendants\u2019 argument that <em>Fiser </em>was overruled sub silentio by <em>Ross, supra. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">The contention that <em>Fiser </em>was overruled misapprehends the meaning of <em>Ross. </em>The \u201cdiscretionaiy/ministerial\u201d test of <em>Ross </em>applied only to the common-law liability of individual employees, not to the statutory liability of governmental agencies. <em>Ross </em>held that neither that decision nor MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) detracts from a city\u2019s liability under MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105), as applied to police pursuits in <em>Fiser. Ross, supra </em>at 591, 593-594, 620-622.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">We find that <em>Ross </em>could not and did not overrule <em>Fiser. </em>Thus, we conclude that <em>Fiser </em>remains good law in Michigan .... <em>[Rogers, supra </em>at 140-141.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The majority adopts Justice Taylor\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Rogers. </em>It now maintains that a police officer\u2019s pursuit is comprised of two parts: 1) the decision to pursue and 2) the officer\u2019s physical handling of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>In <em>Rogers, </em>we explicitly stated that the officer\u2019s decision to commence or continue a pursuit could provide a basis for a finding of liability under MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105). <em>Id. </em>at 145-146. The decisions to pursue, to continue pursuit, and the officer\u2019s actions while pursuing are so intertwined that they provide a jury with no rational means of distinguishing among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The majority ignores the fact that an officer\u2019s decision to operate a vehicle at breakneck speed is made simultaneously with the continuing decision to pursue the suspect. Moreover, other investigative measures often can be used in preference to high speed pursuits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Police officers should seriously consider these measures in the interest of avoiding the injury or death of innocent persons. It is sometimes better to let a suspect go than to endanger the Uves of innocents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Although certain drivers operate their motor vehicles without careful thought, I doubt that the Legislature perceived that police officers routinely do so while in high speed pursuit through residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>streets. Forcing the jury to sift through the wreckage to find such a distinction defies practical workability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Likewise, the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \u2018resulting from\u2019 language\u201d does not encompass injuries sustained when the fleeing driver\u2019s vehicle is not hit or otherwise forced off the road or into another vehicle or object by the pursuing police vehicle challenges common sense. <em>Ante, </em>p 457. It illustrates how the majority ignores the factual complexities underlining police chases.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">For example, the majority\u2019s premise fails to take into consideration a situation in which a police car forces an innocent intervening car to \u201chit\u201d the fleeing vehicle. There, the fleeing driver\u2019s vehicle is not hit or otherwise forced off the road or into another vehicle or object <em>by the pursuing police vehicle. </em>Under the majority\u2019s analysis, the government escapes liability simply because the fleeing car was hit by a vehicle other than the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">I also note that the Legislature\u2019s deliberate inaction on this subject supports our previous decisions. As <em>Rogers </em>observed, the Legislature has demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>awareness of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fiser. </em>When it chose to amend the governmental immunity act in 1986, it retained unmodified the provisions that were at issue in <em>Fiser. </em>Thus, I continue to adhere to this Court\u2019s <em>Rogers </em>decision, because I believe that <em>Rogers </em>supports legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Added to the unworkability of its new test to determine whether police officers\u2019 actions allow recovery under MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105), the majority provides a new hurdle for injured innocent third parties. By overruling <em>Dedes v Asch, supra, </em>today\u2019s majority ignores established proximate causation principles and effectively negates the legislative mandate that fault be determined individually with respect to each contributor to a plaintiff\u2019s injuries. MCL 600.6304(1); MSA 27A.6304(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Given that the majority has forced this Court to revisit <em>Bedes, </em>I would affirm our decision in that case.

The defendants contend that because \u201cthe\u201d is a definite article while \u201ca\u201d is usually indefinite, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cthe\u201d preceding \u201cproximate cause\u201d demonstrates a clear intent to limit liability to only those circumstances in which the defendant is the sole proximate cause. This plain meaning argument is buttressed by authority from this Court that recognizes a distinction between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>use of \u201ca proximate cause\u201d versus \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d in jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">The source of the surface appeal of the argument is an instructional issue involving proximate cause, of which the practicing bar is acutely aware. However, it cannot be safely assumed that every courtroom connotation is a part of the legislative culture. While to lawyers the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d implies \u201csole cause\u201d heresy, it is incorrect to conclude that therefore \u201cthe\u201d means sole. \u201cThe\u201d cause language is inappropriate because \u201cthe\u201d is ambiguous and might be understood by the jury to mean either \u201ca\u201d cause or the \u201csole\u201d cause. Thus, where the proofs raise a question regarding whether more than one party\u2019s negligence caused the injury, and the jury is not instructed that there can be more than one proximate cause, reference to \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d proximate cause is instructional error. As we observed in <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 607; 256 NW2d 400 (1977):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOl\">\u201cWhile it is true that the instructions might have been interpreted to mean a proximate cause, it is also equally true that the jury might have contemplated otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asf\">Moreover, where used to describe the cause in fact of the injury, \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d are interchangeable and \u201cthe\u201d does not mean \u201csole.\u201d As noted by the author of the Restatement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201cIn many cases the question before the court is whether the actor\u2019s negligence was in fact the cause of the other\u2019s harm\u2014that is, whether it had any effect in producing it\u2014or whether it was the result of some other cause, the testimony making it clear that it must be one or the other, and that the harm is not due to the combined effects of both.\u201d [Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 431, comment b, p 429. Emphasis added.] <em>(Dedes, supra </em>at 105-107.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">I continue to find our <em>Bedes </em>rationale persuasive, given the lack of any legislative suggestion of an intent to abolish the long-recognized and fundamental tenet of tort law that \u201c[t]here may be more than one proximate cause for the same injury, and the mere fact that some other cause co-operates with the negligence of the defendant to produce the injuiy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>which suit is brought does not relieve him from liability.\u201d <em>Camp v Wilson, </em>258 Mich 38, 42; 241 NW 844 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The majority contends that <em>Stoll v Laubengayer</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>over eighty-five years ago defined proximate cause as \u201cthe immediate efficient, direct cause preceding the injury.\u201d However, as we noted in <em>Hagerman v Gencorp </em>Automotive,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cthat was merely one of several definitions considered in <em>Stoll, </em>and the rule to be gleaned from that case is that proximate cause is a case-by-case analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">As we stated in <em>Hagerman, </em>this analysis has developed over time to our present understanding of concurrent proximate causation, consistent with the statutory enactment of comparative fault. <em>Hagerman, supra </em>at 732. Thus, not only may there be more than one proximate cause of an injury, but, where there is, the negligent wrongdoer\u2019s behavior may be referred to as \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201c[T]here may be two or more concurrent and directly cooperative and efficient proximate causes of an injury. Negligence which was operative at the time an injury was inflicted may constitute the proximate cause of the injury and be actionable, notwithstanding it concurred with the act of a third person to produce the injury.\u201d <em>[Brackins v Olympia, Inc, </em>316 Mich 275, 281; 25 NW2d 197 (1946) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Thus, as we so aptly stated in <em>Hagerman, </em>construing the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d to require one cause contradicts our longstanding recognition of the fact that \u201cthere may be two or more concurrent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>directly cooperative and efficient proximate causes of an injury.\u201d <em>Hagerman, supra </em>at 733. We have neither a textual nor an historical basis on which to find that the Legislature intended we construe MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c) to require only one cause. This is particularly significant given the common law\u2019s established recognition of concurrent proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, this tenet is to be abolished. In its place appears a rule relieving a government employee of all liability for negligence if another tortfeasor is negligent, however slightly, as long as the other\u2019s negligence is later. The net effect of today\u2019s decision is to deny innocent victims of police car chases recovery for their injuries. Applying its rationale, the pursuing police officer will never be the only proximate cause of an injury to an innocent passenger. If a vehicle is fleeing the police, its driver will always be a wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The holding in effect revives the doctrine of contributory negligence with respect to government employees. As Justice Boyle noted, \u201cIt defies common sense and the responsible exercise of our authority to conclude that the Legislature would have provided protection tantamount to eliminating liability without having commented on it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Dedes, supra </em>at 115. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>There are no grounds to believe that the statute intended absolute immunity for the actions of police officers when chasing fleeing vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Moreover, MCL 600.6304(1); MSA 27A.6304(1), as amended by 1995 PA 249, provides additional support for the correctness of our decision in <em>Dedes. </em>This provision states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">In an action based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death involving fault of more than 1 person, including third-party defendants and nonparties, the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">(b) The percentage of the total fault of all persons that contributed to the death or injury ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Surely, had the Legislature intended to exempt government tortfeasors and enact a separate standard of proximate causation with respect to them, it would have included it in this recently amended section. The language of this section makes clear that all tortfeasors, whether government agents \u00f3r not, shall be subject to the same standards for purposes of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>This reasoning is consistent with Justice Boyle\u2019s opinion in <em>Dedes, </em>our opinion in <em>Rogers, </em>and common-law principles of proximate causation. A police officer\u2019s negligence need not be the only or most direct proximate cause of an injury in order to allow recovery. The majority\u2019s decision to overturn this Court\u2019s well-reasoned precedent and reinstate contributory negligence by judicial fiat is mistaken and unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In her concurrence, Justice Corrigan attempts to defend the majority\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedents. She protests that the majority is only righting the wrongs perpetrated by previous members of this Court. An examination of the justifications offered by the majority in defense of its disregard for precedent reveals that these protests ring hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In <em>People v Graves,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Justice Taylor acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">It is true of course that we do not lightly overrule a case. This Court has stated on many occasions that \u201c[u]nder the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d [Quoting <em>People v Jamieson, </em>436 Mich 61, 79; 461 NW2d 884 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In this case, instead of determining whether <em>Fiser </em>and <em>Rogers </em>were \u201cdeliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d Justice TAYLOR first uses the dictionary to define the term \u201cresulting from.\u201d But instead of analyzing whether plaintiffs\u2019 injuries resulted from defendant\u2019s action, he merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>concludes that \u201cplaintiffs cannot satisfy the \u2018resulting from\u2019 language of the statute where the pursuing police vehicle did not hit the fleeing car or otherwise physically force it off the road or into another vehicle or object.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The doctrine of stare decisis does \u201capply with full force to decisions construing statutes or ordinances . . . .\u201d <em>Boyd v WG Wade Shows, Inc, </em>443 Mich 515, 525; 505 NW2d 544 (1993). The wisdom of this rule becomes apparent when members of this Court apply contrived meanings to the language of statutes instead of using accepted legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The majority also infuses public policy into its reading of the motor vehicle exception, despite its own oft-repeated admonitions that this Court may not consider public policy when interpreting the plain language of a statute. Clearly, the motor vehicle exception allows plaintiffs to recover when government entities negligently operate a motor vehicle. MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996(105). The exception says nothing about the duty of police officers to apprehend criminal suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In fact, the Legislature has made it clear that emergency vehicles may exceed posted speed limits <em>only </em>in a manner that will not endanger \u201clife or property.\u201d MCL 257.603(3)(c); MSA 9.2303(3)(c). But the majority insists that the police officer\u2019s duty to apprehend criminal suspects conflicts with (1) plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover under these circumstances, and (2) the police officer\u2019s duty not to endanger innocent lives when deciding to pursue a criminal suspect. <em>Ante, </em>p 457. But where does the language of either the motor vehicle exception or MCL 257.603(3)(c); MSA 9.2303(3)(c) address the duty to apprehend criminal suspects? It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>does not. The majority simply places a higher premium on this consideration, to the derogation of the explicit intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Moreover, not all the cases in which this majority disposed of prior precedent involved statutory construction. In <em>Ritchie-Gamester v </em>Berkley,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it overruled Fe<em>lgner v </em>Anderson<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>Williams v Wood.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These cases held that, for injuries arising from recreational activities, the proper standard is that of ordinary care. The majority substituted a new standard, reckless misconduct, on the basis of arguments that it made more \u201ccommon-sense,\u201d and that other states have adopted a similar rule. <em>Ritchie-Gamester, supra </em>at 89. The majority also stated that it sought to \u201cencourage[] vigorous participation in recreational activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It did so without consideration of whether the rule Michigan courts had applied during the preceding sixty years had dampened participation in recreational activities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Finally, Justice Corrigan chastises Justice Cavanagh because, in his dissenting statement to the order granting leave in this case, he refers to Justice Brickley\u2019s past service to this Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I believe that, in so doing, she clouds the real issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>I read Justice Cavanagh\u2019s statement as pointing out that the remaining four justices acted together in all of the six listed occasions. Justice Brickley\u2019s contributing vote did not change the fact that the remaining members of the Court always acted together. Justice Cavanagh\u2019s separate footnote to Justice Brickley\u2019s jurisprudential standards clarified his belief that the latter\u2019s record in opposition to overturning precedent extended far beyond the instant cases. Hence, his decision to join the majority on some occasions was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Justice Corrigan misconstrues Justice Cavanagh\u2019s obvious intent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In his dissenting statement, Justice Cavanagh referred to the collective conscience of the majority and its seeming compulsion to act without judicial reserve to nullify past decisions. The majority has affirmatively changed the law, whether through disagreement with the lead opinion in plurality decisions, by expressly overruling precedent, or by forging paths around well-established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Justice Corrigan argues that Justice Brickley\u2019s actual voting record disproves \u201c[t]he claims that the majority lacks respect for the doctrine of stare deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>sis . . . <em>Ante, </em>p 470, n 1. However, to find support for my concerns, I need go no further than the majority\u2019s opinion in this case. In it, three opinions of this Court are discarded in favor of a strained and erroneous interpretation of the statute involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The majority\u2019s casual disregard for this Court\u2019s past opinions suggests to future courts that they do the same and creates instability in the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The reasons proffered to overrule <em>Dedes, Rogers, </em>and <em>Fiser </em>are based solely on the majority\u2019s subjective, contrived interpretation of the statutes involved. For instance, the Legislature has stated that eveiy time a statute refers to something in the singular, it may be read, also, to mean the plural. MCL 8.3b; MSA 2.212(2). Yet, in a statute where the Legislature referred to one or \u201cthe\u201d proximate cause, the majority refuses to include several proximate causes, thereby finding the need to overrule <em>Dedes. Ante, </em>p 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In this decision, the majority exposes itself to criticism that it picks and chooses when to apply its preferred principles of statutory interpretation. Here, it has overruled past decisions of this Court because it claims that past Courts have not interpreted the statute involved properly. It acclaims the virtues of giving statutory language its \u201cplain meaning.\u201d But is has given its own meaning to the expression \u201cresulting from,\u201d rather than using the plain meaning. Similarly, it admonishes us not to infuse public policy into the plain language of the Legislature, but proceeds to do so here in reaching its interpretation of the statute. As a consequence of this selective use of preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>principles of statutory interpretation, the majority arrives at the conclusion that <em>Fiser </em>and <em>Rogers </em>must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The majority fails to convince me that <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Fiser </em>erroneously interpreted the motor vehicle exception to government immunity. It must be reiterated that it has eliminated these rulings without making the extraordinary showing that this Court has consistently demanded before overruling established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In the majority\u2019s race to overrule precedent, it establishes a rule that will likely yield unconscionable results. Its new \u201cproximate cause\u201d language provides little motivation for police departments to promulgate and enforce coherent rules concerning police chases. There is little incentive for police officers to adhere carefully to such rules, where they exist. A police officer could claim not to be the most direct proximate cause of an accident arising from a police chase, no matter how outrageous the officer\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>I agree that the fleeing individuals here are responsible to a great extent for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. However, I would not join the majority in automatically holding the police officers harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Consistent with <em>Dedes </em>and <em>Rogers, </em>I would remand to the trial court for a factual determination of the extent of fault, if any, attributable to the defendant officers.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-8\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> Although no duty is owed to wrongdoers in a fleeing vehicle, it does not follow that summary disposition should be granted in a broad range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>circumstances. At some point, a determination must be made whether wrongdoing occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">2 In his dissenting statement accompanying the supplemental briefing order in this case, Justice Cavanagh pointed out that <em>Rogers </em>was decided only fourteen months ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">Stare decisis, of course, is hardly a handcuff enfeebling us from responding to the changes that inevitably occur over time.

Other options include the use of air support and photographic evidence to identify the perpetrator.

All these purposes were noted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>commented on as the bill moved through the legislative process and took its final form. The construction of proximate cause advanced by the defendants and adopted by the majority will enormously limit that liability, much more than the gross negligence standard adopted by the Legislature.

He concurred separately in both <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484; 596 NW2d 607 (1999), and <em>Ritchie-Gamester v City of Berkley, supra. </em>Even if Justice Corrigan is not specific with reference to Justice Brickley\u2019s decisions, it is clear that he was part of the majority in four, rather than five, of the aforementioned cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> Of course, this presumes that the fleeing driver\u2019s vehicle is not hit or otherwise forced off the road or onto another vehicle or object by the pursuing police officer.

However, the majority having taken the opportunity, quite properly, to respond to the dissent, I offer a few brief words of my own in response to the wonderfully defensive concurrence. The concurrence\u2019s uncontrolled compulsion to respond to a 1999 statement, and its efforts to reargue the merits of decided cases evidence its perceived shortcomings of the rationale already provided by the majority in these cases. Despite the concurrence\u2019s proclamations about the importance of legitimacy and continuity in the law, the concurrence fails to adequately justify this Court\u2019s recent routine practice of ignoring precedent and overruling our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">I cannot disagree more with the concurrence that today\u2019s decision \u201crestores judicial legitimacy by overruling decisions that wrongly usurped the power of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 474. To suggest that legitimacy has been restored is to suggest that legitimacy had been lost. One need only review the decisions cast aside by today\u2019s decision in order to discover that they were firmly rooted in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Although the concurrence provides an explanation for the Court\u2019s recent track record, it provides no justification. I take comfort in the fact that anyone who reads the concurrence with a critical eye will be led back to the cases cited. The criticisms of the majority opinions in the cited cases will not soon be erased.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>It is unclear exactly how the concurring opinion relates to the merits of the present cases. Rather, the concurrence latches onto a new discussion as a means for rehashing a tangential debate. Yet, paranoia about how a prior debate has been viewed is not a sufficient basis for injecting that former debate into a subsequent phase of this case. Although I could offer further explanations for my dissenting statement from the resubmission order in this case, 461 Mich 1201-1204 (1999), I disagree that this is the time to debate a dissent that focused on whether this Court should manufacture issues to be briefed. Rather, this is the time to decide the issues argued. Thankfully, the majority and dissent have done so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\"> For an explanation on the merits, see the dissenting opinions in <em>McDougall v Schanz/Sobran v McKendrick, </em>461 Mich 15, 38; 597 NW2d 148 (1999) (pointing out an unconstitutional legislative usurpation of judicial power); <em>People v Lukity, </em>460 Mich 484, 504; 596 NW2d 607 (1999) (arguing that <em>People v Gearns, </em>457 Mich 170; 577 NW2d 422 [1998], rather than the majority opinion, was true to MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096). In <em>People v Kazmierczak, </em>461 Mich 411; 605 NW2d 667 (2000), the dissent pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>vides an explanation why <em>People v Taylor, </em>454 Mich 580; 564 NW2d 24 (1997), was not \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d as the concurrence asserts. <em>Ante </em>at 472. The <em>Kazm/ierczak </em>dissent amply explained why <em>Taylor </em>could be applied, and cautioned against overruling precedent unnecessarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
