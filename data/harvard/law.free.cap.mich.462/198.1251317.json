In light of our recent decision in <em>Grievance Administra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>tor v Lopatin, </em>462 Mich 235; 612 NW2d 120 (2000), adopting on an interim basis the American Bar Association\u2019s (aba) standards for imposing lawyer sanctions, we remand this matter to the Attorney Discipline Board (adb) for a determination of the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Respondent Arnold Fink was an attorney with the Lopatin, Miller law firm. He gave partner Sheldon Miller a stock tip. Respondent did not inform Miller that he made a commission on Miller\u2019s purchase of the stock. The investment performed poorly.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Miller filed an action against respondent for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the stock purchase. After a contentious September 12, 1991, motion hearing, Miller told respondent that he was fired. Respondent nonetheless returned to work to prepare for an out-of-state deposition scheduled for the next day. When Miller returned to the office, he allegedly choked respondent and threatened to kill him. Miller rescinded the termination and respondent continued working with the firm until January, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Miller was charged in Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court in connection with this assault and entered a guilty plea, but it was taken under advisement. The criminal charges were ultimately dismissed. The Grievance Administrator filed a formal complaint against Miller for the assault, but the hearing panel dismissed it, finding it to be \u201cwithout credible factual basis.\u201d No petition for review was filed with the adb.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The present charges arise out of a deposition of Miller, held on August 8, 1995. Respondent, representing himself, was questioning Miller. There was a good deal of friction between respondent and Miller. The deposition fell apart with the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Q. </em>[By respondent, representing himself] So if Arnold Fink told you that Share Data would be bought at two dollars a share, and now you go ahead and enter into an entirely different purchase, how is it that you\u2019re blaming Mr. Fink?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\"><em>A. </em>[by Miller] Read my complaint, Mr. Fink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\"><em>Q. </em>Sir, how is it you\u2019re blaming Mr. Fink. Answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\"><em>A. </em>Because the lying stinking son-of-a-b_took a kick-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">back of three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, that\u2019s how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\"><em>Q. </em>Sit the f_down. Don\u2019t you raise your voice at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\"><em>A. </em>You asked a question; you got the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\"><em>Q. </em>Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\"><em>A. </em>Tell me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\"><em>Q. </em>Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\"><em>Mr. Schwartz </em>[Miller\u2019s attorney]: Gentlemen, gentlemen\u2014come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\"><em>Q. </em>I\u2019ll tear your f_ing head off. Sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\"><em>A. </em>Oh, come on, come on, threaten me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-17\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: </em>Stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-18\"><em>A. </em>Oh, come on, threaten me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-19\"><em>Q. </em>You\u2019re\u2014all right, that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-20\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: </em>Call the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-21\"><em>Q. </em>You c_-sucker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-22\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: </em>Call the police. Get out of here. Stop it. Both of you stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-23\">[Off the record.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-24\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: </em>This deposition is over. That\u2019s it. I want a record. The deposition is over. Mr. Fink came around the table to where Mr. Miller was. Mr. Fink attacked Mr. Miller. Mr. Fink choked Mr. Miller and shoved him to the ground, knocking over the chair that Mr. Miller was on . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-25\"><em>Mr. Fink: </em>Yeah right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-26\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: . . . </em>and he started to try to strangle Mr. Miller. I tried to separate . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-27\"><em>Mr. Fink: </em>In your dreams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-28\"><em>Mr. Schwartz: . . . </em>them and he refused to get off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Mr. Fink: </em>In your dreams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Respondent later testified about this incident. He explained that Miller, who enjoyed a clear size advantage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cursed at him and stood and leaned over the table during the deposition. Respondent acknowledged that he \u201cjust lost it\u201d and \u201ccame around the table and shoved [Miller].\u201d He disagreed with Schwartz\u2019s description of the events as set forth in the transcript. Respondent testified that he shoved Miller and that Miller went over the chair, but that he did not hit, strangle, or choke Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Respondent was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery for this conduct. On April 10, 1996, he pleaded guilty to this charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was fined, placed on probation, and was required to perform community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In August 1996, the Grievance Administrator filed the judgment of conviction. The hearing panel initially issued an order of dismissal on December 12, 1996. On July 30, 1997, the adb issued an order of remand for a hearing in accordance with <em>Grievance Administrator v Deutch, </em>455 Mich 149; 565 NW2d 369 (1997), which held that proceedings initiated by a valid judgment of conviction could not be dismissed. On January 15, 1998, the hearing panel issued an order imposing no discipline. It noted respondent\u2019s testimony admitting the altercation and explaining that \u201cthere had been a long history of acrimony preceding the deposition and that Mr. Miller had threatened him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in the past.\u201d It noted that respondent denied that he had choked Miller or shoved him to the ground (as Miller\u2019s attorney stated in the deposition transcript). It also noted that respondent had two prior disciplines, but that neither involved assaultive behavior. It then concluded that no discipline was warranted for the following reasons: the exchange of insults and scuffle at the deposition were remote to the administration of justice, respondent\u2019s misconduct appeared to have been provoked by Miller, the conduct of respondent and Miller had been \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d and the misconduct was \u201cin the nature of a personal lapse of control by two lawyers . . . who should have known better . . . .\u201d Further, the panel stated that it might have decided otherwise if \u201cthe misconduct had occurred in open court or before non-lawyer clients, or resulted in physical injury, or led to a conviction for felonious assault.\u201d Finally, it stated that it thought the limited resources of those involved in discipline should be expended in areas other than personal transgressions \u201cnot involving lawyer-client relationships or adversely impacting the decorum of the courts or of the legal profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On November 6, 1998, the adb vacated the hearing panel\u2019s order and issued an order of reprimand. It deferred to the hearing panel\u2019s assessment of respondent\u2019s credibility and demeanor and its acceptance of his version of the incident. After noting that both respondent and Miller acted in a \u201cchildish, pugnacious, and unprofessional manner,\u201d it concluded that respondent \u201cescalated the dispute from verbal sparring to physical contact . . . .\u2019\u2019It opined that provocation does not excuse and only rarely mitigates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>gross incivility such as what occurred here. The adb held in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">[T]here is sufficient evidence to convince us that discipline is warranted. Respondent admittedly \u201clost it.\u201d Also, respondent\u2019s testimony establishes that he could have retreated from the room had he truly felt threatened. Finally, the argument that no discipline in this case is necessary to balance the ledger also fails. Respondent and Miller may despise each other, but they are attorneys and they have an obligation to refrain from interfering with the administration of justice. We are not persuaded that Fink can shove Miller at a deposition because Miller may have escaped discipline for allegedly similar conduct four years prior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">We have concluded that the imposition of discipline is clearly required in this case. However, we also conclude that a reprimand is appropriate under all of the circumstances. Respondent has engaged in a lengthy career with no record of this type of behavior. This singular, short-lived incident occurred in a case in which respondent was the defendant. His status as a party does not excuse his behavior; an attorney must abide by his or her obligations as an officer of the court even if he or she is also the client. However, respondent may not have fully appreciated how difficult it would be to represent himself in the litigation with Miller. Apparently, respondent did learn this lesson as no other incidents were reported.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">In an appropriate case, we will not hesitate to impose a suspension for an attorney\u2019s assaultive conduct, particularly that which arises out of the performance of lawyering functions. However, assessing all of the facts here, we conclude that a reprimand fully achieves the objectives of the discipline system. There is no evidence of injury to Mr. Miller or of a pattern of similar incidents. Respondent presents no discemable risk to the public, the courts, or the legal profession in light of the unique circumstances giving rise to this incident.

For all these reasons, the adb vacated the hearing panel\u2019s order imposing no discipline and reprimanded respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">When the ADB issued this order, it did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s guidance in <em>Lopatin, supra, </em>regarding the use of the aba standards for imposing lawyer sanctions. We accordingly remand this matter to the adb for application of the aba standards. Because this is among the first cases requiring application of the aba standards, we draw the adb\u2019s attention to standard 5.12, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in criminal conduct which does not contain the elements listed in Standard 5.11 [which focuses on dishonesty] and that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The commentary to this section states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">Although a lawyer is personally answerable to the entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for offenses that indicate lack of those characteristics relevant to law practice. Offenses involving <em>violence, </em>dishonesty, or breach of trust, or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">This appears to be the standard applicable to the type of conduct at issue. As we explained in <em>Lopatin, supra </em>at 240:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">[A]fter determining the recommended sanction, the disciplinary body moves to the third step of the analysis and considers the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>On review of these factors, it then decides whether to increase or decrease the sanction. Aba Standard 9.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In the course of deciding the appropriate sanction in a particular case, the ADB is to delineate any aggravating and mitigating factors and explain the effect of such factors on the sanction recommended by the applicable ABA standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In accordance with <em>Lopatin, </em>we remand this matter to the adb for reconsideration of the appropriate level of discipline in light of the ABA standards.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-8\">Weaver, C.J., and Corrigan, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b363-9\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> Respondent testified that Miller is about 6' 1\", 200-210 lbs, while respondent is 5' 8\" and about 155 lbs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\"> The judgment of sentence indicates that he pleaded guilty.
