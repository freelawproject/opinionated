In addition, the respondent claims that the court improperly prevented her from questioning Jordan\u2019s foster parent concerning the future contact between Jordan and her biological family in the event that the court terminated the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The department of children and families (department) first became involved with Jordan after the respondent confessed to police that she had participated in the armed robbery of a Burger King restaurant. The respondent reported later that she had been intoxicated at the time and had been coaxed into participating by her boyfriend at the time. The respondent was arrested and taken into custody on December 30,2006. Following her arrest, the respondent remained incarcerated between December, 2006, and April, 2007, when she posted bond and was released pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">At the time of the respondent\u2019s arrest, she told the police about Jordan, who was then in the care of her maternal grandmother. The police notified the department, which invoked a ninety-six hour hold; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g; after determining that the grandmother was not an appropriate placement due to her history of substantiated abuse and neglect allegations. The court granted an order of temporary custody to the petitioner on January 3, 2007. The department placed Jordan in a foster home, where she resided through the time of trial. Jordan was adjudicated neglected and committed to the care of the petitioner on March 22, 2007, and specific steps were implemented for the respondent to be reunified with Jordan.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">While released on bond, the respondent worked on achieving the specific steps put in place for her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the department\u2019s plan for Jordan was reunification. The respondent found full-time employment and a suitable housing arrangement for herself and Jordan. Additionally, the respondent completed parenting education courses and began outpatient mental health and substance abuse counseling. The respondent visited with Jordan as often as possible, and she acted appropriately during those visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In November, 2007, the respondent pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), and, on January 11, 2008, she was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifty-five months, with three years of probation. She began serving her sentence in January, 2008. Following the respondent\u2019s incarceration, the petitioner changed her permanency plan to termination of parental rights and filed a petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights. The petitioner alleged as grounds for termination that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and had abandoned Jordan within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (A). Following trial on the petition, on December 4, 2008, the court issued its memorandum of decision finding that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. The court did not reach the alleged ground of abandonment. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>dispositional phase, the court found that it was in Jordan\u2019s best interest to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The respondent first claims that the court improperly determined (1) that she failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation and (2) that termination is in Jordan\u2019s best interest. The respondent argues that the evidence in the record does not support the court\u2019s determinations. We disagree and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 17a-l 12, a hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more of the four grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 [j] exists by clear and convincing evidence. The commissioner ... in petitioning to terminate those rights, must allege and prove one or more of the statutory grounds. In contrast to custody proceedings ... in termination proceedings the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun. . . . Section [17a-112 (j)] carefully sets out . . . [the] situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute countervailing interests sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">\u201cIf the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the disposi-tional phase. During the dispositional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 688-89, 741 A.2d 873, reargument denied, 251 Conn. 924, 742 A.2d 364 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">We first address the respondent\u2019s claim that the court improperly terminated her parental rights on the ground that she had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. The respondent argues that the evidence did not support this determination and that the only basis for the finding was her incarceration. The court found that she substantially complied with the specific steps ordered on March 22, 2007, and she argues that this court should hold that incarceration alone cannot be sufficient to prove failure to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation, analogous to the rule that incarceration alone cannot satisfy the burden of proof for abandonment. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>181 Conn. 638, 645, 436 A.2d 290 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The court appointed David Mantell, a psychologist, to evaluate the respondent and Jordan and to present his expert opinion to the court. After the parties stipulated to his expertise as a clinical psychologist specializing in forensic evaluations in the area of child custody and family permanency, Mantell testified extensively concerning his evaluation and opinion of the respondent and Jordan. He testified that he would not recommend placement of Jordan with the respondent immediately following her release from prison and estimated that she would need to prove her reliability as a resource for at least one year upon her release. He also testified that the respondent had a history of parent-child relational problems with her own parents, an adult relational problem associated with her two most recent romantic partners, a history of alcohol abuse, antisocial behavior in committing the act of robbery and an adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features, including some depression, anxiety and paranoia.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">There was extensive testimony concerning Jordan\u2019s difficulty visiting the respondent in prison. A social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>worker, Lauren Delaney, assigned to the case by the department, testified that the department had been offering monthly visitation in prison, which had begun to be difficult for Jordan. Specifically, Delaney stated that after a visit in July, 2008, \u201cit took Jordan about three or four weeks to recover from that visit. . . . [S]he was waking up . . . screaming during the middle of the night, crying. She was asking to stay in the home forever and to never leave. . . . She had started wetting the bed overnight. She was aggressive at school.\u201d Delaney also described various strategies employed by the department in conjunction with the respondent and the foster parent to help Jordan with her anxieties related to visiting the respondent in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Delaney testified that the prison setting and missing the respondent were partly the cause of Jordan\u2019s negative reactions to the visits. Mantell agreed that the prison setting would be difficult for a child to adjust to, and he also testified that Jordan\u2019s negative reactions to the prison visits could be attributed to a decreasing ability to wait for reunification. He testified that these negative reactions might, in another context, necessitate immediate reunification, but noted that that solution was not available here. He also testified that, absent some other cause, Jordan\u2019s negative reactions to the visits strengthened his recommendation that she remain in the care of the foster mother and also may necessitate decreasing visitation with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Following the trial, the court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that, on the date the petition for termination was filed, the respondent \u201cwas unable to satisfy even the minimal essential obligations of parenthood. . . . This inability to meet her parental obligations is largely a function of her incarceration. But it is also a function of \u2018psychological conflicts, social adjustment problems, alcohol abuse and probable dependency, and probably also adjustment problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>with depressed and anxious features, which have combined to cause her very substantial difficulties, dislocations and repeated disappointments,\u2019 as . . . Mantell noted.\u201d The court further noted that the respondent\u2019s \u201cmultitude of unresolved childhood handicaps, her history of inappropriate male relationships, her unacknowledged issues with alcohol, her criminal conduct, which resulted in her incarceration, and her inability to meet her parental responsibilities,\u201d provided the basis for its decision that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Our standard of review is well established. \u201c[W]e review a trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to rehabilitate herself in accordance with the rules that apply generally to a trier\u2019s finding of fact. We will overturn such a finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. . . . [G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [0]n review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 705-706.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Section 17a-112 (j) provides in relevant part that the court may grant a petition for termination of parental rights \u201cif it finds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . (B) the child . . . has been found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding . . . and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent . . . and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cPersonal rehabilitation, as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent. . . . [Section 17a-112] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent\u2019s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and farther, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time.\u201d (Intemal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The respondent argues that the evidence does not support the conclusions made by the court concerning her \u201cchildhood handicaps\u201d because her parenting up to the time of her incarceration had not been impacted by these challenges. The respondent refers to testimony by Delaney that the department would not have become involved with the family had it not been for the respondent\u2019s commission of the robbery. The court, however, made no finding concerning the suitability of the respondent\u2019s parenting prior to the removal of Jordan from her care, and any evidence suggesting that the department would never have become involved would be purely speculative. The court did find that \u201c[l]ittle information is available to [the department] about [the respondent\u2019s] parenting between the child\u2019s birth in August, 2005, and the child\u2019s removal in December, 2006. The child did become very closely bonded with [the respondent] and with the extended family, especially [the respondent\u2019s] younger sister.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Even if we assume that the respondent had been appropriate in her parenting prior to her arrest, the court considered what impact her unresolved mental health issues had on the likelihood that she would achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation quickly enough to maintain a permanent and stable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>parenting role in Jordan\u2019s life. The court relied on the opinion of Mantell in reaching the conclusion that the respondent had unresolved mental health issues owing to her own difficult childhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The respondent also argues that there was no evidence suggesting that she had used alcohol during the time she was released on bond, which would undermine the court\u2019s reliance on her unwillingness to receive treatment for alcohol dependence. The court made no finding concerning the respondent\u2019s use of alcohol during the several months she was released on bond,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it did address the unwillingness of the respondent to engage in treatment for alcohol dependence during that same time period and her unwillingness to admit, even when questioned at trial, that she had an alcohol abuse or dependency problem. Concerning her alcohol use, the court wrote that the respondent \u201chad given self-reports of heavy drinking in the months before the robbery. She reported that on the night of the robbeiy she was severely intoxicated by alcohol. She gave a history of blackouts from drinking earlier in her life. Based upon this information, the [Hockanum Valley Community Council, Inc. (council)] clinic physician made a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. . . . [The respondent] reported a desire to stop her alcohol use but had been unsuccessful at quitting. The doctor prescribed a drug to reduce alcohol cravings. Another [council] clinician also made a diagnosis of alcohol dependence and recommended a relapse prevention program and participation in Alcoholics Anonymous. . . . [T]he clinic notified [the department] that [the</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>respondent] had stopped taking her anticraving medication. [The respondent] reported that she does not need the medication and disagreed with the diagnosis of alcohol dependence. . . . [The respondent] testified in court on November 20, 2008, illogically persistent as it may be, that T do not have a problem with alcohol.\u2019 This denial certainly raises issues about her fitness to serve as a parent upon release from incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The court placed great emphasis on the time frame for a possible reunification between the respondent and Jordan in reaching its conclusion that the petitioner had proven that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B). It noted Mantell\u2019s assessment that the respondent would likely need one year to establish herself in the community and found that her earliest possible release date is January 11, 2010. Following her release, she would have sixty-five months of possible incarceration remaining and be under probation supervision for three years. The court further found that, at the time of trial, Jordan had already been in out of home care for nearly two years and that it would be at least another two years from the time of the court\u2019s decision, or longer, before she could be reunited with the respondent. The respondent has not attempted to argue that the court\u2019s conclusions concerning the time frame for reunification for Jordan were factually incorrect or improper under \u00a7 17a-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The court acknowledged that the department had planned to reunify the respondent with Jordan prior to the respondent\u2019s incarceration. It also addressed the reality of the respondent\u2019s incarceration, including the difficulty posed by the visitations in the prison, which the respondent had at one point agreed to stop due to the impact on Jordan. The court wrote, however, that \u201cthe respondent [mother\u2019s] incarceration, in and of itself, does not dictate the determination that [she] has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>failed to achieve rehabilitation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The respondent has asked this court to hold that incarceration alone cannot serve as the basis for a finding that a parent has failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation and argues that the court in the present case made such a finding. Upon review of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, however, we cannot conclude that incarceration was, in the present case, the sole basis for the court\u2019s conclusion, nor can we conclude that it was clearly erroneous for the court to find that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. The court centered its analysis on the respondent\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge that she had alcohol dependence, as well as on the amount of time that Jordan would be in foster care before the respondent could resume a constructive role in her life. The court relied on the evidence in the record, and despite the existence of any contrary evidence, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The respondent next argues that the court improperly determined, in the dispositional phase of the trial, that termination was in the best interest of Jordan. The respondent argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s determination that termination of her parental rights is in the best interest of Jordan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that the court had sufficient evidence on which to base its decision and, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">\u201cIn the dispositional phase of a termination of parent rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is not in the best interest of the child. In arriving at this decision, the court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding seven factors delineated in [\u00a7 17a-112 (k)]. On appeal, we will disturb the findings of the trial court in both the adjudication and disposition only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Vanna A., </em>83 Conn. App. 17, 26-27, 847 A.2d 1073 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The court properly considered and made written findings on the factors delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (k), but the respondent\u2019s argument relies on evidence in the record tending to show that Jordan misses the respondent and is sad to be separated from her. She also refers to the report of Mantell that Jordan has several psychological parents, with the respondent being the first, the maternal aunt as the second and the foster mother as the third, and argues that the fact that Jordan is more closely bonded to the respondent shows that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is not in Jordan\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Even if the evidence persuaded this court that termination was not in Jordan\u2019s best interest, it failed to convince the trial court. The court reasonably relied on contrary evidence in the record, including the testimony of Mantell. Mantell testified that none of the options available to the court were ideal and that the question of Jordan\u2019s best interest was one of minimizing harm. In light of that goal, Mantell testified that maintaining the security of Jordan\u2019s foster placement, which was likely to become her permanent adoptive home upon termination, would do less harm than waiting for the possible eventual rehabilitation of the respondent. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the court\u2019s determination of the best interest of the child was without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>support of evidence in the record. We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The respondent argues finally that the court improperly prevented her from questioning Jordan\u2019s foster mother concerning whether she would allow contact with the biological family if she adopted Jordan. The respondent characterizes the court\u2019s ruling as based on relevance, and she argues that, in light of the testimony that Jordan is strongly connected to her family, the question of whether postadoption contact would be allowed is highly relevant to the determination of Jordan\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Mantell had testified that Jordan\u2019s \u201cties to her biological family were really powerful and that she would sustain a huge loss if . . . those ties were severed.\u201d He stated that the foster parent had told him that if she adopted Jordan, she would permit \u201cstatic information exchanges in the forms of pictures and things of that sort, with no personal contacts.\u201d He speculated that the foster parent\u2019s reluctance to permit Jordan ongoing contact with her biological family could be attributed to insecurity about Jordan\u2019s affections, a desire to protect Jordan from disappointments by unreliable family members or some combination of those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Later in the proceeding, the respondent, through counsel, asked the foster mother, \u201c[I]f you did in fact adopt her, what would be your plan for Jordan\u2019s contact with her biological family?\u201d The petitioner objected, stating, in part, \u201c[T]he issue of postadoption contact is really outside of the scope of these proceedings.\u201d The court sustained the objection. The respondent then argued that the evidence of continuing ties would be relevant to the court\u2019s decision concerning Jordan\u2019s best interest in light of the testimony by Mantell about the effect it would have on Jordan to sever ties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the biological family. The court replied, \u201cI heard from . . . Mantell on that. That\u2019s why I really don\u2019t want to hear particulars from this witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">\u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing ... of substantial prejudice or injustice. . . . Additionally, it is well settled that even if the evidence was improperly admitted, the [party challenging the ruling] must also establish that the ruling was harmful and likely to affect the result of the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Anna Lee M., </em>104 Conn. App. 121, 126, 931 A.2d 949, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 939, 937 A.2d 696 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Section 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence states: \u201cRelevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or <em>needless presentation of cumulative </em>evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cEvidence is cumulative if it multiplies witnesses or documentary matter to any one or more facts that were the subject of previous proof. . . . The court\u2019s power in that area is discretionary. ... In precluding evidence solely because it is cumulative, however, the court should exercise care to avoid precluding evidence merely because of an overlap with the evidence previously admitted.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Pullman &amp; Comley, LLC, </em>88 Conn. App. 615, 627, 871 A.2d 392 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Although the department appeared to object on the basis of relevance and the court sustained the objection, the court later appeared to conclude that the proffered testimony would be cumulative of testimony already elicited from Mantell concerning the foster mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>future plans for contact between Jordan and her biological family. Although the respondent now argues on appeal that she would have gone beyond just asking about what contact would be allowed, to determine the basis for the foster mother\u2019s decision and therefore better inform the court of the possibility for Jordan to have continued contact with her biological family, no such argument was made at trial. The respondent only proffered to question the foster mother regarding her plans, and that is what the court excluded. We cannot, therefore, conclude that the court abused its discretion in excluding as cumulative the testimony by the foster mother concerning her future plans, should she adopt Jordan, for contact between Jordan and her biological family.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-14\"> The court also terminated the parental rights of Jordan\u2019s father. Because he has not appealed, we refer in this opinion to the respondent mother as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) provides for the termination of parental rights when the child \u201chas been found by the Superior Court or Probate Court, to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> As the petitioner notes, there was some evidence in the record that the respondent did continue drinking even after the robbery incident. The petitioner\u2019s exhibit A, a letter from Katherine Paquette, a social worker at Hockanum Valley Community Council, Inc., which provided counseling to the respondent, states that the respondent \u201chad continued to use alcohol intermittently despite its reported role influencing her decision to participate in the robbeiy last winter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The respondent also argues that the dispositional determination was improper because it was based on an improper determination in the adjudicatory phase. This argument has no merit because we have already affirmed the court\u2019s holding that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation under \u00a7 17a-112.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
