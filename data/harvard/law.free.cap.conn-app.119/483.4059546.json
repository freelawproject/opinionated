In docket number CR-05-128445, the defendant was convicted of attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>to commit larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 and 53a-49; identity theft in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-129b; attempt to commit illegal use of a credit card in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-128d and 53a-49; and forgery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-140. In docket number CR-05-128811, the defendant was convicted of larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124; identity theft in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-129d; illegal use of a credit card in violation of \u00a7 53a-128d; and forgery in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-140. In docket number CR-05-129108, the defendant was convicted of attempt to commit larceny in the fifth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-125a and 53a-49; attempt to commit illegal use of a credit card in violation of \u00a7 53a-128d and 53a-49; and identity theft in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-129d. In docket number CR-05-129107, the defendant was convicted of larceny in the fifth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-125a; illegal use of a credit card in violation of \u00a7 53a-128d; and identity theft in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-129d. The jury found the defendant not guilty on eight other counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant asserts that the court improperly (1) denied her motion for a mistrial, claiming that events that transpired during the trial prejudiced the jury, (2) denied her motion to proceed pro se and (3) instructed the jury about reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>a unanimous verdict. Additionally, the defendant claims that her convictions of both identity theft and illegal use of a credit card violate her constitutional right to be free of double jeopardy. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant was employed by Kate\u2019s Paperie, a paper products and gift store, between November 5, 2003, and January 24, 2004. Kate\u2019s Paperie accepted major credit cards, and store employees had access to the signed credit card receipts, which included the customer\u2019s name and full credit card account number.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In December, 2003, Pamela Williams purchased items from Kate\u2019s Paperie in Greenwich. She paid for these items by using her American Express credit card. Shortly thereafter, Williams examined her American Express monthly statement and discovered that approximately $3000 had been charged to her card by a Greenwich boutique without her knowledge or authorization. American Express investigated the charges and determined that the charges were fraudulent. Williams\u2019 credit card was deactivated and a new card using a new account number was issued to her. Using this new card, Williams made other purchases from Kate\u2019s Paperie. In March, 2005, several purchases were charged to Williams\u2019 new American Express account without her knowledge or authorization. These purchases were made online from Blissout, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Sephora USA, Inc., and The Finish Line, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">On January 20, 2005, Paul Gerst, a Federal Express employee, attempted to deliver two packages to 133 Wild Rose Drive in Orange. The packages required the addressee to sign a receipt indicating that she had received them in order for Gerst to leave them. The homeowner at 133 Wild Rose Drive was not home, so Gerst did not leave the packages. As Gerst was getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>back into his truck, the defendant came out of a neighboring house. This house was numbered 183 Wild Rose Drive. The defendant informed Gerst that the packages were misaddressed. She told him that they should have gone to her home at 183 Wild Rose Drive, not 133 Wild Rose Drive. The defendant then signed for the packages using the name \u201cS. Bosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Prior to January, 2006, John Hillgen lived at 133 Wild Rose Drive. On several occasions, packages that did not belong to him were delivered to his home. Each time Hillgen informed the sender that they had misaddressed the packages and then returned them to the sender.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Gerst was assigned to deliver another package to 183 Wild Rose Drive on March 17, 2005. This package was addressed to Pamela Williams. Williams did not reside at 183 Wild Rose Drive. Gerst was instructed by his supervisor to deliver the package to the town of Orange police department as part of an ongoing investigation. Robert Cole, a town of Orange police investigator, called the telephone number listed on the package and discovered that it belonged to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Five days later, Gerst was assigned another parcel to be delivered to 189 Wild Rose Drive. When Gerst delivered the package to the resident of 189 Wild Rose Drive, she informed him that the package did not belong to her but, rather, belonged to 183 Wild Rose Drive, the house next door. This package was addressed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">In December, 2004, Jonathan Boies and his wife, Jodie Boies, were joint users of an American Express account. On December 23 or 24, 2004, Jodie Boies used her American Express credit card at Kate\u2019s Paperie. On January 27,2005, Randy Vines, a fraud investigator from Nieman Marcus, the parent company of Bergdorf Goodman, telephoned Jonathan Boies regarding possible fraudulent purchases, in the amount of $2252, charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>to his American Express credit card and shipped to 133 Wild Rose Drive in Orange. The Boies\u2019 American Express account was used again at the end of January, 2005, to purchase approximately $43,000 worth of merchandise from Bergdorf Goodman. The customer who ordered these purchases requested that the items be mailed to Debra Boies at 133 Wild Rose Drive in Orange, and used the defendant\u2019s telephone number. Jonathan Boies did not have any knowledge of these purchases, did not know of any Debra Boies and did not authorize anyone to use his credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The United States Postal Service and town of Orange police officers conducted a videotaped controlled delivery to the defendant, in which Patrick Bernardo, a United States postal inspector, purported to deliver merchandise from Bergdorf Goodman to 183 Wild Rose Drive, the address of the defendant. Bernardo asked the defendant: \u201c[A]re you Debra Boies?\u201d The defendant responded that she was and proceeded to sign \u201cDebra Boies\u201d on four different sections of the United States postal parcel slips. The defendant was then taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the court erred in denying her motion for a mistrial on the basis of jury partiality. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The additional facts relating to the defendant\u2019s claim are as follows. On October 4, 2007, the presentation of evidence ended. The following morning, the court was informed that at least three jurors had received telephone calls regarding the case at home on the previous evening. The court instructed those three jurors to leave the room and inquired of the remaining three regular jurors and two alternate jurors whether they had received telephone calls as well. One additional juror indicated that he received a telephone call as well. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>court then proceeded to summon and to inquire of the four affected jurors individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Juror R<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that at about 8:06 p.m. he received a telephone call from a young male asking whether he was a juror. R responded by asking: \u201cWho wants to know? What\u2019s going on? What do you mean? I can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d The caller repeated several times, \u201c[t]he girl is innocent.\u201d He also stated, \u201c[y]ou\u2019re sending the wrong person to jail.\u201d The juror responded to the caller, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be talking [about] this to you,\u201d and asked, \u201c[h]ow did you get my number?\u201d The caller stated that he couldn\u2019t tell R how he got his number but that he \u201chad friends in the court system.\u201d R also asked how the caller knew that the defendant was not guilty. The caller answered that he \u201cstayed over to check the records\u201d and that \u201c[h]er boss lied.\u201d The caller also pl\u00e9aded with R, \u201c[d]on\u2019t put her in jail, she\u2019s innocent . . . her boss lied.\u201d R\u2019s caller identification system showed the telephone call came from Kate\u2019s Paperie.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The court then inquired as to R\u2019s ability to be impartial after receiving this telephone call. R stated that the telephone call did not influence his ability to sit as a fair juror and that he would follow the court\u2019s instructions to decide the case solely based on the evidence presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Juror D similarly testified that someone had called her home at 8:04 p.m. the previous night. D\u2019s caller identification system indicated that the telephone call was from Kate\u2019s Paperie. D\u2019s mother answered the telephone and said, \u201cwhat juror?\u201d This prompted D to pick up the telephone. D asked the male voice who he was, and he responded, \u201cshe did not work here.\u201d D replied by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to talk to you,\u201d and disconnected the call. D testified that she informed the marshal about the call when she arrived at the courthouse and that she had not discussed the matter with anyone else. D stated that the call would not influence her and that she could still be a fair juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Juror W informed the court that he received a telephone call at about 8:15 p.m. the previous evening. W\u2019s wife answered the call, and the male caller asked if she was on the jury. W\u2019s wife responded that she was not on the jury, and the caller asked who was on the jury. W overheard this conversation and picked up another telephone to listen in on the telephone call. W\u2019s wife asked how the caller had found their number, to which he responded that he had gotten the number from the court. She then told the caller, \u201c[njobody\u2019s on a . . . jury here\u201d and disconnected the telephone. The court questioned W as to whether the telephone call would affect his ability to be a fair and impartial juror. W stated that he could remain impartial and fair and that his deliberations would not be affected by extraneous information.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Juror K stated that she received a telephone call at 8:18 p.m. the previous evening. A male caller asked her: \u201cAre you on the jury?\u201d K then hung up the telephone. The court questioned K as to whether she could remain fair and impartial. K stated that she could and that she had not been compromised or affected by what had happened the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The defendant first moved that D, one of the female jurors, be removed. The court had asked each juror if he or she had discussed the telephone calls with any other juror. Juror D stated that she had not spoken of this matter with anyone. Jurors W and K, however, stated that while sequestered by the court prior to being questioned about the telephone calls, one of the female jurors remarked to the other three jurors, \u201coh, you got a call, too.\u201d Both W and K stated that nothing else was discussed regarding the calls. The court found that \u201cin weighing their reaction, [it felt] fairly comfortable that this would be a harmless error,\u201d as \u201c[t]hey did not discuss the nature of the calls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that she could not be given a fair trial. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the ground that the jurors had stated that they would remain fair and impartial. The court concluded that each juror had taken an oath to remain fair and impartial and that it firmly believed that the jurors would abide by their oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We turn to the standard of review that controls our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in denying her motion for a mistrial. \u201cIn [its] review of the denial of a motion for mistrial, [our Supreme Court has] recognized the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial has so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial. The decision of the trial court is therefore reversible on appeal only if there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, 255 </em>Conn. 425, 435, 773 A.2d 287 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Despite each juror\u2019s personal assurances to the court that he or she could remain impartial, the defendant argues that any direct contact between a juror and a third party creates a presumption of partiality. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defendant further argues that the state has the burden of proving that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for the court not to have excused the jurors who had been contacted at home. Finally, the defendant argues that jurors R, D and W should have been dismissed for juror misconduct because they did not immediately disconnect the telephone call but, rather, engaged the caller or listened to further discourse with the caller. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cJury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . [T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. . . . The modem jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court. . . . Consideration [by the jury] of extrinsic evidence is presumptively prejudicial because it implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>84 Conn. App. 551, 555-56, 854 A.2d 89, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 938, 861 A.2d 514 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201c[N]ot every incident of juror misconduct requires a new trial. . . . [D]ue process seeks to assure a defendant of a fair trial, not a perfect one. . . . [T]he constitution does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation . . . [because] it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence which might theoretically affect their vote. . . . The question is whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial. . . . The defendant has been prejudiced if the misbehavior is such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror. . . . We have previously held that, in cases where the trial court is directly implicated in juror misconduct, the state bears the burden of proving that misconduct was harmless error. . . . Where, however, the trial court was in no way responsible for the juror misconduct . . . we have repeatedly held that a defendant who offers proof of juror misconduct bears the burden of proving that actual prejudice resulted from that misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>80 Conn. App. 542, 556-57, 835 A.2d 1058 (2003), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 902, 845 A.2d 406 (2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Applying those well settled legal principles to the present case, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Each juror assured the court that the telephone call to his or her residence would not affect his or her ability to remain impartial and fair. They all stated that they could follow the court\u2019s instructions that they not consider any evidence not presented before the trial court when deliberating. The court\u2019s factual findings, that the telephone calls had not prejudiced each juror, find support in the record. The court based its findings largely on the jurors\u2019 representations that the telephone calls did not affect their ability to remain impartial. The fact of the jurors\u2019 impartiality was reinforced by their finding the defendant guilty of some charges and not guilty of other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The defendant asserts that because the court did not recognize that jurors R, D and W engaged in misconduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>it could not properly determine whether the jurors could have remained fair and impartial. We do not agree. \u201cThe court\u2019s function with regard to the matter required it to assess prejudice. On the basis of the representations of each juror, the court had to determine whether the misbehavior [was] such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror. . . . Because it is in the best position to evaluate the assurances by the jurors, the trial court\u2019s credibility assessment is entitled to substantial weight. . . . The court\u2019s analysis in this case was inherently fact specific. When findings are not clearly erroneous, this court will decline to substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 80 Conn. App. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">There may be cases in which a juror\u2019s affirmation of his or her ability to be fair does not overcome the inherent prejudice of a particular communication. See <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>173 Conn. 334, 339-40, 377 A.2d 1087 (1977) (ex parte conversations between court and juror presumptively prejudicial). This case, in which the contact was not initiated by a juror, was quite brief and, at least on the surface, favored the defendant, is not such a case. We conclude that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied her request to represent herself in violation of her rights under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>after the jury had been selected, but prior to the jury\u2019s being sworn, she sought to waive the right to counsel and to represent herself but that the court summarily and improperly denied her request. The defendant also maintains that the court improperly failed to conduct an inquiry into her request pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3. We conclude that the court exercised its discretion properly and consistently with our Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>293 Conn. 406, 433, 978 A.2d 64 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On May 12, 2005, the defendant was arraigned in this case. At a hearing to assign the case for trial, held on May 30, 2007, the defendant\u2019s counsel, Yito Castignoli, notified the court that the defendant was rejecting the state\u2019s plea offer and intended to go forward with a trial. Castignoli also advised the court that the defendant told him that she wanted to a hire a new attorney. After noting that the defendant\u2019s cases were very old, the court continued the case until June 13, 2007, and informed the defendant that if she intended to hire a new attorney, she should have her new attorney present at that hearing. On June 13, 2007, Castignoli, still appearing for the defendant, informed the court that the defendant had hired new counsel and requested that the court continue the cases again until new counsel had appeared. The court expressed its reluctance to do so in light of the fact that it had already provided the defendant with a two week period to retain new counsel and that the cases against her were \u201cthe oldest cases on the jury list almost by far.\u201d Despite its reluctance, however, the court granted the defendant additional time to provide an appearance of her new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>counsel. The defendant was given until June 21, 2007, the date set for the commencement of trial, to secure the appearance of new counsel, but she was instructed that no further continuances would be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On June 21, 2007, the defendant appeared in court with her new counsel, Angelica Papastavros. Papas-tavros informed the court that she had not had sufficient time to prepare for trial and asked for another continuance. The court thereafter conducted a scheduling conference with the parties in chambers to discuss rescheduling the cases for trial. The cases were again rescheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">On October 2, 2007, after jury selection, the cases were about to begin the evidential phase. That morning, defense counsel stated that she had received from the defendant a fax terminating her representation. Defense counsel informed the court that the defendant informed her \u201cthat she\u2019s willing\u2014or she\u2019s prepared to go forward pro se, if need be.\u201d Defense counsel then stated that she did not believe that it was appropriate for the defendant to represent herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The state opposed the defendant\u2019s request to represent herself. The state reasoned that defendant\u2019s trial counsel was the third attorney to represent her in these matters and that her request to proceed pro se on the day evidence was scheduled to begin was just a tactic used to delay the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The court then questioned the defendant in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [J]ust so I am clear, you were represented by attorney [Robert] Casale at one point in time in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cThe Court: And you were\u2014you basically dismissed him from representing you, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, that\u2019s not true, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cThe Court: But, obviously, he\u2019s no longer representing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">\u201cThe Court: And you retained attorney Vito Castignoli to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, I did not. Attorney Castignoli was retained by my conservator at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">\u201cThe Court: But, as far as an appearance, so what the court works with is an appearance of an attorney, that both attorney Casale and attorney Castignoli were representing you by appearance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: It is correct that both attorney Casale and attorney Vito Castignoli had appearances in these files in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right. And, now, it\u2019s my understanding you later retained attorney Papastavros.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I retained attorney Papastavros of my own accord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">\u201cThe Court: And you, obviously, were satisfied with her representation through the jury selection process, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">\u201c[The Defendant]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">\u201cThe Court: That, over\u2014if my math is correct\u2014we had, if not over eighty potential jurors or around eighty potential jurors in the course of three days. And you were present when motions were argued last Wednesday in Derby\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cThe Court: With attorney Papastavros? Now, the representations of attorney Papastavros are that you are no longer satisfied with her representation, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think it\u2019s within\u2014I\u2019m sure it\u2019s within my authority to basically reject your actions. I think I\u2019ve just named . . . three of the most qualified criminal defense attorneys in the New Haven, Milford area that you, at some point in time, said you were not satisfied with and no longer wanted their services. I am concerned with the fact that we have already spent three full days and then a half day on this matter. And here it is at the commencement of a trial when we\u2019ve had jurors come in\u2014come back. The expense the state has had to absorb in getting witnesses in and putting their case together, to have you come in on the beginning of the first day of evidence in saying, I am not satisfied anymore with my attorney, I feel that this is questionable, I think, because there have been other delays in this matter. And I think the state has been more than accommodating; the court has been more than accommodating with you on these matters throughout the last few years. And it is pretty close to one of the oldest cases in the Ansonia-Milford judicial district. So, I think the interests of justice are best served by going forward with the case today. And I\u2019m not going to allow attorney Papastavros to be released. We have to go forward. We have a jury here. The state is ready to put on evidence. And I will move the case forward today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In a later articulation of its decision in response to an inquiry from this court, the trial court stated that its reasons for denying the defendant\u2019s motion were that (1) the defendant had not expressed a dissatisfaction with her trial counsel prior to the date evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>scheduled to commence, (2) the defendant had exhibited a pattern of dismissing her attorneys on the eve of trial even though her attorneys were very qualified and experienced criminal defense attorneys, (3) this matter was one of the oldest on the Milford docket and (4) the defendant was facing at least ten felony charges and numerous misdemeanor charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cBoth the federal constitution and our state constitution afford a criminal defendant the right to [forgo] the assistance of counsel and to choose instead to represent himself or herself at trial. As a matter of federal constitutional law, the right to self-representation is premised on the structure of the Sixth Amendment, as well as in the English and colonial jurisprudence from which the Amendment emerged. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 818, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975); see also <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 174, 104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1984); cf. <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, [342] 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963) ([making sixth amendment right to counsel applicable to states through due process clause of the fourteenth amendment]). The Connecticut constitution is more explicit, stating directly that [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard <em>by himself </em>and by counsel .... Conn. Const., art I, \u00a7 8. We repeatedly have interpreted this language to establish an independent state constitutional guarantee of the right to self-representation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>211 Conn. 215, 558 A.2d 669 (1989) .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 820, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Although [w]e harbor no illusions that a defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel and [to] proceed pro se generally will lead to anything other than disastrous consequences . . . values informing our constitutional structure teach that although [a defendant] may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the lifeblood of the law. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>[397 U.S. 337, 350, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970)] (Brennan, J., concurring).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>281 Conn. 613, 646-47, 916 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 868, 128 S.

Ed. 2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">A defendant\u2019s right to represent himself or herself, after a clear and unequivocal request to do so, is not unlimited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Faretta, </em>the United States Supreme Court identified three grounds for denying a defendant her right to self-representation: \u201c(1) [the defendant] makes the request in [an] untimely fashion such that granting it would disrupt the proceedings; <em>[Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 422 U.S.] 807; (2) the defendant engages in serious obstructionist misconduct; id., 834 n.46; and (3) the defendant has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Id., 835; see 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 11.5 (d), pp. 47-49.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 221 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In accordance with those limitations, our Supreme Court recently held that \u201cwhen a defendant clearly and unequivocally has invoked his right to self-representation <em>after the trial has begun, </em>the trial court must consider: (1) the defendant\u2019s reasons for the self-representation request; (2) the quality of the defendant\u2019s counsel; and (3) the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute counsel. If, after a thorough consideration of these factors, the trial court determines, in its discretion, that the balance weighs in favor of the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, the court must then proceed to canvass the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 to ensure that the defendant\u2019s choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to proceed pro se has been made in a knowing and intelligent fashion. If, on the other hand, the court determines, on the basis of those criteria, that the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, then the court should deny the defendant\u2019s request and need not engage in a \u00a7 44-3 canvass.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">After a trial has begun,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether the defendant\u2019s interest in her right to represent herself outweighs the potential disruption to the trial of the case. In this case, the court\u2019s decision to proceed with existing counsel was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In the present case, the court did not have the benefit of our Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Flanagan, </em>delineating a balancing test for evaluating a defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se after the commencement of trial. Nonetheless, the court considered the three <em>Flanagan </em>factors to determine whether the interest in representing herself was genuine and outweighed the potential for further delay. The court\u2019s colloquy clearly demonstrates its findings that (1) the defendant\u2019s reasons for requesting to proceed pro se were \u201cquestionable,\u201d as she had not expressed any displeasure with her trial counsel prior to the date evidence was to begin, (2) her previous attorneys, including the trial counsel at issue, were \u201cthree of the most qualified criminal defense attorneys in the New Haven, Milford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>area,\u201d and (3) the defendant had shown a previous pattern of dismissing these qualified attorneys on the eve of trial, resulting in further delay of the trial of her case. The court then weighed these factors against the possible disruption that would occur if her request was granted. The parties had already spent three and one-half days choosing a jury. That jury was present on that day to begin hearing the case. The state had expended money to have its witnesses present, some of whom had come from different states, and the case was quite old.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The defendant suggests that no delay would have resulted from self-representation. The court, however, was not bound to believe that assertion. The court clearly believed that granting the defendant\u2019s request would result in a further delay, and the defendant did not specifically state that if she were permitted to dismiss her counsel and to represent herself, no further delay would occur.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, her attorney stated that she did not think that it would be appropriate for the defendant to represent herself, at least without standby counsel. In light of these considerations, the court determined that \u201cthe interests of justice are best served by going forward with the case [that day]\u201d and denied the defendant\u2019s request. Accordingly, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request to represent herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly coerced the jury to arrive at a unanimous verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The defendant concedes that her claim was not preserved because she did not file a written request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>charge or take an exception to the court\u2019s instructions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 473 n.6, 915 A.2d 872 (2007) (party may preserve for appeal claim of instructional error by submitting written request to charge or by taking exception to charge). The defendant seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <em>Golding </em>holds that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u201cThe first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied in the present case. The record is adequate for review and the defendant\u2019s claim is of constitutional magnitude because it involves her fundamental right to have her case decided by a jury. Accordingly, we consider whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\u201cA challenge to the validity of jury instructions presents a question of law over which this court has plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>108 Conn. App. 566, 576, 948 A.2d 1075 (2008). \u201cIt is well settled that jury instructions are to be reviewed in their entirety. . . . When the challenge to a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>instruction is of a constitutional magnitude, the standard of review is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. ... In determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the juiy is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement .... Individual instructions also are not to be judged in artificial isolation .... Instead, [t]he test to be applied ... is whether the charge ... as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Makee R., </em>117 Conn. App. 191, 198, 978 A.2d 549, cert. granted on other grounds, 294 Conn. 912, 983 A.2d 275 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The defendant directs our attention to the court\u2019s instruction and claims that she was denied her \u201cfundamental constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial and a unanimous verdict free of coercion.\u201d Specifically, she argues that the court coerced the jury into reaching a verdict by improperly instructing the jury: \u201cYou must, therefore, make every reasonable effort to come to a verdict. You must listen to what the other jurors say. You must not hesitate to reconsider your own options as reasonable people. You should ultimately be able to cometo an agreement upon a verdict.\u201d According to the defendant, this instruction pressured the jury into reaching an unanimous verdict and undermined the integrity of its deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court\u2019s instruction did not pressure the jury into reaching a unanimous verdict. The state refers to <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 183 n.8, 405 A.2d 626 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 966, 99 S. Ct. 2417, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1979), in which our Supreme Court upheld a jury instruction that stated: \u201cYou must not hesitate to reconsider your own opinions. ... As reasonable people, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>you should ultimately be able to come to some agreement upon a verdict.\u201d The defendant responds that the validity of the <em>Peary </em>instruction is questionable based upon our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>261 Conn. 49, 64, 801 A.2d 730 (2002), in which the court modified the antideadlock instruction, known as the Chip Smith instruction, to more \u201cappropriately [balance] the systemic interest in a unanimous verdict and the defendant\u2019s right to have each and every juror vote his or her conscience irrespective of whether such vote results in a hung jury.\u201d Id., 76. We need not discuss the effect that <em>O\u2019Neil </em>had <em>on Peary, </em>because the court\u2019s instructions satisfied the <em>O\u2019Neil </em>requirements. The court\u2019s instruction did balance the system\u2019s interest in a unanimous verdict with the defendant\u2019s right to have jurors vote their conscience. Although the court first stated that \u201c[y]ou must not hesitate to reconsider your own options as reasonable people. You should ultimately be able to come to an agreement upon a verdict,\u201d it followed that instruction by stating that \u201cit is your individual duty to make up your own mind and to decide this case upon the basis of your own individual judgment and your conscience.\u201d These instructions considered together reflect the balance required by <em>O\u2019Neil. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s instructions did not mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that her convictions of the identity theft charges under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-129b and 53a-129d and of the illegal use of a credit card charges under \u00a7 53a-128d for a single course of conduct, stemming from illegal use of the victims\u2019 credit cards, violated her protection against double jeopardy.

The defendant now argues that she was punished twice, under both \u00a7 53a-129a and \u00a7 53a-128d, for a single transaction in violation of her constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant did not preserve her claim at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Because the record is adequate and because a double jeopardy claim is of constitutional magnitude; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 704-705, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S.

[W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>98 Conn.

It is undisputed that both the identity theft charge and the illegal use of a credit card charge arose out of the same act or transaction. The identity theft charge required the state to prove that the defendant intentionally obtained the personal identifying information of another person and used that information to obtain or attempt to obtain goods or services without the consent of the cardholder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This statute punishes defined acts, in this case, the acts of obtaining the credit card number and of using that credit card number, without the cardholder\u2019s permission. Identity theft in the first degree requires that the state additionally prove that the value of the goods obtained exceeds $10,000. By contrast, the illegal use of a credit card charge requires the state to prove that the defendant, intending to defraud the issuer of the credit card or merchant providing goods and services, obtained goods or services by representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that she was the holder of the credit card without the consent of the cardholder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This statute punishes the act of defrauding the merchant by representing that the defendant is the cardholder. It is apparent that each charge required proof of a fact or facts that the other did not: identity theft requires that the defendant obtain the personal identity information of another person, and illegal use of a credit card does not; and illegal use of a credit card requires that the defendant intend to defraud the issuer of the credit card or a merchant, and identity theft does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant claims that identity theft in the circumstances of this case is a lesser offense included within the crime of illegal use of a credit card. \u201c [I]f two offenses stand in the relationship of greater and lesser included offense, [however] then [t]he greater offense is . . . by definition the same for purposes of double jeopardy as any lesser offense included in it. . . . If it is possible to commit the greater offense in the manner described in the information without having first committed the lesser offense, then the lesser is not an included offense.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>115 Conn.

Because the commission of illegal use of a credit card as charged did not require the state to prove that the defendant intentionally obtained the credit card number of another person without the cardholder\u2019s consent, the charge of identity theft is not a lesser offense included within the crime of the illegal use of a credit card charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Thus, the defendant\u2019s final claim fails under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-4\"> In docket number CR-01-129104, the defendant was found not guilty of attempt to commit larceny in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-125 and 53a-49; attempt to commit illegal use of a credit card in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-128d and 53a-49; larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b; illegal use of a credit card in violation of \u00a7 53a-128d; and identity theft in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-129d.
