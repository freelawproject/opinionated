J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acu\">The plaintiff, Debra Tomlinson, appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of the defendant, John A. Tomlinson, to modify the unallocated alimony and child support order incorporated by reference into the judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage and from the judgment of the court denying her motion for contempt. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the court improperly granted the motion to modify because the agreement of the parties expressly precluded modification and (2) the court improperly failed to grant her motion for contempt and awarded her an insufficient amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We conclude that parties are expressly authorized by statute to agree to make unallocated periodic alimony and child support nonmodifiable although the court must retain the authority to modify such orders where the evidence demonstrates that the needs of the parties\u2019 children warrant modification. The record in the present case is clear that none of the contingencies for which the parties bargained permitting modification had occurred. Additionally, the non-modifiable provision was part of an integrated and comprehensive agreement consisting of all financial orders and property division made a part of the final decree of dissolution. Finally, because the record is devoid of any indication that the minor children of the marriage did not receive proper financial support, the court had no evidentiary ground based on public policy that children receive adequate support to permit modification for that reason. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court modifying the unallocated alimony and child support order. Because the court\u2019s judgment regarding the plaintiffs motion for contempt and attorney\u2019s fees was dependent in part on our resolution of the plaintiffs first claim, we reverse that judgment as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed relevant facts. Following an uncontested dissolution hearing held on December 9, 2005, the court, <em>B. </em>Fischer, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>accepted the separation agreement of the parties and incorporated it by reference into its judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. According to the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff and the defendant would have joint legal custody and the plaintiff primary physical custody of the parties\u2019 two children. The children, who were ages ten and five at the time, were not represented by counsel. The guardian ad litem for the children signed the agreement directly below a statement indicating that he approved and acknowledged the parties\u2019 agreement \u201cwith respect to the custody, visitation and counseling issues pertaining to the minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Paragraph 2.1 of the agreement provides in relevant part: \u201cCommencing the first day of the week following the [plaintiffs] removal from the residence at 1158 West River Street, Milford, Connecticut . . . the [defendant] agrees to pay to the [plaintiff] unallocated periodic alimony and child support, until June 30, 2018, or until her death, remarriage, or cohabitation pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-86 (b), whichever shall first occur, the sum of Seventy Two Thousand Dollars ($72,000.00) per year or One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ($1,384.00) per week. THE UNALLOCATED PERIODIC [ALIMONY] AND CHILD SUPPORT SHALL BE [NON-MODIF1ABLE] IN AMOUNT AND TERM OF PAYMENTS EXCEPT AS NOTED ABOVE.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only exceptions \u201cnoted above\u201d in the agreement are those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>contained within paragraph 2.1 itself. The final sentence of the paragraph is the only portion of the separation agreement typed entirely in capital letters. The parties did not incorporate into their agreement any provision permitting modification of the unallocated support order if primary custody of the children changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The parties agreed by way of a stipulated order filed June 12, 2007, that primary physical custody of the children would be transferred to the defendant. However, despite this transfer, the plaintiff still enjoyed visitation with the children two days a week and every other weekend in her home. On November 16, 2007, the defendant filed a motion to modify the unallocated support order, seeking a reduction in the amount of support he paid to the plaintiff on the ground that custody had changed. The plaintiff opposed the motion, filing a motion asking the court to strike the defendant\u2019s modification request and arguing that the agreement by its terms precluded modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The court, Turner, J., held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion on February 6, 2008, during which the plaintiff and the defendant testified- The defendant testified as to the change in custody, noting that he currently covered expenses such as the children\u2019s cellular telephones, gymnastics, entertainment and transportation and that the plaintiff did not contribute to these expenditures. The guardian ad litem for the children attended but did not participate in the hearing, and the children were not represented by counsel. We deem it a matter of some considerable significance that the defendant presented no evidence that the children\u2019s needs for support had changed or were not being met sufficiently under the agreement. Nothing else in the record indicates that the children\u2019s needs were unmet. Nonetheless, the court held that despite the nonmodifiable language of paragraph 2.1, the separation agreement was modifiable. It pointed to paragraphs 2.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and 2.7 of the agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provide direction in the event of a change in or termination of alimony and child support, opining that the provisions demonstrated the parties\u2019 clear contemplation of a future change in the unallocated support order. The court found that the change in custody of the children constituted a substantial change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and modified the separation agreement, concluding that the defendant no longer was obligated to pay child support to the plaintiff. On the basis of the parties\u2019 financial affidavits and the child support guidelines in effect at the time the dissolution judgment entered, the court determined that the child support portion of the unallocated order was $604 per week, and it reduced the defendant\u2019s unallocated order of alimony and support to the plaintiff by that amount. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for reargument, which the court denied. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the unallocated alimony and child support order. She argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the parties\u2019 agreement, incorporated by reference into the judgment of dissolution, clearly and unambiguously precluded modification of the order except in certain enumerated circumstances, none of which were present here. Thus, she contends, under \u00a7 46b~86 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court could not modify the agreement as to child support. In opposition, the defendant maintains that despite the language of the agreement cited by the plaintiff, the court properly modified the child support portion of the agreement under the court\u2019s broad power to act in the best interests of the parties\u2019 children. Because no evidence was presented that the children\u2019s needs were unmet, thereby justifying abrogation of the parties\u2019 agreement, we agree with the plaintiff that the agreement was not modifiable under the circumstances present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and principles of law underlying the plaintiffs claim. It is well established that a separation agreement, incorporated by reference into a judgment of dissolution, is a contract between the separating parties. See <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 234-35, 737 A.2d 383 (1999). Accordingly, our review of a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a separation agreement \u201cis guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 235. \u201cIf a contract is unambiguous within its four comers, intent of the parties is a question of law requiring plenary review. . . . When the language of a contract is ambiguous, the determination of the parties\u2019 intent is a question of fact, and the trial court\u2019s interpretation is subject to reversal on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>293 Conn. 698, 711, 980 A. 2d 880 (2009). Here, the pertinent language of the separation agreement is clear and unambiguous, and, thus, our review of the court\u2019s interpretation is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We first analyze the common law and statutory duty of parental child support and then turn our analysis to why that important policy does not warrant modification of the unallocated order in the present case. The common-law duty of parents to provide for their children preceded recognition and enforcement of that duty in our statutory scheme. See <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>196 Conn. 260, 263-64, 492 A.2d 175 (1985), citing <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>137 Conn. 74, 75 A.2d 42 (1950). \u201cThe [parent\u2019s] duty to support ... is a continuing obligation, which ordinarily exists even apart from any judgment or decree of support. ... A parent has both a statutory and common law duty to support his minor children within the reasonable limits of his ability.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kalinowski </em>v. <em>Kro-pelnicki, </em>92 Conn. App. 344, 350, 885 A.2d 194 (2005). Our statutes reflect the parental duty of child support. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-37 (b) (\u201cit shall be the joint duty of each spouse to support his or her family\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 (a) (\u201c[u]pon or subsequent to the . . . dissolution of any marriage or the entry of a decree of legal separation or divorce, the parents of a minor child of the marriage, shall maintain the child according to their respective abilities, <em>if the child is in need of </em>maintenance\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215 (a) (1) (\u201c[t]he Superior Court . . . may make and enforce orders for payment of support against any person who neglects or refuses to furnish <em>necessary support </em>to such person\u2019s . . . child under the age of eighteen . . . according to such person\u2019s ability to furnish such support\u201d [emphasis added]). These statutes embody the strong public policy interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of the state pertaining to matters of \u201cneeded\u201d or \u201cnecessary\u201d child support. \u201cIt is ... in the interest of society that the child be supported by those obligated to support the child and that the child not be required to seek public assistance to satisfy those needs unless otherwise necessary.\u201d <em>Mulholland </em>v. <em>Mulholland, </em>31 Conn. App. 214, 218, 624 A.2d 379 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 643, 643 A.2d 246 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial court\u2019s authority over issues of alimony and child support also is firmly rooted in our statutory law. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-l, the Superior Court exercises plenary and general subject matter jurisdiction over legal disputes in \u201cfamily relations matters,\u201d including issues of alimony and child support. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 729, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999); see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-212h (a) (granting family support magistrate division or Superior Court exclusive jurisdiction over child support orders it previously has issued). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (a) provides the court broad authority to \u201cmake or modify any proper order regarding the custody, care, education, visitation and support\u201d of minor children in dissolution actions. See <em>Guille v. Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 266. Section 46b-86 (a) vests the Superior Court with \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction to modify support orders.\u201d <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 729. In making or modifying such orders, the court is to be guided by \u201cthe best interests of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We next analyze why the important policy ensuring child support does not warrant upsetting the nonmodifiable unallocated order in the parties\u2019 dissolution decree. Modification of alimony and support orders is governed by \u00a7 46b-86 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification . . . any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support . . . may at any time thereafter be . . . altered or modified by said court upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines . . . unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a).The clear language of the statute permits nonmodifiable support orders. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>56 Conn. App. 459, 471, 743 A.2d 1135, cert. granted, 253 Conn. 910, 754 A.2d 160 (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000). Although permissible, provisions prohibiting the modification of alimony or support are disfavored. <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>285 Conn. 687, 693,941 A.2d 301 (2008). \u201cIn accordance with the preference in favor of modification, ambiguous nonmodification provisions are construed to permit modification. . . . Nonmodification provisions that are clear and unambiguous, however, are enforceable.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The plaintiff cites the recent decision of <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>supra, 285 Conn. 687, in support of her argument that the court improperly modified the parties\u2019 agreement as to child support. In <em>Eckert, </em>the parties\u2019 separation agreement, incorporated by reference into the dissolution judgment, contained a clause prohibiting modification of the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation, which was to be a percentage of his gross yearly earned income. Id., 689. The agreement defined \u201cgross yearly earned income\u201d as \u201cincome actually received\u201d by the defendant, and expressly excluded from this definition future stock grants and the exercise of stock options. Id. Approximately four years after the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, the defendant\u2019s employment was terminated, and he obtained another position where his compensation consisted of debt instruments that could be converted into stock. Id., 690. The plaintiff moved to modify the separation agreement\u2019s definition of gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>yearly earned income to include the type of compensation the defendant received in his new position. Id. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the motion, holding that the agreement plainly and unambiguously precluded modification of the definition. Id., 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that the nonmodification provision of the agreement was clear and unambiguous. Id., 693-95. The court further agreed with the trial court that the language of \u00a7 46b-86 (a), combined with the clear nonmodification clause, resolved the issue. The court explained: \u201c[Section] 46b-86 (a) provides in relevant part: <em>\u2018Unless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification . . </em>. any final order for the periodic payment of . . . alimony . . . may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified . . . .\u2019 Thus, the statute permits a court to alter an order for alimony only in the absence of a nonmodification clause that would extend to bar the requested change.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Although <em>Eckert </em>provides guidance regarding the application of \u00a7 46b-86 (a), the statute at issue in the present case, <em>Eckert </em>is distinguishable in one important regard. The dispute in <em>Eckert </em>concerned modification of an alimony order only. See id., 689. The issue before this court concerns an unallocated order of alimony <em>and </em>child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In support of his contrary argument that the court\u2019s modification of the child support portion of the agreement was proper, the defendant relies primarily on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 260. In that case, the judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage incorporated by reference the parties\u2019 separation agreement. Id., 261. The agreement contained a provision limiting subsequent modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of the agreement to the provisions concerning visitation. Id. The parties were represented by counsel at the time of the dissolution, but their three minor children were not represented. Id., 261-62. Six years following the entry of judgment, counsel for the minor children moved the court to \u201ccorrect\u201d the judgment of dissolution by deleting the provision precluding modification of custody and child support. Id., 262. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On appeal, the defendant father challenged the court\u2019s decision, arguing that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) should have prevented the court from deleting the provision prohibiting modification of the terms of child support<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as set forth in the judgment. Id. The Supreme Court held that \u201cneither the general language of ... \u00a7 46b-86 (a), permitting the court to modify support \u2018[ujnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification,\u2019 nor the decree\u2019s broadly phrased nonmodifiability provision, was effective to restrict permanently the court\u2019s power to modify the terms of child support under the circumstances of this case.\u201d Id., 265. The court emphasized both the \u201cindependent character\u201d; id., 263; of the minor children\u2019s common law right to parental support and the trial court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to \u201cmake or modify any proper order regarding the . . . support of the [minor] children\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (a). (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 262. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the passage of the underlying legislation, the court stated that it could not conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 46b-86 (a) to change the common-law rule prohibiting parents from contractually restricting or defeating their children\u2019s right to support. Id., 267. Affirming the decision of the trial court, the Supreme Court concluded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201cSince the court was without power to enter an order that would permanently restrict the unrepresented children\u2019s rights, it was not error, upon a motion by the children, to open the . . . divorce judgment and delete the provision purporting to preclude modification of child support and custody.\u201d Id., 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s contention that all unallocated, nonmodifiable orders of alimony and child support are always modifiable. He argues that <em>Guille </em>stands for the proposition that the court may modify the child support component of an otherwise nonmodi-fiable agreement. At oral argument, the defendant expressed the opinion that under <em>Guille, </em>an agreement <em>could not be nonmodifiable </em>as to child support. We cannot agree with the broad reading of the case advanced by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the plain text of \u00a7 46b-86 (a) belies the defendant\u2019s argument. The statute clearly permits nonmodifiable support orders, such as the one to which the parties agreed in the present case. See <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 471. Section 46b-86 (a) is substantially the same today as it was in 1985 when the Supreme Court decided <em>Guille. </em>Although the court held that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) and the agreement\u2019s nonmodifiability provision did not prohibit modification of the agreement in that case, it did not hold that nonmodifiable child support agreements were impermissible under the statute or that nonmodifiable orders were always modifiable, as the defendant contends. Presumably, had the court desired to render the holding the defendant here posits, it could have stated clearly that parties could not agree to make child support orders nonmodifiable. Rather than making such a broad statement of the law, the court expressly limited its holding to the circumstances of that case. <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 265. It held: \u201cWe conclude that neither the general language of ... \u00a7 46b-86 [a] . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>nor the decree\u2019s broadly phrased nonmodifiability provision, was effective to restrict permanently the court\u2019s power to modify the terms of child support <em>under the circumstances of this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. Further, <em>Guille </em>has never been cited, either by our Supreme Court or by this court, for the proposition that child support orders may not be made nonmodifiable by agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We believe the holding of <em>Guille </em>is more limited: parties to a dissolution action may not, by means of a nonmodifiable separation agreement, permanently restrict their unrepresented children\u2019s independent right to child support. See id., 268. The <em>Guille </em>court upheld the common-law rule prohibiting parents from \u201ccontractually restricting or defeating their children\u2019s right to support\u201d; id., 265, citing <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 74; without going so far as stating that a separation agreement concerning child support could <em>never </em>be made nonmodifiable. The <em>Guille </em>court\u2019s opinion underscores both the independent nature of the children\u2019s right to the support of their parents and, especially, the fact that the children had been unrepresented through the dissolution proceedings: \u201cAlthough the . . . stipulation and judgment may have been effective to define permanently the support obligations of the divorcing parties as between themselves, neither their agreement nor the court\u2019s decree can be held binding as to their minor children, <em>who were unrepresented </em>during both the negotiation of the stipulation and the dissolution proceedings. Since the stipulation is merely a contract between the defendant husband and the plaintiff wife, it could not affect the minor children\u2019s right of action for parental maintenance. . . . The divorce decree was likewise ineffective to establish conclusively the extent of the children\u2019s support rights because <em>they were not represented </em>when that judgment was entered. It is a fundamental premise of due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that a court cannot adjudicate a matter until the persons directly concerned have been notified of its pendency and have been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard in sufficient time to prepare their positions on the issues involved. . . . Since the court was without power to enter an order that would permanently restrict the <em>unrepresented children\u2019s </em>rights, it was not error, upon a motion by the children, to open the . . . divorce judgment and delete the provision purporting to preclude modification of child support and custody.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 267-68. Our reading of <em>Guille </em>comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s description of the opinion offered by the court in <em>Amodio-. </em>\u201c[SJupport orders can be modified in spite of preclusion provisions when those provisions are ambiguous . . . and when the rights of interested parties are not protected adequately by the separation agreement.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 730, citing <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In the present case, the record provides no indication that the parties\u2019 minor children were represented by counsel during the parties\u2019 negotiation of the separation agreement or, indeed, at anytime during the dissolution proceedings. Although the guardian ad litem for the children signed the completed agreement, his approval and acknowledgement of the agreement pertained only \u201cto the custody, visitation and counseling issues pertaining to the minor children.\u201d Furthermore, the motion to modify the agreement was brought on behalf of the defendant only and was based solely on the change in primary physical custody of the children. The defendant made no representation to the court that the children\u2019s support needs had been affected by the change in custody. The case therefore is factually distinguishable from <em>Guille </em>in this important regard, as the motion to modify the agreement in <em>Guille </em>was brought by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>for the parties\u2019 minor children and on their behalf. See <em>Guille </em>v. <em>Guille, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 262. In light of the preceding, we conclude that the circumstances like those in <em>GuiUe, </em>under which children asserted their right to parental support, causing the court to determine that a facially nonmodifiable provision of a separation agreement could nonetheless be modified, are not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We next analyze the terms of the contractual agreement that was incorporated into the decree at the time of the dissolution of the marriage. As we have stated, we review the trial court\u2019s decision interpreting the separation agreement incorporated into the dissolution judgment according to the general principles of contract interpretation. See <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 234-35. The agreement \u201cmust be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>supra, 285 Conn. 692. The intent of the parties \u201cis to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words\u201d whereby the language of the contract is \u201caccorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Applying these interpretive principles to the separation agreement, we conclude, contrary to the conclusion of the court, that the provision covering unallocated alimony and child support was nonmodifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The language of paragraph 2.1 of the agreement, which bears the parties\u2019 emphasis, is clear and not ambiguous: \u201cTHE UNALLOCATED PERIODIC [ALIMONY] AND CHILD SUPPORT SHALL BE [NONMODI-FIABLE] IN AMOUNT AND TERM OF PAYMENTS EXCEPT AS NOTED ABOVE.\u201d The only exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the nonmodifiability of the alimony and support contained in the agreement precede the capitalized language in paragraph 2.1: the plaintiffs death, remarriage or cohabitation. The intent of the parties to make the unallocated alimony and child support nonmodifiable, except in these circumstances, is clear from the language of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The court cited two additional provisions of the agreement in support of its interpretation that the parties had intended the alimony and support order to be modifiable. The court referenced paragraph 2.5, which provides: \u201cIf in the future the amount of alimony changes and/or terminates and a determination needs to be made for child support, the court shall determine the amount in accordance with the child support guidelines.\u201d Paragraph 2.7 of the agreement, also cited by the court, provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the event of the termination of unallocated alimony and child support provided in [paragraph] 2.1 hereof during the minority of any child, the parties shall determine the amount of child support to be paid by the [defendant] for the support of the minor child or children . . . .\u201d The court concluded that these provisions indicated that the parties foresaw the potential that the agreement would require modification as to alimony and support. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although the language of these paragraphs alludes to possible future modifications in alimony and support, there is nothing in the language to suggest that the parties intended those potential modifications to result from anything other than the enumerated reasons for modification found in paragraph 2.1, namely, the plaintiffs death, remarriage or cohabitation. Reading the terms of paragraphs 2.5 and 2.7 to mean that the parties intended the unallocated alimony and support order to be modifiable in direct contradiction to the clear language of paragraph 2.1 declaring its nonmodifiability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>is akin to supplying terms to the parties\u2019 agreement, which is not appropriate under these circumstances. \u201cA term not expressly included will not be read into a contract unless it arises by necessary implication from the provisions of the instrument.\u201d <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rogow, </em>150 Conn. 401, 408, 190 A.2d 48 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The clear and unambiguous language of the agreement forbad future modification of the unallocated alimony and child support order except for certain enumerated reasons, none of which were present. The parties were free in negotiating the terms of the agreement to bargain for a term allowing the order to be modified upon a change in physical custody. They did not do so. We recognize that, as in <em>Guille, </em>instances may arise in which a trial court must modify a facially nonmodifiable separation agreement as to child support in order to protect the children\u2019s interest in receiving material support from their parents. The court must retain the authority to modify child support orders in accordance with the strong public policy, expressed in our statutory and interpretive case law, that parents support their children. See <em>Sablosky </em>v. <em>Sablosky, </em>258 Conn. 713, 721, 784 A.2d 890 (2001); see also <em>Commissioner of Social Services </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>265 Conn. 723, 735, 830 A. 2d 228 (2003). Such circumstances are not present here. The defendant provided the court no evidence that the support needs of the parties\u2019 minor children were unmet or even diminished as a result of the change in their physical custody, or because of the unallocated order requiring payment to the plaintiff of $1384 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Alimony and child support orders may either be allocated or unallocated. If allocated, some set amount is awarded for each such purpose. If unallocated, the award of the amount to be paid periodically is not designated either as child support or alimony. Because it is unallocated, the benefit to the party charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>paying is that it is a deduction in its entirety for federal income tax purposes; see <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 304, 81 S. Ct. 1343, 6 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1961); whereas child support, if allocated, is not deductible. Here, the parties bargained for, and succeeded in incorporating into their divorce decree, a provision making alimony and child support unallocated. The effect of the court\u2019s order modifying that award was to transmogrify an unallocated award to an allocated award.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Our courts repeatedly have recognized that \u201c[t]he rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>275 Conn. 348, 354, 880 A.2d 872 (2005). This holds just as true in the instance of parties negotiating a settlement agreement that the court approves and incorporates into a marriage dissolution judgment as when the court authors financial and property settlement orders. By way of their comprehensive separation agreement, the parties here divided the property and other assets of their marriage. Among other things, the plaintiff relinquished any claim to an interest in the defendant\u2019s business and certain other property. The defendant, in turn, among other things, agreed to pay to the plaintiff an unallocated order of periodic alimony and child support, which was to be nonmodifiable except in the case of her death, remarriage or cohabitation. Given the clear language of the agreement, and on the record before us, we conclude that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly denied her motion for contempt and failed to award her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the dissolution judgment. As to the motion for contempt, the plaintiff specifically argues that the court\u2019s denial was based in part on its previous incorrect determination addressed in part I of this opinion that the unallocated support order was modifiable. She further claims that although the court found that the defendant was not in compliance with the court\u2019s order, it nonetheless failed to award her a reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We address these two aspects of the plaintiffs claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for resolution of the plaintiffs claim. On April 17, 2008, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt against the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant wilfully had violated the orders contained in the court\u2019s dissolution judgment in that he: (1) failed to maintain life insurance for her and the minor children, (2) failed to sell two properties, (3) filed the motion to modify the unallocated support order on a ground other than those for which the agreement allowed modification and thereby violated her right to timely receive support under paragraph 2.6 of the agreement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (4) failed to pay the $1384 per week since the middle of March as required by the agreement and pursuant to the court\u2019s order staying its modification of the unallocated order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought an order holding him in contempt of court and requiring the defendant to maintain the life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>insurance and to list the properties for sale according to the agreement; \u201cto pay all fees and costs incurred by the plaintiff to defend against his motion to modify, including all [attorney\u2019s] fees and costs at trial and on appeal\u201d; to pay the unpaid unallocated support; and to pay the plaintiffs costs for the motion for contempt, including attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff submitted to the court an affidavit and itemized list of attorney\u2019s fees and costs relating to the motion for contempt totaling $9283.75.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court, <em>Turner, J., </em>held a hearing on the motion on July 8 and 16 and September 23, 2008. In its October 3, 2008 memorandum of decision, the court found that the defendant had failed to maintain the required life insurance and was in arrears in his alimony and support payments. As to the defendant\u2019s having filed a motion for modification of the alimony and support order, the court noted that it previously had found a substantial change in circumstances due to the change in the children\u2019s custody and held that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s filing and successful pursuit of the motion to modify was not a wilful violation of the plaintiffs right to timely receive unallocated support.\u201d The court found that the defendant had made reasonable, diligent and timely efforts to list and to sell the properties. In sum, the court did not find that the defendant had wilfully violated the court\u2019s orders but found that, in certain respects, he was in noncompliance with them. Accordingly, the court denied the plaintiffs motion for contempt in each of its particular specifications. However, the court ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the defendant to obtain life insurance for the plaintiff and the children, continue to list the properties for sale and to pay the plaintiff in a lump sum the arrearage of $13,508 in alimony and child support. The court denied the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs to defend the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the alimony and support order. Finally, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the court\u2019s orders, the court granted the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in filing the motion for contempt, awarding her the sum of $750. The plaintiff subsequently amended her original appeal, which pertained to the court\u2019s judgment on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the alimony and support order, to include an appeal of the court\u2019s denial from her motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The plaintiff argues that pursuant to paragraph 2.1 of the separation agreement, the unallocated alimony and child support award was nonmodifiable except for certain limited reasons. She maintains that the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the alimony and support order for a reason other than those outlined in the agreement violated paragraph 2.6 of the agreement, which states in relevant part that the defendant will \u201ctake no action for the purpose of defeating the [plaintiffs] timely right to receive alimony and support . . . .\u201d According to the plaintiff, because the court incorporated the separation agreement into its judgment of dissolution, the defendant\u2019s motion to modify constituted a wilful violation of the court\u2019s order pertaining to alimony and support. She challenges the court\u2019s failure to hold thus in its judgment on her motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201cA finding of contempt is a question of fact, and our standard of review is to determine whether the court abused its discretion in failing to find that the actions or inactions of the [defendant] were in contempt of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>court order. ... To constitute contempt, a party\u2019s conduct must be wilful. . . . Noncompliance alone will not support a judgment of contempt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gina M. G. </em>v. <em>William C., </em>77 Conn. App. 582, 590, 823 A.2d 1274 (2003). \u201c[It] is within the sound discretion of the court to deny a claim for contempt when there is an adequate factual basis to explain the failure to honor the court\u2019s order.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>96 Conn. App. 75, 82, 899 A.2d 76, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 907, 907 A.2d 89 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiffs motion for contempt with regard to the defendant\u2019s seeking modification of the unallocated alimony and support order was based on its previous decision, discussed in part I of this opinion, granting the defendant\u2019s motion to modify. The court granted the motion to modify on the basis of its improper conclusion that the agreement was modifiable. The court denied the plaintiffs subsequent motion for contempt, holding that the defendant had not violated wilfully the court\u2019s orders in moving for modification of the agreement. To rule on the motion for contempt, the court was required to make factual findings concerning the defendant\u2019s actions and whether they constituted wilful violation of a court order. \u201c[A] court may not find a person in contempt without considering the circumstances surrounding the violation to determine whether such violation was wilful.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>38 Conn. App. 263, 275-76, 661 A.2d 621 (1995). It is not the province of an appellate court to make such factual findings. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court denying the plaintiffs motion for contempt limited solely to the court\u2019s decision concerning the defendant\u2019s actions in seeking to modify the unallocated order of alimony and child support. We remand the case to the trial court for consideration of this portion of the plaintiffs motion for contempt in light of our decision in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The plaintiff also challenges the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs based on the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the court\u2019s orders. She cites paragraph 12.1 of the separation agreement,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides that a party judged to have failed to meet an obligation under the agreement would be liable to the other party for his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs in enforcing the agreement. She argues that in light of this provision, her affidavit of fees and costs in the amount of $9283.75, the court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in compliance with the court\u2019s orders and the fact that the defendant did not challenge the reasonableness of the time expended in bringing the motion for contempt, the court\u2019s award of $750 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs was insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The court\u2019s judgment with regard to the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs was dependent, at least in part, on its judgment with regard to the plaintiffs motion for contempt. As we stated in part II A of this opinion, the court\u2019s judgment on the motion for contempt was based in part on the court\u2019s prior decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to modify the separation agreement. We, therefore, reverse the judgment as to attorney\u2019s fees and costs and remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration of whether, in light of our decision in part I of this opinion, any further award is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The judgments are reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> The reference to \u201cOne Thousand Five Hundred Dollars\u201d in paragraph 2.1 is unexplained by the parties on appeal, who refer solely throughout their briefs to the corresponding payment amounts of $72,000 per year and $1384 per week. As such, the reference appears to be a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> Under the agreement, the plaintiff agreed to quitclaim to the defendant her interest in two properties in Milford and to forgo any claim against the defendant\u2019s property in Utah.

In addition to the unallocated alimony and child support order, the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff $400,000.
