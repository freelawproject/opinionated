On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court (1) abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification, (2) improperly rejected his claim that his trial counsel and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel and (3) abused its discretion in denying his motion for permission to file a third amended petition. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">The following facts are necessary for resolution of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. On September 1, 1998, the jury found the petitioner guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134, failure to appear in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172 (a) and two counts of tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner appealed to this court from the judgments of conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>and we affirmed the judgments of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>57 Conn. App. 337, 748 A.2d 357 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The facts underlying the petitioner\u2019s convictions were set forth in State v. <em>Reeves, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 339-43. \u201cAt approximately 6 p.m. on February 21, [1997], Marcus Russell, age seventeen, and his girlfriend, Shaluanda Elliot, age fourteen . . . left his apartment to walk ... to her home on Homeside Avenue [in West Haven]. As they were walking, Russell and Elliot noticed that three black males were following them. Both Russell and Elliot recognized two of the individuals as the [petitioner] and Willie Minor. Elliot also recognized the third individual as John Walton. Russell told Elliot to keep walking. Both did so. When Russell and Elliot reached Glade Street, which was a few blocks from Homeside Avenue, they noticed that the three individuals who had been following them had disappeared. Shortly thereafter, however, when they had reached Terrace Street, they saw that the [petitioner] and Minor had reappeared behind them and were again following them.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">\u201cWhen Russell and Elliot reached Homeside Avenue, the [petitioner] shouted at them, \u2018You all stop walking.\u2019 Russell turned around and said, \u2018What?\u2019 and continued walking. The [petitioner] then said, \u2018You all gots to stop walking. I\u2019m going to shoot.\u2019 The [petitioner] approached them, and both Russell and Elliot saw a gun in his hand. He stated to Russell, \u2018You violated me,\u2019 and that he was going to \u2018run [Russell\u2019s] jewels.\u2019 Both men wore dark jackets and masks that covered the lower half of their faces. Thereafter, the [petitioner] held the gun against Russell\u2019s chest. At the [petitioner\u2019s] direction, Minor \u2018popped\u2019 a gold chain that Russell was wearing from around his neck. This chain had a round medallion with a depiction of the Virgin Mary on it and was worth approximately $600. Russell was also directed to remove a gold ring from his finger and to give it to the [petitioner]. This ring had rubies and cubic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>zirconias on the band and a picture of the Virgin Mary on its face, and it was worth about $80. The [petitioner], telling Russell that he knew he had more jewelry, checked Russell\u2019s wrists for bracelets, but found none. The [petitioner] and Minor then fled toward Glade Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">\u201cBoth Russell and Elliot immediately ran the short distance to Elliot\u2019s house and told her mother, Luray Elliot, what had happened. Angered over this situation, Elliot\u2019s mother, Elliot, Russell and several neighbors went to Glade Street to try to find the [petitioner].</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">\u201cIn the meantime, the police were called and told of the robbery. David Cahill, an officer with the West Haven police department, was dispatched to the area. Upon his arrival, he spoke to Russell and Elliot, who told him that the [petitioner] had robbed them at gunpoint. He learned that the two alleged robbers were black males, both dressed in dark coats and dark pants, and that they had worn masks that covered the lower half of their faces. He also got a description of the gold chain and the gold ring. Cahill was familiar with the [petitioner] in that he lived in the area. The police dispatcher learned that the [petitioner] lived at an apartment at 54 Glade Street and sent Officers Steven Viele and Pauline Sires, who had been in radio contact with Cahill, to that address to find him.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">\u201cCahill proceeded to the [petitioner\u2019s] apartment on foot, but Viele and Sires arrived there before him. Emily Reeves, the [petitioner\u2019s] grandmother, answered Sires\u2019 knock on the apartment door. Sires told her that the [petitioner] was a suspect in a robbery that had just occurred and that they wanted her consent to search the apartment. She consented and pointed out the [petitioner\u2019s] room for them. In that room, Viele and Sires observed two dark jackets, one on the bed and the other on the floor, which were similar to the jackets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>worn by the alleged robbers. The jackets later were determined to belong to the [petitioner] and Minor. The officers continued to search the bedroom, but the [petitioner] was not there. In that bedroom, there was a closet about six feet high and four to five feet wide, with sliding doors, one to each side. ... As he stood up from examining the right side of the closet, Viele saw a piece of jewelry in front of a stack of clothes on a shelf. It was \u2018very bright,\u2019 it was \u2018gold with clear stones\u2019 and \u2018red colored stones on it,\u2019 and the face of the ring . . . had an inscription of . . . the Virgin Mary. No gun was found during that search.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\u201cThe police did not locate the [petitioner] that night, but apprehended him several days later on February 26, [1997]. He posted a bond, and his trial was eventually set to begin on April 21, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">\u201cIn March, 1998, while the [petitioner] was still out on bond, Elliot was with her mother in her mother\u2019s car on Glade Street when the [petitioner] approached the car. He apologized to \u2018her for sticking [Russell] up when [she] was with him,\u2019 and he told her that \u2018he wanted to be friends\u2019 and that \u2018he was stupid for doing it.\u2019 Later, on April 20, 1998, after Russell had been subpoenaed to attend court on that day, which was when the [petitioner\u2019s] trial was scheduled to commence, the [petitioner] pulled up in a car as Russell was coming out of his house. The [petitioner] got out and started to speak with Russell. After Russell told him that he had been subpoenaed, the [petitioner] \u2018asked him not to go to court and if [he] did to give a false statement.\u2019 He also told Russell that \u2018if [Russell] [needed] any money, he [would] give it to [him] and anything [he] wanted or needed or whatever.\u2019 Russell rejected the [petitioner\u2019s] offer. The next day, Russell told Joseph Zampano of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office about this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\u201cOn the day that the [petitioner] had approached Russell, i.e., April 20,1998, the [petitioner] called Elliot\u2019s mother and told her that he knew that she and Elliot had been subpoenaed to go to court the next day. He talked to her about their not saying they were sure it was him, and he wanted to know if Elliot had talked to the state\u2019s attorney. She said that Elliot had spoken with the state\u2019s attorney. He then wanted to know what Elliot had told the state\u2019s attorney, and her mother said that she did not know. The [petitioner] said that he \u2018needed\u2019 to know what she said \u2018so he knew what he would be walking up against when he came into the courtroom.\u2019 He went on to say that \u2018it is not like I\u2019m going to do anything to you guys, I just want to know what I am walking up against when I go into the courtroom.\u2019 Elliot\u2019s mother said that she did not know what her daughter had said as she was not in the room with her. The [petitioner] then asked her if Elliot was home because he wanted to speak with her. She replied that Elliot was not home. The next day Elliot\u2019s mother reported this by telephone to Zampano at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201cOn April 21,1998, the [petitioner] went to court, but before his case was called for trial, he left the courthouse and did not return. The police found him on May 21, 1998, in New Haven and he was rearrested.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">After the petitioner\u2019s judgments of conviction were affirmed on appeal, the petitioner, representing himself, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on December 11, 2005. His habeas counsel, Damon A. R. Kirschbaum, filed a second amended petition on December 29, 2006. In the second amended petition, the petitioner alleged that (1) his trial counsel, Jerald S. Barber, had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, (2) his appellate counsel, also Barber, had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel and (3) the state had improperly failed to disclose material information at the criminal trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>habeas trial was held on the matter on September 10, 2007. At the outset of the proceedings, the court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for permission to file a third amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court then heard testimony from the petitioner and Barber. The court, <em>Swords, J., </em>by memorandum of decision filed November 26, 2007, denied the habeas petition on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that Barber\u2019s performance was deficient as trial counsel or as appellate counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 6, 2007, the habeas court denied the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">When confronted with a denial of certification to appeal, we must determine whether this ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). \u201cA petitioner satisfies that substantial burden by demonstrating that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Solman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>99 Conn. App. 640, 643, 916 A.2d 824, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 901, 918 A.2d 888 (2007). If the petitioner can show that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, then the petitioner must demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits. See <em>John-sons. Commissioner of Correction, </em>285 Conn. 556, 564, 941 A.2d 248 (2008). To determine whether the court abused its discretion, we must consider the merits of the petitioner\u2019s underlying claims. <em>Taylor v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>284 Conn. 433, 449, 936 A.2d 611 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The petitioner first asserts that the court improperly dismissed his numerous claims that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">\u201cFor the petitioner to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s mistakes, the result of the proceeding would have been different,.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McClendon </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>93 Conn. App. 228, 230, 888 A.2d 183, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 917, 895 A.2d 789 (2006); see also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \u201cIn a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McClellan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>103 Conn. App. 159, 161, 927 A.2d 992 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The petitioner claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to introduce evidence of a drug dealing relationship between the petitioner and Russell. At the criminal trial, the petitioner testified that he had not robbed Russell but that Russell, in fact, had given the petitioner the jewelry as payment for a debt. The petitioner maintains that Barber should have allowed him to testify that Russell sold drugs for him and owed him money for drugs that were missing. The habeas court found that \u201cBarber and [the] petitioner had extensive discussions on the issue of whether [the] petitioner should <em>testify </em>and the pros and cons of this testimony. [The] petitioner insisted that he wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>give the jury his own explanation for his possession of Russell\u2019s property. This explanation included a description of the drug dealing relationship between Russell and himself. Barber, however, advised [the] petitioner that his testimony about a drug debt owed to him by Russell ran the risk the jury would convict him notwithstanding any weaknesses in the state\u2019s case but merely because he was a drug dealer.\u201d Consequently, the habeas court found that \u201cBarber thoroughly discussed the issue with the petitioner and weighed the potential benefit against any harm to the petitioner\u2019s case. The criminal trial transcript indicates that the absence of the evidence did not damage [the] petitioner\u2019s defense, and the introduction of the evidence would likely have been prejudicial. Thus, Barber exercised sound professional judgment in deciding against taking an unnecessary risk, and this court will not second-guess that trial strategy.\u201d The decision not to disclose the drug dealing relationship between the petitioner and Russell was guided by professional judgment, and we cannot say that the decision was so unsound as to constitute ineffective assistance. \u201cWe consistently have declined to second-guess such decisions.\u201d <em>Beverly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>101 Conn. App. 248, 252, 922 A.2d 178, cert. denied, 283 Conn. 907, 927 A.2d 916 (2007). Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Next, the petitioner claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to introduce a transcript of a telephone conversation between the petitioner, Russell and Elliot\u2019s mother in order to impeach Russell, Elliot and her mother with evidence of their relationship to the petitioner. The court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim because it found that (1) the petitioner failed to prove that the transcript would have been admitted at trial and (2) the transcript did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>affirmatively establish that the petitioner had a relationship with Russell, Elliot and her mother prior to the robbery. The court found that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was prejudiced when his trial counsel did not offer the transcript to impeach Russell and Elliot\u2019s mother. The transcript does not necessarily show any relationship between Elliot\u2019s mother and the petitioner prior to the time that the robbery occurred. Although the transcript may provide evidence that Russell knew the petitioner prior to the robbery, it could not be used to impeach Russell irrefutably because Russell admitted knowing the petitioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8 Had the transcript of the telephone conversation been admitted into evidence at the criminal trial, it would, with some degree of reasonable probability, likely have had virtually no impact, viewed in the entirety of the evidence, and would not have produced a different verdict. Our review of the record reveals that the petitioner did not present any credible evidence demonstrating that his trial counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The petitioner also maintains that his trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance by not requesting jury instructions on lesser included offenses. Specifically, the petitioner asserts that (1) his trial counsel should have permitted him to decide whether to request a lesser included offense charge and (2) to the extent that requesting a lesser included offense charge was a strategic decision for counsel to make, his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request such a charge. The court credited Barber\u2019s testimony that he had discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>using a lesser included offense charge with the petitioner, as he does with all his clients, and that the petitioner did not argue with his trial strategy. Barber also testified that not requesting a lesser included offense was a strategic decision based on the fact that the state\u2019s evidence on the elements of use of force and larceny was weak. Barber adopted a strategy designed to obtain a full acquittal on the robbery charge; the petitioner denied guilt and claimed that Russell had voluntarily given him the items to pay a debt. The habeas court specifically did not credit the petitioner\u2019s testimony that he did not discuss whether to include a lesser included offense charge in the jury instructions. The petitioner\u2019s argument that the decision to include a lesser included offense should be made solely by the defendant in a criminal case is unpersuasive. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to request a lesser included offense instruction does not necessarily deprive a defendant of reasonably effective assistance of counsel. ... It may be sound trial strategy not to request a lesser included offense instruction, hoping that the jury will simply return a not guilty verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 404, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 107 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989). If the decision to not request a lesser included offense instruction may be part of the overall trial strategy to obtain a not guilty verdict, then clearly this decision is in the realm of strategy decisions to be made by the attorney. In this case, the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel stated that his decision not to request instructions on lesser included offenses was based on the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence as well as the strength of the state\u2019s case. The petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason. Given the usual deference courts must afford to trial counsel\u2019s decisions when reviewing such claims, we cannot conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>the court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification as to this claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The petitioner also asserts that the court improperly dismissed his claims that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to file a petition for certification to appeal to the Supreme Court after this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgments of conviction. The court rejected this claim because there were no issues in the appeal worthy of certification. Under our rules, \u201c[c]ertification by the supreme court on petition by a party is not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion and will be allowed only where there are special and important reasons therefor. ...\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 84-2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sole issue presented in the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was that the trial court improperly restricted his cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses regarding their bias and motive for testifying. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 359-60. This issue was routine, the decision of this court was not in conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>with any other decision, and this court was unanimous in affuming the trial court\u2019s judgments. Certification was unlikely. Moreover, the petitioner conceded at the habeas trial that he could not prove to a reasonable probability that had the Supreme Court considered his appeal, the outcome would have been different. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s claim fails under both <em>Strickland </em>prongs. Because the petitioner has not met his burden under Strickland, this claim is not debatable among jurists of reason, a court could not resolve it in a different manner and it is not adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. Accordingly, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to file a petition for certification to appeal to our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The petitioner\u2019s final claim is that the court abused its discretion in denying certification to appeal as to whether the court abused its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for permission to file a third amended petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We begin our analysis of the petitioner\u2019s claim by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cWe will not disturb a habeas court\u2019s grant or denial of permission to amend a pleading in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>263 Conn. 453, 472, 820 A.2d 1009 (2003). Practice Book \u00a7 23-32 states: \u201cThe petitioner may amend the petition at any time prior to the filing of the return. Following the return, any pleading may be amended with leave of the judicial authority for good cause shown.\u201d \u201cWhile our courts have been liberal in permitting amendments . . . this liberality has limitations. Amendments should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>be made seasonably. Factors to be considered in passing on a motion to amend are the length of delay, fairness to the opposing parties and the negligence, if any, of the party offering the amendment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hasan </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>27 Conn. App. 794, 798, 609 A.2d 1031, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 917, 614 A.2d 821 (1992). On the day of the habeas trial, more than seven months after the return was filed, the petitioner filed a motion to amend his petition for the third time, alleging instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Prior to filing his motion to amend his petition for the third time, the petitioner had ample time in which he could have sought the court\u2019s permission to amend his petition to include a new claim of prosecutorial impropriety. Instead, the petitioner sought to amend his petition on the day that the habeas trial was set to commence. The court, in the exercise of its discretion, denied the petitioner\u2019s motion to amend. In view of the last minute filing and the failure to show good cause, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues raised with regard to the court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus or its denial of his motion to amend his petition for the third time are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve encouragement to proceed further. Having failed to satisfy any of these criteria, the petitioner cannot demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-11\"> The petitioner was found not guilty of a fifth charge, larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\"> At the habeas trial, the petitioner withdrew a claim of prosecutorial impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\"> When asked about his relationship with the petitioner, Russell stated that he knew the petitioner: \u201cI know his voice and eyes.

Juries are generally instructed <em>to </em>consider the greater charge first and to consider lesser included offenses only if they find the defendant not guilty of the greater charge. Because the jury in this case found the defendant guilty of the greater charge, at least in theory, the jury would not have reached lesser offenses in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 84-2 states: \u201cCertification by the supreme court on petition by a party is not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion and will be allowed only where there are special and important reasons therefor.
