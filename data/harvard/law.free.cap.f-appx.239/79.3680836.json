Gutierrez-Oliva preserves for further review his contention that his sentence is unreasonable because this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rulings have effectively reinstated the mandatory Sentencing Guideline regime condemned in <em>Booker. </em>Gutierrez-Oliva concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Gutierrez-Oliva further argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 41-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">Gutierrez-Oliva\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Gutierrez-Oliva properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
