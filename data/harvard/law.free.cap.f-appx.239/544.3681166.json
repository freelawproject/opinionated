No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">We first address McKenzie\u2019s argument that application of the armed career criminal enhancement, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). McKenzie contends that prior convictions that qualified him as an armed career criminal were not alleged in his indictment nor proven to the jury and that, as a result, the district court erred in increasing his sentence beyond the ten-year statutory maximum penalty for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). McKenzie concedes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), \u201cis an impediment to his arguments\u201d; but he asserts that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>only permits judicial fact-finding about the existence of pri- or convictions and does not allow \u201cqualitative factual determinations\u201d about prior convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">McKenzie failed to raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence in the district court; so we review his claim only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, McKenzie must establish \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, [we] may then exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>McKenzie has failed to show error here. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>reaffirmed this principle from <em>Apprendi: </em>\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>which remains binding precedent, \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005); see <em>also United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law \u201cuntil the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). The government is not required to prove the nature of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, a district court can find facts about both the existence and the nature of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>Because we continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in using McKenzie\u2019s convictions to enhance his sentence as an armed career criminal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">McKenzie next argues that a certified copy of a printout of his prior convictions was not \u201cconstitutionally sufficient\u201d to prove his prior convictions. Again, because McKenzie failed to raise this argument before the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Because McKenzie failed to challenge his prior convictions used to enhance his sentence, we see no merit in McKenzie\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We turn to McKenzie\u2019s assertion that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not consider adequately the sentencing factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). McKenzie contends that the district court should have considered that he has struggled with drug addiction and that he is a deportable alien who will be subject to harsh prison conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Because McKenzie was sentenced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We conclude that McKenzie\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated his Guidelines imprisonment range as 235 to 293 months; and the district court sentenced McKenzie to the lowest point of that range. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). The Supreme Court has recently explained that \u201ca court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In addition, McKenzie\u2019s sentence was far less than the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Brame, </em>997 F.2d 1426, 1428 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The district court indicated that it determined McKenzie\u2019s sentence after considering statements of the parties, the advisory Guidelines, and the section 3553(a) factors. The district court also stated that McKenzie\u2019s sentence was appropriate and reasonable and that sentencing him to the lowest point of his advisory Guidelines range provided a sentence that was sufficient for punishment and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The district court judge was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). Based on the factors outlined in section 3553(a) and our review of the record, we conclude that McKenzie has not carried his burden of establishing that his 235-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-12\">. Because McKenzie did not object to the convictions listed in his PSI that supported his enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal, McKenzie admitted those facts. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). About his criminal history, McKenzie only objected to assigning criminal history points for two misdemeanor cases that, McKenzie acknowledged, \u201cdon't impact [his] classification as an armed criminal.\u201d McKenzie also admitted at sentencing that he \u201cqualifie[d] as an armed career criminal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\">. To the extent that McKenzie challenges the application of the 180-month mandatory minimum of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), we reject this argument as without merit. After <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences, <em>see Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2420, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002); and the Supreme Court has not overruled that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
