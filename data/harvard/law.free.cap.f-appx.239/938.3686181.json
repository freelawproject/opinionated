We pretermit the question whether Heli-Mejia\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">The district court may modify an imprisonment term when a defendant has been sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). This court reviews the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">Heli-Mejia contends that his sentence should be reduced because of the adoption of Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines; he invokes <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reiterates the arguments asserted in the district court with respect to the determination of his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-24\">Amendment 591 does not lower the guidelines range applicable to Heli-Mejia. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Vol. II, Amend. 591. Amendment 591 does not apply to the determination of base (or specific) offense levels within the applicable offense guideline section or to any consideration of relevant conduct. <em>See id. </em>Amendment 591 makes clear that the sentencing court should determine the applicable offense guideline section in Chapter Two of the Sentencing Guidelines based only upon the offense charged in the indictment for which the defendant was convicted (or upon an offense stipulated as part of a plea agreement), assisted by the Statutory Index. <em>Id.; see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2(a) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.1). Because Heli-Mejia was charged with and convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 846, \u00a7 2D1.1 is the applicable offense guideline section. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. A (Statutory Index) (1991); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.4 (1991). Heli-Mejia\u2019s offense level was determined under \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>abuse its discretion in denying Heli-Mejia\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. The appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
