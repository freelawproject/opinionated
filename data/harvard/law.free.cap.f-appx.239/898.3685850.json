Smith argues that the evidence merely shows that he was present at a known crack house when authorities executed a search warrant and that it fails to establish that he actually or constructively possessed cocaine base found in the house. Our review of the evidence shows that a rational juror could have concluded that Smith constructively possessed cocaine base by exercising control over rocks of cocaine base found during the execution of the search warrant. <em>United States v.
