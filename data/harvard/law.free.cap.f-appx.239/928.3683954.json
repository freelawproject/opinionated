Loyola argues that the BIA violated his procedural due process rights when it refused to exercise its discretion to accept his out-of-time appellate brief. The brief was submitted several days late and was accompanied by an untimely request for an extension of the filing time.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">The relief sought by Loyola (namely, an adjustment of status to that of a legal permanent resident) is discretionary in nature and is not afforded due process protection. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent that Loyola argues that the BIA erred in affirming the denial of an adjustment of status, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Wilmore v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 524, 528-29 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
