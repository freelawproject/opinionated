In 2002, an immigration judge (IJ) determined that Rivas De Williams was not eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Before the BIA, the Government moved for summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision. In 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-23\">In 2006, Rivas De Williams filed a notice of appeal from the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief, which the BIA construed as a motion to reopen or reconsider its 2004 decision. The BIA denied the motion based on its determination that Rivas De Williams was statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because \u00a7 212(a) does not contain a ground of inadmissibility comparable to the ground for which she was removable, citing <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 722, 724-29 (BIA 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-24\">The Government argues that Rivas De Williams\u2019s PFR is untimely relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>any challenge of the BIA\u2019s 2004 decision affirming the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief. The BIA\u2019s 2004 affirmance and its 2006 denial of reopening are two separate final orders, each requiring their own PFRs. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). The limitations period for filing a PFR \u201cbegins to run when the BIA complies with the terms of federal regulations by mailing its decision to petitioner\u2019s address of record.\u201d <em>Ouedraogo v. INS, </em>864 F.2d 376, 378 (5th Cir.1989). While Rivas De Williams\u2019s PFR was timely filed with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of reopening, the PFR is not timely as to the BIA\u2019s 2004 affirmance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Rivas De Williams\u2019s arguments insofar as they challenge the merits of the BIA\u2019s 2004 decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(5); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki, </em>997 F.2d at 111. In any event, the errors asserted by Rivas De Williams relating to the 2004 decision would now be inconsequential in light of the BIA\u2019s determination in denying reopening that Rivas De Williams was statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief on the independent ground that her basis for removal was not comparable to any basis for inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), this court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of reopening. <em>See De La Paz Sanchez v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 133, 134 (5th Cir.2006). Rivas De Williams does not raise any arguments challenging the BIA\u2019s treatment of her notice of appeal as a motion to reopen or reconsider or the BIA\u2019s reasoning for denying reopening. Therefore, she has waived any such challenges. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Although Rivas De Williams contends that she is statutorily eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because she has served less than five years in prison for aggravated felony convictions, the import of the BIA\u2019s comparability determination is that she is statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief irrespective of the amount of prison time she served.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">For the first time, Rivas De Williams contends in this court that she has been treated in bad faith during her proceedings before immigration judges and the BIA, was not allowed to enter evidence during a hearing before an immigration judge, was denied copies of records of proceedings, and was allowed only one continuance to obtain an attorney. While these complaints may be construed as a due process challenge based on fundamental unfairness, Rivas De Williams has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to these complaints. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). A petitioner\u2019s due process claims are subject to the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1252(d)(1) when they relate to procedural errors that are correctable by the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Because Rivas De Williams\u2019s due process complaints allege procedural errors correctable by the BIA, her failure to exhaust her arguments deprives this court of jurisdiction to review them. <em>See id. </em>In any event, her arguments are unavailing because she has no due process right to either discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c) or a hearing to determine eligibility for such relief. <em>Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 610 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Nguyen v. Dist. Dir., Bureau of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, </em>400 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Rivas De Williams also argues that she was denied due process because she was not served with the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief. That alleged error relates to the denial of her eligibility for relief under \u00a7 212(c). Therefore, it is likewise not entitled to due process protection. <em>See Gutierrez-Morales, </em>461 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>610. Furthermore, insofar as Rivas De Williams\u2019s complaint of bad faith includes an argument that the BIA violated her due process rights in deciding her motion to reopen, such an argument is unavailing because the denial of a motion to reopen does not implicate a Fifth Amendment due process right. <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Rivas De Williams also asserts a claim relating to the apparent revocation of her bond. Even if jurisdiction existed to review such a claim, this court does not do so because the administrative record contains no documentation relating to any such revocation. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 391 n. 15 (5th Cir.2001) (recognizing that a court reviewing an agency decision should not go outside of the administrative record); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
