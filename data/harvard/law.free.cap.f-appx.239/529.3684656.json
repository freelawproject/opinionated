For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In March 2006, a grand jury returned an indictment against Lyle, charging her with six counts of making false claims against the U.S., in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, and four counts of fraudulent use of another person\u2019s identification with the intent to make a false claim against the U.S., in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The indictment stemmed from a criminal enterprise that began in or about January 2000 and continued until approximately June 2002. Lyle perpetrated the scheme by offering to assist friends, acquaintances, and family members in filing their federal income tax returns and obtaining their personal information. After receiving these individuals\u2019 personal information (including their social security numbers), Lyle filed tax returns in their names using false information regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>employment, earnings, income tax withheld, and tax credits. In several instances, Lyle filed tax returns using the names and social security numbers of these persons without their knowledge or authorization. In many of the tax returns, Lyle applied for a refund anticipation loan (\u201cRAL\u201d) on behalf of the purported taxpayer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the RAL applications, Lyle instructed the bank to pay the RAL proceeds either by issuing a check to an address where she, a friend, or a relative resided, or by depositing the proceeds into bank accounts in the names of herself, a friend, or a relative. And in several of the tax returns, Lyle directed the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to deposit the claimed refunds into bank accounts held in her name or in the name of a friend or a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">During an IRS investigation, Lyle told investigators that her cousin, Rene Cook, was responsible for all of the questionable returns. Betsy Smith, a friend of Lyle\u2019s, also told investigators that Rene Cook was responsible for the false returns. Upon being informed that providing false information to federal investigators was a felony, Smith recanted her statement, said that Cook was not responsible for the returns, and said that Lyle had instructed her to blame Cook. Smith also admitted that she had granted Lyle permission to deposit tax refunds into her account, that she followed Lyle\u2019s instructions regarding when and how to withdraw the funds, and that she had cashed two refund checks on Lyle\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Lasetta Jackson, Lyle\u2019s sister, told investigators that she allowed Lyle to use her bank account to receive tax refunds and that she had cashed one refund check for Lyle. Likewise, Lyle\u2019s mother, Rosetta Kemp, told investigators that she allowed Lyle to use her bank account to receive tax refunds. Kemp also stated that on at least one occasion, Lyle drove her to the bank and instructed her regarding how much money to withdraw. After withdrawing the funds from their respective bank accounts, Smith, Jackson, and Kemp gave all of the money to Lyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Lyle pleaded guilty to the indictment in its entirety without a plea agreement. The probation office then prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), determining that Lyle\u2019s offense level was 19 based on, <em>inter alia, </em>a 2-level enhancement for the \u201cunauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification to produce or obtain any other means of identification,\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), and a 2-level enhancement for being an organizer, leader, or manager in a criminal offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Based on a criminal history category of I, Lyle\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Lyle raised four objections to the PSI, two of which are relevant to the instant appeal: an objection to the identification enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) and an objection to the aggravating-role enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. At a sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Lyle\u2019s objections and sentenced her to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment as to each count, to run concurrently; three years of supervised release; a $1,000 special assessment; and restitution in the amount of $74,419 to be paid to the IRS. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On appeal, Lyle argues that the district court erred in overruling her objections to the identification and aggravating-role enhancements. We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Clear error is present when \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the district court. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">A. Identification Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.1(b)(10)(C)(i), a defendant receives a 2-level enhancement to her offense level if the offense conduct involved \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any means of identification.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.1(b)(10)(C)(i). \u201c[T]he term \u2018means of identification\u2019 refers to any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u201d social security number or access device. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(A)). An \u201caccess device\u201d includes, among other things, any \u201caccount number\u201d that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1). The Application Notes to \u00a7 2B1.1 set forth examples of the types of conduct to which the identification enhancement applies, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">A defendant obtains an individual\u2019s name and social security number from a source (e.g., from a piece of mail taken from the individual\u2019s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual\u2019s name. In this example, the account number of the bank loan is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(C)(ii)(I)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Here, Lyle argues that the district court erred in applying this identification enhancement on the basis of the RALs because RALs are not \u201cmeans of identification\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">Lyle obtained the names and social security numbers of various persons under the guise of aiding them with fifing their federal income tax returns, and, often without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>these persons\u2019 knowledge or permission, Lyle filed fraudulent tax returns using these persons\u2019 names and social security numbers. Based on falsely-claimed refunds in these tax returns, Lyle applied for and obtained RALs (bank loans) in these persons\u2019 names. Thus, Lyle used two means of identification \u2014 the names and social security numbers of unsuspecting persons who had not given their authorization \u2014 to unlawfully obtain another means of identification \u2014 RALs with associated account numbers in these persons\u2019 names. In our view, Lyle\u2019s conduct is not meaningfully distinguishable from that described in the Application Notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(C)(ii)(I)). Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error in applying the identification enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">B. Aggravating-Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 2-level enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). A \u201cparticipant\u201d in the offense \u201cis a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1). In determining whether the defendant acted as an organizer or leader of the offense, the court may consider factors such as, <em>inter alia, </em>the exercise of decision making authority, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.4). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). And the government need only prove the defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On appeal, Lyle argues that the Government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of other participants in her offense of conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Smith, Jackson, and Kemp told IRS investigators that (1) Lyle recruited<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> them to allow the use of their bank accounts for the direct deposit of fraudulently obtained tax refunds; (2) Lyle instructed them regarding when to withdraw the funds and how much of the funds to withdraw; and (3) after withdrawing the fraudulently obtained funds from their respective bank accounts, they gave all of the money to Lyle at her direction. Moreover, Smith stated that Lyle instructed her to lie to IRS investigators, and she admitted that she endorsed and cashed two of the fraudulent refund checks at Lyle\u2019s direction. And Smith, Jackson, and Kemp each allowed Lyle to file at least two fraudulent tax returns in their names. On this record, we conclude that the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Smith, Jackson, and Kemp were \u201crecruited\u201d by Lyle as \u201cparticipants\u201d in Lyle\u2019s criminal enterprise, Lyle exercised control and authority over these participants in carrying out the aims of the criminal enterprise, and Lyle retained a larger share (indeed, all) of the fruits of the crime. Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error by imposing a 2-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>hancement to Lyle\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. Upon receipt of an RAL application, a bank contacts the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\u201d) to verify that a tax return matching the applicant has been filed. After a match is verified, the bank issues a loan to the applicant in an amount equal to the refund claimed on the applicant\u2019s tax return. The loan is secured by a pledge of the taxpayer's anticipated refund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">.
