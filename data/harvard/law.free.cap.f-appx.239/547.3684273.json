The racketeering charge was based on predicate acts that included robbery, murder, and dealing of controlled substances. Specifically, Romero admitted to being involved in two second degree murders of rival gang members, one of which involved a chase and shootout on the interstate. Romero argues on appeal that the district eourt erred by departing upwardly from a high-end guidelines sentence of 327 months to an imposed sentence of 400 months under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14 based on the danger Romero\u2019s crimes created for the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s application of a departure, we review the district court\u2019s (1) legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>(2) factual findings for plain error, and (3) departure for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 907, 912 (11th Cir.1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court may depart from the guidelines under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) if \u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described [in the guidelines].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">[We have] established a three-part test for reviewing an upward departure under Section 3553(b): First, was the aggravating circumstance taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the Guidelines? Second, if adequate consideration was not given to the circumstance, was consideration of the circumstance consistent with the goals of the sentencing guidelines? If the circumstance was properly taken into account, was the extent of the departure from the guidelines range reasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-16\"><em>United States v. Briggman, </em>931 F.2d 705, 709-10 (11th Cir.1991). With regard to the first two questions, the Sentencing Commission included a list of circumstances, which it did not incorporate into guidelines controlling offense level or erim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>inal history calculations, but which may be appropriate bases for departure, including U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14. <em>United States v. Dempsey, </em>957 F.2d 831, 834 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14, a district court may depart upwardly \u201c[i]f national security, public health, or safety was significantly endangered\u201d by the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.14. Generally, the conduct must have posed a threat \u201csubstantially in excess of that ordinarily involved in the offense.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>957 F.2d at 834. In determining whether it did so, the district court may consider \u201call pertinent facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>F.3d at 913. In <em>Dempsey, </em>we affirmed an upward departure where the defendant possessed explosive devices \u2014 pipe bombs and grenades\u2014 that, by their nature, \u201cwere so dangerous, indiscriminate, anti-personnel [sic] and capable of seriously injuring a number of people at one time[,]\u201d that they constituted a danger to the public safety. <em>Dempsey, </em>957 F.2d at 834. Moreover, we held that the upward departure from an high-end sentence of 27 months to an imposed sentence of 60 months was reasonable in light of the 10 year statutory maximum and the \u201cindiscriminate and uniquely dangerous propensity of pipe bombs and grenades.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Here, because Romero created a danger to the public by (1) shooting at rival gang members on public streets and (2) being involved in an interstate chase and shootout with rival gang members, the district court did not err by imposing an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. We have held that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) did not change our review of application of the guidelines. <em>United States v.
