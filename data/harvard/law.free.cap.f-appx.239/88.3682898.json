Montano asserts that the district court erred by relying on the presentence report (PSR) to make a determination that his prior Oregon conviction for delivery of a schedule II controlled substance is a felony drug trafficking offense meriting a 12-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Review of the district court\u2019s conclusion that a prior conviction has been sufficiently proven for sentence enhancement purposes is de novo. <em>United, States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1410 (5th Cir.1993). The judgment of Montano\u2019s prior conviction establishes that Montano pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with delivery of a schedule II controlled substance, a Class B felony. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>962 F.2d 1161, 1167-69 (5th Cir.1992). Montano\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a felony and a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2; thus, the district court committed no error in enhancing Montano\u2019s sentence. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Montano asserts that the district court did not comply with Fed.R.CrimP. 32(i)(l)(A) because it did not directly inquire of him whether he had read the PSR. He urges this court to follow precedent from other circuits that mandates reversals and resentencing for such Rule 32 noncompliance. As Montano concedes, his challenge is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Esparza-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 272, 273-74 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
