For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The probation officer petitioned for the revocation of Canham\u2019s supervised release for violating the law based on a June 6, 2006 arrest for two counts of computer theft; violating the law in connection with three automobile sales where Canham failed to provide title and destroyed, removed, concealed, encumbered, or transferred property subject to a security interest; failing to notify his probation officer within 72 hours of his arrest; and failing to truthfully answer all inquiries by the probation officer, as the intended victim of Canham\u2019s computer theft offense did not receive a full refund as Canham had reported to the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Canham denied the allegations, and both parties presented evidence and made arguments as to an appropriate punishment by the district court, the government seeking a 24-month sentence, and Canham seeking in-house arrest, some alternative incarceration other than straight jail time, or supervised release. After hearing the evidence and arguments, the district court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">I do find that Mr. Canham is in violation of the terns of his supervised release for the reasons alleged in the petition. He has sold vehicles and failed to provide title. He has sold property subject to a security interest. Having later made some insufficient, I might add, attempt to rectify that certainly doesn\u2019t excuse the original offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">I find that he failed to notify his probation officer of his arrest in Forsyth County, and that those were discovered by the probation officer, not disclosed by him, and in reviewing the probation report, I find that he failed to answer truthfully on numerous occasions, and, of course, has been cited for probation violations a number of times in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">He continued to operate a used motor vehicle dealership after the voluntary surrender of his license. He was cited by the Secretary of State based on fraud and misrepresentation and unprofessional conduct, and as a result of those violations, Mr. Canham, I\u2019m going to sentence you to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for 24 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">I would impose a lengthy term of supervised release after that if I were authorized to but I\u2019m not----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">. Neither party raised any objections, although the government noted that Can-ham had a right of allocution before the sentence was imposed. The district court gave Canham an opportunity to speak, noting that it would reconsider the sentence if Canham provided anything in mitigation. Personally addressing the court, Canham explained the reasons and motivations for his actions, and expressed concern about his daughter. The district court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-17\">Well, I\u2019m truly sorry about your daughter, Mr. Canham. I did review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>judgment of the court awarding you custody, and it did seem there were problems there with your former wife, the child\u2019s mother, but in view of all the harm you\u2019ve caused, I still think that\u2019s an appropriate sentence, and I think you should have taken all that into consideration before you told these lies to the probation officer and defrauded and sold vehicles in violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On appeal, Canham argues that the district court did not demonstrate a sufficient evaluation of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He contends that the district court was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to indicate that it had consider those factors, and that its failure to do either was error. We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Unreasonableness may be procedural, when the court\u2019s procedure does not follow the requirements of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or substantive. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Upon finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, the district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering various factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Specifically, the district court must consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the applicable Guidelines or policy statements; (4) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; (6) and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)). The district court is also required to consider, but is not bound by, the advisory policy statements of Chapter 7 of the Guidelines concerning violations of supervised release. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We recently considered a case where the district court failed to mention explicitly that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and we did not hold that this failure warranted vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944-45 (11th Cir.2007). Instead, we looked to the record to see if the district court did, in fact, consider factors relevant to \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing the sentence. <em>See id. </em>Recently the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), which requires the sentencing judge to state his reasons for imposing a particular sentence, only requires that the district court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>thority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 208 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Under <em>Dorman, </em>the district court\u2019s failure to state explicitly that it considered the \u00a7 3558(a) factors does not make its sentence unreasonable. <em>See Dorman, </em>488 F.3d at 944-45. Taken as a whole, the district court\u2019s comments set forth above reflect that its concern when imposing the sentence was the actions underlying Can-ham\u2019s supervised release violations. Although the district court did not address each argument advanced by the parties, the record reflects that the district court considered the evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments, which raised issues relevant to a number of the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the nature and circumstances of the offense. The record also reveals why the district court selected a 24-month sentence \u2014 Canham\u2019s conduct underlying the supervised release violations and the harm that conduct caused. We therefore hold that the record reflects that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">To evaluate the substantive reasonableness of Canham\u2019s sentence, we consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2007). \u2018When reviewing the length of a sentence for reasonableness, we will remand for resentencing if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1363. \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because our review is not de novo.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363 (citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Canham\u2019s 24-month sentence was the statutory maximum sentence applicable following the revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court explained its 24-month sentence based on the totality of Canham\u2019s conduct and the harm he caused. Upon review of the proffered and actual testimony presented at the revocation hearing and the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we hold that the sentence is reasonable. In view of the evidence before the district court, the district court\u2019s reliance on Canham\u2019s supervised release violations and the resulting harm caused by his actions, even without more extensive explanation than the district court provided, fails to establish that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">In light of the foregoing, Canham\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. Before the district court, Canham argued for a lesser punishment than the 24-month sentence imposed by the court, but did not object on the ground that the court did not consider adequately the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We need not decide whether our review of Canham\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim is for reasonableness or plain error in this case, because Canham's claim fails under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
