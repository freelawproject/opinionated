Fiorani, Jr., petitions for a writ of error coram nobis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (2000). In his petition and supplement (\u201cErrata\u201d), Fiorani alleges that his conviction is unconstitutional and seeks an order from this court vacating his conviction. The relief sought by Fiorani is not available under \u00a7 1651, but is properly pursued through a motion to vacate pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We note that Fiorani has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, and must therefore obtain authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000) to file a successive motion before a second or successive motion may be considered by the district court. Accordingly, although we grant Fiorani leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the coram nobis petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
