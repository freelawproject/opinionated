As Hess is not seeking to appeal from the final order in a habeas proceeding, Hess does not need a COA. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). A COA is therefore denied as unnecessary. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In 1994, Hess was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child. <em>See Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 214 (5th Cir.2002). He was sentenced to 15-years imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Hess\u2019s first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his conviction and sentence was filed in April 1997. <em>See id. </em>In October 1997, that \u00a7 2254 petition was dismissed as time-barred. <em>See id. </em>In 2002, this court found that the application of the time-bar was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 216. In the Rule 60(b) motion, filed in April 2006 and unfiled by the district court, Hess was attempting to challenge the October 1997 judgment dismissing his first \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. Hess\u2019s purported Rule 60(b) motion in a closed case was \u201ca meaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d with no statutory or legal basis. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). As such, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In September 2006, this court denied Hess\u2019s third petition for leave to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application and issued a sanctions warning. <em>In re Jeffrey Hess, </em>No. 06-10718 (5th Cir. Sept. 7, 2006) (unpublished). Because this appeal was pending prior to imposition of the sanctions warning, we decline to impose a monetary sanction at this time. However, Hess is again CAUTIONED that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
