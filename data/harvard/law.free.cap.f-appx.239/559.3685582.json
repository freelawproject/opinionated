For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b581-26\">In 2001, Baxter pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The U.S. Probation Office prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which stated that Baxter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>offense of conviction was a Class C felony with a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. Because of his lengthy criminal history, the PSI assigned Baxter a criminal history category of VI. Thereafter, the district court sentenced Baxter to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 36 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">On April 14, 2006, Baxter was released from prison and began his term of supervised release. On June 2, 2006, the district court issued an order to show cause as to why Baxter\u2019s supervised release should not be revoked, charging that Baxter had violated the conditions of his release by failing to report for drug testing and by being arrested for simple battery. On July 6, 2006, the district court issued an amended show-cause order, charging Baxter with making untruthful statements to his probation officer and knowingly associating with a convicted felon. The district court found that Baxter had violated his supervised release and sentenced him to 4 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 32 months of supervised release, with the first 4 months to be served in home confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Baxter was released from prison in October 2006, and on December 22, 2006, the district court issued a summons and order to show cause as to why Baxter\u2019s supervised release should not be revoked. The show-cause order alleged that Baxter had violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to report to his probation officer within 72 hours of his release from prison, making untruthful statements to his probation officer, leaving the Northern District of Georgia without permission, failing to submit to drug testing, and testing positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">During the revocation hearing on January 8, 2007, Baxter conceded the violations, but stated that he had recently found secure employment, that he could comply with the requirements of supervised release, and that he would be willing to live in a halfway house to get his life organized. Baxter\u2019s counsel noted that the probation officer had recommended that the terms of Baxter\u2019s supervised release include placement in a halfway house for 4 months with electronic-bracelet monitoring. Baxter\u2019s counsel further noted that the 4 months of home confinement the court had ordered in October 2006 had not been executed because Baxter did not have a home. In response, the Government objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation regarding the halfway house and electronic monitoring and asked the court to sentence Baxter to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Upon finding that Baxter violated the terms of his supervised release, the district court revoked the remainder of his release and sentenced him to 20 months\u2019 imprisonment. Regarding the sentence, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">That is the maximum sentence I am able to sentence you to, as I understand it, under the present sentencing guidelines. I don\u2019t think that the guideline range is adequate to address your situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">The history of your supervised release shows that you will not comply with the conditions of your supervised release, you\u2019ve repeatedly failed to comply, you have continued your drug use, you have failed to submit for drug testing on a number of occasions which indicates there may be several other occasions in which you\u2019ve been using drugs. You have a significant criminal history, several of the offenses involve violence. Most of these offenses were committed while you were on some sort of probationary sentence similar to supervised release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The last time you were revoked was the result of a new criminal offense which was an assault on a former girlfriend who the court had instructed you not to I believe have contact with. So I think the only way to go, one, resolve this and, two, to protect the community, is to sentence you to the 20 months with no supervised release to follow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The court then asked Baxter\u2019s counsel if he had \u201cany objection to the sentence or the manner in which it was imposed?\u201d Baxter\u2019s counsel responded that he did and stated that \u201cI respectfully suggest that the sentence that you imposed is not reasonable under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)].\u201d The court replied \u201cI understand\u201d and informed Baxter of his right to appeal his sentence. The court then asked the Government if it objected to the sentence, and the Government responded that it did not. Baxter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">On appeal, Baxter argues that the district court failed to elicit objections after imposing sentence as required by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir. 1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), and failed to sufficiently indicate on the record that it had considered the Sentencing Guidelines before imposing the sentence. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">A. Compliance with <em>Jones</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Pursuant to <em>Jones, </em>\u201cafter imposing a sentence, the district court must give the parties an opportunity to object to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the manner in which the sentence is pronounced, and must elicit a full articulation of the grounds upon which any objection is based.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102). The objection-elicitation requirement serves two purposes: \u201c(1) a well-made objection may permit the court to cure an error, perhaps avoiding the need for appeal; and (2) an objection may narrow the issues on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>971 F.2d 675, 681 (11th Cir.1992). \u2018Where the district court has offered the opportunity to object and a party is silent or fails to state the grounds for objection, objections to the sentence will be waived for the purpose of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201cwill not entertain an appeal based upon such objections unless refusal to do so would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">When a district court fails to elicit objections after imposing sentence, \u201cwe normally vacate the sentence and remand to the district court to give the parties an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347. \u201cA remand is unnecessary, however, when the record on appeal is sufficient to enable review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And this court has recently clarified that the <em>Jones </em>rule applies to supervised-release revocation proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">In <em>Jones, </em>this court held that the objection-elicitation requirement could have been satisfied in that case \u201cif the [district] court, after pronouncing sentence, had asked counsel whether there were <em>any objections </em>\u2014 to <em>the sentence or to the manner in which the court pronounced it </em>\u2014 other than those previously stated for the record.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102 (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Neely, </em>979 F.2d 1522 (11th Cir.1992), we held that \u201cthe district court followed our instructions in <em>United States v. Jones </em>\u201d by asking \u201cthe parties whether they had <em>\u2018any objection to the sentence or the manner in which the sentence was </em>pronounced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neely, </em>979 F.2d at 1523 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>we held that the <em>Jones </em>rule was satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>where the district court stated \u201care there any exceptions to the findings made in the sentencing hearing?\u201d 983 F.2d 221, 225-26 (11th Cir.1993). In <em>United States v. Maurice, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he district court complied with <em>Jones </em>by asking for objections after imposition of the sentence.\u201d 69 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1995). And in <em>United States v. Ramsdale, </em>we held that <em>Jones </em>was satisfied where the district court asked \u201canything else ..'. necessary in this resentencing,\u201d and defense counsel stated an objection in response, thereby demonstrating that he understood the court to be eliciting objections. 179 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Baxter argues that the district court failed to comply with the objection-elicitation requirement of <em>Jones </em>because the district court faded to ask if Baxter had any objections to the court\u2019s \u201cultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">After imposing the sentence, the district court asked Baxter\u2019s counsel if he had \u201cany objection to the sentence or the manner in which it was imposed?\u201d Baxter\u2019s counsel replied \u201cI do. I respectfully suggest that the sentence that you imposed is not reasonable under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d Thus, not only did the district court specifically asked defense counsel if he had <em>any </em>objection to the <em>sentence, </em>the court <em>also </em>asked if defense counsel had <em>any </em>objection to \u201cthe manner in which [the sentence] was imposed,\u201d which, necessarily includes any factual or legal bases upon which the district court relied in imposing the sentence. Nothing in the record' indicates that the district court\u2019s request for objections was limited solely to objections based on the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Furthermore, nothing in our case-law construing <em>Jones </em>requires that the district court specifically ask a party whether he objects to the court\u2019s \u201cultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>See Wilson, </em>983 F.2d at 225-26 (holding that <em>Jones </em>was satisfied where the district court asked \u201care there <em>any exceptions </em>to the findings made in the sentencing hearing?\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Maurice, </em>69 F.3d at 1557 (\u201cThe district court complied with <em>Jones </em>by <em>asking for objections </em>after imposition of the sentence.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Ramsdale, </em>179 F.3d at 1324 (holding that the district court\u2019s inquiry of \u201canything else ... necessary in this resentencing\u201d satisfied <em>Jones </em>where defense counsel stated an objection in response). Again, as long as \u201cthe district court <em>has offered the opportunity to object,\u201d </em>the <em>Jones </em>rule is satisfied. <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103 (emphasis added). Indeed, as stated above, in <em>Neely </em>we held that <em>Jones </em>was satisfied where the district court \u201casked the parties whether they had <em>\u2018any objection to the sentence or the manner in which the sentence was pro</em>nouncedi,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Neely, </em>979 F.2d at 1523 (emphasis added), which is nearly identical to the question the district court posed during Baxter\u2019s revocation hearing. Because the district court provided Baxter with an opportunity to lodge any objection to the sentence and the bases upon which the district court relied in imposing that sentence, we conclude that the <em>Jones </em>rule was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">B. On-the-Record Consideration of the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Baxter next argues that the \u201cdistrict court failed to state on the record its conclusions regarding its calculations under the sentencing guidelines,\u201d so that his sentence is \u201cinvalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">We review the legality of a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Pla, </em>345 F.3d 1312, 1313 (11th Cir.2003). But where, as here, the defendant failed to raise an issue in the district court, we review only for plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>error. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) an error has occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003). If all three conditions are met, this court may, in its discretion, notice and correct the forfeited error, but only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, 398 </em>F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir. 2006). Factors to consider include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cOne of the factors a court <em>must </em>consider ... is ... the sentencing <em>range </em>established [by] ... the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1318 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)) (emphasis added). \u201cFor sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, the recommended sentencing range is based on the classification of the conduct that resulted in the revocation and the criminal history category applicable at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to the term of supervision.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348-49 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.4). But because \u201cthe Guidelines have always been advisory for sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release,\u201d it is enough \u201cthat there be some indication that the district court was aware of and considered the Guidelines, which requires the court to consider the sentencing <em>range </em>established under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Section] 3553 requires a court only to <em>consider </em>the Chapter Seven policy statements in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release. If the defendant commits a Grade C violation of the terms of his supervised release (that is, a federal, state, or local offense punishable by one year of imprisonment or less, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3)), the defendant had a criminal history category of VI at the time of his original conviction, and the district court revokes the defendant\u2019s release as a result, the Guidelines range is 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Where the defendant\u2019s original conviction was a Class C felony, the total sentence imposed upon revocation cannot exceed 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). And this court has held that the aggregation of <em>all periods </em>of post-revocation imprisonment cannot exceed this statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Williams, 425 F.3d 987, 989 (11th </em>Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">On appeal, Baxter argues that the district court failed to state the Guidelines imprisonment range, and, therefore, this court cannot determine whether the district court accurately calculated the Guidelines range or whether the district court complied with its duty to consult and consider the Guidelines. To that end, he contends that \u201cthe court compounded the problem by offering ambiguous comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>regarding the guidelines\u201d and making \u201ccontradictory assertions,\u201d requiring the parties \u201cto guess whether or not the court followed its obligation to correctly calculate the sentencing guidelines range.\u201d Although he concedes that both his attorney and the Government stated that the Guidelines range was 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment during the revocation hearing, he asserts that the district court was required to \u201cexplicitly\u201d state its Guidelines calculation. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Because the district court revoked Baxter\u2019s supervised release as a result of a Grade C violation, and Baxter had a criminal history category of VI at the time of his original bank robbery conviction, the resulting Guidelines range was 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Baxter\u2019s bank robbery conviction was a Class C felony, the district court could not impose aggregate periods of post-revocation imprisonment exceeding 2 years (24 months). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>Williams, </em>425 F.3d at 989. Following the district court\u2019s first revocation of Baxter\u2019s supervised release in July 2006, the court imposed a sentence of 4 months\u2019 imprisonment. As a result, following the instant revocation, the district court could only impose a sentence of 20 months\u2019 imprisonment so as not to exceed the 2-year (24-month) statutory maximum provided under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In this light, the district court\u2019s statement that 20 months\u2019 imprisonment was \u201cthe maximum sentence\u201d it could impose \u201cunder the present sentencing guidelines\u201d was in reference to the statutory maximum set forth in \u00a7 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">And although the district court never \u201cexplicitly\u201d stated that Baxter\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range was 8 to 14 months, the court\u2019s statement that \u201cI don\u2019t think that the guideline range is adequate to address [Baxter\u2019s] situation\u201d and its imposition of a sentence that exceeded that range demonstrate that, as required by <em>Campbell, </em>the court \u201cconsider[ed] the sentencing range established under the Guidelines[,]\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, there is \u201csome indication that the district court was aware of and considered the Guidelines\u201d in imposing Baxter\u2019s sentence, which, under <em>Campbell, </em>is all that is required. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Furthermore, even if we were to conclude that the district court\u2019s statements were insufficient to demonstrate that it \u201cconsidered\u201d the Guidelines range, we nonetheless hold that such \u201cerror\u201d was harmless, as Baxter has not shown that the \u201cerror\u201d affected his substantial rights. In sentencing Baxter to the statutory maximum of 20 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court considered Baxter\u2019s history and characteristics and the need to protect the public (per \u00a7 3553(a)), determined that the Guidelines range was inadequate, and concluded that the maximum sentence (pursuant to \u00a7 3583(e)) of 20 months\u2019 imprisonment was warranted. Specifically, the court considered (1) Baxter\u2019s repeated failures to comply with the conditions of his previous terms of supervised release; (2) his continued drug use; (3) his failure to report for drug testing; (4) his significant criminal history; (5) his commission of numerous violent offenses during probationary periods similar to supervised release; and (6) the resulting need to protect the community from Baxter\u2019s conduct. Nothing in the record evinces that either the district court\u2019s consideration of these factors or the sentence imposed in light of these factors was \u201cinvalid\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>See Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. And it is clear from the record that regardless of the sentencing range suggested under the Guidelines, the district court still would have sentenced Baxter to the statutory maximum of 20 months\u2019 imprisonment. As such, Baxter has failed to dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>onstrate that the district court plainly-erred in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">III.
