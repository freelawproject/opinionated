Schipke raised numerous claims pertaining to perceived injustices regarding her medical treatment and the conditions of her detention and sought an order for injunctive relief modifying the conditions of her detention. The district court held that Schipke had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition. As an initial matter, this court recognizes that a prisoner cannot avail herself of habeas corpus relief when seeking injunctive relief that, as in this case, is unrelated to the cause of her detention. <em>See e.g., Rourke v. Thompson, </em>11 F.3d 47, 49 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cHabeas corpus is not available to prisoners complaining only of mistreatment during their legal incarceration.\u201d <em>Cook v. Hanberry, </em>592 F.2d 248, 249 (5th Cir.1979). Allegations that challenge the fact or duration of confinement are properly brought in habeas petitions, while allegations that challenge rules, customs, and procedures affecting conditions of confinement are properly brought in civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>actions. <em>See Spina v. Aaron, </em>821 F.2d 1126, 1127-28 (5th Cir.1987); see <em>also Cook v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice Transitional Planning Dept., </em>37 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Since none of the claims raised by Schipke challenge the fact or duration of her confinement and none, if prevailed on, would entitle her to accelerated release, Schipke\u2019s claims are not cognizable in a habeas action, but should have been raised in a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); <em>see Spina, </em>821 F.2d at 1127-28. Nevertheless, Schipke would not have prevailed on her claims even if the district court had construed her suit as arising under <em>Bivens, </em>since the exhaustion requirement also applies to <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>See Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 525, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">A federal prisoner must exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking purely injunctive relief under <em>Bivens. See Rourke v. Thompson, </em>11 F.3d 47, 49 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cExceptions to the exhaustion requirement are appropriate where the available administrative remedies either are unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought, or where the attempt to exhaust such remedies would itself be a patently futile course of action.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Rich, </em>11 F.3d 61, 62 (5th Cir.1994). Exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and Schipke bears the burden of demonstrating the futility of administrative review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The record demonstrates that Schipke has not exhausted the administrative remedies provided by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10-542.19. Further, Schipke has failed to carry her burden of showing that administrative remedies are either unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought or that exhausting her claims through the administrative process would be futile. The judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED. Schipke\u2019s motion for an expedited appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
