California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Parker has not filed a response. Counsel avers that Parker has served his term of incarceration and is not being supervised. Based on our review of the record and counsel\u2019s representations, we conclude that there is no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847-48 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
