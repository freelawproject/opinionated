We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Davis v. Knipp, </em>No. 1:07-cv-00388-JFM, 2007 WL 1308843 (D. Md. filed May 1, 2007; entered May 2, 2007). We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
