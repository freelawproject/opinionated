The district court imposed a 262-month sentence consisting of a total of 142 months as a career offender on Counts 1 and 3 and a consecutive 120 months on Count 2. Reed\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging Reed\u2019s sentence on Counts 1 and 3 but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Reed was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\">Counsel questions whether the district court violated Reed\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by classifying Reed as a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2005), where the predicate convictions were not charged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>doubt. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Reed\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
