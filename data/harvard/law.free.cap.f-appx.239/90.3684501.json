He argues that his sentence should be vacated and the case should be remanded for resentencing because it is unclear whether he was sentenced pursuant to an advisory guidelines scheme or a mandatory guidelines scheme in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-26\">De Leon-Hernandez has been released from prison and removed from the United States. Because De Leon-Hernandez is barred from returning to the United States and there is no indication that he has waived his right to be present for resentencing, his challenge to the validity of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>v.
