On December 11, 2006, the Supreme Court vacated that judgment and remanded the case for our reconsideration in light of its decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). On remand and following this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381 (5th Cir.2007), we hold that Mendoza\u2019s release from prison and presumed subsequent deportation render us incapable of granting him the relief he seeks. We therefore dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">On February 19, 2004, Mendoza pleaded guilty to the violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which forbids the re-entry of deported aliens whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony. Because Mendoza was previously convicted of possession of cocaine, an aggravated felony under Texas law, the district court enhanced his sentence by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Mendoza was sentenced to three years imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">Mendoza appealed to this court, contending that the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines was in error and challenging the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Our precedent foreclosed both claims, and we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision on August 15, 2005. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Torres, </em>145 Fed.Appx. 888 (5th Cir.2005). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and, in light of its recent opinion in <em>Lopez, </em>remanded the case to this court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-19\">In <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that a state felony conviction for mere possession of a controlled substance does not amount to an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and therefore does not qualify for sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. 127 S.Ct. at 629-33. As a result of this decision, the government concedes that Mendoza\u2019s enhanced sentence was miscalculated. Nevertheless, the government maintains that this appeal is moot because our precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>will not permit this court to grant Mendoza any relief by way of re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Mendoza served his three-year term of imprisonment and was released July 31, 2006. He is still subject to the three-year supervised release component of his sentence until approximately July 31, 2009. On remand, Mendoza requests that this court vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. We agree with both parties that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lopez, </em>Mendoza\u2019s sentence was miscalculated. This court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rosenbaum, </em>however, dictates that Mendoza\u2019s presumed deportation renders us unable to grant Mendoza relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The facts in <em>Rosenbaum </em>are notably similar to those in the case at bar. Like Mendoza, Rosenbaum had a prior conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance and his sentence was enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Rosenbaum, </em>483 F.3d at 382. Rosenbaum served the full term of his imprisonment and was subsequently deported, though he was subject to a supervised release component at the time of his appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 383. The <em>Rosenbaum </em>court concluded that under Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, re-sentencing requires that a defendant be present and have the opportunity to allocute. <em>Id. </em>Thus Rosenbaum\u2019s deportation and inability to reenter the country legally made his re-sentencing impossible, and Rosenbaum\u2019s appeal was ruled moot and dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Mendoza argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352 (5th Cir.2006), dictates a different result. In <em>Rosenbaum, </em>however, we distinguished Rosenbaum\u2019s appeal from that presented in <em>Lares. </em>483 F.3d at 383. We explained that Lares did not seek re-sentencing because he conceded that any sentencing error was harmless; thus he sought no relief that the court could not grant. <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Rosenbaum, </em>Mendoza is seeking relief by way of re-sentencing. Accordingly, Mendoza\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Lares, </em>and <em>Rosenbaum </em>controls this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Mendoza further argues that <em>Rosenbaum </em>conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Campos-Serrano, </em>404 U.S. 293, 92 S.Ct. 471, 30 L.Ed.2d 457 (1971), and <em>Church of Scientology of California v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). <em>Rosenbaum </em>was made in the face of both decisions and is controlling in this circuit. This court may not overrule the judgment of another panel, absent an <em>en banc </em>or intervening Supreme Court decision. <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Finally, Mendoza maintains that he may waive his presence at the re-sentencing hearing and allow this proceeding to move forward <em>in absentia. </em>As we explained in <em>Rosenbaum, </em>this argument is not compelling, because no such waiver has been presented to the court and the possibility of a future waiver is speculative. <em>See Rosenbaum, </em>483 F.3d at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">We therefore DISMISS Mendoza\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
