When he filed his second petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, he was serving his sentence at FCI-Allenwood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>As he unsuccessfully argued in his direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Kennedy, </em>133 <em>F.3d </em>53, 55 (D.C.Cir.1998), Kennedy claimed in his petition that the Government failed to show service of the information beyond a reasonable doubt. He also argued the following: (1) he is \u201cactually, factually innocent of his life sentence\u201d; (2) he is actually innocent of the crimes charged in the indictment; (3) he suffered a miscarriage of justice at sentencing; (4) there were irregularities and improprieties in the indictment; (5) the District of Columbia District Court lacked jurisdiction over District of Columbia crimes; (6) the District Court improperly enhanced his sentence; (7) his right of confrontation was denied; (8) he suffered a miscarriage of justice \u201cwith respect to the unconstitutionality of armed career and career offender act and statute\u201d in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (9) the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) is fundamentally unfair and unconstitutional; (10) his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel; (11) the District Court improperly instructed the jury; and (12) \u201ca life sentence on counts one through four were unauthorized under The Hobbs Act and 924(c) counts under 18 use \u00a7 3559(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">The District Court, concluding that Kennedy had raised the same claims in his first \u00a7 2241 motion, held that its earlier analysis, <em>see Kennedy v. USP Allenwood Warden, </em>No. 05-2561, 2006 WL 126984 (M.D.Pa. Jan.17, 2006), applied. Specifically, the District Court noted that it had dismissed the earlier petition because Kennedy had not shown that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective remedy. The District Court further stated that there was no evidence that Kennedy had pursued further relief in the sentencing court through a \u00a7 2255 motion or otherwise. Accordingly, on July 28, 2006, the District Court dismissed Kennedy\u2019s second \u00a7 2241 petition as it had dismissed his first \u2014 without prejudice to Kennedy\u2019s right to seek authorization in the appropriate court of appeals to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Kennedy filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that he had evidence that he had sought relief in the sentencing court. He showed that he had filed an \u00a7 2244 application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had denied it. While his motion for reconsideration was pending, he instituted an appeal by filing a notice of appeal. By order of the Clerk, Kennedy\u2019s appeal was stayed pending resolution of the motion for reconsideration. On October 26, 2006, the District Court granted Kennedy\u2019s motion for reconsideration and vacated its order of July 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Also on October 26, 2006, the District Court reconsidered the \u00a7 2241 petition in an \u201camended order,\u201d noting Kennedy\u2019s unsuccessful \u00a7 2244 application, but again dismissing Kennedy\u2019s petition. The District Court explained that Kennedy\u2019s personal inability to file another \u00a7 2255 motion was not enough to show that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective. Kennedy filed another motion for reconsideration and another notice of appeal. He captioned the notice of appeal as an \u201camended notice of appeal,\u201d and specified therein that he appealed from the October 26, 2006 order dismissing his petition. Shortly thereafter, on November 15, 2006, the Clerk of this Court sent a letter to the District Court Clerk, notifying the District Court that the new notice of appeal would be considered an amendment in the above-captioned case and no new appeal would open. By Clerk\u2019s order dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>November 16, 2006, this case was stayed pending resolution of Kennedy\u2019s second motion for reconsideration. On January 18, 2007, the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We subsequently considered Kennedy\u2019s appeal and summarily affirmed the District Court\u2019s October 26, 2006 order dismissing Kennedy\u2019s petition. <em>See Kennedy v. Warden, USP Allenwood, </em>217 Fed.Appx. 179 (3d Cir.2007) (non-precedential opinion). Briefly stated, the District Court was without jurisdiction to consider Kennedy\u2019s claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Kennedy could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because a motion to challenge his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">After we ruled on Kennedy\u2019s appeal of the October 26, 2006 order, Kennedy timely filed this appeal of the January 18, 2007 order denying his motion for reconsideration. The Government asks that we summarily dismiss this appeal, contending that we have already affirmed the order at issue. We did not previously consider the January 18, 2007 order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(B)(ii). Accordingly, we deny the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Nonetheless, we will dismiss Kennedy\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Kennedy\u2019s appeal is without merit in fact or law. Not only did he present no basis for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s October 26, 2006 order, but he also filed his appeal of the order denying the motion for reconsideration after we had explained to him why the October 26, 2006 order was correct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-18\">. Without applying to this Court for permission to do so, the Bureau of Prisons recently transferred Kennedy to a federal prison in Indiana. Nonetheless, we retain jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See Goodman v.

Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 441, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004); <em>Ex parte Endo, </em>323 U.S. 283, 307, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
