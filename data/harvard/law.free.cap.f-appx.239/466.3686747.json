We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Ellis filed a <em>pro se </em>civil action against the BOP, United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Records Department, and stated that he was invoking the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Ellis alleged that the BOP held him for three years beyond his correct release date. He contends that, while he was in state custody awaiting sentencing on state charges in September 1992, he was taken into federal custody pursuant to a federal indictment. The district judge sentenced Ellis to 137 months of imprisonment on November 18, 1992, and, on November 24, 1992, he received a seven-year sentence for the state charges, Ellis argues that his state sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence. He also alleges that he was committed to federal custody until February 17, 1994, when the BOP transferred him to state custody after realizing he had been erroneously designated as a federal prisoner. Ellis argues that, when he completed his state sentence on July 2, 1996, the BOP erroneously determined that his federal sentence began on that date and did not grant him credit for the prior time that he had spent in federal custody. Consequently, he contends that his federal sentence was increased by fifteen months. Rl-1 at 6. Ellis alleges that he previously filed two actions raising his claims in federal court but that he was denied relief in both. Ellis sought compensatory damages of $1,000,000 and punitive damages of $1,000,000. In support of his claim, Ellis attached the docket sheet from his federal conviction, which indicates that the execution of his sentence began on January 10,1993, and the transfer order of February 17, 1994. Rl-1, attached exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The district judge, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed Ellis\u2019s action as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The judge noted that Ellis\u2019s action initially was construed as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and ordered that the action be converted into a civil rights action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), because Ellis invoked the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 and sought only damages. The district judge then granted Ellis <em>in forma pauperis </em>status and screened his action pursuant to \u00a7 1915A. The judge took notice that the Middle District of Pennsylvania, in denying a \u00a7 2241 petition brought by Ellis raising the same claim, concluded that any time Ellis had spent in federal custody erroneously was credited to his state sentence and that Ellis was not entitled to have his state and federal sentences run concurrently. Rl-3 at 4; <em>see Ellis v. True, </em>No. 4:CV-97-1511 (M.D.Pa. Dec. 30, 1997), <em>aff\u2019d </em>164 F.3d 621 (3d Cir.1998). The district judge also found that Ellis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>raised the same claim in at least two successive \u00a7 2241 petitions that were both denied. Rl-3 at 4; <em>see Ellis v. United States, </em>No. 5:02-cv-165 (M.D.Fla. Aug. 12, 2002); <em>Ellis v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 1:04-cv-00015 (N.D.Fla. Sept. 16, 2005). The judge concluded that Ellis\u2019s claim was \u2018\u201cindisputably meritless\u2019 \u201d because he failed to show that his sentence was invalid or called into question and that, in fact, his challenges to his sentence had been \u201csoundly rejected.\u201d R1-3 at 5. Accordingly, the district judge dismissed Ellis\u2019s action as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">On appeal, Ellis argues that the district judge erred by characterizing his claim as a <em>Bivens </em>action. He contends that the issue is the BOP\u2019s error in its designation process, not the unconstitutionality of his confinement. Ellis also argues that the district judge did not properly examine the record before concluding that his claim was without merit because he provided sufficient support for his claim. The government did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Under \u00a7 1915A, a district judge must review a prisoner\u2019s civil complaint against a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity to identify cognizable claims or to dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). Similarly, a district judge must dismiss an appeal taken <em>in forma pauperis </em>if, at any time, the judge determines that the action is \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201cmalicious,\u201d or \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Because we review a district judge\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion, <em>Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002), we will review a district judge\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous .under \u00a7 1915A for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201c[a] determination of frivolity is best left to the district court\u201d); <em>Rice v. Baker, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 902, 903 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (reviewing the district judge\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A for an abuse of discretion). An action is frivolous if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal, </em>251 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Bivens </em>established the availability of a cause of action for monetary damages against federal officials in their individual capacities based on a violation of a federal constitutional right. 403 U.S. at 395-97, 91 S.Ct. at 2004-05. <em>Bivens </em>involved alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has extended <em>Bivens </em>to actions alleging violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 242\u201444, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2275-76, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979). <em>Bivens </em>actions may not be asserted against federal agencies. <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXU\">in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\"><em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Thus, if entering judgment in fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>vor of the prisoner \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [the prisoner\u2019s] conviction or sentence[,]\u201d a district judge must dismiss the complaint unless the prisoner demonstrates that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. We have held that <em>Heck </em>applies with equal force in a <em>Bivens </em>action filed by a federal prisoner. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As an initial matter, the district court properly considered Ellis\u2019s claim under <em>Bivens. </em>In his complaint, Ellis sought monetary damages from individuals in the Records Department of the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s federal penitentiary in Atlanta for committing an error that resulted in illegal confinement in violation of his due process rights. The district judge correctly found that <em>Bivens </em>is the appropriate cause of action for such a claim. <em>See Davis, </em>442 U.S. at 242-44, 99 S.Ct. at 2275-76. To the extent that Ellis argues he sought monetary damages against the BOP itself, a federal agency, such a claim is not cognizable under <em>Bivens, see Meyer, </em>510 U.S. at 486, 114 S.Ct. at 1005-06, and Ellis did not meet the requirements of raising a claim for monetary damages against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2675(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that Ellis\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim was without arguable merit. Ellis claims that he has remained in federal custody beyond his release date because his federal sentence should have run concurrently with a state sentence that he also received and because the BOP failed to credit his federal sentence with time he spent in a federal prison during which he should have been in a state prison. A ruling in favor of Ellis, concluding that individuals in the BOP were hable for illegally confining him, would necessarily imply that his federal sentence was invalid on the grounds that it should have run concurrently with his state sentence or because he did not receive proper credit for time previously served. Therefore, to succeed on his <em>Bivens </em>claim, Ellis must first prove that his sentence has been invalidated or at least \u201ccalled into question.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Ellis has not made such a showing; instead, he admits that his previous challenges to his sentence have failed. Ellis raised the same arguments regarding his sentence to various district courts through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petitions, and each district court rejected his arguments. <em>Ellis v. True, </em>No. 4:CV-97-1511 (M.D.Pa. Dec. 30, 1997); <em>Ellis v. United States, </em>No. 5:02-cv-165 (M.D.Fla. Aug. 12, 2002); <em>Ellis v. Ashcroft, </em>No 1:04-cv-00015 (N.D.Fla. Sept. 16, 2005). One district judge specifically found that Ellis was not entitled to have his sentences run concurrently or to receive credit on his federal sentence for the time he served in federal prison because the time was credited to his state sentence. <em>Ellis, </em>No. 4:CV-97-1511, at 7. In view of these prior rulings and the absence of any evidence that his sentence has been invalidated or called into question, Ellis cannot meet the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Heck. </em>Therefore, the district judge did not abuse his discretion by concluding that Ellis\u2019s claim was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Ellis argues on appeal that the district judge erroneously treated his complaint as a <em>Bivens </em>action and, consequently, concluded that his claim had no merit. As we have explained, the judge correctly analyzed Ellis\u2019s allegations. Accordingly, the district judge\u2019s dismissal of Ellis\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. To the extent that Ellis attempts to bring a claim for monetary damages against the BOP for the actions of its employees, such a claim should be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <em>et seq. </em>For a district court to have jurisdiction over an FTCA action, a plaintiff must first show that he presented his claim to the agency and that the agency denied it in writing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Burchfield v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1252, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1999). Because Ellis presented no evidence that he met this requirement, the district court did not have jurisdiction over any claim for monetary damages against the BOP as an agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
