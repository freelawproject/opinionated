Gaines was sentenced by the district court to a total of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Gaines filed a pro se supplemental brief, contending the district court erred in its application of the Sentencing Guidelines, the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement, and his counsel provided ineffective assistance. The Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">Because Gaines did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review any alleged Rule 11 error for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-26 (4th Cir.2002). To establish plain error, Gaines must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005). We have reviewed the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-21\">Gaines next contends that the district court erred in its application of the Sentencing Guidelines. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">Initially, Gaines argues that he does not satisfy the criteria for enhancement as a career offender. As Gaines was over eighteen years old at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>committed the instant controlled substance offense, and was previously convicted of assault on an officer while resisting arrest and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, we conclude Gaines was appropriately sentenced by the district court as a career offender. Gaines also argues that the court erred in determining his criminal history category. However, because Gaines was a career offender, his placement in category VI was required by <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(b) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Next, Gaines contends that the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement by making a sentencing recommendation to the court. \u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cIt is well-established that the interpretation of plea agreements is rooted in contract law, and that \u2018each party should receive the benefit of its bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 413 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 506 (4th Cir.1993)). \u201cA central tenet of contract law is that no party is obligated to provide more than is specified in the agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Accordingly, \u201cthe government\u2019s duty in carrying out its obligations under a plea agreement is no greater than that of \u2018fidelity to the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fentress, </em>792 F.2d 461, 464 (4th Cir.1986)). As the agreement is silent on the issue of sentencing recommendations, we conclude Gaines cannot establish that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is settled that a defendant alleging the Government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement bears the burden of establishing that breach by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Gaines finally contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the plea agreement and presentence report. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is generally not cognizable on direct appeal, but should instead be asserted in a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999). However, we have recognized an exception to the general rule when \u201cit \u2018conclusively appears\u2019 from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir.1994)). Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective, we conclude Gaines\u2019s claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
