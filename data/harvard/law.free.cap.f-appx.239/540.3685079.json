Berdugo-Castro was one of 8 crew members of a small vessel transporting approximately 1,200 kilograms of cocaine. On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by denying him a mitigating-role reduction at sentencing, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, to reflect his minimal or minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-26\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>factual finding to be reviewed only for clear error, and the defendant bears the burden of proof. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937, 939 (11th Cir.1999). The guidelines provide for a two-level reduction for a minor participant, which is defined as a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. (n.5). To determine whether a minor-role reduction applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which the defendant has been held accountable. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940-41. The district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45. In doing so, the district court should look only to other participants who are identifiable or discernable from the evidence, who are involved in the conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In this case, Berdugo-Castro and 7 other crew members knowingly helped transport 1,2000 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 a substantial amount of drugs \u2014 on board a vessel, and he was held accountable for this conduct. Further, he did not present any evidence to indicate that his conduct was less culpable than that of the other crew members. Berdugo-Castro\u2019s role in the offense was identical to his relevant conduct, and he failed to show that he was less culpable than other identifiable participants in the offense. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that BerdugoCastro did not qualify for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
