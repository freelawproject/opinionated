In their brief before this Court, however, petitioners raise no argument regarding the denial of their motion to reopen; rather, they challenge the BIA\u2019s decision of November 9, 2005, affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of their applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed more fully below, we dismiss the petition, in part, and deny, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). By statute, an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). An order of removal becomes final upon, <em>inter alia, </em>the dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549. \u2018We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Because Petitioners did not file their petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s November 9, 2005 decision, and because the filing of a motion to reopen does not toll this statutory period, we lack jurisdiction to review the November 9, 2005 decision and therefore dismiss the petition as it relates to that decision. Although we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s August 21, 2006 decision denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, Petitioners have abandoned any claim of error as to that decision by failing to challenge it in their brief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that where a petitioner fails to raise arguments regarding the issue on appeal, that issue is deemed abandoned). Accordingly, as to that order, their petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part; DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Petitioners seek asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that they suffered past persecution from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia on account of their political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
