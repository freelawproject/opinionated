Mitchell, Jr. (\u201cMitchell\u201d), was under investigation for outstanding tax liabilities for 2001 and 2002. The investigation was conducted by Chandy Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d), a revenue agent for the Internal Revenue Service. On August 10, 2006, Thomas issued an administrative summons to Bank of America requesting copies of \u201call records, including signature cards, bank statements, deposit slips, checks deposited\u201d between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005 pertaining to Mitchell. Notice of the summons was given to Mitchell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>On August 25, 2006, Mitchell filed a petition to quash the summons. The district court denied Mitchell\u2019s petition and Mitchell\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">A review the denial of a petition to quash begins by determining whether the government has established a <em>prima facie </em>case pursuant to the four factors articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). The <em>Powell </em>court stated that in order for the IRS to enforce a summons, it must demonstrate that: (1) the basis for the underlying investigation is legitimate, (2) the investigation\u2019s relevancy causally relates to that basis, (3) the IRS does not already possess the information being sought, and (4) the administrative procedures established by the Internal Revenue Code have been adhered to. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248. \u201cThe government\u2019s minimal burden at this stage can be fulfilled by a \u2018simple affidavit\u2019 by the IRS agent issuing the summons.\u201d <em>Mazurek v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir. 2001). The government has met this burden as Thomas has submitted a declaration outlining the history of the case and asserting facts meeting the above factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Because the government has established a <em>prima facie </em>case \u201cwe assess whether the opponent of the summons fulfills his \u2018heavy\u2019 burden of rebutting the proponent\u2019s case by either undermining the proponent\u2019s contentions regarding any of the <em>Powell </em>factors or by demonstrating that enforcement of the summons would result in an \u2018abuse\u2019 of the court\u2019s process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mitchell has provided nothing beyond conclusory assertions that the <em>Powell </em>factors are not met and has provided no support for his claim that the summons was issued in bad faith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is insufficient to satisfy his heavy burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Mitchell additionally argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying the petition to quash without holding an adversary hearing. We have held that \u201cbefore a taxpayer is entitled to the adversary summons enforcement hearing, he \u2018must raise in a substantial way the existence of substantial deficiencies in the summons proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>628 F.2d 875, 879 (5th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>United States v. Newman, </em>441 F.2d 165, 169 (5th Cir.1971)). Mitchell\u2019s conclusory assertions do not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">Lastly, we note that Mitchell\u2019s arguments regarding sovereign and qualified immunity are not relevant to his petition to quash the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Mitchell\u2019s petition to quash the summons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b78-18\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">. \u201cA summons is issued in bad faith if it is issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer, to force the taxpayer to settle a collateral suit or for the sole purpose of gathering evidence for a criminal prosecution.\" <em>United States v. Harris, </em>628 F.2d 875, 879 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
