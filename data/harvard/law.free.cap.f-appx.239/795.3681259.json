The district court sentenced Spivey to an aggregate of 420 months of imprisonment under the then-mandatory federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">We previously affirmed Spivey\u2019s conviction, but vacated his sentence, and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). At resentencing, the district court sentenced Spivey to concurrent 360-month terms of imprisonment on Counts 1, 2, and 3, and a consecutive 60-month term of imprisonment on Count 4, for an aggregate 420-month term of imprisonment, the same sentence imposed originally. Spivey again appeals, contending that his sentence is unreasonable based upon the district court\u2019s failure to enunciate which particular 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), factors it considered in imposing sentence. He also challenges this Circuit\u2019s post-<em>Booker </em>standard of review, asserting that the use of the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness in review of sentences that are within the advisory guideline range is a Sixth Amendment violation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">As a preliminary matter, Spivey does not challenge the calculation of his advisory guidelines sentencing range. Rather, he asserts his sentence is unreasonable. We have repeatedly held that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>guideline range is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Spivey\u2019s contention that a within-guidehne sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness is unavailing because a panel may not overrule another panel. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346 (4th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Given that Spivey does not challenge the advisory guideline range in his case, coupled with his failure to provide evidence to overcome the presumption of reasonableness we accord such a sentence, we reject Spivey\u2019s claim of unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Moreover, while the district court did not enunciate each \u00a7 3553(a) factor it considered prior to imposing sentence on Spivey, the court did specifically refer to <em>Booker </em>and to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at the resentencing hearing, stating that it specifically considered those factors. It adopted the findings in the presentence report, stating that they were credible and reliable, and it stated that in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court considered the guidelines range and other relevant guideline factors. The court was familiar with Spivey\u2019s history and background, having presided over his trial. Also, the court had sentenced Spivey originally and was familiar with the details of Spivey\u2019s case from the initial sentencing hearing. Spivey\u2019s presentence report outlined his offense conduct and his criminal history. Finally, Spivey took the opportunity to argue at length about the strength of the evidence against him during the resentencing hearing, providing additional information about the nature and circumstances of his offense prior to the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">The sentencing court \u201cneed not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record ... particularly ... when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Rather, we can evaluate whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly based on the context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation. <em>See Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 381. We find that the district court here fully complied with the mandates of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>and that Spivey\u2019s sentence was reasonable and not in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Spivey\u2019s sentence. Given that Spivey is represented by counsel, we deny his motion to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\"> To the extent Spivey is objecting to this court\u2019s review standards, such a challenge appropriately is made to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
