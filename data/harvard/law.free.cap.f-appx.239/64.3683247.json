He challenges the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). Because an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling prior precedent is required to alter this court\u2019s precedent, the grant of certiorari in <em>Rita </em>has no impact on this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). And now the Supreme Court has decided <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. 2456 (2007), upholding the rule of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-22\">Bennett\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is entitled to great deference. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). But aside from that deference, because of this record and because the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that Bennett has failed to demonstrate that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 519-20. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b87-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
