Konan appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. The district court dismissed Konan\u2019s complaint on the grounds that Konan failed to adequately state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection Clause and that his Due Process claim was barred by collateral estoppel. After having reviewed the record, we find that, pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Konan\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Konan\u2019s claims seek redress for injuries caused by his disbarment by the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board, an administrative agency of the Supreme Court of Virginia. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 54.1-3910 (Michie 2005). While the Disciplinary Board is not itself a state court, the form of the proceeding is not determinative under Rooker-Feldman; rather, it is the nature, character, and effect of the proceedings themselves that is controlling. <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303. In <em>Feldman, </em>the Supreme Court took note of the judicial nature of state bar disciplinary proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 482 n. 15, 103 S.Ct. 1303 (citing <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982)). Additionally, this court has held that the disciplinary board of a state bar can be considered as part of the \u201csystem of state courts\u201d and that their judicial decisions are not subject to review by the federal courts. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. West Virginia State Bar, </em>233 F.3d 813, 817-18 (4th Cir.2000) (holding Rooker-Feldman doctrine deprived district court of jurisdiction to review decision of West Virginia State Bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">The Virginia State Bar is, by statute, an arm of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and its decisions are judicial in nature. <em>See Allstate, </em>233 F.3d at 817; <em>see also </em>Supreme Court of Virginia Rule Pt. 6, \u00a7 IV, \u00b613 (procedure for disciplining and disbarring attorneys). In this case, while Konan challenges the procedures of the Bar\u2019s Disciplinary Board, the decision by the Board was upheld by the Supreme Court of Virginia, the appropriate court to review such challenges. Because the Board\u2019s function is judicial in nature, we hold that its rulings are subject to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and, therefore, not reviewable by a federal district court. Accordingly, we modify the district court\u2019s dismissal to show that the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and affirm the dismissal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>modified. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><em>AFFIRMED </em>AS <em>MODIFIED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-12\"> <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is confined to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Davani v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>434 F.3d 712, 718 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
