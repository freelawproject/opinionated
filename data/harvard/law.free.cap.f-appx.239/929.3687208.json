Agbomire appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for court documents at government expense under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250. Under \u00a7 2250, an indigent petitioner is entitled to court documents at no cost as long as he has filed a request for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Walker v. United States, </em>424 F.2d 278, 278-79 (5th Cir.1970). When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Agbomire filed his motion for court documents with the district court, he did not have a \u00a7 2255 motion pending before the district court. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Agbomire\u2019s motion. The appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. We caution Agbomire that filing frivolous appeals may be sanctioned. <em>United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Agbomire\u2019s motion for transcripts at government expense is denied. Agbomire\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
