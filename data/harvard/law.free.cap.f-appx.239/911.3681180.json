California, 386 </em>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Holguin has been deported and has not filed a response to counsel\u2019s motion. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and in part as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
