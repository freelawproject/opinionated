Maciel argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon the determination that his 2004 conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a) for attempted indecency with a child is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Sexual abuse of a minor is an enumerated offense which qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-05 (5th Cir.2000), held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a) is sexual abuse of a minor as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d As such, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Maciel also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Maciel\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Maciel contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624 (5th Cir.2007). Maciel properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
