On August 31, 2006, the district court sentenced Thinley to 51 months in prison. Thinley appealed and asserts his sentence is unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>sonable because the district court based the sentence upon an incorrect finding of drug quantity. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Thinley contends that the district court erred at sentencing when it found that at least 1100 pills were attributable to him during the periods of the conspiracy. In calculating the guideline range for each co-conspirator, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense\u201d are to be included. USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). When evaluating the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Contrary to Thinley\u2019s assertions, the district court did not err in finding Thinley was responsible for 518 pills he delivered to a confidential informant on July 19, 2005, and for between 100 and 200 pills on each of six to ten other occasions. First, the district court determined that the testimony of coconspirator Alex Le was credible, and credibility determinations are within the province of the trier of fact and are not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). Le testified that he had sold Thinley 100 to 200 pills on six to ten occasions prior to the July 19, 2005 sale to the informant. This earlier conduct was clearly relevant and within the scope of the conspiracy. Based upon Le\u2019s testimony, the district court found Thinley received at least 600 pills from the time Le and Thinley met in February 2005 until the July 19, 2005 sale to the informant. Added to the 518 sold to the informant, and not even considering the pills involved in the August 3, 2005 intended transaction, the court correctly found Thinley\u2019s involvement easily placed him in the Level 26 range.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The district court thus properly determined the drug quantity attributable to Thinley. Accordingly, we affirm Thinley\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
