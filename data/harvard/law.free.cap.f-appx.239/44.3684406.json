Barrera argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level based on its finding that Barrera\u2019s prior Florida conviction for aggravated battery was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Barrera also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">The district court did not err by increasing Barrera\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on the determination that a prior Florida aggravated battery conviction was a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Dominguez, 479 </em>F.3d 345, 347-49 (5th Cir.2007). The sentence enhancement was proper because Barrera\u2019s prior conviction had as an element at least a threatened use of force. <em>See id. </em>at 348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">Barrera\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Barrera contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Barrera properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
