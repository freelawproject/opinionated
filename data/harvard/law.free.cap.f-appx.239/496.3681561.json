Further, the government argues that Hamilton has failed to present (1) a cognizable constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tional claim or (2) a statutory question regarding the denial of his \u00a7 212(c) application and therefore does not qualify for the \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) exception to the jurisdictional bar, which allows us to exercise jurisdiction over those two types of claims even where the petitioner is convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Hamilton has been before the IJ and BIA multiple times due to his reliance on former \u00a7 212(c) and the subsequent cases of <em>In re Soriano, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 516, 520 (BIA 1996) (allowing the reopening of removal proceedings if the petitioner conceded deportability prior to the enactment of AEDPA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in reliance on the availability of section 212(c) relief), and <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (determining that AEDPA did not apply retroactively to aliens who pleaded guilty prior to the enactment of the statute). In his third and latest appearance before the Immigration Court, the IJ determined that Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) claim failed on the merits because Hamilton had done nothing to improve himself, had failed to file taxes, had no property, children or dependents, had a haphazard employment history, had no steady home, and had performed no community service. The IJ weighed the equities and counter equities, and found that it was not in the best interest of the community to award Hamilton \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Hamilton appealed that decision to the BIA, claiming that the IJ failed to adequately balance the equities, was biased against him, appeared annoyed, and was impaired from making independent findings of fact. The BIA affirmed the IJ and entered a final order of removal, noting that Hamilton failed to demonstrate unusual or outstanding equities. Hamilton did not appeal the BIA\u2019s decision (just as he did not appeal the BIA\u2019s two prior decisions) but instead filed a motion to reconsider. That motion did not specifically allege that his due process rights had been violated but claimed that the IJ did not allow him to present new evidence and did not give enough weight to the positive equities he offered. The BIA subsequently denied Hamilton\u2019s motion to reconsider, and Hamilton filed a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">We must begin by determining whether and to what extent we have jurisdiction over Hamilton\u2019s appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of subject matter jurisdiction. Jag<em>gernauth v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we have an obligation to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking. <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Although Hamilton did not expressly appeal the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, his motion to reconsider alleges some claims that are directly linked to that decision and the underlying decisions of the IJ. We have no jurisdiction to consider those decisions for two reasons. First, because Hamilton was convicted of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute (an aggravated felony), we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to review an order of removal entered against him. We only have jurisdiction to the extent Hamilton raises a constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Second, although the government did not raise the argument, we hold <em>sua sponte </em>that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order of removal and the underlying IJ decisions because Hamilton failed to file a timely appeal in this court. The Id\u2019s removal order became final when it was affirmed by the BIA on July 28, 2006. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1. Hamilton had thirty days to petition for review of that order, but he failed to do so. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)\u2014(2). The motion to reconsider that Hamilton did file in a timely fashion did not toll the thirty-day time period. <em>Dakane v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (motion to reopen). Therefore, we have jurisdiction only to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s motion to reconsider. We cannot review any claims arising out of the BIA\u2019s order of removal or the attendant IJ orders, including Hamilton\u2019s constitutional due process claim to the extent it was not included in his motion to reconsider. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir. 2006) (noting that procedural due process claims alleging that the petitioner was denied a full and fair hearing before a neutral factfinder requires administrative exhaustion).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Accordingly, we turn to Hamilton\u2019s motion to reconsider. \u201cAliens are entitled to due process of law in deportation [or removal] hearings.\u201d <em>Ibrahim v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cDue process is satisfied only by a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, an alien\u2019s procedural due process rights are violated where he is denied a full and fair hearing before a neutral IJ. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251. Our review here is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Judicial review is \u201climited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Upon review of the record and the BIA\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s motion to reconsider, we find no abuse of discretion. The transcript from the IJ hearing indicates that the IJ allowed Hamilton and all of his witnesses to testify. The IJ listened to and evaluated the testimony, asked follow-up questions, and cited that testimony is his oral decision. The IJ was not biased. While he challenged Hamilton\u2019s failure to improve himself, he also challenged government\u2019s failure to submit proof regarding Hamilton\u2019s 2001 conviction for using false documents. Hamilton had a full and fair hearing before the IJ, and the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">.
