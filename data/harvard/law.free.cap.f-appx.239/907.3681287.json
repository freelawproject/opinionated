Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2, and in part as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
