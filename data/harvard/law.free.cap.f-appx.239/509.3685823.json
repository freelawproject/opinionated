After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">Moore was indicted for committing bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). Moore pled not guilty and was found guilty by a jury. According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Moore entered a bank, slid a bag to the teller and told her to \u201c[f]ill the bag with money. I\u2019ve got a gun.\u201d Moore then pulled his shirt up to display the grip of an air gun. After obtaining the money and leaving the scene, Moore led police on a high-speed chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">The PSI assigned Moore five criminal history points for these prior convictions: (1) one point for \u201ctheft by taking,\u201d where Moore attempted to commit armed robbery by entering a Winn-Dixie grocery store with what appeared to be a handgun and demanding money and for which he received a sentence of 12 months\u2019 probation; (2) three points for a \u201crobbery by sudden snatch,\u201d where he obstructed law enforcement by backing his car into a police officer\u2019s vehicle and attempted to elude police; and (3) one point for a 1995 conviction for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d). With two criminal history points for committing the instant offense while on probation, the PSI assigned a criminal history category of IV. With a total offense level of 27, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>At his initial sentencing, Moore objected to the inclusion of one point for the 1995 DUI conviction because he had not been represented by counsel. The district court indicated that it would not consider the DUI conviction in computing Moore\u2019s criminal history score. This should have reduced Moore\u2019s criminal history category to III, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the district court calculated an advisory guidelines range of 100 to 125 months, which was consistent with a criminal history category IV, and imposed a 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In Moore\u2019s first appeal, this Court concluded: (1) that the district court had not properly calculated Moore\u2019s criminal history category as IV, and (2) that it could not determine whether, absent the calculation error, the district court would have imposed the same sentence. This Court vacated Moore\u2019s sentence and remanded with instructions for the district court to clarify its ruling on Moore\u2019s objection to the DUI point in his criminal history score and whether it intended for Moore\u2019s sentence to fall within the applicable advisory guidelines range or to constitute a variance from the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On remand, the district court confirmed that it had sustained Moore\u2019s objection to the DUI conviction. The district court clarified that it was making an upward departure in Moore\u2019s criminal history category based on the fact that the seriousness of Moore\u2019s criminal history was not adequately represented, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">[Wjhen I look at some of the underlying convictions, theft by taking in a Winn-Dixie store where he only got one point, we go with the prior sentence given by a previous judge as a rough proxy of the seriousness of the crime. When I look at this, I think that\u2019s not a good proxy, that was more serious than a one-point offense and it should have been a two or a three, that in my mind, it\u2019s more serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">And, likewise, the other snatching incident was, I think, more \u2014 well, it got three points but it was a serious sort of incident____ It really wouldn\u2019t be a variance, it would be what I would have done before Booker: I would have gone down one point for the DUI and then I would have departed back up the same point for the seriousness of his conviction with the Winn-Dixie and the seriousness with the snatching at least one or two points. That gets him back to the same place he was, so I view it as an upward departure based on the inadequacy of [the] criminal history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">The district court also noted the violence running throughout Moore\u2019s offenses and the similarities between Moore\u2019s prior Winn-Dixie theft conviction and the instant bank robbery, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">[T]his is a man who this is his second violent sort of robbery. It may have been an air gun but there was a gun involved, he had another robbery at a Winn-Dixie store, he had a snatching incident and then he also banged into another policeman\u2019s car. That\u2019s too many acts of violence for me to impose a sentence less than the sentence I imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The district court indicated that, if an upward departure under the guidelines had been unavailable, it would have imposed the same sentence as a <em>post-Booker </em>variance from the advisory guidelines range. The district court reimposed the 120-month sentence. Moore filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Moore argues that the district court erred in imposing an upward departure in his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must consult and correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s range under the Sentencing Guidelines and then impose a reasonable sentence considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005). Although <em>Booker </em>has rendered the guidelines range advisory, the correct application of the individual guideline provisions is obligatory. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 457, 166 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court may depart upwards in the criminal history category if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). \u201c[A]n upward departure may be appropriate where the defendant had previously received an extremely lenient sentence for a serious offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 232 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation marks and emphasis omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, cmt. background (noting that extremely lenient past sentences may be appropriately considered). In addition, the district court may consider the similarity of the current offense to prior offenses in deciding whether to impose a \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure. <em>See United States v. Castrillon-Gonzalez, </em>77 F.3d 403, 407 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing on the basis that Moore\u2019s criminal history category underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history. The district court considered the fact that Moore received only twelve months\u2019 probation for the Winn-Dixie theft offense, a sentence that did not adequately reflect the seriousness of that offense. The district court also considered similarities between the instant bank robbery and Moore\u2019s prior offenses. Both prior offenses involved violent theft crimes. The Winn-Dixie offense involved an attempted robbery in which Moore flashed what appeared to be a gun. The robbery \u201cby snatch\u201d involved an attempt to elude police.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Both the leniency of the sentences for prior offenses and the similarity of the prior offenses are appropriate factors to consider in deciding to depart. Furthermore, these factors were adequately supported by the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the degree of the departure \u2014 from a category III to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>category IV \u2014 is not unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Moore also contends that the district court\u2019s upward departure constituted double counting prohibited by <em>United States v. Hunerlach, </em>258 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2001). Under <em>Hunerlach, </em>a district court may not make an upward departure in the criminal history category for criminal conduct that was considered relevant conduct in calculating the defendant\u2019s offense level. 258 F.3d at 1286-87. Here, Moore\u2019s upward departure was not based on relevant conduct but on past criminal conduct. Therefore, <em>Hunerlach </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upward under \u00a7 4A1.3 and that Moore\u2019s 120-month sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. <em>Post-Booker, </em>we review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). A sentence can be procedurally or substantively unreasonable. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if \"it is the product of a procedure that does not follow Booker's requirements, regardless of the actual sentence,\u201d such as a failure to apply the guideline provisions correctly. <em>Id. </em>at 1185 n. 3. Moore raises only a claim of procedural unreasonableness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">. We review a district court\u2019s decision to depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 668 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that <em>pre-Booker </em>standards of review apply to review of guideline calculations). In so doing, we review the district court's legal determination that it may rely on a particular factor as a basis for departure <em>de novo, </em>its factual findings for clear error and the extent of the departure for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Weaver, </em>920 F.2d 1570, 1573 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-14\">. At sentencing and resentencing, Moore did not dispute the factual accuracy of criminal history portion of his PSI. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that undisputed factual matters in the PSI are deemed admitted and may be relied upon by the district court in determining the defendant's sentence); <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832-34 (11th Cir.2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>(concluding that undisputed facts in the PSI relating to the defendant\u2019s prior convictions could be used to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
