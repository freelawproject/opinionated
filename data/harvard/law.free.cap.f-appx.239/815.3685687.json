Mirabile appeals, claiming that the sentence imposed violates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government asserts that Mirabile waived his right to appeal the sentence by executing a valid and enforceable plea agreement containing a waiver of appellate rights. We agree and dismiss the appeal for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-24\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 169 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995) (determining whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent by examining the background, experience, and conduct of the defendant). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 952, 126 S.Ct. 461, 163 L.Ed.2d 350 (2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir. 1991). The question of whether a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>dant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We find that, based on our review of the record, the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 during the plea colloquy and that Mirabile\u2019s waiver of appellate rights was knowing and intelligent. Moreover, a plea agreement\u2019s appellate waiver accepted prior to <em>Booker </em>is not invalidated by the <em>Booker </em>decision. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 170-73; <em>see also Johnson, </em>410 F.3d at 150-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We therefore dismiss Mirabile\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
