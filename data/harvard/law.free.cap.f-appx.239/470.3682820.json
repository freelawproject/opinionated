Petitioners argue that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence, and that they established a fear of future persecution, sufficient to warrant asylum, if they return to China. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">When the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cTo the extent that the [IJ\u2019s] decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe IJ\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test,\u201d meaning that we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004). Put another way, we will reverse the IJ only upon finding that the record <em>compels </em>that conclusion. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">If an alien provides credible testimony, it may be sufficient, without corroboration, to establish his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. However, an IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief can be based solely on an adverse credibility determination if the alien does not produce corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>If the alien does provide corroborating evidence, the IJ may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination and must consider the corroborating evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir. 2005). Once the IJ explicitly finds that the alien lacks credibility, the burden shifts to the alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination \u201cwas not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (llth Cir.2006). Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written asylum application, and the absence of embellishments. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Here, the IJ made an adverse credibility finding, for which she gave specific reasons, including that (1) Xi Chen\u2019s testimony before the IJ conflicted with his testimony at his credible-fear interview <em>and </em>with statements he made in his asylum application regarding how the Chinese officials discovered his wife\u2019s second pregnancy, when he learned that his wife had been sterilized, and the name of the friend at whose house the Chens hid from the Chinese authorities; and (2) Xi Tuo Chen\u2019s testimony indicated that he did not know some of the facts that- he and his brother were relying on in support of their claim for asylum. These inconsistencies, as well as the Chens\u2019 failure to provide detailed testimony in aid of their asylum claims, support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In addition to making adverse credibility findings, the IJ considered the Chens\u2019 corroborating evidence, which included \u201cnotarial birth certifications\u201d and an X-ray and hospital records associated with Xi Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s alleged involuntary sterilization. The IJ stated that she questioned the identity of each petitioner because although the petitioners left China with their own passports, they had failed to present legitimate passports in support of their petitions. Moreover, the IJ noted, among other indications of a lack of authenticity, that the Petitioners\u2019 birth certifications were issued simultaneously and after the Petitioners left <em>China. </em>As for Xi Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s X-ray and hospital report, the IJ observed that \u201cthe red seal [on the X-ray] does not consistently follow through from the paper document onto the photograph,\u201d and that the report did not establish the existence of a forced sterilization. On this record, the corroborating evidence does not compel us to conclude that the IJ erred by finding that Xi and Xi Tuo failed to carry their burden of showing that they had either suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">. Because we conclude Petitioners have not met their burden to establish their eligibility for asylum, we also conclude that they failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT relief. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
