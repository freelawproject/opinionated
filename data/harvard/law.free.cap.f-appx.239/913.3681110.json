Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">The district court concluded that Moore\u2019 suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, which bars the litigation of claims that were previously litigated or should have been raised in an earlier suit. <em>Test Masters Educational Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005). Moore\u2019s brief fails to address the res judicata determination, which could constitute abandonment of the sole issue on appeal. <em>See Matchett v. Dretke, </em>380 F.3d 844, 848 (5th Cir.2004). However, because the appellee has addressed res judicata fully and does not assert prejudice resulting from Moore\u2019s inadequate briefing, and in consideration of Moore\u2019s pro se status, we will review the district court\u2019s res judicata ruling. <em>See Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">The four elements of res judicata are: (1) the parties are identical or in privity; (2) the judgment in the prior action was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior action was concluded by a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause of action was involved in both actions. <em>Test Masters, </em>428 F.3d at 571. These elements are easily satisfied here. Moore\u2019s prior suit alleged discrimination arising out of the same May 27, 2003, termination and arrest that forms the bases of her claims in the current suit. In both suits, she sued the Jones County School District and Superintendent Thomas Prine. The prior suit resulted in a judgment on the merits with prejudice, and that judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that the instant suit is barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
