The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Johnson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">Johnson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit because Judge Bigelow is not judicially immune from claims for equitable relief and for attorney\u2019s fees. He also argues that federal courts, via \u00a7 1983, may address unconstitutional actions taken by state courts by awarding injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-22\">Johnson is correct that judicial immunity does not bar claims for injunctive or declaratory relief in civil rights actions. <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>765 F.2d 517, 525 (5th Cir.1985). The dismissal of his claims for such relief was nevertheless appropriate as the federal courts have no authority to direct state courts or their judicial officers in the performance of their duties. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir. 1973). Johnson\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which allows a district court, in its discretion, to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in a \u00a7 1983 action, was also properly dismissed as Johnson did not prevail in his \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">As Johnson has not shown that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal was incorrect, his request for IFP is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b887-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
