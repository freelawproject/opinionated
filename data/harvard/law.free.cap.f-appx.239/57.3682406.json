He argues that the district court erred by relying on the presentence report\u2019s characterization of his prior conviction as a drug trafficking offense to enhance his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). As Palacios did not preserve this issue in the court below, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). Plain error exists when \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, the court may consider \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). \u201c[U]nder <em>Shepard, </em>a district court is not permitted to rely on a PSR\u2019s characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offense for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Because the district court did not have access to any <em>Shepard-approved </em>documents at the time of sentencing, the district court erred in enhancing the sentence. This error was clear and obvious because it conflicts with <em>Shepard. See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">In order to prove the third prong of the plain error test, Palacios must prove that if the district court relied the state court judgment and information at sentencing it would not have enhanced his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). <em>See Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d at 867. In the instant case, the state court judgment and information are too ambiguous to show whether Palacios was convicted of a drug trafficking offense warranting a 12-level enhancement. Accordingly, it is impossible to determine whether Palacios would have received a lesser sentence if the district court had reviewed these state court records. The proper remedy in such a case is a remand for development of the record and resentencing. <em>See United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1070, 126 S.Ct. 819, 163 L.Ed.2d 644 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">For these reasons, we vacate Palacios\u2019s sentence and remand for development of the record and resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
