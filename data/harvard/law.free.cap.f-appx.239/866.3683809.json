(\u201cVela\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s judgment awarding unpaid overtime, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs to Margaret Lucio-Cantu, Dawn Michelle Rodriguez, and Marisa Morales (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) following a jury trial. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Plaintiffs, former employees of Vela, sued Vela in federal district court, alleging that Vela failed to pay them overtime as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFLSA\u201d). The parties consented <em>to </em>have the <em>matter </em>referred to a magistrate judge, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial. The jury found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Vela failed to pay Plaintiffs overtime as required by the FLSA in the following amounts: $3348.29 to Lucio-Cantu, $52.50 to Rodriguez, and <em>$1296.00 to </em>Morales. Additionally, the jury found that Vela\u2019s actions in failing to pay Plaintiffs overtime were not willful. Despite the jury\u2019s finding on -willfulness, however, the district court exercised its discretion to award liquidated damages to Plaintiffs because Vela did not show that she made all necessary good faith efforts to comply with the FLSA or that she reasonably believed she was acting in conformity with the law. The district court awarded liquidated damages equal to the unpaid overtime amounts found by the jury, thereby doubling the Plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. The district court also awarded costs and $51,750 in Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees. Vela appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-19\">Vela attacks the judgment of the district court on numerous grounds. We reject all of Vela\u2019s arguments, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">First, Vela argues judicial estoppel. Vela contends that the district court failed to give \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d to a Texas state court judgment in which, Vela alleges, plaintiffs Lucio-Cantu and Morales received deferred adjudications for pocketing insurance premium payments from Vela\u2019s clients for their personal use while issuing false receipts and false confirmations that the underlying insurance policies were still effective. According to Vela, the Texas deferred adjudications judicially estop Lucio-Cantu and Morales from arguing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>federal court that Vela failed to pay them overtime, because during the periods of unpaid overtime, according to Vela, Lucio-Cantu and Morales did not perform work \u201cprimarily for the benefit\u201d of their employer but instead for the benefit of their criminal activities. <em>See Vega v. Gasper, </em>36 F.3d 417, 424 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Dunlop v. City Elec., Inc., </em>527 F.2d 394, 401 (5th Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We do not reach the merits of Vela\u2019s judicial estoppel argument because it is unsupported by the record. The district court refused to admit Vela\u2019s Exhibits 67 and 68, copies of the Texas deferred adjudications, and Vela failed to proffer Exhibits 67 and 68 to preserve them in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without the Texas deferred adjudications before us, we are unable to determine whether the district court properly held them inadmissible, whether they judicially estop Lucio-Cantu and Morales from bringing their FLSA claims against Vela, and whether the district court should have given them \u201cfull faith and credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Next, Vela argues that Plaintiffs are not the \u201cprevailing parties\u201d and therefore are not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerkart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>Saizan v. Delta Concrete Prod. Co., Inc., </em>448 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Tyler v. Union Oil Co. of Calif., </em>304 F.3d 379, 404 (5th Cir.2002). According to Vela, Rodriguez is not a prevailing party because her $52.50 award is \u201cde minimis.\u201d Vela also argues that Lucio-Cantu and Morales are not prevailing parties because their awards, when offset by the restitution amounts and costs they are allegedly paying under the Texas deferred adjudication, are either de minimis or zero. Alternatively, Vela argues that there is insufficient evidence to support Plaintiffs\u2019 awards and that the jury\u2019s findings are contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">We conclude that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties. As the district court correctly explained in its August 21, 2006 order, Plaintiffs prevailed on their most significant issue in the case: whether Vela violated the FLSA by failing to pay them for overtime. Plaintiffs provided sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings, each testifying to the number of overtime hours they worked that Vela never compensated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vela\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit and are unsupported by case law. Accordingly, under <em>Hensley, </em>Plaintiffs are prevailing parties entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Vela also challenges the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees the district court awarded, arguing the award is excessive in the light of Plaintiffs\u2019 limited recovery. We find no abuse of discretion. The district court properly calculated the lodestar amount and then properly considered the Plaintiffs\u2019 limited recovery when it reduced the lodestar amount by ten percent. <em>See Saizan, </em>448 F.3d at 799-803.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Finally, Vela challenges the district court\u2019s liquidated damages award. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>agree with the district court\u2019s analysis in its August 21, 2006 order and uphold the award. In her testimony before the jury, Vela failed to show that she \u201chad reasonable grounds for believing that [her] act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d <em>See Martinez v. Food City, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 369, 376 (5th Cir.1981) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. Vela later filed a motion in this Court to supplement the record with Exhibits 67 and 68. We denied Vela\u2019s motion on January 24, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\">. Also, by their testimony, Plaintiffs met their initial burden of producing sufficient evidence of the amount and extent of the unpaid overtime they worked. <em>See Harvill v. Westward Comm\u2019ns, L.L.C., </em>433 F.3d 428, 441 (5th Cir. 2005). Vela was unable to rebut Plaintiffs' evidence because she had destroyed Plaintiffs' employment records. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
