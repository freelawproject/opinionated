When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). A \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard\u201d applies in reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Jiang argues that his due process rights were violated because he never had the opportunity to have his asylum claim heard on its merits. He maintains that his motion to reopen should have been granted because he was not properly advised of his duty to provide the immigration court with an address in a language he understood. He asserts that the 1-213 form showing that he did receive such notice was suspect because statements in it were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Jiang has not proven that any information contained in the 1-213 form was false. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s factual determination that Jiang was warned of the requirement of providing an address and the consequences of failing to appear is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1053 (5th Cir.1986). As Jiang was informed of his duty to provide the immigration court with his address and failed to do so, he was not entitled to notice of the removal hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(B). For the same reason, the constitutional requirement of due process was also met. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d 733, 735-36 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Jiang has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen on the ground that he did not receive notice of the hearing. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Jiang additionally argues that the BIA and IJ abused their discretion by not reopening his removal proceedings on the ground that he had shown exceptional circumstances for not attending the hearing. While he acknowledges that his motion to reopen was not filed within the 180-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen on this ground, he maintains that this time limit should have been equitably tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Assuming arguendo that equitable tolling applies to the deadline at issue here, Jiang has not shown the exceptional circumstances necessary to be entitled to reopen his removal proceedings. Jiang did not attend the removal hearing because he did not provide the immigration court with his address as required. Accordingly, he did not show that his failure to attend the hearing was caused by exceptional circumstances beyond his control. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(e)(l). Jiang has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen on the ground that he did not attend the hearing due to exceptional circumstances. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
