Under the 1997 Electric Restructuring Act, St. 1997, c. 164, distribution companies must unbundle the rates they charge for each of their services, see St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 192, 193, amending G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 1, ID, and are expected to recover fully their supply-related costs through their supply service rates. See D.T.E. 02-40-B at 15 (2002). This case concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the mechanics of NSTAR\u2019s attempt to shift the recovery of one of its supply-related costs, supply-related bad debt costs, from its distribution rates to its supply rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In 2007, NSTAR filed a petition with the Department of Public Utilities (department), see <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>460 Mass. 800, 801 n.2 (2011), through which it sought to begin recovery of its supply-related bad debt costs through its supply rates rather than, as before, through its distribution rates. In that petition, NSTAR asserted that it had stopped recovering such costs through its distribution rates in early 2006. Notwithstanding that contention, the department conditioned its approval of NSTAR\u2019s petition on a corresponding (in NSTAR\u2019s view, further) reduction in NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We conclude that the department has failed to provide an adequate statement of its reasons for imposing the above condition. Specifically, we are unable to determine whether this aspect of the department\u2019s order rests on a determination that NSTAR did not follow the correct procedural path in removing supply-related bad debt costs from its distribution rates, or rather on a determination that NSTAR did not in fact remove such costs from its distribution rates at all. We conclude further that certain of the department\u2019s factual determinations are not adequately supported by subsidiary findings and that an aspect of the department\u2019s analysis is legally erroneous. The department\u2019s order is to be vacated and the matter is to be remanded to the department for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>As relevant here, NSTAR provides two distinct types of services: the procurement and supply of electric power (supply service) and the distribution of that electricity over power lines (distribution service). See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.04 (2008); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>453 Mass. 191, 192-193 nn.4-7 (2009). Generally speaking, NSTAR\u2019s customers pay for distribution services through distribution rates, and they pay for supply services \u2014 that is, for the power they actually consume \u2014 through supply rates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Id. </em>See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.04; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 193 nn.5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Although NSTAR enjoys a regulated geographic monopoly in electric distribution, see 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.04(2), it faces competition in the supply aspects of its business from \u201ccompetitive\u201d suppliers, that is, firms that generate or otherwise procure electricity without owning or operating the means to distribute electricity to consumers. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1A, as appearing in St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 193. NSTAR competes with such competitive suppliers on the basis of its supply rates rather than its distribution rates. So that its supply rates accurately reflect supply costs and thus send the correct price signal to customers choosing between NSTAR and various competitive suppliers, the department\u2019s policy is that NSTAR\u2019s supply rate should ensure full recovery of all of its supply-related costs. See generally D.T.E. 02-40-B at 15 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">One component of supply-related costs consists of those costs associated with customers defaulting on the supply-related components of their bills (supply-related bad debt costs). See D.T.E. 03-88 at 3 (2003). Yet, distribution companies like NSTAR historically have recovered at least part of these supply-related bad debt costs through their distribution rates rather than their supply rates. See D.T.E. 03-88A-F at 4 (2005). Accordingly, by a 2003 order, the department began proceedings to require distribution companies to move supply-related bad debt cost recovery from distribution rates to supply rates. D.T.E. 03-88, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The proceedings commenced by that order were resolved by a settlement agreement between distribution companies and various other entities, including the Attorney General. This agreement, reached on January 21, 2005 (January Settlement), and approved by the department shortly thereafter, see D.T.E. 03-88A-F, <em>supra, </em>called for supply-related bad debt cost recovery to be moved from distribution rates to supply rates. However, art. 2.4 of the January Settlement specified that any such shift would not take place \u201cuntil the next general distribution rate case in which a [distribution [cjompany proposes or the [djepartment directs the removal of [djefault [sjervice-related costs, or unless otherwise proposed to be adjusted by the [djistribution [cjompany, subject to approval by the [djepartment.\u201d The department em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>phasizes that this clause ensured its ability to review the specifics of each distribution company\u2019s rate changes and to verify that such changes did not result in multiple recoveries of supply-related bad debt costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On December 6, 2005, NSTAR entered into a second settlement agreement with the Attorney General and others (December Settlement). The December Settlement was intended to have the same effect as a general distribution rate case and was approved as such by department order. See D.T.E. 05-85 (2005). The parties \u201cagree[d] to an Alternative Rate Stabilization Plan that [would], on January 1, 2006, reduce the sum of the distribution rates [and a second category of rates] of NSTAR Electric below what they otherwise would have been and then ensure that the sum of those rates shall change only in a manner specified [by the December Settlement] for seven years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">NSTAR contends that the December Settlement removed supply-related bad debt cost recovery from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates and that the department\u2019s order approving the settlement thus constituted approval by the department of NSTAR\u2019s removal of such costs from its distribution rates. On this basis, NSTAR filed in early 2007 a request to adjust upward its \u201cbasic service adder,\u201d a component of its supply-related \u201cbasic service rate,\u201d so as to recover supply-related bad debt expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The department, however, took the position that the December Settlement \u201cdid not identify any changes to the level of bad debt included in [NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates] [nor] what level of supply-related bad debt, if any, was removed from [NSTAR\u2019s] distribution rates.\u201d D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4 at 5 (2007) (initial order). The department therefore ordered that NSTAR offset any increase in its supply rates with a corresponding decrease in its distribution rates. <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">NSTAR then filed a motion for reconsideration or clarification, which the department granted. D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-A (2007) (order granting reconsideration). However, after holding further proceedings, the department again determined that NSTAR could not increase its supply rates without a corresponding decrease in its distribution rates. See D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B at 21 (2010) (final order on reconsideration). NSTAR thereafter filed a petition for review of the department\u2019s final order on reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tion in the county court. See G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. A single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing an order issued by the department, \u201cwe give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision-making authority [and] shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>440 Mass. 625, 631 (2004), quoting <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997). See G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>We begin with three observations that neither party contests on appeal. The first is that NSTAR is only entitled to the relief it seeks on a showing that it has stopped recovering supply-related bad debt costs through its distribution rates. The second is that any such change in NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates must have taken place as part of a general rate case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or its equivalent. The third is that the December Settlement operates as the equivalent of a general rate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Where the parties disagree is on the meaning and effect of the December Settlement. NSTAR contends that the December Settlement incorporates by reference certain documents that were appended to it as exhibits. In NSTAR\u2019s view, these exhibits demonstrate that the December Settlement removed supply-related bad debt costs from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The department\u2019s position on appeal is that the December Settlement has binding effect only as to issues clearly and explicitly addressed in the text of the agreement. D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 15. The provisions of the December Settlement do not expressly mention bad debt costs. Therefore, in the department\u2019s view, the December Settlement did not effect the requisite change in NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>NSTAR contends that the department\u2019s position on appeal is in tension with its actions in the course of the proceedings below. In particular, NSTAR notes that the department\u2019s order granting reconsideration stated that the department\u2019s \u201csole purpose\u201d in reopening the record was to determine whether the distribution rates charged by NSTAR in 2006 provided for recovery of supply-related bad debt costs. NSTAR argues that such an inquiry would have been \u201ccompletely pointless\u201d if the plain language of the December Settlement was the only relevant issue before the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">As suggested by the above paragraphs, the parties\u2019 arguments are somewhat at cross purposes. The department is focused on the plain language of the December Settlement \u2014 what the settlement said. NSTAR\u2019s primary focus is the effect of the December Settlement \u2014 what the settlement did. Notwithstanding the clarity of the department\u2019s position on appeal, this confusion finds its source in the department\u2019s three orders in this case, particularly the department\u2019s final order on reconsideration. As discussed, <em>infra, </em>we are unable to discern the legal basis relied upon by the department to support that order. Further, the order fails to address a significant portion of the record, and it does not contain sufficient subsidiary findings of fact to demonstrate that its ultimate conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. Because these infirmities leave us unable to determine whether the department\u2019s order is supported by sound reasoning and fact finding, \u201cwe decline to affirm the department\u2019s order, and remand for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">a. <em>The department\u2019s statement of reasons. </em>The deference we grant to an agency\u2019s determination of questions entrusted to its expertise places a \u201cheavy burden\u201d on parties challenging the department\u2019s orders. See <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 636. See also part 2, <em>supra. </em>Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he principle of according weight to an agency\u2019s discretion ... is \u2018one of deference, not abdication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 346 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>456 Mass. 309 (2010), quoting <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986). Indeed, we are required to \u201ccarefully review the depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>merit\u2019s findings for error.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 868, quoting <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 533 (1984). Such a review is only feasible when the agency has provided \u201ca guide to its reasons,\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>346 Mass. 130, 137 (1963), quoting <em>Leen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>345 Mass. 494, 502 (1963), including a \u201cdetermination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8), \u201csupported by adequate subsidiary findings.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra, </em>quoting <em>Leen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">(i) <em>Legal basis. </em>\u201cWhile we can conduct a meaningful review of \u2018a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned,\u2019 we will not \u2018supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 535-536, quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285-286 (1974). Here, we are unable to discern the legal reasoning supporting the department\u2019s orders. The \u201canalysis and findings\u201d provided by the department do not make clear whether the issue before the department was the interpretation of the language of the December Settlement or the determination of what costs in fact remained part of NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates on and after January 1, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In its final order on NSTAR\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the department alternated its analysis between the language of the December Settlement and the effect of the December Settlement, without stating which rationale formed the basis for its decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, we cannot tell whether the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was concerned with what the December Settlement said or with what NSTAR actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">At the beginning of the \u201canalysis and findings\u201d supporting the order, the department states that it had \u201creopen[ed] the record to permit [NSTAR] to provide additional evidence . . . that supply-related bad debt was removed from the distribution [rates] approved\u201d by the December Settlement. D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 11. It then states that \u201cfor the reasons outlined below . . . [NSTAR] has failed to provide evidence to support its contention\u201d that it had removed such costs from its rates in January, 2006. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The \u201creasons outlined below,\u201d however, relate primarily to whether the text of the December Settlement clearly discussed the removal of supply-related bad debt from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates, not whether such costs were in fact removed. Indeed, later in its analysis, the department emphasized that NSTAR was \u201cincorrect\u201d in suggesting that it could make its case for a nonrevenue-neutral rate adjustment without showing that the December Settlement \u201ccontainfed] a specific and explicit provision providing for the transfer of supply-related bad debt.\u201d D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 15-16. Yet, as NSTAR points out, if this were true no rehearing would have been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Moreover, the department\u2019s two potential grounds of decision are inconsistent. As noted above, the parties agree that, under the January Settlement, NSTAR is only entitled to the relief it seeks on a showing that it has ceased recovery of supply-related bad debt costs through its distribution rates and that this change to its distribution rates took place as the result of a \u201cpropos [al] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>or . . . direct[ive]\u201d in a general rate case. They agree also that a settlement agreement may substitute for a general rate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">However, in interpreting the language of the December Settlement, the department argues that a settlement agreement only has legally binding effect to the extent of its \u201cspecific and explicit\u201d language. The department contends further that the December Settlement lacks any specific and explicit language related to supply-related bad debt costs. On this theory, the December Settlement would not have any legally binding effect on NSTAR\u2019s supply-related bad debt costs. Further, even if NSTAR had stopped recovering supply-related bad debt costs in January, 2006, that change would not have resulted from a \u201cpropos[al] or . . . directive]\u201d in a general rate case. Accordingly, the terms of the January Settlement would still prevent NSTAR from obtaining the relief that it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">It was incumbent on the department to explain its adverse decision, making clear which of these lines of reasoning it had adopted and why that ground for decision comports with relevant provisions of the applicable enabling statutes, regulations, and policies. See <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). As part of that explanation, the department should have set forth the showing that NSTAR was required to, but apparently did not make. That is, the department should have explained whether NSTAR was required to show either that the December Settlement reflected an agreement to remove supply-related bad debt costs from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates or that the distribution rates adopted on January 1, 2006, did not include such costs, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Absent such clarity, we are left to speculate as to the grounds for the department\u2019s order. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>442 Mass. 793, 808 (2004). Such speculation prevents us from determining with confidence whether the reasoning in fact employed was factually supported and free from legal error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It therefore \u201cfrustratefs]\u201d effective review. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Massachusetts Auto. Rating &amp; Acc. Prevention Bur. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>401 Mass. 282, 292 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>(ii) <em>Subsidiary findings. </em>An adequate statement of reasons must contain not only the department\u2019s factual conclusions, but also supporting subsidiary findings of fact. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 533 (1984). One function of subsidiary findings is to allow a reviewing court to \u201cascertain. . . whether the [department\u2019s] decision and [its] findings [are] supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Packard Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>345 Mass. 718, 723 (1963), quoting <em>Leen </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>345 Mass. 494, 501-502 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201c[Substantial evidence is \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), quoting <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). Further, a determination whether the department\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence must be made on the basis of the record as a whole. \u201c[W]e are not required to affirm the [department] merely on a finding that the record contains [some] evidence from which a rational mind might draw the . . . inference\u201d drawn by the department. <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 466, quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Here, the department has not set forth sufficient subsidiary findings to allow meaningful review of its apparent conclusion that NSTAR\u2019s January 1, 2006, distribution rates include bad debt costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The department offers no explanation of what the December Settlement\u2019s January 1, 2006, adjustments to NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates actually accomplished if they did not remove supply-related bad debt costs from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates. As a result, the only direct evidence on the intent and effect of the January 1, 2006, rate change comes from NSTAR\u2019s expert witness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The department\u2019s failure to state whether and, if so, why it believes this testimony to be mistaken or flawed leaves us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>without the tools to evaluate, on the record as a whole, the reasonableness of the department\u2019s apparent conclusion that the December Settlement had no effect on NSTAR\u2019s bad debt cost recovery.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Moreover, the limited evidence discussed by the department is inconclusive. Neither the department\u2019s initial order, D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4, <em>supra, </em>nor the department\u2019s final order on reconsideration, D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra, </em>provides any express subsidiary findings to support a determination that NSTAR\u2019s January 1, 2006, distribution rates included NSTAR\u2019s supply-related bad debt costs. The department\u2019s final order on reconsideration could generously be read as reasoning that the absence of any language addressing bad debt costs in the text of the December Settlement indicates that the January 1, 2006, rates established by that agreement left unchanged NSTAR\u2019s method of recovering supply-related bad debt costs. As explained in part 3.b, <em>infra, </em>however, the department\u2019s interpretation of the text of the December Settlement is influenced by an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The order granting reconsideration, D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-A, <em>supra, </em>makes two additional findings with regard to whether NSTAR\u2019s January 1, 2006, rates provided for supply-related bad debt cost recovery:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that even after January 1, 2006, NSTAR continued to provide a distribution credit to certain of its customers, which would not have been necessary if NSTAR had in fact removed supply-related bad debt costs from its distribution rates; and that NSTAR\u2019s explanation of how bad debt costs had been removed from its January 1, 2006, rates was not part of its initial case before the department, but was instead presented for the first time through its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The relevance of NSTAR\u2019s continuing provision of a distribution credit is called into question by the department\u2019s final order on reconsideration, which states that the \u201cmistake\u201d made by NSTAR in continuing to provide a distribution credit after January 1, 2006, \u201cdid not impact the [department\u2019s finding in D.T.E./D.RU. 07-4, <em>supra </em>at 5-7 that supply-related bad debt was not removed from the distribution rates in [the December Settlement].\u201d D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The relevance assigned by the department to the timing of NSTAR\u2019s submission of expert evidence is not apparent from the department\u2019s order. To the extent the department intended its observation on NSTAR\u2019s timing as a basis for a determination that NSTAR\u2019s expert witness was not credible, \u201csuch disbelief [does not alone] create affirmative\u201d substantial evidence in support of the department\u2019s ultimate finding. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass 37, 67 n.21 (1977), citing <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 251-252 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">b. <em>Incorporation by reference. </em>Although the department\u2019s failure to provide an adequate statement of the legal and factual basis of its final order on reconsideration would alone require remand, we address also an error in the department\u2019s interpretation of the December Settlement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the department erred in concluding that the agreement did not expressly incorporate certain of the exhibits filed with the agreement. NSTAR argues that these exhibits, unlike the text of the agreement itself, clearly contemplate the removal of supply-related bad debt costs from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">We begin with an observation on the principles applicable to the interpretation of the December Settlement. The consistent policy of the department has been to interpret approved settlement agreements in line with our general principles of contract law. See <em>Southern Union Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>458 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Mass. 812, 820 (2011), and cases cited. Indeed, the department concedes that this policy governs the present case. Nonetheless, aspects of the department\u2019s orders appear to hold the parties to the December Settlement to an ill-defined heightened standard of clarity, see, e.g., D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 15-16 (\u201cNSTAR Electric is incorrect in asserting that a settlement need not contain a specific and explicit provision providing for the transfer of supply-related bad debt from base distribution rates to basic service rates\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Although the precise nature of the \u201cexplicit statement\u201d that the department would require of NSTAR is not clear from the department\u2019s orders, the application of any such heightened clarity requirement would amount to a sub rosa change in department policy. Such a \u201cnew policy may not [generally] be retroactively applied where a prior agency policy existed.\u201d <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 190 (2009). See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>405 Mass. 115, 120-121 (1989). Absent an explanation from the department as to why a departure from its established policy is appropriate here, the December Settlement must be interpreted in line with the general principles governing the reading of any contract under Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>We turn now to the proper application of Massachusetts contract law to the question whether the December Settlement incorporates by reference any of its exhibits. \u201cIncorporation by reference is a common tool in the drafting of contracts.\u201d <em>Artuso </em>v. <em>Vertex Pharms., Inc., </em>637 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2011) (applying Massachusetts law). Nevertheless, \u201cthe language used in a contract to incorporate extrinsic material by reference . . . must clearly communicate that the purpose of the reference is to incorporate the referenced material into the contract (rather than merely to acknowledge that the referenced material is relevant to the contract, e.g., as background law or negotiating history).\u201d <em>Northrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>535 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2008). See <em>M.L. Shalloo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ricciardi &amp; Sons Constr., </em>348 Mass. 682, 687-688 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Article 2.5 of the December Settlement provides: \u201cThe tariffs that would be implemented on January 1, 2006 and May 1, 2006, and supporting workpapers are set forth as \u2018Exhibit NSTAR-3 (Settlement)\u2019 through \u2018Exhibit NSTAR-22 (Settlement).\u2019 \u201d Considered in the broader context of art. 2, we conclude that art. 2.5 incorporates the above-referenced exhibits as fully integrated components of the December Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In determining whether the language referring to exhibits 3-22 should be read only as referencing those exhibits as illustrative of the parties\u2019 agreement, or as fully incorporating those exhibits into the parties\u2019 agreement, we are guided first by the plain meaning of the language chosen by the parties. See <em>de-Freitas </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>342 Mass. 474, 477 (1961). Here, the parties plainly stated that the rates to be implemented under the agreement were those \u201cset forth in [the exhibits marked \u2018Exhibit NSTAR-3 (Settlement)\u2019 through \u2018Exhibit NSTAR-22 (Settlement)\u2019].\u201d Even if this language were ambiguous, we would consider it in light of the \u201ccontract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>MCI WorldCom Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>442 Mass. 103, 113 (2004), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>quoting <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The December Settlement as a whole is incomplete in material respects when read without the exhibits marked \u201cNSTAR-3 (Settlement)\u201d through \u201cNSTAR-22 (Settlement).\u201d Articles 2.2-2.4 of the December Settlement set forth, in summary terms, the changes that NSTAR was to make to each of these rates in January and May of 2006. Each of these articles refers generally to the aggregate change in the rates that would be charged by \u201cNSTAR Electric.\u201d However, at the time of the agreement, NSTAR\u2019s electric distribution business operated through three separately regulated operating companies, each with its own rate schedule. The language of arts. 2.1-2.5 does not address how the changes contemplated by the agreement were to be apportioned between each operating company.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Absent the detail provided in the exhibits, the December Settlement would have provided no guidance as to the manner in which the rate changes would be allocated between the three operating companies\u2019 service areas, or between different categories of consumers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Such a result would be particularly anomalous in the context of an agreement that provides detailed procedures and formulas governing the manner in which NSTAR can modify its rates in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The department contends that if it were bound by working papers and other addenda to settlement agreements, it could \u201cno longer . . . rely on the principle that its approval of a proposed settlement approves only the settlement agreement\u2019s express terms,\u201d and that it would therefore be unable to continue to approve settlements for fear of the unforeseen consequences of such approval.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing. Exhibits \u201cNSTAR-3 (Settlement)\u201d through \u201cNSTAR-22 (Settlement)\u201d were explicitly referenced in the December Settlement in a manner that any sophisticated party would have recognized as indicating their incorporation into the agreement. In such circumstances, we do not think that \u201cpresum[ing] that the [contents of these exhibits] were known and assented to\u201d creates any potential for unfair surprise. <em>Trambly </em>v. <em>Ricard, </em>130 Mass. 259, 260 (1881). That is not, of course, to suggest that the department is bound by every inference that could conceivably be drawn from a settlement agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, it is bound only by those interpretations of settlement language that are objectively supported by a settling party\u2019s \u201coutward manifestations to the [department].\u201d <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Rollins Envt\u2019l Servs. (NJ), Inc., </em>416 Mass. 684, 696-697 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The department determined that the spreadsheets in the exhibits were not sufficiently labeled or explained so as to alert the department to any understanding by the settling parties that such documents provided for the removal of bad debt costs from NSTAR\u2019s distribution rates. D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B, <em>supra </em>at 18. Certainly, the absence of clear labeling renders the import of the exhibits \u201cnot obvious to a layperson.\u201d <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Cable, </em>457 Mass. 562, 568 (2010). However, the agreements at issue were made between highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sophisticated parties with a long course of dealing. A determination of what would have been reasonably apparent to the department, and to the other sophisticated settling parties, must take into account the department\u2019s \u201cspecialized technical knowledge in ascertaining [the] meaning and application\u201d of the exhibits incorporated into the agreement. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Pennsylvania R.R. </em>v. <em>Day, </em>360 U.S. 548, 553 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Here, the department has failed to apply its \u201cexpertise to determine [the technical meaning of] the language in question\u201d to the parties and to others experienced in the electric distribution industry. See <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Cable, supra. </em>Specifically, the department has not addressed NSTAR\u2019s central arguments as to the meaning that the exhibits incorporated into the December Settlement would have had to parties experienced in the electric distribution industry.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Such arguments, which relate to industry practice and usage, are properly addressed by the department in the first instance. Cf. <em>id. </em>(because of its \u201ctechnical competence, and experience. . . the department possesses the expertise to determine\u201d in first instance meaning to accord specialized contractual provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The department has failed to make findings and to provide a statement of the reasons for its decision adequate to support meaningful judicial review. Accordingly, we remand the case to the county court where an order is to enter vacating D.T.E./D.P.U. 07-4-B (2010) and remanding the matter to the department for \u201ca statement of reasons, including subsidiary findings,\u201d of its conclusions of law and relevant facts.
