L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, and he was ordered committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) for an indeterminate period of from one day to life. On appeal, he claims that the trial judge erred in (1) denying his motion in limine to exclude any reference to his failure to participate in sex offender treatment programs made available to him by the Department of Correction (department); (2) excusing a prospective juror for cause who expressed his belief that no medical expert could conclusively demonstrate whether the defendant is going to commit another sexual offense; (3) admitting evidence that the defendant feared for his safety in prison because of rumors that he had sexually assaulted another inmate; and (4) instructing the jury regarding the elements of mental abnormality and the likelihood of engaging in sexual offenses, and in describing proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant also claims that the prosecutor made improper and inflammatory remarks in closing argument that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We conclude that there were errors in the admission of evidence and in the judge\u2019s instructions of law that, when considered together with the improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, require reversal and a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\"><em>Background. </em>On December 3, 1990, the defendant pleaded guilty to three indictments charging rape of a child and an unrelated indictment charging unarmed burglary, and he was sentenced to from eight to fifteen years in State prison on each of the indictments, to be served concurrently. At the plea hearing, the defendant admitted that he had been the live-in boy friend of the victim\u2019s mother for many years. When the victim was approximately seven years old, he began fondling her chest, and when she was approximately ten years old he raped her once or twice each week. The rape indictments to which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>pleaded guilty occurred when the victim was between the ages of twelve and fourteen, the last occurring shortly after she had moved out of her mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On June 4, 2004, the Commonwealth filed a petition under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, seeking civil commitment of the defendant as an SDP. On June 17, a judge in the Superior Court temporarily committed the defendant to the treatment center pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (e). After a hearing on September 18, 2007, a judge found probable cause to support the petition. At trial, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of two qualified examiners, and a third designated forensic psychologist, each of whom opined that the defendant is appropriately diagnosed with pedophilia, has a mental abnormality as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, and is likely to commit further sexual offenses if not confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The defendant offered the testimony of three licensed psychologists, each of whom agreed that the defendant met or may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of pedophilia under the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 2000), but opined that the defendant is not likely sexually to reoffend. Two of the defense experts opined that the defendant did not have a mental abnormality as defined in the statute; one opined that he did. On June 3, 2008, a jury found the defendant to be an SDP. The defendant appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 344 (2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment programs. </em>While in prison serving his sentence and in the treatment center awaiting trial on the SDP petition, the defendant was offered the opportunity to participate in sex offender treatment programs provided by the department if he agreed in writing to the conditions of such treatment. In 1994, he was offered treatment that included \u201ca period of self-guided treatment, assessment and education, followed by group therapy utilizing the Relapse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Prevention Model\u201d conducted by a \u201csex offender therapist.\u201d As a condition of such treatment, he was required to sign an agreement giving his sex offender therapist \u201cpermission to share information concerning [his] progress in treatment and other pertinent evaluative information\u201d with the department and the parole board. He declined to sign the agreement. In 2003, he was again offered comparable treatment if he executed an agreement that, among other conditions, gave his sex offender therapist \u201cpermission to share information concerning [his] progress in treatment and other pertinent evaluative information\u201d with the department, parole board, and the probation department, the district attorney, and \u201cany other law enforcement agencies.\u201d He again declined. In June, 2004, after he was temporarily committed to the treatment center, he was offered unspecified treatment if he agreed in writing that nothing he said or disclosed in treatment or in discussions with his therapist would be confidential and that such information may be reviewed by qualified examiners and other evaluators to determine whether he was an SDP. He again declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Before trial, the defendant moved in limine to bar any reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to participate in the sex offender treatment programs, claiming that admission of this evidence would violate his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as applied to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge denied the motion and overruled the defendant\u2019s objections when the evidence was offered at trial. The essence of his argument is that sex offender treatment programs require participants to admit and discuss their prior sexual offenses, including uncharged sexual offenses, based on the premise that such admissions are a necessary step in the rehabilitation of sex offenders. See <em>Ainsworth </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>244 F.3d 209, 215 (1st Cir. 2001), vacated sub nom. <em>Ainsworth </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>536 U.S. 953, aff\u2019d on reh\u2019g, 317 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 999 (2003) (\u201cThe program\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>requirement that participants admit to their crimes is widely believed to be a necessary prerequisite to successful treatment\u201d); Shevlin, \u201c[Bjetween the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\u201d: A Look at the Fifth Amendment Implications of Probation Programs for Sex Offenders Requiring Mandatory Admissions of Guilt, 88 Ky. LJ. 485, 485 (1999-2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Where, as here, a sex offender is required to waive the confidentiality of statements made in treatment to a sex offender therapist in order to obtain treatment, the sex offender is faced with a problematic choice. If he agrees to waive confidentiality and seek treatment, all that he admits during treatment, including past sexual offenses, may be used against him, whether to prosecute him for offenses that have yet to be adjudicated, to deny him early release on parole, or to show that he is an SDP who must be civilly committed to prevent future sexual offenses. If he avoids incriminating himself by refusing to waive confidentiality, he is denied any sex offender treatment, and his refusal to enter treatment may be admitted in evidence and used by the qualified examiners and the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses, as it was here, to support their opinion that he is an SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The defendant contends that the admission in evidence of his refusal of treatment violates his privilege against compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because the admission of such evidence constitutes a penalty to compel testimony that has not been immunized. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The prohibition against self-incrimination \u201cnot only permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial in which he is a defendant, but also \u2018privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Minnesota </em>v. Murphy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>465 U.S. 420, 426 (1984), quoting <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77 (1973). \u201cA defendant does not lose this protection by reason of his conviction of a crime.\u201d <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra. </em>Even if a defendant is imprisoned when he makes incriminating statements, \u201cif those statements are compelled they are inadmissible in a subsequent trial for a crime other than that for which he has been convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that an incriminating statement need not be ordered by a court to be \u201ccompelled\u201d: a statement may be deemed \u201ccompelled\u201d where the penalties for the defendant refusing to incriminate himself are so severe that they are \u201ccapable of coercing incriminating testimony.\u201d <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 49 (2002) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) <em>(McKune). </em>See <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra </em>at 434, quoting <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 806 (1977) (surveying cases in which Court found compulsion where State sought to induce individual \u201cto forgo the Fifth Amendment privilege by threatening to impose economic or other sanctions \u2018capable of forcing the self-incrimination which the Amendment forbids\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Where an incriminating statement is found to be \u201ccompelled,\u201d the individual faced with the dilemma of incriminating himself or suffering the penalties of silence has one of two judicial remedies. If the individual refuses to make the incriminating statements, he is entitled to protection from the imposition of the penalties arising from the refusal. See <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra </em>at 806; <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Sanitation of N.Y., </em>392 U.S. 280, 284-285 (1968); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 279 (1968). If the individual makes the incriminating statement to avoid the penalties, he is entitled to immunity to protect against the incriminating use of the statement. See <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 500 (1967); <em>Sher </em>v. <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>488 F.3d 489, 502 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1309 (2008). Federal constitutional law requires use immunity \u2014 the statements may not be used against the individual directly or indirectly in a future criminal proceeding. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, supra </em>at 276. Under Massachusetts law, art. 12 \u201crequires transactional immunity to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 610 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dormady, </em>423 Mass. 190, 198 (1996) (\u201cwe are not disposed to throw aside the long-standing jurisprudence of this Commonwealth and accept the concept of use immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Here, where the defendant refused sex offender treatment and therefore avoided the need to make incriminating statements about his sexual history, the remedy the defendant seeks is to be protected at his SDP civil commitment proceeding from any reference to his failure to accept sex offender treatment. Pragmatically, this would bar not only the admission of evidence that he refused treatment, but also any reference to his refusal or failure to undergo sex offender treatment by the qualified examiners or the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses in offering their opinion that the defendant is an SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The defendant would be entitled to such relief here only if the potential use at his SDP civil commitment proceeding of his refusal to accept sex offender treatment is so severe a penalty for his refusal to incriminate himself that he should be deemed \u201ccompelled\u201d to accept admission to sex offender treatment. See <em>McKune, supra </em>(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). The United States Supreme Court has held that incriminating statements are \u201ccompelled\u201d where the refusal to self-incriminate mandates a penalty of termination of employment, see <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Sanitation of N.Y., supra </em>at 284; loss of a professional license, see <em>Spevack </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, 519 (1967); ineligibility to receive government contracts, see <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Turley, supra </em>at 84-85; or the loss of the right to participate in private, voluntary political associations and hold public office. See <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra </em>at 807-808. More recently, the Supreme Court held that a convicted sex offender\u2019s participation in a prison sexual abuse treatment program where he is required to \u201ccomplete a sexual history form, which details all prior sexual activities, regardless of whether such activities constitute uncharged criminal offenses,\u201d without the benefit of any protection from the use of this incriminating information in a criminal proceeding, is not compelled even though his refusal to participate results in the automatic curtailment of his visitation rights and other prison privileges and requires his transfer to a maximum security unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>where he would move from a two-person to a four-person prison cell. <em>McKune, supra </em>at 30-31 (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Set Ainsworth </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>317 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002), cert denied, 538 U.S. 999 (2003) (participation in New Hampshire\u2019s sex offender treatment program not compelled where nonparticipation results in transfer to less desirable housing and \u201calmost always results in an inmate being denied parole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The Supreme Court has yet to decide whether the risk that a prisoner\u2019s refusal to enter sex offender treatment will be considered at an SDP civil commitment proceeding is so severe a penalty for his refusal to incriminate himself as to constitute compelled self-incrimination. But we conclude that this risk falls well short of the severity of penalty necessary to constitute compulsion in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Where the Supreme Court has found compulsion, the severe penalty that compelled the self-incrimination was automatically imposed upon the refusal to self-incriminate. See, e.g., <em>Lefko-witz </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 808 n.5 (1977); <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Broderick, supra </em>at 275 n.3. In <em>McKune, supra </em>at 60 (Stevens, J., dissenting), the four dissenting Justices who concluded that the prison sanctions imposed for refusing to participate in the sex offender treatment program compelled the sex offender\u2019s self-incrimination noted that the \u201cpenalty for refusing to participate ... is automatic.\u201d The dissent continued, \u201cInstead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>of conjecture and speculation about the indirect consequences that may flow from a decision to remain silent, .... [t]he penalty involved in this case is a mandated official response to the assertion of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Stevens, J., dissenting). Here, there is no mandatory penalty arising from the refusal to participate. Rather, the prisoner faces the possibility that, if the Commonwealth subsequently seeks civilly to commit the prisoner as an SDP, it may offer the refusal in evidence or the qualified examiners or the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses may refer to it as supporting their opinion that the defendant is an SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In addition, in <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976), where a prisoner, was informed that he could remain silent at his disciplinary hearing but that his silence could be used against him, the Supreme Court held that the prisoner was not compelled to incriminate himself. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that his silence was not being used against him in a criminal proceeding and that his silence was insufficient alone to support an adverse disciplinary decision. <em>Id. </em>The Court added that giving \u201cevidentiary value\u201d to his silence \u201cdoes not smack of an invalid attempt by the State to compel testimony without granting immunity or to penalize the exercise of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. Here, the defendant\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment is not being used against him in a criminal proceeding; his refusal is insufficient alone to support a finding of sexual dangerousness, and the Commonwealth is merely giving \u201cevidentiary value\u201d to his refusal. In these circumstances, we conclude that under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments the defendant\u2019s participation in sex offender treatment is not compelled by the possible evidentiary use of his refusal at a trial adjudicating whether he is sexually dangerous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We recognize that we have held that the right against self-incrimination under art. 12 is broader than that under the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>848, 859 (2000); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass. 1201, 1210-1211 (1992). \u201c[W]here Federal law is insufficient to protect the broader rights against self-incrimination guaranteed by art. 12, we have adopted additional rules under the Massachusetts Constitution to secure those rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>456 Mass. 280, 291, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 181 (2010). We need not decide here whether art. 12 jurisprudence follows Federal law in determining whether the Commonwealth has compelled a statement. To decide this case, it suffices that we conclude that the possibility that evidentiary use will be made of a defendant\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment does not constitute compulsion of such treatment in violation of art. 12. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delisle, </em>440 Mass. 137, 143-144 (2003) (where probation of defendant in batterers\u2019 program was not revoked solely because he refused to write letter to his wife detailing his prior abuse, defendant was not compelled to incriminate himself by writing letter); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brescia, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 908-909 (2004) (even if participation in sex offender treatment program would have required defendant to incriminate himself, no compulsion where \u201cthere is nothing in the record before us to show that any refusal would result automatically in the revocation of his probation\u201d). Because we find no compulsion, where a defendant agrees to enter such a treatment program and waive confidentiality, we conclude that a defendant is not entitled to transactional immunity for any sexual offense he reveals during treatment. Therefore, we conclude that reference at trial to the defendant\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment did not violate his rights under either the United States Constitution or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Although we find no constitutional violation, we recognize under our common law of evidence the potential for unfair prejudice arising from the admission of evidence at an SDP civil commitment proceeding that the defendant refused sex offender treatment. Although the record does not describe the sex offender treatment the defendant was offered, the consent forms he was asked to sign describe it as a form of psychological therapy, including group therapy, conducted by a \u201csex offender therapist.\u201d In <em>Jaffee </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>518 U.S. 1, 12, 15 (1996), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Supreme Court recognized a psychotherapist-patient privilege, joining the fifty States and the District of Columbia in doing so, and extended the privilege to include licensed social workers who provide psychotherapy. The Court recognized the importance of confidentiality to clinical therapy, noting the \u201cwide agreement that confidentiality is a sine qua non for successful psychiatric treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, quoting Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to Proposed Rules, 56 F.R.D. 183, 242 (1972). The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">\u201cEffective psychotherapy . . . depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communications made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede development of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10. \u201cIf the privilege were rejected, confidential conversations between psychotherapists and their patients would surely be chilled, particularly when it is obvious that the circumstances that give rise to the need for treatment will probably result in litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Our Legislature has recognized the importance of confidentiality in communications between patients and psychotherapists, licensed social workers, and allied mental health professionals (including licensed marriage and family therapists, licensed rehabilitation counselors, licensed educational psychologists, and licensed mental health counselors) by enacting statutes declaring such communications confidential and protecting their confidentiality with an evidentiary privilege. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 129A, and c. 233, \u00a7 20B (psychologists and psychotherapists); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 135A, 135B (licensed social workers); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172 (allied mental health professionals).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>also G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J (communications between sexual assault victim and sexual assault counsellor). Although the record does not reveal whether the \u201csex offender therapist\u201d met the definition of a psychotherapist, licensed social worker, or allied mental health professional, we have no reason to believe that the confidentiality of communications is less important in providing sex offender therapy than in providing other forms of clinical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Yet, the sex offender treatment offered to the defendant was conditioned on his agreement to waive any entitlement to confidentiality, and provided notice that the statements made by the prisoner during treatment, including the most potentially incriminating statements regarding his sexual conduct, proclivities, and thoughts, would be made available to those who may choose to use such statements to prosecute him for past sexual crimes, deny him parole, or commit him indefinitely as an SDP. The required waiver of confidentiality not only poses a substantial risk that a prisoner\u2019s statements during sex offender treatment will be used against him at a criminal trial, parole hearing, or SDP civil commitment proceeding but also, if sex offender therapy is akin to psychotherapy, is likely to impede the development of an atmosphere of confidence and trust, chill the candor of communication, and diminish the likelihood of successful treatment. See <em>Jaffee </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra </em>at 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Because sex offender treatment without confidentiality is so laden with risk for the sex offender and the relationship of trust between therapist and sex offender so compromised, we draw a distinction between a prisoner not receiving sex offender treatment and a prisoner\u2019s refusal of such treatment. At an SDP civil commitment proceeding, a qualified examiner or the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness may offer the opinion \u2014 assuming it is sufficiently supported by empirical evidence \u2014 that those who receive or complete sex offender treatment are less likely sexually to reoffend than those who do not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If sex offender treatment has been shown to reduce sexual recidivism, what is relevant is whether a defendant received such treatment as a prisoner, not why he did not. It does not matter whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>failure to obtain treatment arises from the unavailability of treatment at the facility where the prisoner is held or from the refusal by the prisoner to enroll in treatment. If supported by empirical evidence, we do not find this opinion to be unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">But if a jury were to learn that a defendant refused sex offender treatment as a prisoner, they may infer from the refusal that the defendant does not wish to be treated for sexual problems. Where sex offender treatment is conditioned on a waiver of confidentiality, refusal of treatment alone is insufficient to support an inference that the prisoner does not want to be treated. If the Commonwealth were to provide sex offender therapy without requiring a waiver of confidentiality, then this inference arising from refusal would be fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, although evidence that a defendant in an SDP civil commitment proceeding did not receive sex offender treatment is admissible, we conclude that it is error to admit evidence that a defendant refused sex offender treatment where he could receive such treatment only by waiving confidentiality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The risk of unfair prejudice arising from such evidence substantially exceeds its probative value, especially where, as just stated, the jury properly may learn that the defendant did not receive sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Therefore, we conclude that the judge erred in admitting evidence that the defendant refused sex offender treatment and should have allowed evidence only that the defendant did not receive such treatment. We recognize that the judge may not reasonably be faulted for this error because we have not before considered this issue or drawn this evidentiary distinction between not receiving treatment and refusing treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">2. <em>Excusal of prospective juror for cause. </em>During voir dire of the venire, a prospective juror declared that he had two biases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">\u201c[0]ne, I think that the Massachusetts law is too lenient in these cases; two, I don\u2019t think the medical community has the facilities to prove one way or the other, to rehabilitate or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The juror assured the judge that he would not have trouble following the law as the judge instructed, even if he were to disagree with it. The judge told the juror that his \u201cviews on the state of medical science\u201d would not disqualify him as a juror unless they would cause him automatically to reject any opinion by a medical expert. The juror explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that I would reject an opinion as it is, that I don\u2019t think that they can demonstrate one way or another whether or not this guy\u2019s going to repeat the crime or not. ... I just don\u2019t think their opinions relate to anything that\u2019s conclusive. ... I don\u2019t think that they really can prove one way or the other if . . . he\u2019s going to repeat or not unless they demonstrate that they . . . repeat the behavior of doing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The judge, in conferring with the attorneys after the juror had stepped back, said that his \u201csense\u201d was that the juror \u201cwould handicap the Commonwealth\u201d in its reliance on psychological opinion testimony because the juror \u201cdoes not believe that the psychological community can predict future behavior and that . . . belief would almost lead automatically\u201d to the juror finding the defendant not to be sexually dangerous. Defense counsel said that he thought the juror was \u201cexpressing a healthy skepticism about the testimony in this case.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not skepticism; it\u2019s rejection is what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>judge, over defense objection, excused the prospective juror for cause, stating that he did not \u201cbelieve on the science opinion that he can be fully fair to the Commonwealth\u201d and that he could not be \u201csatisfied that he could be fully fair and impartial to both sides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We give great deference to a judge\u2019s decision to excuse a prospective juror for cause during empanelment, because a judge who has spoken directly with the juror is better positioned than we are to evaluate the juror\u2019s credibility and impartiality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupont, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 605, 607-608 (2009). We review the decision for abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 442-443 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456, 460-461 (1989). We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in excusing this juror. The judge properly recognized that a \u201chealthy skepticism\u201d of the ability of experts to predict future sexual recidivism did not justify excusing the juror for cause. He rested his decision on his informed judgment that the prospective juror had decided to reject the opinions of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses before hearing their testimony and therefore could not be a fair and impartial juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">3. <em>Admissibility of rumors that the defendant had sexually assaulted another inmate. </em>Before trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude references to false rumors circulating within the prison suggesting that he sexually assaulted another inmate. The defendant had reported the rumors in correspondence to the department because he wanted to remain in protective custody and had challenged the disciplinary reports he received for refusing an order to return to the general prison population. The judge reserved his decision on the motion until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">During the cross-examination of one of the qualified examiners, Dr. Michael Murphy, defense counsel asked whether the defendant\u2019s disciplinary reports could fairly be characterized as \u201ctechnical or minor in nature.\u201d Dr. Murphy stated that the disciplinary reports primarily involved the defendant\u2019s refusal to \u201cgo into population settings that he was ordered to go into.\u201d Defense counsel asked if the records showed that the defendant had complained that he feared for his safety in prison. Dr. Murphy replied in the affirmative and stated that the defendant had</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>cited reasons why \u201che felt that he was in more danger in the general population of assault by other inmates, so he refused to go into the population resulting in a disciplinary report. . . .\u201d At a subsequent sidebar, the prosecutor argued that this exchange had \u201copened the door\u201d for her to inquire into the basis of the defendant\u2019s fear and solicit evidence regarding the prison rumors that he had raped another inmate. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge agreed, finding that G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c), which allows the admission of prison \u201cincident reports,\u201d required the admission of testimony about the rumor. On redirect examination, the prosecutor elicited from Dr. Murphy that the defendant in correspondence stated he believed he had been targeted for assault by other inmates because \u201che had been accused . . . within the inmate population of having sexually assaulted another inmate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The defendant claims that the judge abused his discretion in admitting in evidence this unsubstantiated rumor. We agree. The judge recognized that the only reference to a rumor that the defendant had raped another inmate came from the defendant; there was no report of a rape from any other source and no suggestion that the prison had investigated the allegation or made a determination as to the truth of the allegation. But the judge appeared to believe that he was bound by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331 (2002), to admit evidence of these rumors because they were mentioned in prison incident reports that are admissible in evidence in SDP civil commitment proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the disclosure of these rumors was not contained in an incident report and is not admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">An \u201cincident report\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 123A or the department\u2019s regulations, but we can discern its meaning from the term itself, the context in which it is used in the department\u2019s policies, and our case law. An \u201cincident\u201d is \u201ca definite and separate occurrence; an event.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 886 (4th ed. 2006). A \u201creport\u201d is \u201c[a]n account presented usu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ally in detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1480. Under the department\u2019s written policy, \u201c[a]ll allegations and incidents of inmate on inmate . . . sexually abusive behavior shall immediately be reported by Department employees, contractors and volunteers to the shift commander verbally and followed up with a confidential incident report to the Superintendent before the end of his/her shift.\u201d 103 DOC \u00a7 519.03 (2011). From the dictionary definition of these words and their use in this department policy, it is plain that an incident report is a written report of an event or allegation prepared by a correction employee, contractor, or volunteer. We have also understood incident reports to be descriptions of specific events prepared by correction officers who investigated the events. In <em>McHoul, petitioner, </em>445 Mass. 143, 150 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1114 (2006), we noted that incident reports \u201cmay contain the reporting officer\u2019s own observations,\u201d admissions by the person charged with the incident, \u201cstatements of other inmate witnesses, or information supplied by other correctional officers investigating the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Here, the defendant\u2019s references to these rumors were contained in his own correspondence and appeals from disciplinary sanctions and classification determinations. They were not contained in any incident report written by correction officers, contractors, or volunteers. There was neither an incident nor a report. Because this information was not contained within an incident report or any other category of document that is admissible under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (c), it could only be admissible under our common-law rules of evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 335. Unsubstantiated rumors of rape that, as here, would be relevant only if offered for their truth are plainly not admissible under our rules of evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Zeininger, </em>459 Mass. 775, 782, cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 462 (2011); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 801-802 (2012). The judge erred in admitting this evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">4. <em>Instructions of law. </em>The defendant contends that the judge made three errors in his final jury instructions, none of which triggered objections at trial. First, the defendant claims that the judge erred in stating, \u201cIn this case, all the experts agreed that the mental abnormality at issue is pedophilia, although the experts disagree about whether [the defendant] meets the clinical diagnostic criteria for pedophilia.\u201d The defendant contends that this instruction gave the jury the false impression that all the experts agreed that pedophilia is a mental abnormality. We agree that this instruction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\u201cMental abnormality\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, as \u201ca congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d An expert witness called by the defense, Dr. Joseph J. Plaud, testified that a diagnosis of pedophilia \u201cdoes not carry with it any . . . statement concerning volitional control,\u201d that is, whether the pedophile\u2019s sexual attraction to prepubescent children means that the pedophile will act on that orientation by having sexual relations with young children. Another expert witness called by the defense, Dr. Daniel Kriegnan, testified more directly about the distinction between the \u201cmental disorder\u201d of pedophilia and a mental abnormality under the law, with only the latter requiring impairment of self-control and the likelihood of future harm to a victim. Both opined that the defendant may meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia but did not meet the legal criteria for a mental abnormality. The judge\u2019s instruction suggested that all the experts had agreed that pedophilia itself is a mental abnormality, which mischaracterized these expert opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Second, the defendant argues that the judge erred in instruct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ing the jury, \u201cYou may conclude that [the defendant] is likely to commit a future act of sexual misconduct if you find that [the defendant] has not committed any act of sexual misconduct during his incarceration.\u201d In the charge conference, the judge read this instruction but included the word \u201ceven\u201d before the word \u201cif.\u201d It appears he neglected to include the word \u201ceven\u201d when he read this instruction to the jury. Had the word \u201ceven\u201d been included, the instruction would have informed the jury that they need not find that the defendant committed any act of sexual misconduct while incarcerated to find the defendant sexually dangerous, which is an accurate statement of law. Without the word \u201ceven,\u201d the instruction suggests confusingly that the absence of any sexual misconduct in prison somehow supports a finding of future sexual dangerousness, which is not an accurate statement of law. This error may be harmless in some circumstances, but it was not harmless here. The prosecutor in her closing argument declared that the defendant was \u201csexually frustrated\u201d after spending approximately eighteen years in prison without \u201caccess to the children that he desires,\u201d suggesting that the defendant\u2019s sexual abstinence in prison made him more likely to offend on his release.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The erroneous jury instruction may have given inappropriate legal validation to the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the judge erred in instructing the jury that if the evidence supports two plausible inferences, \u201cone consistent with the finding of [the defendant] as sexually dangerous and the other that he is not,\u201d then sexual dangerousness has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>389 Mass. 866, 873 (1983), we declared that \u201ca reference to the consequences of an even balance in the evidence preferably should not be included in a charge on reasonable doubt,\u201d but we concluded that in the context of the entire charge this reference could not have led the jury to believe that their verdict could rest on anything less than proof beyond reasonable doubt. The same is true here. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>would have been preferable to omit this instruction, but it did not create confusion regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving sexual dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We need not decide whether the judge\u2019s errors of instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, because we conclude that these errors, when considered together with the erroneous admission of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s refusal of sex offender treatment, the erroneous admission of rumors that the defendant had sexually assaulted another inmate, and the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument regarding the defendant\u2019s sexual frustration from his time in prison, require reversal of the judgment of sexual dangerousness, the setting aside of the jury verdict, and a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 576 (1985).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of sexual dangerousness is reversed, the jury verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by Michael F.
