Mahar did not enter into the agreement to obtain Northeast\u2019s services pursuant to the competitive bidding procedures contained in G. L. c. 30B. When Mahar questioned the validity of the agreement, Northeast filed a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment that its agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>with Mahar is valid and enforceable because, under G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 <em>(b) </em>(33), the agreement is exempt from the competitive solicitation and bidding procedures set forth in G. L. c. 30B. A judge of that court has certified to us the following questions of State law pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201c[1.] Is a contract between a school district and an energy broker for the procurement of contracts for electricity exempt from the requirements of G.

L. c.] 30B applies to the contract, does a provision providing for automatic renewal of the contract term with a public entity, without the public entity\u2019s affirmative approval, violate [G. L. c.] 30B?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">For the reasons discussed below, we answer the first certified question, \u201cYes\u201d; we therefore need not reach the second or third questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>We assume the following facts, which we draw from the pleadings and other documents of record. Northeast is a broker of energy services that acts as an agent for clients in purchasing electricity from electricity suppliers. Northeast\u2019s clients include businesses and governmental entities, such as regional school districts. Through its \u201cPrice Watch Aggregation Program,\u201d Northeast negotiates pricing and other terms with electricity suppliers on behalf of a large group of customers; customers sign agreements authorizing Northeast to enter into multiyear, fixed-rate contracts for electricity, up to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>specified maximum rate, on their behalf. Customers do not pay Northeast to participate in the price watch aggregation program. Northeast receives compensation for its services through commissions and other payments from electricity suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Northeast and Mahar entered into a price watch agreement in July, 2004. That agreement authorized Northeast to explore energy markets, negotiate pricing and other terms, and enter into contracts on Mahar\u2019s behalf for the supply of Mahar\u2019s electricity requirements for a period of between twelve and forty-eight months, at a price of $0.0669 per kilowatt hour or less. The agreement specified that if Northeast were unable to obtain a contract to supply Mahar\u2019s requirements at or below that price, due to \u201cmarket conditions,\u201d Northeast could propose a modification to the agreement to reflect a higher authorized purchase price. The agreement provided also that, on receipt of a proposed higher authorized purchase price or length of term modification, Mahar had fifteen days to respond in writing that it accepted or rejected the proposed modification. If Mahar failed to reject the proposed modification in writing within fifteen days, the agreement would automatically be modified to incorporate the proposed change.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The initial term of the price watch agreement was for one year, ending in July, 2005, but was subject to both extension and automatic renewal under the following circumstances. If Northeast were successful in executing an electricity supply agreement during the one-year period, the initial term would automatically extend to, and be coextensive with, the term of the electricity supply agreement. In addition, as long as Northeast obtained a new or renewal agreement with an electricity sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>plier, then Mahar\u2019s price watch agreement with Northeast would automatically be modified to incorporate the new rate and would renew for a term coextensive with that of the new electricity supply agreement, unless rejected in writing by Mahar within fifteen days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Northeast was unable to obtain a contract for Mahar at the $0.0669 price authorized by the terms of the initial agreement. In January, 2005, Mahar and Northeast amended the price watch agreement, increasing the authorized purchase price to $0.0792 per kilowatt hour for a term of forty-six months, beginning in March, 2005, and ending in December, 2008. Eileen M. Perkins, who was then Mahar\u2019s superintendent, signed the amendment to the price watch agreement to reflect the increased authorized purchase price. In February, 2005, Northeast, as agent for Mahar, entered into an energy service contract with an electricity supplier, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. (Constellation), pursuant to which Constellation would supply Mahar with electricity at the fixed rate of $0.0792 per kilowatt hour until December, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In anticipation of the December, 2008, expiration of the electricity supply agreement, Northeast negotiated a new contract with Constellation for electricity supply on Mahar\u2019s behalf. In July, 2008, Northeast sent Mahar a proposal for the new contract with Constellation, listing a price of $0.1380 per kilowatt hour for a five-year term commencing in December, 2008, and ending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>December, 2013.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the provisions of the amended price watch agreement then in effect, Mahar had until August 1, 2008, to decline the proposal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Mahar did not decline the proposal, Northeast, as agent for Mahar, executed the electricity supply contract with Constellation on August 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In 2009, Mahar\u2019s superintendent, Michael Baldassare, became concerned about the rate Mahar was paying for electricity, which he believed was in excess of that being paid in other Massachusetts school districts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His attempts to negotiate a lower rate with Northeast were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">By two letters sent in March and May, 2010, Mahar advised Northeast and Constellation that it believed the price watch agreement to be invalid and unenforceable because the agreement had not been subject to the competitive bidding procedures contained in G. L. c. 30B, and specifically that the automatic renewal provision violated G. L. c. 30B by renewing the agreement without Mahar\u2019s \u201caffirmative approval.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letters further advised that Mahar would not be renewing the agreement, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Mahar intended to put out to bid \u201cimmediately\u201d a contract for electricity services, and that Mahar would seek a declaratory judgment that its contracts with Northeast and Constellation were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In July, 2010, Northeast filed the underlying declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and Mahar counterclaimed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In December, 2010, Mahar filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the Federal case, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of Mahar\u2019s contracts with Northeast and Constellation; Northeast and Constellation opposed the motion and filed cross motions for summary judgment on Northeast\u2019s claim that the agreements at issue are exempt from the requirements of G. L. c. 30B and therefore valid and enforceable. After a hearing, the judge issued an order certifying the questions now before us.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The first certified question asks that we determine whether an agreement between an energy broker and a regional school district for the procurement of a contract for electricity is a contract for \u201cenergy or energy related services\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 <em>(b) </em>(33), that is exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of G. L. c. 30B. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u201cThe starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute, \u2018the principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984). We apply familiar principles of statutory construction, interpreting the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201cStatutes are to be interpreted, not alone according to their simple, literal or strict verbal meaning, but in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, [and] contemporary customs and conditions .... General expressions may be restrained by relevant circumstances showing a legislative intent that they be narrowed and used in a particular sense.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, supra </em>at 243, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931), cert. denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">a. <em>Uniform procurement act. </em>General Laws c. 30B, the Uniform Procurement Act (procurement act), is a public bidding statute \u201cdesigned to prevent favoritism, to secure honest methods of letting contracts in the public interest, to obtain the most favorable price, and to treat all persons equally.\u201d <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>387 Mass. 687, 692 (1982). Unless a specific exemption exists, the procurement act applies \u201cto every contract for the procurement of supplies, services or real property . . . by a governmental body.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 (a). As is relevant here, the procurement act does not apply to \u201cenergy contracts entered into by a city or town or group of cities or towns or political subdivisions of the [Commonwealth, for energy or energy related services.\u201d G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 <em>(b) </em>(33).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the term \u201cenergy related services\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>not defined in the procurement act, and the parties advance substantially different definitions in support of their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">To support its claim that the contract with Northeast is not one for energy related services, Mahar relies on a May 18, 2010, letter from the office of the Inspector General, which is charged with enforcing the public procurement laws. See G. L. c. 12A, \u00a7 7. According to that letter, energy related services are limited to those services \u201cthat are ancillary to the delivery of energy, such as reactive power and voltage control, loss compensation, and load following.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Northeast asserts that, based on the plain meaning of the term \u201crelated,\u201d its services of \u201cidentifying and selecting electricity suppliers, [and] negotiating and executing agreements,\u201d are \u201cassociated\u201d with or \u201cconnected by means of an established or discoverable relation\u201d to the purchase of energy, and are therefore exempt under G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 <em>(b) </em>(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To some extent, focusing on the phrase \u201cenergy related services\u201d misses the point. The essential inquiry is whether the agreement at issue is of the type that the Legislature intended to exempt from the public bidding requirements of the procurement act. The exemption does not apply to energy related services as distinct from energy; rather, it applies to \u201cenergy contracts . . . for energy or energy related services.\u201d G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 (b) (33). The operative term in this sentence is \u201cenergy contracts.\u201d Although neither \u201cenergy contract\u201d nor \u201cenergy related\u201d are terms defined in the procurement act, a precise definition is unnecessary to resolve the question before us;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is apparent from the statutory scheme that the agreement at issue is an energy contract that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Legislature intended to exempt from the requirements of the procurement act.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">b. <em>Restructuring act. </em>In 1997, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive restructuring of the electric utility industry in Massachusetts, see St. 1997, c. 164 (restructuring act), changing it from a government-regulated monopoly to \u201ca framework under which competitive producers will supply electric power and customers will gain the right to choose their electric power supplier.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 1 <em>(c) </em>(ii). Much of the legislation was codified as amendments to G. L. c. 164, but numerous other provisions of the General Laws were also affected, including sections of the procurement act. See, e.g., St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 58. Among its declared purposes, the restructuring act was intended to provide affordable electric service \u201cto all consumers on reasonable terms\u201d; to introduce \u201ccompetition in the electric generation market\u201d in order to \u201cencourage innovation, efficiency, and improved service from all market participants\u201d with resulting \u201creductions in the cost of regulatory oversight\u201d; to achieve long-term reductions in energy costs by \u201callowing market forces to play the principal role in determining the suppliers of generation for all customers\u201d; and to preserve and augment \u201cconsumer protections, full and fair competition in generation, and enhanced environmental protection goals.\u201d St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>(/), (*), (Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The electric utility industry involves three general components: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>generation, transmission, and distribution. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>431 Mass. 251, 253 (2000). Generation is \u201cthe act or process of transforming other forms of energy into electric energy or the amount of electric energy so produced.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1. \u201cTransmission\u201d is the delivery of electric power \u201cfrom generating facilities across interconnected high voltage lines to where it enters a distribution system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From there, electricity is distributed over lower voltage lines to customers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Prior to the restructuring act, the Massachusetts electric industry consisted of a \u201ccomplex mosaic of exclusive service territories supported by electricity generation, transmission, and distribution assets under the individual ownership of eight discrete investor-owned utilities\u201d as well as forty municipal utilities. D.P.U. 95-30 at 5 (Feb. 10, 1995). These companies controlled the entire process from the generation of electricity to its final distribution to customers. They owned the electric generation facilities, high-voltage transmission networks, and low-voltage distribution networks used to serve customers in their service territories. <em>Id. </em>at 4-6. See <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>915 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 931 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The restructuring act separated these three utility services and opened the supply of generation services to competition, recognizing that \u201cthe interests of consumers [could] best be served by an expedient and orderly transition from regulation to competition in the generation sector consisting of the unbundling of prices and services and the functional separation of generation services from transmission and distribution services.\u201d St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 1 (m). This functional separation of services, which limited a \u201ccompany\u2019s ability to provide itself an undue advantage in buying or selling services in competitive markets,\u201d was regarded as a necessary first step in moving toward \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>fully competitive generation market based on customer choice.\u201d See D.P.U. 95-30 at 16 (Aug. 16, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In the competitive marketplace, consumers of electricity could choose among different suppliers of electricity services, while still receiving their electricity through the existing transmission and distribution networks. D.P.U. 95-30 at 9-10 (Feb. 10, 1995). Consumers could purchase electricity directly from a distribution company or through a \u201ccompetitive supplier,\u201d an entity licensed by the Department of Public Utilities (department) to purchase wholesale power from generation companies for resale to end users. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.02 (2008). Consumers could also purchase electricity by utilizing the services of an \u201celectricity broker,\u201d an entity that \u201cfacilitates or otherwise arranges for the purchase and sale of electricity and related services to [r]etail [customers, but does [not] sell electricity.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The restructuring act also directed the department to promulgate rules and regulations that would \u201cprovide retail customers with the utmost consumer protections contained in the law\u201d and govern licensing of \u201call generation companies, ag-gregators, suppliers, energy marketers, and energy brokers.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IF, inserted by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">A \u201c[s]upplier\u201d of electricity is defined as \u201ca supplier of generation service to retail customers, including power marketers, brokers and marketing affiliates of distribution companies.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1. That \u201csupplier[s]\u201d are defined to include energy brokers recognizes that suppliers and brokers perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>functionally equivalent services that enable consumers to select and purchase electricity from an array of competitive sources. In directing the department to promulgate licensing regulations for the restructured industry, the Legislature also included brokers as a type of supplier. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IF (1) (requiring department to license \u201call generation companies, aggregators, suppliers, energy marketers, and energy brokers,\u201d and referring to \u201cenergy brokers, energy marketers, and other suppliers\u201d). It is apparent from the inclusion of energy brokers within the statutory scheme that the Legislature envisioned that such brokers, by facilitating the sale and purchase of electric energy from the suppliers of energy, would play an important role in \u201caccommodat[ing] retail access to generation services and choice of suppliers by retail customers.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IF.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Although the department\u2019s regulations distinguish between competitive suppliers and electricity brokers, in that a broker does not own or sell electricity to a consumer and only \u201cfacilitates or otherwise arranges\u201d for its purchase and sale, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.02, a broker is treated as equivalent to a supplier in the broader regulatory scheme.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consistent with the statutory language, brokers are explicitly enumerated in various regulatory definitions of \u201csupplier.\u201d See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12.02 (2008) (defining \u201c[n]on-affiliated [e]nergy [s]upplier\u201d as any entity \u201cengaged in marketing, brokering, or selling natural gas, electricity, or energy-related services to retail customers where such product or service is also provided by a Competitive Energy Affiliate\u201d); 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 19.03 (1998) (\u201c[r]etail [s]eller of [electricity\u201d is \u201cany business, person or entity selling, offering to sell, arranging for the sale of, or engaged to market electricity or related products or services to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>consumers, including ... to all entities which are regulated, or which are required to be licensed, by the [department for these purposes\u201d). Suppliers and brokers are generally subject to the same requirements. See, e.g., 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.05 (2009) (establishing \u201crequirements applicable to all Competitive Suppliers and Electricity Brokers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">c. <em>Application to the first certified question. </em>At the same time that the Legislature created this newly competitive energy marketplace, it also exempted from the procurement act\u2019s complex public bidding requirements \u201cenergy contracts entered into by . . . political subdivisions of the commonwealth, for energy or energy related services.\u201d G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 (b) (33). There is no dispute that a contract for the purchase and sale of electricity entered into directly between a regional school district and an energy supplier is an \u201cenergy contract\u201d within the meaning of the exemption. Because a broker that facilitates or arranges for the purchase and sale of electricity on behalf of a retail customer performs functionally the same service as an energy supplier, the Legislature could not have intended to require that such contracts with energy brokers be subject to the procurement act, while exempting agreements for the direct purchase of energy from energy suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In addition to including brokers within the statutory definition of suppliers, the Legislature required the licensing and regulation of both types of entities. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IF. The regulations preclude competitive suppliers from using the services of \u201cany entity to facilitate or otherwise arrange for the purchase and sale of electricity to [rjetail [cjustomers, unless such entity has been licensed as an [ejlectricity [bjroker by the [department.\u201d 220 Code Mass Regs. \u00a7 11.05(5). Furthermore, the Legislature established consumer protections for end users, including regional school districts, in the form of licensing requirements and customer authorization requirements applicable to both suppliers and brokers. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IF (1), (8) (a); 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.05(2), (4). The Legislature also put in place a mechanism for oversight of energy contracts entered into by cities, towns, and political subdivisions. A contract exempt from the procurement act pursuant to G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 (b) (33), must nevertheless be submitted to the department, the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Energy Resources, and the office of the Inspector General within fifteen days of signing, along with \u201ca report of the process used to execute the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">These licensing and regulatory provisions guard against potential abuses in the new competitive environment, and support a determination that the Legislature intended to exempt from the requirements of the procurement act a contract for energy between a regional school district and an electricity broker, as well as between a regional school district and a competitive supplier of electricity. We therefore conclude that an agreement between a regional school district and an energy broker to arrange for the purchase of electricity is an \u201cenergy contract\u201d exempt from the requirements of the procurement act pursuant to G. L. c. 30B, \u00a7 1 (b) (33).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We answer the first certified question, \u201cYes.\u201d Because of our answer to the first certified question, the second and third certified questions are not applicable, and we do not answer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The Reporter of Decisions is directed to furnish attested copies of this opinion to the clerk of this court.

See National Consumer Law Center, Access to Utility Service \u00a7 1.4.2.4 (1996 &amp; Supp. 1998). The restructuring act reflects considerations underlying the department\u2019s earlier investigation: to \u201cpromote competition and economic efficiency\u201d in the electric utility industry and to extend to customers \u201cthe option of choosing their own electricity suppliers.\u201d D.P.U. 95-30 at i, 4 (Aug. 16, 1995) (if \u201cinitiatives to restructure the electric utility industry require statutory change, the [department will coordinate with the Legislature in an effort to bring about change that is in the public interest\u201d).
