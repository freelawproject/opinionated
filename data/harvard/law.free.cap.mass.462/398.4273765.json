L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A. At the defendant\u2019s first trial in November, 2003, the trial judge entered a required finding of not guilty on one of the indictments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned guilty verdicts on the remaining indictments. However, in October, 2004, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In December, 2008, the case proceeded to a new jury trial, before a different Superior Court judge, on the remaining five indictments. Although the indictments did not specify, the first three involved the child victim, Nancy, and the remaining two involved her half-sister, Toria.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty on the charges of rape of a child by force as to Nancy, finding that there was insufficient evidence of the element of penetration, but submitted to the jury three charges of the lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery on a person under the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The judge also allowed the defendant\u2019s motion on the charges of rape of a child by force as to Toria, finding there was insufficient evidence of the element of force, but submitted to the jury two charges of the lesser included offense of statutory rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. The jury convicted the defendant of all charges. The defendant appealed, arguing (1) that he was convicted of crimes for which he was not indicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>in violation of his State and Federal constitutional rights; (2) error in the admission of first complaint testimony; (3) error by the judge\u2019s restriction of cross-examination of Toria and refusal to grant a mistrial; and (4) error in the admission of bad act evidence. We transferred the case here on our own motion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as the jury could have found them, reserving certain details for later discussion. In January, 2000, Nancy was six years of age and her half-sister, Toria, was ten years of age. The girls lived in Peabody with their mother, Paula,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who was divorced and worked full time. Paula\u2019s mother, the girls\u2019 grandmother, Arlinda (called Linda), regularly cared for the girls at her house in Peabody. When Linda babysat the girls, the defendant, who was her live-in boy friend, often would be present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Nancy testified that her relationship with the defendant changed when he began \u201ctouching her.\u201d During the period between January, 2000, and September, 2001, the defendant, in various rooms of the house, would reach his hand under Nancy\u2019s underwear, or pull down her pants and underwear, and touch the outside of her vagina with his fingers. This touching occurred once in the dining room, once in the exercise room, and more than ten times in the living room. When the touching occurred, others were often in the house, but not in the same room as Nancy and the defendant. In addition to the sexual touchings, the defendant once showed Nancy images of \u201chalf-naked\u201d women on his computer and asked her if she could keep it a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Toria testified that her relationship with the defendant changed around the same time period as her sister reported, starting when Toria was ten years of age. The defendant would have Toria sit on his lap to play computer games. On one occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the defendant rubbed his hand on her leg and moved his hand higher up her leg while he was doing so. Another time, the defendant touched her vagina over her clothes. Several times the defendant put his hand inside Toria\u2019s pants, inserted his finger into her vagina and \u201cmove[d] it around.\u201d This occurred about ten times in the dining room and once in Linda\u2019s bedroom. In the basement, dining room, and once in the outside shed, the defendant would stand Toria up, lift up her shirt, and suck on her nipples. Several times after touching Toria, the defendant instructed her not to tell her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Once, in the basement, Toria was sitting on the defendant\u2019s lap at his workbench. The defendant started tickling Toria, then pushed up her shirt over her head. Linda walked in and saw them, started yelling, and told Toria to get off of the defendant. Linda then went back upstairs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Toria also testified that on more than one occasion, the defendant showed her computer images of naked or \u201csemi-dressed\u201d women. The defendant showed her images of women grabbing their breasts and women who were spreading their legs \u201cwide open.\u201d Neither girl observed the defendant touching the other girl in a sexual manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">After Paula learned from the girls that the defendant had shown them computer images of undressed and partially undressed women, she went to Linda\u2019s house and had Linda enter his password on his computer. Paula found recently viewed Web sites, which were \u201ctriple-x sites.\u201d She \u201cclicked on\u201d one Web site that revealed images of naked women and advertised other Web sites to visit for illicit sex. Linda did not remember this, but did recall one instance where she found the defendant at his computer watching a young (but adult) woman \u201cstripping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">After Paula learned about the defendant\u2019s having inappropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>touched the girls, she asked her mother to have the defendant telephone her. When they spoke about this, four days later, the defendant said that he wanted to be the one who showed her girls how to \u201cbe with a man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The defendant was the sole defense witness. He denied all the allegations. He claimed that he did not purposefully visit Web sites with images of naked women, but rather received such images because of then inadequate \u201cspam\u201d filtering. He acknowledged the incident in the basement with Toria that Linda observed, but maintained that Toria took off her shirt on her own initiative and then asked him to rub her back, which he did. He admitted to having borrowed money from Linda. He denied telling Paula over the telephone that he wanted to be the one to show the girls how to be with a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The theory of the defense was that none of the sexual touchings had ever occurred. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel suggested that they could not have occurred without having been observed because of the open floor plan of the house. He also argued that Paula had always resented him and had fabricated the events. Further, he claimed that the accusations were false because the girls did not disclose the abuse to a disinterested party for a long time.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Amendment of the indictments. </em>As relevant here, the indictments involving Toria alleged two offenses (rape of a child under the age of sixteen by force) that took place on \u201cdivers dates between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2001\u201d in Peabody, but otherwise did not specify where in Peabody. The grand jury heard testimony that the defendant had digitally penetrated Toria \u201cat least three times,\u201d including once in the dining room of Linda\u2019s house, once in the defendant\u2019s automobile, and once in Danvers, but the trial judge entered a finding of not guilty on that indictment, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. At the second trial, however, Toria testified that the defendant digitally penetrated her in the dining room about ten times and once in her grandmother\u2019s bedroom. After modifying the indictment to reflect two charges of statutory rape, the judge instructed the jury that a guilty verdict on each indictment required they unanimously find at least one occasion of the offense on Toria in the dining room and one occasion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Linda\u2019s bedroom. Following the final charge, the defendant renewed his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the latter indictment, arguing that he had not been indicted for an offense that took place in Linda\u2019s bedroom. The judge denied the motion. The defendant argues this was error and that he was convicted of a crime for which he was not charged (i.e., statutory rape in Linda\u2019s bedroom) in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u201cUnder Mass. R. Crim. P. 4 (d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979), a judge has discretion to allow an amendment of an indictment if the amendment is one of form, not substance, and if the amendment will \u2018not result in prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 787 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>437 Mass. 487, 491-492 (2002). \u201cArticle 12 . . . adds the requirement that the amendment not \u2018materially change[] the work of the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, supra </em>at 492. Here, we assume without deciding that with his instructions to the jury, the judge effectively amended the last indictment (as specified in the grand jury evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>American News Co., </em>333 Mass. 74, 77 [1955]) by changing the location of the offense from the defendant\u2019s automobile to Linda\u2019s bedroom. We conclude that this so-called variance in location was not material and was one of form only. \u201cThe time and place of the commission of the crime need not be alleged [in the indictment] unless it is an essential element thereof.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 20. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Megna, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 514-515 (2003). The location of the offense is not an element of either statutory or forcible rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Mass. 217, 222 n.3 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) (King) (elements of rape of child under sixteen by force are [1] sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with [2] child under sixteen years of age [3] by force or threat of bodily injury and [4] against child\u2019s will); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knap, </em>412 Mass. 712, 714 (1992) (elements of statutory rape are [1] sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with [2] child under sixteen years of age). Thus, the variance in location may constitute a ground for acquittal only if the defendant was thereby prejudiced in his defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Megna, supra </em>at 515, quoting G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35 (\u201cA defendant shall not be acquitted on the ground of variance between the allegations and proof if the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless he is thereby prejudiced in his defence\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parrotta, </em>316 Mass. 307, 309-310 (1944) (change in location not element of crime requiring acquittal unless defendant prejudiced in defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The variance did not prejudice the defendant. The purpose of an indictment is \u201cto furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defence. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 512 (1991), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, 92 </em>U.S. 542, 558 (1875). At the defendant\u2019s second trial, he had the benefit of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence from the first trial, which included Toria\u2019s testimony that the defendant had digitally penetrated her in Linda\u2019s bedroom. Thus, the defendant had reasonable notice of the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the offenses occurred not only in the dining room, but also in Linda\u2019s bedroom. Any ambiguity as to the location of the offenses did not impact his defense that he never committed the offenses or that the allegations were fabricated because Paula did not like him. Although the defendant maintains that his defense could have been altered insofar as he suggested that the open floor plan of the first floor of the house bolstered his denial of the allegations, he could not have relied on such a claim before the variance. Nevertheless, in view of Toria\u2019s testimony at the first trial, no matter how arguably \u201cunreliable,\u201d the defendant had full notice that his \u201copen floor plan\u201d defense would not necessarily be responsive to the allegation of penetration in the bedroom. In the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>cumstances, we determine that there was no prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>420 Mass. 508, 511 n.6 (1995) (no prejudice where defendant had benefit of evidence at first trial concerning challenged variance at second trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Last, the variance did not materially change the work of the grand jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 790. The grand jury were told that the incidents involving Toria alleged offenses (rape of a child under sixteen years of age by force) that happened \u201cat least three times.\u201d Although the prosecutor had identified three locations where such offenses had occurred, the location of the offense is not an element of the offense and was not set out in the indictments (except identifying the town). Rather, the grand jury returned indictments involving Toria and alleging rape of a child by force \u201con divers dates between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2001,\u201d and did not limit the offenses in number or to any specific location other than the town. Thus, the charge with the location \u201cchange\u201d was never precluded by the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">b. <em>First complaint testimony. </em>Prior to trial, the Commonwealth moved to introduce the testimony of Paula as the first complaint witness for both Nancy and Toria, even though the girls had talked first to each other. The judge allowed the motion, determining that in view of the facts that the girls were very young and both were complainants, it was appropriate to admit Paula\u2019s testimony because she was the first adult and first noncomplain-ant who had been told about the sexual assaults.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">At trial, Nancy testified that on one occasion she told her sister \u201cwhat was happening\u201d and \u201call [that Toria] did was say that it was happening to [her] too.\u201d The defendant did not object to this testimony. Toria also testified that she had spoken once to Nancy about what was happening.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Toria stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Nancy \u201cwent into detail\u201d about what was happening to her and Toria just said, \u201cMe too.\u201d The judge did not provide any cautionary or limiting instructions concerning this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Nancy also testified that in September, 2001, while in a supermarket, she first told her mother about the defendant touching her. Nancy recalled that earlier that day, while in her grandmother\u2019s dining room, she had told her mother that the defendant had shown her images of \u201chalf-naked women\u201d on his computer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Toria testified that one day in September, 2001, at her grandmother\u2019s house, she asked her mother for permission to use the Internet. Paula said no because there might be pornography.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nancy asked what pornography was. After Paula explained, Nancy stated that she had seen that before and Toria added that she had also. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, which the judge overruled, Toria testified that Paula asked where they had seen it, and the girls told her that the defendant had shown it to them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Paula left. Toria testified that a few days later, she told her mother that the defendant had touched her. Toria did not remember where the disclosure had occurred or if her sister had been present, but did recall that her grandmother had not been present.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Paula testified that, on September 23, 2001, she brought the girls to her mother\u2019s house. The defendant was not there. The girls asked to use the Internet and Paula told them no, explaining to them that it was \u201cunfiltered\u201d and they \u201ccould find things that [they] aren\u2019t supposed to see.\u201d Nancy told Paula that the defendant had already shown her \u201cpictures of women with shirts and no pants,\u201d and Toria added that she had seen \u201cpictures of women with no clothes on.\u201d Paula left, but soon returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>bring the girls home.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That night, she returned to Linda\u2019s house and asked her mother to enter the defendant\u2019s password into his computer, and found the \u201ctriple-x\u201d Web sites. A couple of days later, she asked Nancy if the defendant had touched her and Nancy replied that the defendant had touched her under her shirt and down her pants. Paula testified that on that day or the following day, she asked Toria if the defendant had touched her, and Toria replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Paula stated that she did not recall whether she had spoken to the girls together or separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Before Paula testified about learning from the girls that the defendant had shown them computer images of undressed or partially undressed women and that the defendant had touched them in a sexual manner, the judge gave proper limiting first complaint instructions in accordance with <em>King, supra </em>at 247-248. He also instructed the jury on the subject in his final charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">i. <em>First complaint doctrine. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass. 60, 71 (2011) <em>(Aviles), </em>we affirmed the continued vitality of the first complaint doctrine as set forth in <em>King, supra, </em>and its progeny, and set forth a brief overview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIn <em>King, </em>we replaced the doctrine of \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 with the doctrine of \u2018first complaint\u2019 to reflect \u2018a contemporary understanding of information that will permit jurors to make a fair assessment of a sexual assault complainant\u2019s credibility.\u2019 <em>King, [supra] </em>at 237. See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 413 (2011). Pursuant to the first complaint doctrine, we \u2018no longer permit in evidence testimony from multiple complaint witnesses, limiting the testimony to that of one witness\u2019 who, where feasible, will be the first person told of the sexual assault. <em>King, supra </em>at 242-243. Such witness \u2018may testify to the details of the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint of sexual assault and the circumstances surrounding that first complaint as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 243. Where a first complaint witness testifies at trial regarding the complaint, the complainant also may testify about the details of the first complaint and the reasons why it was made at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>particular time. See <em>id. </em>at 245. What the complainant may not do, however, is testify to the fact that she \u2018told\u2019 others, apart from the first complaint witness, about the sexual assault, even where the details of the conversation have been omitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 223 (2009)[;] <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 493 (2009). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 456-457 (2008)[.] Such testimony \u2018is the equivalent of saying that [the complainant] repeated her account of the incident, i.e., it allows fresh complaint testimony through the back door. Repetition of the narrative tends to enhance the credibility of the complainant to the prejudice of the defendant.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 457.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><em>Aviles, supra </em>at 67-68. First complaint testimony is admissible only where \u201cthe fact of the assault or the issue of consent is contested.\u201d <em>King, supra </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In <em>Aviles, supra </em>at 73, we modified the scope of appellate review of decisions on the admissibility of first complaint evidence. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201cThe judge who is evaluating the facts of a particular case is in the best position to determine the scope of admissible evidence, keeping in mind the underlying goals of the first complaint doctrine, our established first complaint jurisprudence, and our guidelines for admitting or excluding relevant evidence. . . . Once a judge has carefully and thoroughly analyzed these considerations, and has decided that proposed first complaint evidence is admissible, an appellate court shall review that determination under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">ii. <em>Cumulative first complaint testimony. </em>Where the judge permitted Paula to testify as the first complaint witness,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the girls\u2019 testimony that they first told each other about the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ant\u2019s having inappropriately touched them should not have been admitted. See <em>King, supra </em>at 243 (under first complaint doctrine, only one complainant witness is permitted to testify). The defendant did not object to the admission of their respective testimony on this ground, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>and does not argue that the failure to object was the result of a tactical decision by his trial counsel. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 853 (2010). Where the defense was that the touchings did not happen at all, that the accusations were false because the girls did not disclose the abuse to a disinterested party for so long, that the abuse would have been discovered in view of the open floor plan of the house, and that the accusations were fabricated because Paula hated the defendant, there does not appear to be any strategic reason for the defense to have withheld an objection to the girls\u2019 testimony concerning their complaints to each other. We add, in considering whether the admission of the testimony created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra </em>at 846, that the testimony was brief and provided no details of the alleged sexual encounters. The testimony also was \u201cweak\u201d because it could have been viewed as inherently biased, as both girls were making claims against the defendant. Thus, the testimony could not have served to counteract any perception that their remaining silent following the sexual assaults meant that they may have fabricated their claims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008). Last, the prosecutor did not use the testimony in her closing argument to bolster the girls\u2019 credibility. In these circumstances, there was no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>risk of a miscarriage of justice resulting from the cumulative first complaint testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">iii. <em>Scope of the first complaint evidence. </em>The defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the admission of testimony regarding the computer images of women he allegedly showed to the girls. He asserts that, because this evidence did not allege a sexual assault, it did not qualify as a complaint but amounted to the improper admission of bad act evidence. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence. See <em>Aviles, supra </em>at 73. The evidence was properly admitted to provide context to Paula\u2019s first complaint testimony. See <em>King, supra </em>at 246 (under first complaint doctrine, witness may testify to \u201cthe events or conversation that culminated in the complaint\u201d). The evidence explained why Paula would ask the girls if the defendant had touched them or why they suddenly would come forward with the allegations that he had done so. The testimony furthered the goal of the first complaint doctrine \u201cto give the jury as complete a picture as possible of how the accusation of sexual assault first arose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. \u201cThat complete picture . . . allow[ed] them to make a fairer and more accurate assessment of the validity of that accusation, based on specific information about the people involved rather than on outdated stereotypes and generalities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the judge instructed the jury that it is \u201cnot a crime\u201d to look at images \u201cof naked or semi-naked women on the computer\u201d and that no proclivity to commit crimes, sexual or otherwise, could be inferred from such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">c. <em>Restriction of cross-examination of Toria and refusal to grant mistrial. </em>In December, 2007, Toria was charged in Middle-sex County with murder. Before the opening statements at the defendant\u2019s second trial in December, 2008, the Commonwealth moved to preclude the defendant from impeaching Toria with the murder indictment. Defense counsel argued, however, that Toria might be biased in testifying at the second trial because, on information and belief, her defense to the murder indictment was based on posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from having been sexually assaulted by the defendant. The judge stated that, in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 762-763 (1979), he would not allow the impeachment absent a material change in Toria\u2019s forthcoming trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Surprising both the prosecutor and the defendant at the second trial, Toria testified that in the backyard shed the defendant had sucked on her nipples and had painted a yellow flower onto one of her nipples. On cross-examination, defense counsel tried to impeach her, questioning why she was revealing this incident for the first time on the stand. Toria, however, claimed that \u201cyears ago\u201d she had told a victim witness advocate about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Before the testimony of the next witness, defense counsel moved to recall Toria so that he could impeach her with the murder indictment, arguing that Toria\u2019s testimony concerning the painting of her nipple was a material deviation from her previous testimony. The prosecutor objected, asserting that the testimony did not pertain to a charged offense and noted that Toria never wavered from her assertions of digital penetration. The prosecutor stated that she had no knowledge of this allegation and would not refer to it during her closing argument. The judge acknowledged that the new testimony, if believed, might add credence to Toria\u2019s other claims due to what the jurors may perceive as a kind of \u201ckinkiness,\u201d but expressed his view that any potential impact was limited by the collateral nature of the testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s representation that she would not reference this evidence during her closing argument. The judge concluded that the probative value of the evidence was minimal and that the prejudicial impact of the murder charge would be \u201cvery substantial,\u201d and excluded the evidence over the objection of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The next day before any testimony was taken, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that Toria\u2019s testimony concerning the painting of her nipple amounted to a prior bad act of the defendant of which he was not given notice. He suggested that the evidence was very damaging, likely having a \u201ccumulative effect down the line,\u201d and expressed doubts that any curative instruction could mitigate the prejudice. The judge determined that granting a mistrial would be harsh and instead struck the testimony, providing the following cautionary instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cMembers of the jury, you heard testimony yesterday from [Toria] that there was an episode in the shed where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>[the defendant] allegedly painted a flower on one of her nipples. That testimony is going to be stricken, and by that, I mean deleted, from the record. And you should delete it from your mind for this reason: up until the time that testimony was provided on the witness stand, no information to that effect was in the hands of either the prosecutor or the defense attorney, so there was no opportunity to deal with it or to verify it. So you must disregard that testimony. It\u2019s really important. I know it\u2019s hard to, sort of, put the paste back in the tube, but you really must disregard that testimony. If you have a note on it, scratch the note out.<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> And do not let it play any role in your deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The defendant argues that the judge abused his discretion by failing to allow defense counsel to impeach To\u00f1a with the murder indictment and by failing to declare a mistrial. We first address the exclusion of the impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u201cArrest or indictment alone is insufficient for general impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 759, citing G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. However, \u201ca criminal defendant is \u2018entitled, as of right, to reasonable cross-examination of a witness for the purpose of showing bias, particularly where that witness may have a motivation to seek favor with the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 760, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 310 (1979). This right is not limitless. Where a witness has made statements or given testimony that predates the charge at issue, there typically must be a \u201cmaterial\u201d change of the witness\u2019s testimony postdating the charge to render it subject to impeachment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 762-763. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 656, 663 (2002). Absent such a material change in testimony, cross-examination on the pending charge may properly be denied \u201cbecause there is no basis for arguing that the criminal charge[] caused the witness to be biased in favor of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>423 Mass. 880, 884 (1996). The decision whether to allow such impeachment testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See <em>id.; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, supra </em>at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The testimony concerning the alleged painting of Toria\u2019s nipple did not pertain to the charges (statutory rape) against the defendant. The judge, thus, correctly determined that such testimony was collateral and did not materially differ from Toria\u2019s prior testimony concerning the allegations that formed the basis of the charges, namely, that the defendant had digitally penetrated her. In any event, the defendant overlooks that the judge struck the testimony and instructed the jury to delete it from their minds and disregard it. \u201cJurors are presumed to follow a judge\u2019s instructions, including instructions to disregard certain testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>450 Mass. 645, 651 (2008). As such, even if an abuse of discretion occurred, the defendant suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to grant a mistrial. See <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 669-670 (2012) (decision to declare mistrial within sound discretion of trial judge). Toria\u2019s testimony came as a surprise to both parties and was not occasioned by any wrongful conduct by the prosecutor. Her testimony did not bear on the charged conduct. As mentioned, the judge instructed the jury to disregard the testimony and the jurors _are presumed to follow such instructions, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra. </em>In instructing the jury, the judge somewhat impugned Toria\u2019s credibility because he told the jury that neither the defense nor the prosecution was told of the incident, which contradicted Toria\u2019s testimony that she had disclosed the incident to a victim witness advocate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the circumstances, there was no prejudice to the defendant from the late disclosure of this new incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">d. <em>Bad act evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the judge abused his discretion in admitting \u201cnumerous incidences of non-charged criminal behavior and prior bad act[]\u201d evidence amounting to prejudicial propensity evidence that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. He points to the evidence of images of naked or semi-nalced women on his computer, an issue we have already addressed and determined to be properly admitted to show context of the first complaint testimony. He also points to the incident in which Toria testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>that the defendant painted a flower on one of her nipples, which we have also addressed. Concerning the defendant\u2019s remaining claims, including the admission of evidence regarding the number of times the defendant sexually touched each of the girls, such evidence was admissible to show \u201ccommon scheme, pattern of operation, [and] absence of accident,\u201d here, undermining the defendant\u2019s explanation for the presence of Toria on his lap without a shirt on when Linda walked into the basement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 128 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001). The evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The six indictments alleged rape of a child by force occurring on divers dates between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2001.

She also did not like the fact that he was significantly younger than Linda.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">In 1996, Paula, the girls, and Paula\u2019s then husband lived with Linda (and the defendant). In the winter of 1997, Linda evicted them because Paula owed her rent money. Later, in 1998, after Paula \u201ccame to Christ,\u201d she reconciled with Linda and developed a \u201cfriendly\u201d relationship with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Linda testified that this incident occurred in October, 2000. She went into the basement and found Toria sitting on the defendant\u2019s lap with her shirt off. The defendant was rubbing Toria\u2019s arm. Linda pulled out a box for Toria to sit on, but did not say anything. Linda never told her daughter what she had seen. She did speak with the defendant, who told her that Toria had taken her shirt off on her own initiative. The prosecutor elicited testimony that the defendant owed Linda thousands of dollars and that she was hoping he would pay her back. The prosecutor suggested during her closing argument that this was why Linda did not inform Paula of what had happened in the basement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury . . . .\u201d Article 12 of the Massachusetts of Declaration of Rights reads, as relevant here, that \u201c[n]o subject shall be held to answer for any crimes or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him . . . .\u201d The defendant overlooks that the \u201cright to a grand jury, secured by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, is not binding on the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCravy, </em>430 Mass. 758, 761-762 n.5 (2000), citing <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 534-535 (1884).

The judge concluded that the testimony was helpful to give context to the jury concerning how the first complaint arose. Nancy testified that she told her mother about the images because the defendant had told her not to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The defendant objected to Toria\u2019s use of the word \u201cpornography.\u201d The judge overruled the objection because it was the word spoken, but instructed the jury that, regarding the computer images shown, all they had heard was \u201ca particular description from the witness\u201d and the \u201cclassification\u201d was for them to decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The defendant states that the record reflects that Toria also told her grandmother about the images on the computer, but the record appears to us to be unclear on this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">There was conflicting evidence concerning what transpired later that day, after Paula left.

Indeed, \u201c[i]n limited circumstances ... a judge may permit the testimony of a complaint witness other than the individual to whom the victim first disclosed the assault.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>461 Mass. 143, 156-157 (2011). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>example, substitution may be appropriate \u201cwhere the first person told of the alleged assault is unavailable, incompetent, or too young to testify meaningfully.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 243-244 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). \u201cThe substituted witness should in most cases be the next complaint witness, absent compelling circumstances justifying further substitution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008). In this case, Toria was Nancy\u2019s first complaint witness and Nancy was Toria\u2019s. In view of their young age at the time of the disclosures, no abuse of discretion occurred when the judge permitted Paula to testify as the first complaint witness. The lack of findings is inconsequential. Findings are only required in certain circumstances, \u201csuch as in the case of bias on the part of the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446-447.
