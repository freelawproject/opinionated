Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (g), as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993), a judge in the Superior Court found that the defendant, Thomas J. Mortimer, IV, was indigent but able to contribute $40,000 to his defense against indictments charging him with the murders of his wife, mother-in-law, and two children. In setting the amount of the defendant\u2019s required contribution, the judge considered various assets that the defendant had reported to the probation department, including bank accounts, a college fund, and an individual retirement account (IRA). She also voiced \u201cconcerns as to the correctness\u201d of her findings with regard to the defendant\u2019s indigency status and the amount of his contribution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, thus, reported the propriety of her decision to the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 42 Mass. 1501 (2004). We subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The defendant contends that the order is in error because in the judge\u2019s calculation of assets available to him, she incorrectly included assets held either jointly with his deceased wife or in trust for one of his deceased children \u25a0\u2014 assets that are currently unavailable to him under the so-called \u201cslayer statute,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 46 (\u00a7 46). The defendant also urges us to rule that his IRA lies outside the definition of \u201cliquid assets\u201d included in SJ.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (h), and accordingly, that it should not be considered as an asset available to him for purposes of determining his indigency or his ability to contribute to the cost of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We conclude that a significant portion of the assets the judge included in the defendant\u2019s indigency determination are likely unavailable to him in light of the constraints of \u00a7 46, and that the order of the judge must be vacated and the case remanded for further findings. We also conclude that an IRA is ordinarily to be considered a liquid asset available to the defendant within the meaning of S.J.C. Rule 3:10 and may properly be included in the assessment of his ability to pay for his representation, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>least up to the net amount available to him after accounting for any early withdrawal penalties and taxes. On remand, it will be the defendant\u2019s burden to establish the applicability and amount of any penalties or taxes to be deducted from the gross value of the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><em>Factual and procedural history. </em>The defendant was indicted on August 26, 2010, and held without bail. Prior to his arraignment, a probation officer interviewed the defendant and completed an initial \u201cPretrial Intake/Indigency Report\u201d (short form). During that interview, the defendant represented that he owned two vehicles and had $1,000 in a checking account and $13,000 in an IRA. Based on that information, the probation officer determined the defendant was \u201cnot indigent.\u201d Counsel, however, was appointed by the presiding clerk-magistrate to represent the defendant at his arraignment. Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s court-appointed counsel met with the acting chief probation officer and agreed jointly to recommend that the defendant be categorized as \u201cindigent but able to contribute\u201d $10,000 to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A Superior Court judge then scheduled a hearing for September 9, 2010, to consider further the appointment of counsel and, in anticipation of the hearing, instructed the probation department to reinterview the defendant and complete a more detailed financial statement (long form). In the course of that interview, the defendant identified additional assets, including a college fund for his oldest deceased child with an estimated value of $25,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a bank account held jointly with his wife containing $500. The defendant also estimated the value of his previously reported IRA at $14,000 and his two vehicles at $10,000 and $1,000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">At the hearing, the judge reviewed both indigency forms and considered the joint recommendation of defense counsel and the acting chief probation officer. The discussion between the judge and defense counsel centered around the defendant\u2019s ability to pay for counsel given his disclosed assets and, particularly, the college fund. Defense counsel noted possible proceedings in the Probate and Family Court that might prevent the defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>gaining access to that fund. The judge suggested that the defendant should be able to contribute more than $10,000 to his defense. There was no mention of \u00a7 46 and the constraints it might impose on the defendant\u2019s ability to gain access to any of the disclosed assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In an order issued on October 1, 2010, the judge found that, in light of the anticipated cost of retaining counsel in a capital case, the defendant was indigent but able to contribute to his defense. \u201c[Gjiven his bank accounts, IRA funds, and his deceased child\u2019s college funds,\u201d the judge assessed the defendant\u2019s ability to contribute at $40,000, which she directed the defendant to pay to the clerk\u2019s office \u201cwithin thirty days, or whatever additional time is permitted by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIt is beyond debate that an indigent defendant is entitled to court-appointed counsel for trial of a serious crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>416 Mass. 732, 735 (1994). The Legislature has identified two categories of individuals qualifying for appointed counsel: (1) persons indigent and unable to obtain counsel and (2) persons indigent with the ability to pay a reduced fee for appointed counsel. G. L. c. 211D, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:10 provides further definition to these categories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A party is \u201c[ijndigent\u201d if, inter alia, he or she receives certain types of public assistance, has an annual income that is 125 per cent or less of the current poverty threshold, or is held in custody with no available funds. SJ.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (f). A party is \u201c[i]ndigent but [ajble to [cjontribute\u201d if, inter alia, he or she is \u201ccharged with a felony within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court and [has] available funds . . . insufficient to pay the anticipated cost of counsel for the defense of the felony but . . . sufficient to pay a portion of that cost.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1 (g) (ii). \u201cAvailable [fjunds\u201d are defined within the rule to include a \u201cparty\u2019s liquid assets and disposable net monthly income calculated after provision is made for the party\u2019s bail obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1 (b) (i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Our focus is on the defendant\u2019s available funds, as calculated by the judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 46 may bear directly on the availability of the assets relied on by the judge, our analysis first considers the assets held either jointly between the defendant and his deceased wife or in trust for his deceased child and then separately addresses the defendant\u2019s IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">1. <em>Joint and beneficiary assets. </em>Section 46, which became effective in 2003, prohibits \u201cany person <em>charged </em>with the unlawful killing of the decedent from taking from the decedent\u2019s estate; . . . including property held between the person charged and the decedent in joint tenancy or by tenancy in the entirety\u201d (emphasis added). In this respect, it codifies the long-standing public policy of preventing individuals from benefiting from their felonious acts. See, e.g., <em>Egelhoff </em>v. <em>Egelhoff ex rel. Breiner, </em>532 U.S. 141, 152 (2001) (noting adoption of slayer statutes in most States and \u201chistorical pedigree\u201d of underlying principle); <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>245 Mass. 565, 567 (1923) (recognizing policy in insurance context).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Section 46 applies only to murder and manslaughter charges and specifically prohibits a judge from \u201c distribu\u00ed[ing] the accused\u2019s share of the decedent\u2019s assets until a verdict or finding on the charge has been rendered in open court.\u201d If a defendant is convicted of murder or manslaughter, he is considered to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of disposing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>estate; thus, he is excluded from it. <em>Id. </em>However, if a defendant is acquitted of such a charge, he may take from the estate by distribution or descent, as allowed by law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The defendant is charged with the murder of his wife, mother-in-law, and children. Consequently, \u00a7 46 applies. As such, a judge may not allow the defendant access to any assets in the victims\u2019 estates (including assets that were held between the defendant and the deceased in \u201cjoint tenancy or by tenancy in the entirety\u201d) unless and until he is found not guilty. The factual record before the court indicates that some of the assets considered in the defendant\u2019s indigency determination likely come within the statute\u2019s constraints, including the joint bank account, the college fund, and the vehicles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, outside a brief comment by defense counsel at the hearing that there \u201cmay be proceedings in the probate court\u201d resulting in the defendant\u2019s forfeiture of rights to the college fund, there is no indication that the parties directed the judge to \u00a7 46 or that the judge considered its application to the issue before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Typically, this court does not \u201csubstitute [its] judgment for that of the trial judge on the factual issue whether the defendant [is] able to pay for counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delorey, </em>369 Mass. 323, 330 (1975). However, in this case it appears factual findings were not made regarding the availability of the assets in light of the principles embodied in \u00a7 46. Consequently, it is necessary that the case be remanded for a determination whether any of the defendant\u2019s identified assets were part of the decedents\u2019 estates or held jointly with the decedents and, if so, for an appropriate recalculation of the defendant\u2019s ability to contribute to his defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">2. <em>Individual retirement account. </em>The definition of \u201c[available [f]unds\u201d in S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (b) (i), includes both \u201cdispos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>able net monthly income\u201d and \u201cliquid assets.\u201d The defendant argues his IRA should be excluded from his indigency calculation because the funds do not fall within either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">First, relying on the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Rousey </em>v. <em>Jacoway, </em>544 U.S. 320, 331 (2005) <em>(Rousey), </em>the defendant asserts the IRA funds cannot be disposable net monthly income because they are properly categorized not as present income, but as \u201cdeferred income.\u201d <em>Rousey, </em>however, rested on the specific terms of a provision in the United States Bankruptcy Code that exempts from bankruptcy proceedings \u201cpayment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) (2006). <em>Rousey, supra </em>at 329. The Court concluded that IRAs are similar to those enumerated items and, because there is often a substantial penalty for early withdrawal from an IRA intended to deter early access, further found that IRAs are properly classified as plans that provide \u201ca right to receive payment on account of age.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-332. Thus, the Court held that IRAs are exempt from bankruptcy proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">There is no comparable language in S.J.C. Rule 3:10 suggesting that age-dependent accounts should be excluded or exempted from the available funds calculation. Thus, the <em>Rousey </em>categor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ization of an IRA for bankruptcy purposes is not instructive as to whether it should be considered income under S.J.C. Rule 3:10. However, S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (e) specifically includes money received from pensions, annuities, and Social Security in the definition of income. Because this indicates that these accounts are not considered income until payments are disbursed, we agree that the defendant\u2019s IRA is not properly categorized as income.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Next, the defendant asserts that the funds in his IRA should not be included in the indigency evaluation because they are not liquid assets within the meaning of S.J.C. Rule 3:10. To make this argument, the defendant attempts to redefine the term \u201cavailable funds,\u201d of which liquid assets and net monthly income are subsets, to mean funds \u201cpresent or ready for <em>immediate </em>use.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 150 (1995) (definition of \u201cavailable\u201d). He then applies the <em>Rousey </em>characterization that IRAs are \u201cdeferred income\u201d to assert that such retirement accounts are not sufficiently similar to \u201c[c]ash, savings accounts, bank accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposits, equity in real estate, [or] equity in a motor vehicle or in other tangible property\u201d to qualify as liquid assets. S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (h). As a deferred income account, immediately accessible only after paying a substantial penalty, the defendant argues that the IRA cannot satisfy the availability requirement for liquid assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The defendant\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cavailable,\u201d however, does not properly describe the list of liquid assets that qualify as available funds in S.J.C. Rule 3:10. \u201cWhen elements are listed in a series, the rules of statutory construction require the general phrase to be construed as restricted to elements similar to the specific elements listed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 31 (2010). Significantly, liquid assets under the rule are not limited to cash, savings accounts, or banks accounts, but also include certificates of deposit and equity in real estate. S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (h). These assets are similar to IRAs in that they are not immediately available in the same sense as cash or funds in a bank account, nor are they accessible without incurring costs or penalties. Equity in real estate often cannot be obtained without selling or mortgaging the property, both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>which can be complicated, costly, and time-consuming endeavors. Similarly, certificates of deposit often require payment of penalties for withdrawing funds before a deposit matures. Cf. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-4313 (2006) (under Truth in Savings Act, banks and depository institutions must disclose amount of penalty on time accounts that \u201cwill or may be imposed for early withdrawal, how it is calculated, and the conditions for its assessment\u201d); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.4(b)(6)(ii) (2012). Thus, S.J.C. Rule 3:10 does not contemplate an immediacy requirement in establishing whether an asset is available, and an IRA\u2019s early withdrawal penalty does not distinguish that asset from the rule\u2019s enumerated elements. See S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (h) (including equity in real or personal property as \u201c[ljiquid [ajssets,\u201d provided that such equity \u201cis reasonably convertible to cash\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Granted, IRAs are different from traditional bank accounts, <em>Rousey, supra </em>at 332, in that they are afforded favorable tax treatment, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, and substantial penalties are imposed for early withdrawals. In addition, certain types of IRAs receive additional protections under Federal law, such as the employment retirement income security act, and are exempt from attachment or alienation. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056 (2006); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-2(d) (2011). All of these characteristics are consistent with a Federal policy intended to encourage retirement savings. See, e.g., <em>In re </em>Atallah, 95 B.R. 910, 919 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1989), abrogated on other grounds, <em>In re Kaplan, </em>162 B.R. 684, 691 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">This policy, however, is not absolute and does not insulate IRAs from their inclusion in a variety of other asset-based calculations used to determine eligibility for publicly funded benefits. For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA) bases eligibility for supplemental security income on income and resources. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381a, 1382 (2006). Liquid assets, which are included within the definition of resources, include stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, savings and checking accounts, certificates of deposits, and \u201csimilar items.\u201d 20 C.F.R \u00a7 416.1201(b) (2011). \u201cSimilar items,\u201d in turn, include retirement funds such as IRAs where the account holder has the option to withdraw funds, even if ineligible for periodic payments. See SSA Program Operation Manual System \u00a7 01120.210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>(2009). See also <em>Blaylock </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>531 F. Supp. 24, 25-26 (W.D. Mo. 1981) (finding agency interpretation that retirement funds are \u201csimilar [items]\u201d in resource determination reasonable). Similarly, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance considers retirement accounts \u2014 and IRAs specifically \u2014 as \u201c[c]ountable [a]ssets\u201d in determining an individual\u2019s financial eligibility to receive Emergency Aid to the Elderly, Disabled and Children benefits. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 321.120(C) (1994).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Further, the Federal policy of protecting retirement savings must be balanced against the fundamental constitutional right to be represented by counsel in a criminal prosecution and the concomitant public obligation to provide counsel for those who truly cannot afford to be represented in such proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Means, </em>454 Mass. 81, 88 &amp; n.13 (2009). Although the Massachusetts Legislature established the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) in order to provide representation for defendants unable to obtain counsel by reason of their indigency, the public funds supporting CPCS are not unlimited. Recognizing the importance of appointed representation, it is critical to conserve the limited resources for those defendants who are truly indigent and unable to fund their legal representation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>439 F.3d 81, 109 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 985 (2006) (noting limited resources for appointed defense counsel and need to avoid requiring public funding of representation for \u201cfinancially ineligible defendants\u201d). Defendants with substantial savings in IRAs, accessible after forfeiting an early withdrawal penalty, can reasonably be considered to have funds available for their defense and should be made to exhaust those accounts before the Commonwealth expends its limited resources on their representation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 605, 611 (2004) (defendants must credibly establish their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>indigency \u201c[b]efore the limited funds of the Commonwealth are expended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that a judge applying SJ.C. Rule 3:10 may properly consider funds held in IRAs to be available funds in the indigency determination, at least absent evidence demonstrating that a Federal statute or federally regulated retirement plan structure makes such funds in a particular case completely unavailable to a defendant as a matter of law, a burden the defendant has not met here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Although we conclude, as did the judge, that some amount of the funds in the IRA will be available for the defendant\u2019s defense, the amount will likely be less than the full account balance due to preretirement withdrawal penalties and tax burdens. See United States vs. Pani, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 08-40034-FDS (D. Mass. Aug. 3, 2011) (\u201cThe [c]ourt recognizes that if [the defendant] seeks to withdraw [IRA] funds to pay counsel, his withdrawals will be subject both to ordinary tax and an early withdrawal penalty of ten percent\u201d). Because the penalty and tax burdens will vary depending on the type of retirement account and a defendant\u2019s particular circumstances, the defendant has the burden to establish the net remaining funds actually available from his IRA. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 72(q) (2006) (ten per cent penalty for premature distributions from annuity contracts); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 72(t)(6) (2006) (twenty-five per cent additional tax on early distributions from simple retirement account within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408[p] [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Here, although the judge properly considered the IRA as containing available funds within the meaning of SJ.C. Rule 3:10, she did not make any findings regarding the amount of funds ultimately available to support the defense when accounting for penalties and taxes. On remand the defendant may present evidence on this point. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Porter, <em>ante </em>724, 732-733 (2012) (defendant has burden to establish indigency by preponderance of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>The order directing the defendant to pay $40,000 toward his defense is vacated and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings and findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The judge also raised questions regarding the appropriateness of appointing counsel for the indigency determination proceeding and requiring a time frame within which the defendant must make his contributions.

Rule 3:10, as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993). The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the rule is that some existing stream of disposable income is necessary to satisfy either prong of the \u201c[i]ndigent but [a]ble to [c]ontribute\u201d definition. This is incorrect. A party may be deemed indigent but able to contribute either by having an annual income within a certain range or by having available funds insufficient to cover the anticipated legal costs. S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 1 (g) (ii). Available funds include both net monthly income and liquid assets. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1 (b) (i). Having no disposable net monthly income does not mean a party has no available funds. Rather, the \u201cdisposable net monthly income\u201d portion of the equation is set to zero for a party without income, and available funds are defined by the party\u2019s liquid assets alone. Because the judge determined the defendant has available funds in the form of, inter alia, his bank accounts and individual retirement account (IRA), he is properly considered indigent but able to contribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">On appeal, the intervener filed with the court motor vehicle registration records that suggest that the vehicles were owned by the defendant\u2019s deceased wife. It is unclear, however, whether and how the vehicles factored into the judge\u2019s indigency calculation. The judge\u2019s order indicates that she assessed the defendant\u2019s ability to contribute based on his bank accounts, IRA funds, and the college fund. The intervener contends the judge also considered the vehicles in her indigency evaluation. Regardless, if on remand the vehicles should be found either to be the property of the defendant\u2019s wife or to be joint assets, they cannot be considered available to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Orders regarding assets or income \u201cmay be modified by the court upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>showing by either the defense or the prosecution of changed circumstances.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass. R. Grim. P. 33, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1680 (LexisNexis 2011-2012). See S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 7. A judge may, in the interest of justice, appoint counsel for a defendant unable to gain access to funds due to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 46, and require the party to reimburse the Commonwealth for the costs of representation if he is later acquitted. See <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>417 U.S. 40 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salim, </em>399 Mass. 227, 238-239 (1987) (deeming \u201csound public policy\u201d judge\u2019s decision that recognized \u201cdefendant should bear the burden of his reasonable counsel fees if he became able to do so\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In <em>Rousey </em>v. <em>Jacoway, </em>544 U.S. 320, 334 (2005) <em>(Rousey), </em>the United States Supreme Court also noted that the exemption provision to the United States Bankruptcy Code contains an exception that specifically lists plans that do not qualify under several sections of the Internal Revenue Code, including 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408 (2006) (governing IRAs). This strengthened the Court\u2019s conclusion that Congress intended IRAs to be exempt from bankruptcy proceedings because it would not make sense to exclude from the exemption plans failing to qualify under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, unless qualifying plans were within the exemption. <em>Rousey, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The regulation provides: \u201cAssets that shall be considered in determining financial eligibility include but are not limited to: . . . <em>Retirement Accounts and Pensions. </em>Retirement or pension funds shall be counted in the determination of eligibility if the funds in the plan(s) are accessible to the applicant or recipient. . . .
