During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>search of the defendant, who was lying face down on a sidewalk and whose arms were handcuffed behind his back, the defendant\u2019s buttocks were exposed to public view. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge entered a memorandum of decision and order in which he ordered that the drugs be suppressed because, in the course of the search incident to his arrest, the defendant was subjected to a \u201cstrip search\u201d that was unreasonably conducted in violation of both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the judge\u2019s order in the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). We transferred the appeal here on our own motion. Because we conclude that the search of the defendant that took place when the police retrieved drugs from between his buttocks constituted an unreasonable strip search on account of the location of the search and the manner in which it was conducted, we affirm the suppression order.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). \u201c[Ojur duty is to make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bostock, </em>450 Mass. 616, 619 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact, supplemented by uncontested testimony adduced at the evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>443 Mass. 824, 828 (2005). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah I., </em>448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007) (we \u201csupplement a judge\u2019s finding of facts if the evidence is uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness\u2019s testimony\u201d). In early November, 2009, Detective Daniel Desmarais, a trained narcotics officer with the special investigations unit of the Lowell police department, was in regular contact with a confidential informant (CI) whom he described as having been reliable in the past. The CI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>informed him that the defendant, a Hispanic male known to the Cl as \u201cCarlos,\u201d whom he described in height, weight, and hair style, and who lived at 189 Walker Street in Lowell, was selling \u201cstreet-level amounts of heroin\u201d out of a tan Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. The Cl indicated that \u201cover the last month\u201d he had purchased heroin from the defendant about \u201cfive times a week\u201d and that the defendant obtained his drugs from someone who resided at 22 Fetherston Avenue in Lowell. The Cl, in the presence of Detective Desmarais, once attempted by cellular telephone to arrange a controlled purchase from the defendant, who informed him that he (the defendant) did not have any drugs to sell at that time, but would have some later that evening (the controlled purchase did not materialize).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">At various times during early November, Detective Desma-rais observed the tan Explorer parked in the common parking lot of the apartment building at 189 Walker Street, and on one occasion saw the defendant enter the vehicle and leave. Detective Desmarais checked the registration plate of the Explorer and learned that it was registered to an individual (not the defendant) who resided at 189 Walker Street. Additionally, Detective Desmarais confirmed that the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license indicated 189 Walker Street as his residential address.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">At about 1:20 p.m., on November 12, 2009, Detective Desma-rais, who was in plain clothes and driving an unmarked vehicle, saw the defendant drive by in the Explorer. He followed the defendant and then passed surveillance off to a Detective Lavoie, who simultaneously was conducting a drug investigation connected to the Fetherston Avenue location. Detective Lavoie reported to Detective Desmarais that the defendant had pulled into the driveway at 22 Fetherston Avenue and appeared to make a cellular telephone call while inside the vehicle. Minutes later a woman came out of the residence and went over to the Explorer. After a brief conversation, the two went inside. About four to six minutes later, the defendant emerged from the residence and departed in the Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Detective Desmarais followed the defendant back to 189 Walker Street. Another police cruiser, driven by Lieutenant James Hodgdon, pulled into the lot. As the officers got out of their vehicles, the defendant looked at them and then drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>away. With Detective Desmarais following, the defendant ignored a stop sign, traveled at a high rate of speed, and detoured through a parking lot to circumvent traffic. Although Detective Desmarais attempted to keep pace, he lost sight of the defendant and radioed for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Officer Stephen Beland, who was patrolling nearby in a marked police cruiser, heard the dispatch with a description of the Explorer. He spotted the Explorer, activated his blue lights, and pulled the vehicle over in the vicinity of 189 Walker Street. As he did so, he observed that the defendant was leaning to his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">As Officer Beland got out of his cruiser, he saw the defendant reach down toward the center console. The defendant was leaning to the right, placing his hands behind and underneath his torso, and sitting up and down, and seemed to be concealing something behind the right side of his torso.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Officer Beland approached the Explorer with his firearm drawn and ordered the defendant to show his hands. The defendant did not comply and kept his hands tucked underneath and behind him. Officer Beland ordered the defendant to place his hands on the steering wheel. Meanwhile, Detective Desmarais had arrived, and also directed the defendant to show his hands. Eventually the defendant complied and the officers ordered him to get out of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Detective Desmarais led the defendant toward the rear of the vehicle. Officer Beland indicated that the defendant may have been hiding something in the vehicle and proceeded to search the area of the vehicle over which the defendant had had immediate control. He informed Detective Desmarais that he did not find any contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">During the subsequent pat-down of the defendant, who was wearing shorts, the defendant moved away and clenched his buttocks when Detective Desmarais reached the area of the rear waistband of his shorts. This observation, coupled with the information shared by Officer Beland, raised the suspicion that the defendant was concealing drugs. Proceeding with the pat-down, Detective Desmarais did an exterior sweep outside of the defendant\u2019s shorts and felt a lump between his buttocks that did not appear to be a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Detective Desmarais walked the defendant to a more secluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>area by a house and, after compelling the defendant to spread his legs apart, pulled back the waistband to the defendant\u2019s shorts and observed a clear plastic bag containing a tan powder protruding from between his buttocks. Detective Desmarais told Lieutenant Hodgdon, who had arrived, \u201cHe\u2019s hiding it in his ass.\u201d Suddenly, the defendant tried to run away, striking Detective Desmarais with his elbow during his attempt to do so. A struggle ensued between the defendant and Detective Desmarais. The defendant clenched his fist and turned toward Detective Desma-rais, who was telling the defendant that he was being placed under arrest. Detective Desmarais punched the defendant on the left side of his jaw in order to \u201ccreate space.\u201d Both men fell to the ground, with the defendant\u2019s face striking the sidewalk. The defendant continued to try to escape, but, with the assistance of Officer Beland and two other officers, Detective Desmarais was able to handcuff the defendant\u2019s arms behind his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">While in handcuffs and lying face down on the sidewalk, the defendant tried to reach down into his shorts. In response, Detective Desmarais grabbed the defendant\u2019s hand and removed it. He then pulled back the waistband to the defendant\u2019s shorts, exposing his buttocks to public view in so doing, and retrieved the bag from between the defendant\u2019s buttocks. After the drugs were seized, the defendant\u2019s father approached the scene and observed his son lying face down on the sidewalk with his buttocks exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The defendant was indicted on charges of possession of a class A controlled substance (heroin) with intent to distribute, as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32 <em>(a) </em>and (6); being a habitual offender, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25; assault and battery on a police officer (Detective Desmarais), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D; and resisting arrest, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B. He moved to suppress the drugs seized from him, claiming, as relevant here, that the drugs were obtained as the result of an unlawful search in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, arts. 12 and 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, the judge agreed and allowed the motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>judge concluded that Detective Desmarais\u2019s separate actions of lifting back the defendant\u2019s waistband visually to inspect the defendant\u2019s buttocks area and later to retrieve the drugs amounted to strip searches that he concluded were unreasonably conducted.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We assume, without deciding, that the officers had probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of drugs and that they therefore were justified, as a matter of constitutional and statutory law, in conducting a search of the defendant\u2019s person for concealed drugs incident to that arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prophete, </em>443 Mass. 548, 552 (2005), and cases cited (once custodial arrest occurs no further justification needed for search of person to discover evidence of crime for which person was arrested). Searches incident to an arrest, however, \u201cmay be unconstitutional notwithstanding the lawful arrest, because they involve inspections of such a highly personal nature, or are conducted in such a manner, as to constitute an unreasonable intrusion on an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. A search of a defendant \u201clawfully could progressively extend into a strip (or a visual body cavity) search only if such a search was justified by probable cause to believe that the defendant had concealed [drugs] on his person or his clothing that would not otherwise be discovered by the usual search incident to arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Thomas, 429 Mass. 403, 408 (1999) (concluding that probable cause is appropriate standard to apply to strip and visual body cavity searches). This is so because \u201cstrip or visual body cavity searches, by their very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>nature, are humiliating, demeaning, and terrifying experiences that, without question, constitute a substantial intrusion on one\u2019s personal privacy rights protected under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prophete, supra </em>at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s conclusion that Detective Des-marais had \u201csufficient probable cause to believe that the defendant was concealing drugs in his buttocks to justify a strip or visual body cavity search,\u201d the Commonwealth argues that Detective Desmarais\u2019s separate actions of lifting back the defendant\u2019s waistband visually to inspect the defendant\u2019s buttocks and later to retrieve the drugs, contrary to the judge\u2019s determinations, did not amount to strip searches. We have noted that \u201c[a] visual body cavity search extends to a visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 407 n.4, citing <em>Cookish </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>945 F.2d 441, 444-445 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prophete, supra </em>at 557, we adopted a definition of the term \u201cstrip search\u201d to mean a search \u201cin which a detainee is commanded to remove the last layer of his or her clothing.\u201d We concluded in that case that a strip search had not occurred because, although the defendant had been ordered to remove his shirt, shoes, socks, and pants, he was never instructed or required to remove his underwear, which constituted the last layer of his clothing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 555 &amp; n.10, 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Recently, the United States Supreme Court confronted the question \u201cwhether the Fourth Amendment requires correctional officials to exempt some detainees [who have committed minor offenses] who will be admitted to a jail\u2019s general population\u201d from \u201ca close visual inspection while undressed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Florence </em>v. <em>Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, </em>132 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>1510, 1513, 1515 (2012). The Court concluded that such exemptions were not required by the Fourth Amendment and that the search procedures at issue \u201cstruck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1523. In so doing the Court pointed out that the term \u201cstrip search\u201d is \u201cimprecise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1515. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201c[A strip search] may refer simply to the instruction to remove clothing while an officer observes from a distance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual inspection from a closer, more uncomfortable distance; it may include directing detainees to shake their heads or to run their hands through their hair to dislodge what might be hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise arms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the ears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to cough in a squatting position. . . . [T]he term does not [necessarily] include any touching of unclothed area by the inspecting officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Insofar as relevant here, Detective Desmarais\u2019s action of lifting back the defendant\u2019s waistband to retrieve the drugs from between his buttocks and publicly exposing the defendant\u2019s buttocks while so doing, constituted a strip search under both our State Constitution and the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The action involved unconsented-to police observation of the defendant\u2019s intimate, private area and also involved the public exposure of the defendant\u2019s intimate, private area, all of which amounted to a significant intrusion of the defendant\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The Commonwealth argues that our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>v. <em>Prophete, supra </em>at 557, requires that a person be completely unclothed to permit visual inspection of the naked person in order for a strip search to occur, which was not the case here when Detective Desmarais removed the drugs from the defendant\u2019s buttock area. This purported mandate, however, has not been imposed by us; rather, what we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prophete, supra, </em>is that the last layer of clothing of a detainee be removed. The requirement must be viewed in the context of that case, namely, the defendant remained in his underwear after having removed other garments; his intimate, private areas were not unclothed and exposed. In the circumstances it was not necessary for us to state the scope of all strip searches, including the notion that the actual removal of all clothing from a person is not the only manner of accomplishing a strip search. A strip search also may occur when a detainee remains partially clothed, but in circumstances during which a last layer of clothing is moved (and not necessarily removed) in such a manner whereby an intimate area of the detainee is viewed, exposed, or displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We next examine the manner in which this search of the defendant was conducted. For a visual body cavity search and a strip search to be constitutional under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, such searches also must be reasonably conducted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 407, citing <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). \u201cThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, . . . and the place in which it is conducted.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, supra. </em>Courts assessing the reasonableness of similar searches have considered a number of factors. Concerning the place where such a search is conducted, courts have indicated that, in order to preserve a detainee\u2019s privacy, a private room is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>preferable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 409 n.5; <em>United. States </em>v. <em>Hambrick, </em>630 F.3d 742, 748 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2919 (2011). In addition, we have cautioned that, in the absence of exigent circumstances, \u201cthe searches should always be done where no one, other than the investigating officer or officers, can see the person being searched.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra. </em>See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>770 F.2d 739, 742 (8th Cir. 1985) (police should \u201ctake precautions to insure that the detainee\u2019s privacy is protected from exposure to others unconnected to the search\u201d). How a search is conducted is of the utmost importance, with the least amount of intrusion constituting the better practice. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>659 F.3d 142, 147 (1st Cir. 2011). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hambrick, supra </em>(officers did not touch defendant, but rather allowed him to remove drugs \u201con his own\u201d). Whether a person of the same gender conducts the search should be given consideration. See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State, </em>239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001). At all times the potential harm to a detainee\u2019s health and dignity should be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the intrusion. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Roche, supra. </em>While each case will warrant decision on its own unique facts as well as the existence of any exigent circumstances, which are not to be disregarded, we conclude that the above-stated factors should be considered in determining the reasonableness of a visual body cavity or strip search not only under the Federal Constitution, but also under our State Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Here, with regard to the strip search, at the time when Detective Desmarais removed the drugs from between the defendant\u2019s buttocks area, the police did not, as we suggested in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 409 n.5, conduct the search in a private room or in any private location. The handcuffed defendant was face down on a public sidewalk and surrounded by four police officers. Detective Desmarais had determined that the lump in the rear of the defendant\u2019s shorts was not a weapon. Thus, there was no concern that the defendant could have used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>a weapon against the officers, fled, or destroyed evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With no exigency existing, the defendant should have been transported to a private space or location. Doing so would have avoided what followed, namely, the public exposure of his buttocks, an embarrassing and humiliating intrusion of the defendant\u2019s privacy. Indeed, the policy of the Lowell police department prohibits strip searches outside the confines of a police station. In the circumstances, the location of this search was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The manner in which the search proceeded, whereby the defendant\u2019s buttocks were publicly exposed in the absence of exigent circumstances, was unreasonable. See <em>Paulino </em>v. <em>State, </em>399 Md. 341, 359 (2007) (instead of reaching into defendant\u2019s underwear to retrieve contraband, officer lifted up defendant\u2019s underwear and publicly exposed his buttocks, which rendered search unreasonable). There was no explanation in the record why Detective Desmur\u00e1is was able to inspect the defendant\u2019s buttocks area for drugs without public exposure, but was unable to retrieve the drugs without the resulting exposure. If Detective Desmur\u00e1is could not have retrieved the drugs without exposing the defendant\u2019s buttocks, he should not have conducted the search on a public sidewalk. Both the inappropriate location of the search and the manner in which it was conducted rendered the strip search constitutionally unreasonable under both the Federal and State Constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the order allowing the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cA search conducted incident to an arrest may be made <em>only </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>purposes of seizing fruits, instrumentalities, contraband and other evidence of the crime for which the arrest has been made, in order to prevent its destruction or concealment; and removing any weapons that the arrestee might use to resist arrest or effect his escape.

I write separately to address briefly the issue of the initial action of Detective Desmur\u00e1is in pulling back the waistband on the defendant\u2019s shorts to ascertain whether what the defendant had shoved down the back of his pants as the police approached his stopped automobile was contraband, thereby justifying his arrest. Whatever the object was, it had been detected as a \u201clump\u201d during the pat frisk of the defendant, and warranted (if not required) some further on-scene investigation. In pursuing that investigation, the detective moved the defendant away from public view, to a secluded area, and merely pulled back his waistband, enabling the detective to see what then appeared to be a clear plastic bag containing a tan powder protruding from between the defendant\u2019s buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In my view, however a court might label this intrusion into the defendant\u2019s privacy, it was perfectly reasonable in scope and manner and did not result in either the public disclosure of the defendant\u2019s buttocks or undue embarrassment or humiliation. Consequently, it was proper police conduct in the circumstances, and I would so hold.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
