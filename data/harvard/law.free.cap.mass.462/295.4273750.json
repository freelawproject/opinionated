Prunty, was convicted by a Superior Court jury of murder in the first degree on a theory of deliberate premeditation. The defendant was convicted also of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and attempted extortion. The convictions arose from an altercation at the defendant\u2019s home on August 7, 2004, during which the defendant fatally shot the victim, Jason Wells. On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred both in rejecting his exercise of a peremptory challenge of a member of the venire during jury empanelment and in improperly providing a limiting instruction as to the use of prior inconsistent statements elicited on cross-examination of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s key witnesses. We conclude that there is no merit in the defendant\u2019s first claim of error. As to the second claimed error, even if it were to be assumed, without deciding, that the limiting instruction should not have been given, this did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We thus affirm the convictions, and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or reduce the murder verdict to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence admitted at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. On the evening of August 6, 2004, the defendant held a party at his home in Sandwich where several individuals, including Jason Wells, the victim, were using cocaine. After the party, the defendant noticed that money, watches, and jewelry were missing. He suspected Wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The next day, the defendant, Wells, and Richard Ford used cocaine at the defendant\u2019s home. At some point, the defendant confronted Wells about the missing items, and an argument ensued. Wells in turn accused Rebecca Pape, a friend of Wells who had also been at the defendant\u2019s home the night before. The defendant then telephoned Pape, telling her that he knew that she had taken his \u201cstuff\u201d and he wanted it back. Pape, with Christopher Rose and two other individuals, drove to the defendant\u2019s home, where the argument between the defendant and Wells was ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>When Wells went into the dining room and sat down, the defendant proceeded upstairs, retrieved his Ruger .22 caliber rifle, and returned to where Wells was sitting. The defendant pointed the rifle at Wells\u2019s head and cocked it, telling him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get my stuff by sunrise, you\u2019ll never see another sunrise again.\u201d Rose intervened, pushing the rifle away and consoling Wells, who had started to cry. Wells admitted his role in taking the defendant\u2019s property and went into the kitchen to make telephone calls to retrieve the stolen items. When Wells could not reach anyone, the defendant again pointed the gun at his head. This time, the defendant fired into Wells\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Pape, having witnessed the shooting, began \u201cpanicking.\u201d The defendant told her what their story would be: Wells had shot himself while Pape and the defendant had been in the bathroom. The defendant called the Sandwich police to report an accidental shooting. When officers responded, the defendant told them that someone had \u201cshot himself,\u201d and led them into the kitchen where Wells was lying on the floor with a gunshot wound to the forehead. The officers detected a pulse and attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate Wells; he was pronounced dead on arrival at a Boston area hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Police questioned the defendant at the scene; he denied shooting Wells, saying that he had been talking with Pape in the hallway when the shot was fired. He admitted, however, that he had used the rifle to threaten Wells into giving his property back. He was arrested for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. On August 31, 2004, the grand jury returned the three indictments. He was tried in February, 2006, and found guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">b. <em>The defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge. </em>When trial commenced on February 7, 2006, both the defendant and the Commonwealth were aware that the issue of race was likely to arise, at least tangentially, at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During an interview with the police, the defendant had said, \u201cThis nigger came up from Hy-annis and ripped me off.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the defendant denied making this statement, the Commonwealth planned to introduce it at trial. As a result, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>individual voir dire of each member of the venire concerning racial prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 398 (1987), overruled in part on another ground, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>407 Mass. 553, 555 (1990) (in murder cases where defendant and victim are of different races, judge must conduct such voir dire on defendant\u2019s request).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The judge decided to empanel sixteen jurors; thus, each side was entitled to sixteen peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge began the empanelment process by introducing the parties, describing the nature of the charges, and naming potential witnesses. The prospective jurors, as a group, were asked the general questions prescribed by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 20 (b) (1), 378 Mass. 889 (1979). Many responded in the affirmative, and the judge proceeded to an individual voir dire of each member of the venire. At the conclusion of each individual voir dire, both the prosecutor and the defendant were required to exercise any desired peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the course of this process, eleven jurors were excused for cause, the defendant exercised fourteen peremptory challenges, and the Commonwealth exercised ten peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Prior to the challenged empanelment of Juror no. 16, the judge had seated fifteen jurors. Juror no. 16, the first African-American member of the venire to be individually questioned,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>was asked the same question as had been asked, in nearly identical form, of each prospective juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cIn this matter, sir, the [defendant is white; the deceased was black; the witnesses may be of different races or ethnic heritage. Does this information about race and ethnic heritage affect your ability to be fair and impartial as a juror?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Like every juror seated to that point, Juror no. 16 responded \u201cno\u201d to this question. After the judge declared Juror no. 16 indifferent, the defendant exercised a peremptory challenge, but the Commonwealth objected. The prosecutor stated, \u201che\u2019s the only African-American potential juror that we\u2019ve had in this panel, and on that basis, I\u2019m objecting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In response, the judge ruled that the Commonwealth had \u201cmet the requirements of a prima facie showing of impropriety\u201d on the basis that he could recall no other prospective juror with a similar physical appearance and, having reviewed the juror\u2019s questionnaire, concluded that \u201cthere is no reason for challenge that is immediately apparent.\u201d The judge then asked the challenging party, the defendant, whether there was a \u201cclear and reasonably specific explanation\u201d for exercising the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Defense counsel then provided the following rationale for the challenge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201c[T]his gentleman is a-\u2014 is a school teacher with young children. Some of the people who are going to testify in this case were a relatively young age. They were in their early 20\u2019s. They were associated with drugs. They \u2014 it appears that one of them at least and perhaps a couple of them, actually three of them \u2014 I think the victim, Mr. Rose and Miss Pape had somewhat of a troubled history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that\u2019s reflected during their course of telephone conversations that were recorded. That history affects how far they went in school and what they did in school. I\u2019m informed that some of the towns down at the Cape \u2014 I don\u2019t know in particular Barnstable public schools, but certainly I\u2019m told the Sandwich public schools, Hyannis public schools have unfortunately been impacted rather heavily \u2014 most recently the Sandwich public schools by alcohol and drug abuse. I feel like this particular type of juror would not be able to sit impartially on a case like this. As a result of his occupation, I also bring to the [cjourt\u2019s attention that he doesn\u2019t bring a lot of diverse experience with him in terms of who his spouse is. It appears she is an administrator, also with the Barnstable public schools. I interpret that to be perhaps a principal or a vice-principal. Typically they promote or advance to that position from a teaching position. So, they have a very, very similar background in that regard. And I feel that he would not sit fairly in judgment of my client on a case like this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In response, the judge pointed out that two seated jurors were retired teachers, and three other jurors had minor children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In view of the circumstances, the judge found \u201cthat the proffered reason for a challenge is not bona fide, but rather is a mere sham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Defense counsel then offered a second reason for the challenge. He argued that certain evidence at trial would establish that the defendant \u201cis a racist,\u201d as demonstrated by his use of the word \u201cnigger\u201d on multiple occasions and his references to African-Americans as \u201cmoon pies\u201d and \u201cporch monkey[s].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to defense counsel, \u201ccomments like that certainly are going to perhaps get under the skin of somebody who might be a little bit more sensitive to that issue, particularly where that is their descent.\u201d The judge decided to bring Juror no. 16 back for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>additional voir dire on this issue. The following exchange between the judge and Juror no. 16 ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">The judge: \u201cIf someone in the course of the evidence is accused of making racist statements, would that in any way cloud your ability to sort out issues of credibility? Who is telling the truth, who isn\u2019t? And then acting on the evidence as you find it to be?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">Juror No. 16: \u201cWow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">The judge: \u201cYeah, wow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Juror No. 16: \u201cI mean, as a teacher, I\u2019ve been able to, you know, separate things anyway. So I think I would be able to do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Unsatisfied with the judge\u2019s question, defense counsel stated, after the juror had been dismissed from the court room, that \u201cI would much rather have the [cjourt ... let the prospective juror know that these remarks are going to be attributed to my client rather than other witnesses.\u201d The judge determined there was no need for additional voir dire, stating, \u201c[Y]ou saw the gentleman\u2019s reaction, just as I did now. And I must say, I \u2014 from my own eyes, I can\u2019t imagine a more straightforward, honest response from a man.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge ordered the juror returned to the court room for additional questioning, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">The judge: \u201cWhen you came in a few moments ago, I spoke about how there may be some testimony from witnesses that could be taken as racist comments. I want to be more direct in this regard. In this case, there will be comments attributed to the [djefendant by other witnesses that he says things to the effect that, \u2018That nigger was going to die anyway\u2019 or \u2014 the exact language, gentlemen?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cI think one of the comments attributed is that, \u2018The nigger shot himself.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">The judge: \u201c \u2018That the nigger shot himself.\u2019 There may also be comments attributed to the [djefendant referencing black people as \u2018porch monkeys\u2019 or \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Defense counsel: \u201cI believe the expression that will be used is moon pies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">The judge: \u201cMoon pie. Now, to these various comments, the [defendant has disavowed them, has denied them. But still, that type of evidence is apt to come in. And I want to be as sensitive as I can to your concerns and to everyone\u2019s concern for a fair trial. Would you be able to set aside the shock value, if you will, or the shock [ejffect of such racist statements \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Juror No. 16: \u201cUh huh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">The judge: \u201c\u2014 and proceed to judge this case strictly on its merits and the credibility of the evidence as you determine it to be?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Juror No. 16: \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been called quite a few of those in my lifetime anyway. So \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">The judge: \u201cAnd can you go forward and be a fair and impartial juror under the circumstances that I have outlined?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">Juror No. 16: \u201cI would be able to do my best on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">On the basis of these responses, the judge issued his final ruling: \u201cThe [cjourt finds there to be no cause for challenge of this juror. The [cjourt finds this juror to be fair and impartial. The [cjourt finds that the challenge is mere sham. For all of those reasons, the gentleman will be seated as Juror 16.\u201d Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, Juror No. 16 was seated and sworn. Juror No. 16 was later selected as one of the twelve jurors to deliberate on the verdict and was made the foreperson of the jury prior to deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">c. <em>Admission of prior inconsistent statements and judge\u2019s limiting instruction. </em>The defense, arguing that Wells had either shot himself or been shot by Christopher Rose, hinged largely on prior inconsistent statements of the individuals who were at the house at the time of the shooting. In this regard, Pape, as one of only two individuals who testified that she had actually seen the defendant shoot Wells, was the Commonwealth\u2019s primary witness. During cross-examination, defense counsel called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the jury\u2019s attention to certain inconsistent statements Pape had made concerning the shooting during her grand jury testimony on August 31, 2004:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd on that day, right, we\u2019re only twenty-four days after the murder, you again say, \u2018He came into the bathroom a few times. And I recall at one point hearing a gunshot.\u2019 \u2018Where were you when that gunshot was fired?\u2019 T was in the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018Where was [the defendant], if you know?\u2019 T recall [the defendant] being in the bathroom with me when that gun was fired.\u2019 Do you recall testifying to that before a [g]rand [j]ury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Pape testified at trial that her statements before the grand jury had been perjury. In addition to Pape\u2019s grand jury testimony, the jury heard about a number of her other prior inconsistent statements, all to the same effect, during cross-examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each of these statements was admitted without objection from the Commonwealth and without a request that their purpose be limited solely to the jury\u2019s assessment of Pape\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In his final instructions to the jury, however, the judge limited the jury\u2019s use of any prior inconsistent statements as going only to a witness\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is you cannot substitute that prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>inconsistent statement for the truth of what the witness has said on the stand, unless, of course, the witness adopts the prior inconsistent statement as their present testimony. The inconsistent statement in the past is used only to judge credibility of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">This instruction was given without objection from either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Peremptory challenge of Juror No. 16. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in refusing to allow his exercise of a peremptory challenge of Juror No. 16.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that, in all respects, the empanelment of Juror No. 16 was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">(i) <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe grant deference to a judge\u2019s ruling on whether a permissible ground for the peremptory challenge has been shown and will not disturb it so long as it is supported by the record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 Mass. 804, 811 (2000). We will not conclude that a judge has abused this considerable discretion \u201cunless juror prejudice is manifest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 443 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">(ii) <em>Analysis. </em>Both art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution afford a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an impartial jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 802 (1995), and cases cited. The presence of even one biased deliberating juror is sufficient to deprive a defendant of this right and require a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>457 Mass. 152, 164 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Peremptory challenges are \u201c[o]ne of a party\u2019s limited number of challenges that do not need to be supported by a reason . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 261 (9th ed. 2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>367 Mass. 419, 420 (1975), quoting <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 220 (1965) <em>(Swain) </em>(\u201cexercised without a reason stated, without inquiry and without being subject to the court\u2019s control\u201d). This type of challenge is distinct from a party\u2019s unlimited ability to challenge jurors \u201cfor cause,\u201d that is, challenges \u201csupported by a specified reason, such as bias or prejudice, that would disqualify that potential juror.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 261. The scope of the peremptory challenge exceeds that of the \u201cfor cause\u201d challenge to permit a party to \u201celiminate those jurors perceived as harboring subtle biases with regard to the case, which were not elicited on voir dire or which do not establish legal cause for challenge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 483-484, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) <em>(Soares).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The right to use peremptory challenges, however, is not absolute.

The objectives served by eliminating discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges \u2014\u2022 the assurance of \u201cdiffused impartiality\u201d in the jury and \u201cpublic confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system,\u201d <em>Soares, supra </em>at 480 \u2014 are no less pressing where the discriminatory challenge is exercised by the defendant rather than by the Commonwealth. Ensuring nondiscriminatory use of peremptory challenges is \u201cintended to benefit both sides in a criminal trial, and to protect the right of each person to have the opportunity to serve on a jury without fear of exclusion due to invidious [racej-based discrimination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fruchtman, </em>418 Mass. 8, 17, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 951 (1994). See <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., supra </em>at 128; <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We therefore decline to permit defendants a \u201cpattern of one\u201d discriminatory peremptory challenge and continue to adhere to our well-settled precedent that a challenge to the only African-American member of a venire is sufficient to rebut the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tion of a properly used peremptory challenge, regardless of the party by whom it is exercised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>424 Mass. 78, 79-80 (1997) (applying <em>Harris </em>exception to defendant\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenge).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendant next asserts that the judge should have accepted his race-neutral reason for challenging Juror no. 16. \u201cThe determination whether an explanation is \u2018bona fide\u2019 entails a critical evaluation of both the soundness of the proffered explanation and whether the explanation (no matter how \u2018sound\u2019 it might appear) is the actual motivating force behind the challenging party\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 464 (2003). In this regard, an explanation for a challenge must be both \u201cadequate\u201d (i.e., \u201c \u2018clear and reasonably specific,\u2019 \u2018personal to the juror and not based on the juror\u2019s group affiliation\u2019 \u201d) and \u201cgenuine\u201d (i.e., \u201cin fact the reason for the exercise of the challenge\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 464, 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Here, defense counsel\u2019s stated reason for the challenge referred to Juror no. 16\u2019s occupation as a teacher. He argued that the problems of drugs in schools might make Juror no. 16 unable to be impartial in a case involving a number of young people involved in drugs. This bias, defense counsel alleged, was compounded by the similar occupation of the potential juror\u2019s spouse as a school administrator. \u201cAlthough defense counsel stated that his peremptory challenge was motivated by nonracial considerations, the judge was entitled to disbelieve him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, supra </em>at 82. The judge did just that, holding that \u201cthe proffered reason for a challenge is not bona fide, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>is a mere sham.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In light of the considerable support for the judge\u2019s determination apparent from the record,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> see <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Fruchtman, supra </em>at 15, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 552 (1981) (\u201cwe do not substitute our judgment for [the judge\u2019s] if there is support for it on the record\u201d), we conclude that the judge sufficiently discharged his responsibility to \u201cconsiderQ both the adequacy and the genuineness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s justification for his challenge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendant argues also that the judge erred in not allowing his challenge after the additional voir dire. During this later voir dire process, Juror no. 16 stated that he had \u201cbeen called quite a few of those [terms that the defendant allegedly used to describe African-Americans] in my lifetime anyway,\u201d and, when asked if he could be impartial despite this experience, said, \u201cI would be able to do my best on it.\u201d The defendant argues that although such statements \u201cmay have been related, in an indirect sense, to his race,\u201d they were sufficiently \u201cpersonal\u201d to Juror no. 16 to justify a peremptory challenge. While the statements may have been personal to the juror, we do not agree that they support the defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Of course, prospective jurors may be questioned about race-related bias, as the judge did of every member of the venire in this case, and a defendant may challenge them if \u201cthe defendant has specific reason to believe [they] would be incapable of confronting and suppressing their racism.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, supra </em>at 58. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>298 F.3d 906, 914 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1096 (2002) (prosecutor could legitimately challenge juror who believed race discrimination tainted criminal justice system). When initially questioned as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>whether racial prejudice would affect his ability to be impartial, Juror no. 16 answered, \u201cNo.\u201d After additional voir dire, Juror no. 16 stated, \u201cI would be able to do my best on it.\u201d This response was not so equivocal as to require the inference that he could not be impartial. The defendant cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 804 (1995), for the requirement that Juror no. 16 should have \u201cunequivocally\u201d stated his ability to be impartial. In that case, however, prior to being asked whether he could be unbiased, the challenged juror had already demonstrated that he \u201charbored a potential ethnic bias against the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 803. Here, no such bias was apparent, so an unequivocal response was not necessary to rehabilitate the juror\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Where a juror provides an answer such as Juror no. 16 did here, we conclude that the question of bias is best left to the considerable discretion of the judge, who can observe the juror\u2019s appearance during questioning. That is particularly appropriate in this case, as the judge expressly based his opinion, in part, on his assessment of Juror no. 16\u2019s appearance \u2014 \u201cyou saw the gentleman\u2019s reaction, just as I did now. And I must say, I \u2014 from my own eyes, I can\u2019t imagine a more straightforward, honest response from a man.\u201d The judge also had the benefit of Juror no. 16\u2019s unequivocal response (\u201cNo\u201d) to the initial question concerning racial bias that was asked of every other juror.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude that Juror no. 16\u2019s response to additional voir dire questioning was not so equivocal as to require reversal of the judge\u2019s determination of his impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Beyond Juror no. 16\u2019s purported equivocation, the defendant claims also that Juror no. 16\u2019s experience of racism provides sufficient basis for his peremptory challenge. The United States Supreme Court \u201cfirmly has rejected the view that assumptions of partiality based on race provide a legitimate basis for disqualifying a person as an impartial juror.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, supra </em>at 59. In recognizing that parties may use peremptory challenges based on criteria that will result in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cdisproportionate removal of prospective [minority] jurors,\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 361 (1991) (plurality opinion) (Hernandez), the Court held that if a party provides a reason that has such a disproportionate impact, \u201cthe trial judge may consider that fact as evidence that the [party\u2019s] stated reason constitutes a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. The Court explained, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 364, because the party\u2019s intent \u201clargely will turn on evaluation of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, quoting <em>Batson, supra </em>at 98 n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In this case, defense counsel based his challenge on an assumption that an individual who had suffered racism would feel subtle biases against an alleged racist. This assumption, however, is undoubtedly \u201cbased\u201d on race, and therefore provides an illegitimate basis for a peremptory challenge. See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, supra </em>at 59. It would require a measure of \u201cwillful intellectual blindness,\u201d <em>Love </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>586 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1180 (N.D. Cal. 2008), for us to conclude that Juror no. 16\u2019s experience of racism (particularly the race-specific examples described by the judge in his questioning) does not correlate almost perfectly with his race and therefore serve as a \u201csurrogate for race.\u201d <em>Hernandez, supra </em>at 371. See <em>id. </em>at 379 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cAn explanation that is \u2018race neutral\u2019 on its face is nonetheless unacceptable if it is merely a proxy for a discriminatory practice\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> An assumption premised solely on an individual having suffered racism is an assumption based on race. We will not require the exclusion of all jurors who have suffered racism by assuming their bias in cases where the defendant is alleged to have used racially offensive language. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 323 (1999). Accordingly, we defer to the judge, and conclude that the fact that Juror no. 16 had himself suffered racism, without any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>that he could not be impartial, was an impermissible ground on which to base a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that, even if he was not entitled to challenge Juror no. 16 at the outset, \u201cthe in-depth questioning of voir [dire] . . . itself had alienated the juror,\u201d and thereby entitled the defendant to exercise the peremptory challenge. The defendant cites <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 376 (1892), quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 353, for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c[b]ecause, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned proves insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Other than the fact that the colloquy took place, there is no evidence from which one could conclude that the procedure had irretrievably biased Juror no. 16 against the defendant. Juror no. 16 expressed no hostility toward either side; the judge found at the conclusion of the colloquy that there was \u201cno cause for challenge of this juror.\u201d Furthermore, the defendant himself sought the additional voir dire, a request that the judge allowed in his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">When requesting individual voir dire based on alleged racial prejudice, a defendant runs the risk that \u201csuch specific questions may activate latent racial bias in certain prospective jurors or may insult others without uncovering evidence of bias in hard-core bigots who refuse to acknowledge their prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>407 Mass. 553, 555 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lumley, </em>367 Mass. 213, 217 (1975).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the opposite choice is not without risk: \u201cnot only does a decision <em>to </em>request a voir dire present a potential of harm to the defendant, but also a decision <em>not </em>to request a voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>dire runs a risk that the jury will include bigots.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>at 556. Defendants are the only ones who can make this choice for themselves, and we will not place our collective thumb on the scale. Were we to conclude that the process itself, even where it did not result in any grounds for a permissible peremptory challenge, could bias the juror against a defendant, defendants would always prevail in such challenges; here, either Juror no. 16\u2019s answers to additional questioning would reveal his bias, or the additional questioning itself would create that bias. Therefore, we conclude that, at least where, as here, there is no evidence of a juror\u2019s hostility to questioning concerning racial prejudice, the mere fact of questioning a potential juror does not ordinarily create bias such that a peremptory challenge is rendered permissible on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s improper challenge, the judge seated Juror no. 16 and proceeded with the trial. The judge\u2019s chosen course of action \u2014 disallowance of the challenge and retention of the already seated jurors \u2014 was eminently appropriate, as \u201c[njothing in <em>Soares </em>suggests that a defendant, whose misuse of peremptory challenges proves unsuccessful, is entitled to select a new jury from a new venire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>395 Mass. 568, 572-573 (1985). There is no basis in the record for us to conclude that the bias of Juror no. 16 was \u201cmanifest\u201d such that a finding of an abuse of discretion is required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 443 (2001). In light of the judge\u2019s strict and considered adherence to the requirements of <em>Soares, supra, </em>and <em>Harris, supra, </em>we conclude that the jury as constituted was fair and representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">b. <em>Limiting instruction on prior inconsistent statements. </em>The defendant maintains that the judge erred in limiting the jury\u2019s use of Pape\u2019s prior inconsistent statements \u2014 that the defendant had not committed the murder and instead had been with her in the bathroom at the time \u2014 to an assessment of Pape\u2019s credibility as a witness. The defendant contends that the unobjected-to limiting instruction resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCray, </em>457 Mass. 544, 552 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992) (pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, where claim of error is unpreserved, we \u201cconsider whether there was an error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>in the course of the trial [by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge] and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We need not decide whether this instruction was given in error. Assuming, without deciding, that it was,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the provision of the instruction did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">There was overwhelming evidence, beyond Pape\u2019s testimony, as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. During the trial, numerous witnesses described the events of August 7, 2004, and their perception of events leading up to the shooting. The defendant himself admitted in police interviews to having threatened the victim with the gun by aiming it at the victim\u2019s forehead. This was only minutes before the victim was shot with the same gun in the very spot where the defendant had aimed it. Richard Ford testified that, shortly before the shooting, the defendant stated to the victim, \u201cYou were my friend. How could you steal my shit? I should kill you.\u201d Five seconds later, Ford heard a gunshot followed by a loud thud. Christopher Rose testified that the defendant \u201cput the gun to [the victim\u2019s] head\u201d and \u201ctold him he was going to die,\u201d and that, after Rose heard the gunshot, he saw the defendant \u201cholding the gun up towards [the victim]\u201d; Rose later stated that he \u201csaw\u201d the defendant shoot the victim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rose also testified that, after the shooting, he saw the defendant \u201cwipe the gun down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The jury learned that the defendant had provided police with the clothes he had purportedly been wearing at the time of the shooting. Instead, and consistent with consciousness of guilt, he had in fact been wearing different clothes when the victim was shot. The jury heard a recorded conversation between the defendant and Pape in which they discussed what each had told the police about the shooting. When their statements concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>their exact location at the time of the shooting did not align, Pape said, \u201c[S]ee, now the story is all fucked up,\u201d indicating that their \u201cstory\u201d had been contrived.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The overwhelming weight of the evidence implicated the defendant in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Significantly, the limiting instruction did not affect the defendant\u2019s ability to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s case. In alleging prejudice, the defendant claims in a general way that the limiting instruction \u201cremoved valuable and directly exculpatory information\u201d from the jury\u2019s consideration. We are hard pressed to see how this was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The distinction between substantive admissibility and admissibility solely for credibility purposes can, of course, be vitally important where the Commonwealth seeks to prove the truth of a prior inconsistent statement; without substantive admission of the statement, the Commonwealth might not be able to prove its case. Defendants, however, need not \u201ctest or produce any evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Laguer, 448 Mass. 585, 598 n.30 (2007). To acquit the defendant, the jury did not need to believe the truth of Pape\u2019s prior statements, i.e., that she and the defendant were in the bathroom while Wells was shot in the kitchen. The jury simply needed to disbelieve Pape\u2019s trial testimony, i.e., that she saw the defendant shoot Wells. The latter was a determination that the judge\u2019s instruction allowed, conveying as it did the jury\u2019s ability to use Pape\u2019s inconsistency to assess her credibility.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, the extensive cross-examination of Pape revealed a litany of prior inconsistent statements she had made on a number of matters, all of which undermined her credibility and allowed the jury to disbelieve her trial testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>See note 10, <em>supra. </em>The jury, in reaching their verdicts, either credited her trial testimony or convicted the defendant on the basis of the other overwhelming evidence against him. Either way, the instruction could not have given rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>427 Mass. 620, 627-628 (1998) (where defendant had objected at trial and, unlike here, had preserved error, prior inconsistent statements as to identity that had been erroneously limited to credibility purposes only resulted in \u201cno harm\u201d to defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">3. <em>Review under G.

Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>450 Mass. 395, 405, 406, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 893 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) (Soares) (declining to analyze defendant\u2019s claim of error because \u201cthe record [did] not supply the necessary factual foundation\u201d where defense counsel and prosecutor focused on different aspects of juror\u2019s identity during discussion of challenge, defense did not make explicit objection to Commonwealth\u2019s challenge, and parties provided \u201cno information\u201d concerning juror\u2019s identity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Defense counsel did not request that the judge pose additional questions to the venire concerning the possible effect of racist remarks purportedly made by the defendant and Rose on the potential jurors\u2019 ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b317-14\">Before providing this justification, defense counsel argued that the Commonwealth had failed to make its prima facie case because one of the seated jurors was \u201cof color,\u201d described by counsel as \u201clight Hispanic.\u201d The judge replied, \u201cI don\u2019t see how one could suggest even remotely that the gentleman is in any way similar to the situation before the [cjourt now.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The judge correctly sought a response from the Commonwealth to the defendant\u2019s race-neutral explanation.

The analysis in <em>Batson, supra, </em>is similar to the analysis in <em>Soares, supra, </em>albeit on different constitutional grounds.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 402 n.11 (1987), overruled on another ground, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>407 Mass. 553, 555 (1990). Accordingly, \u201cour analysis of this issue is the same under the Federal Constitution and the Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 806 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">To prove discriminatory intent, <em>Batson </em>and <em>Soares </em>required a prima facie showing of a \u201cpattern\u201d of such impermissible challenges, but we have since dispensed with the strict \u201cpattern\u201d requirement, holding that \u201cthe challenge of a single prospective juror within a protected class could, in some circumstances, constitute a prima facie case of impropriety.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>414 Mass. 732, 738 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 273, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 465 (1991) <em>(Harris), </em>we held that where the challenged juror is the only member of his or her protected class in the entire venire, that \u201cpattern\u201d is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a properly used peremptory challenge. \u201cThis is so because the ultimate issue is not whether there is a \u2018pattern\u2019 of excluding a discrete group, but whether the challenge made to any member of the panel is impermissibly based on the juror\u2019s membership in one of the discrete groups protected under <em>[Soares].\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 463 n.3 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As was done here, \u201c[i]n making this determination, the judge should hear from the opposing party as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">It is therefore inconsequential that, even assuming defense counsel\u2019s contention during empanelment was correct, one empanelled juror was of Hispanic descent. The test in <em>Soares </em>and <em>Batson </em>does not apply to challenges to members of all minority ethnic or racial groups lumped together, but instead applies to challenges to \u201cparticular, defined groupings in the community,\u201d <em>Soares, supra </em>at 486, such as all African-Americans, see, e.g., <em>id., </em>or all Hispanics, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, supra </em>at 807 <em>n.9. </em>The defendant could not prove that he had not discriminated against the former by allowing a member of the latter group to be seated. See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Brady, 592 </em>F.3d 296, 305-306 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3478 (2010), and cases cited (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that court should construe African-American and Hispanic jurors as part of the same \u201ccognizable group\u201d for <em>Batson </em>purposes because \u201cwe cannot assume that \u2018minorities\u2019 constitute the \u2018cognizable group\u2019 essential to showing that the prosecutor intentionally discriminated against such a group in his or her use of peremptory challenges\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The same could be said of <em>any </em>limitation on the right to use peremptory challenges. The defendant offers no reason why these concerns apply with particular force to challenges to a single juror based on race or ethnicity. These concerns exist regardless whether a pattern of discriminatory strikes or a single such strike is alleged. We have invalidated the use of discriminatory strikes in either case, to achieve \u201ca balance between the goal of diffused impartiality in the . . . jury and the limitations inherent in a feasible and fair process of jury selection.\u201d <em>Soares, supra </em>at 485. See Ogletree, Just Say No!: A Proposal to Eliminate Racially Discriminatory Uses of Peremptory Chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>lenges, 31 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1099, 1104 (1994) (\u201cStriking jurors on the basis of race or gender is not always an irrational act; it can sometimes be ... in keeping with the litigant\u2019s goals, and would simply be part of effective advocacy were it not entirely repugnant to the values and standards of the Constitution, values that should and do override the litigant\u2019s interest in winning\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The rule conferring the right to peremptory challenges in criminal trials in Massachusetts, Mass. R. Crim. P. 20 (c), 378 Mass. 889 (1979), does not distinguish between the Commonwealth\u2019s right to peremptory challenges and the defendant\u2019s right. The rule specifically provides that \u201cthe Commonwealth shall be entitled to as many peremptory challenges as equal the whole number to which all the defendants in the case are entitled,\u201d indicating the equivalence of the interest on each side.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The defendant notes correctly that the exception set out in <em>Harris </em>was first applied to an exercise of a peremptory challenge by the Commonwealth where the defendant and the challenged juror were of the same race. See <em>Harris, supra </em>at 465. The initial application of the rule, however, does not mean that it must be restricted to that factual context. Indeed, since <em>Harris, </em>we have applied the exception to a defendant\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>424 Mass. 78, 79-80 (1997). Also, even before <em>Harris, </em>we recognized that \u201ccommon group membership of a defendant and those jurors excluded is not a prerequisite to assertion of the right (to a representative jury).\u201d <em>Soares, supra </em>at 490. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 429 n.2 (2002) (applying <em>Harris </em>exception even though \u201cthe defendant, the victim, and the witnesses were Caucasian\u201d and the challenged juror was African-American).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In so stating, the judge used precisely the \u201ckey words\u201d (\u201cbona fide\u201d and \u201csham\u201d) that \u201caid us in our review,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, supra </em>at 82 n.4, making it clear that he gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the defendant\u2019s proffered rationale. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, supra </em>at 430. The judge concluded that \u201cthe explanation was inadequate,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 Mass. 804, 810 (2000), and \u201cmerely a post hoc justification for an impermissibly motivated challenge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 466. Because the judge made clear findings as to both adequacy and genuineness, his determination is entitled to deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The connection between Juror no. 16\u2019s occupation and his purported bias, as described by defense counsel, is tenuous at best. While we have held that a juror\u2019s occupation may be a sufficient basis for the exercise of a peremptory challenge, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, supra </em>at 429, \u201cwhere a question has been validly raised about the propriety of a party\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge, the claim of occupation as legitimate disqualifier should be carefully scrutinized.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>452 Mass. 212, 224 (2008). At times, the Massachusetts appellate courts have held to be error a judge\u2019s determination that a juror\u2019s occupation was sufficient to justify an allegedly discriminatory peremptory challenge. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5, <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. 769 (1994). In that case, the Commonwealth had justified its challenge by reference to the African-American juror\u2019s position as \u201ca youth services program director,\u201d arguing that youth workers have \u201ccertain feelings . . . about youth and crime.\u201d The Appeals Court concluded that \u201c[t]he record is destitute of any legal or factual basis supporting whatever may have been the prosecutor\u2019s belief regarding the unexplained propensities of those who work with youth; nor was any authority offered for the propriety of taking judicial notice of any such occupational attitudes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The same could be said here. None of Juror no. 16\u2019s answers during voir dire suggested that his occupation would affect his ability to be impartial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, supra </em>at 224-225 (rejecting prosecutor\u2019s rationale for challenge premised on juror\u2019s occupation [teacher\u2019s assistant] where juror \u201cgave no answers to the questions posed to her that would suggest her occupation\u201d would affect her service on jury). Additionally, the judge pointed out that other jurors with the same occupation had not been challenged; defense counsel offered no reason to differentiate this teacher (Juror no. 16) from those teachers previously seated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 467 (\u201cgenuineness [of proffered rationale for challenge was] significantly impaired by the absence of consistency in its application to other jurors\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>528 F.3d 110, 116-117 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding judge properly evaluated and found discriminatory intent in peremptory challenge partly on basis that there was little difference, other than race, between challenged juror and juror already seated).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">That defense counsel subsequently provided an additional reason for the challenge (his client\u2019s alleged racism) also raises doubts about the genuineness of the first rationale. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>473 (2010) (assessing race-neutral rationale for challenge and noting that challenging party \u201cdid not change his position\u201d during discussion of challenge as a reason to regard it as adequate). The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel conceded at oral argument that, provided only with the justifications originally put forward, he would be \u201chard pressed\u201d to, and \u201ccouldn\u2019t successfully,\u201d convince us that the judge had abused his discretion. We defer to the judge\u2019s well-reasoned decision, which has ample support in both the record and our precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">To the extent the defendant argues that, after the additional voir dire, the juror should have been excused \u201cfor cause,\u201d we disagree. By definition, if (as we conclude) the defendant cannot justify his peremptory challenge, he cannot meet the standard to support a \u201cfor cause\u201d challenge. See <em>Batson, supra </em>at 97 (justifying \u201cfor cause\u201d challenge is higher burden, as reason for peremptory challenge \u201cneed not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In response to the question concerning potential racial bias, two other unchallenged jurors gave responses that could be construed equally as equivocal. When asked whether race would affect their ability to be impartial, one juror stated, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d and the other juror said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d The absence of a challenge in those instances undercuts the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We note that while the judge, on request, conducted an individual voir dire of Juror no. 16 as to racial prejudice, there was no request for the judge to question any other potential jurors on the effect that the defendant\u2019s alleged racism might have on their ability to be impartial. Just as no other member of the venire was African-American, no other member of the venire was subjected to the same line of questioning as was Juror no. 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>407 Mass. 553, 555-557 (1990), we dispensed with the requirement that a judge conduct a personal colloquy with the defendant when his counsel requests an individual voir dire related to racial prejudice. We reasoned that, because there is an inherent risk of juror bias regardless of the defendant\u2019s choice, \u201c[t]he benefit to be obtained by a colloquy does not justify the risk of harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">We note that defense counsel never sought to admit the prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence, at no point suggested that the evidence was being used substantively, did not object to the instruction limiting use of the statements solely to determinations of credibility, and even characterized the testimony as \u201cimpeachment by prior inconsistent statement.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Certain prior inconsistent statements by Rose were similarly limited; any purported error with respect to the instruction did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice for the same reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A considerable amount of physical and testimonial evidence also went to the implausibility of the defendant\u2019s alternative theories of suicide or of Christopher Rose being the shooter. For example, forensic evidence established that the rifle was two inches away from the victim\u2019s forehead when he was shot, making suicide unlikely. Presumably for this reason, although the prior inconsistent statements and the defendant\u2019s own statements described a suicide, defense counsel did not pursue this theory in closing argument. Additionally, the testimony of every eyewitness stated that Christopher Rose had pushed the gun away from the victim and consoled him after the angry defendant had threatened him. No evidence, other than his presence at the scene, implicated Rose in the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">To the extent the defendant alleges that any error raises concerns of a constitutional magnitude, his claim is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
