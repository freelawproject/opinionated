L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D). The question before us is whether, when an awarding authority is making a determination as to bidder re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sponsibility, it is constrained to look only at materials compiled as part of the Department of Capital Asset Management\u2019s (DCAM\u2019s) contractor certification process. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D. We conclude that the competitive bidding statute places no such restriction on awarding authorities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAoS\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite briefly the background facts, which are not contested in any relevant respect. In February, 2008, the town of Holliston (town) solicited bids for the construction of a new police station. The plaintiff, Barr Incorporated (Barr), submitted the lowest bid. The town, however, subsequently determined that the plaintiff was not a \u201cresponsible and eligible general bidder,\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D), and that the contract should instead be awarded to the next-lowest bidder, Statewide Engineering &amp; Construction Co., Inc. (Statewide).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In determining that Barr was not a responsible bidder,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the town first looked to information in DCAM\u2019s certification file on Barr,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also conducted an Internet search. Finding that these materials raised cause for concern as to Barr\u2019s performance on past projects, the town administrator asked Charles Todd, a detective in the town\u2019s police department, to conduct a more thorough investigation into Barr\u2019s projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Todd proceeded by contacting eight municipalities that had previously retained the plaintiff as a contractor. He determined that six of them had an \u201coverall negative\u201d impression of Barr\u2019s work. Compiling Todd\u2019s report with information in DCAM\u2019s file, the town administrator concluded that, of the eighteen public projects awarded to Barr on which the town had information, seven had resulted in \u201cnegative experiences\u201d for the project client. This conclusion was reported to the town committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>charged with overseeing the project; in April, 2008, that committee voted to find that Barr was not a responsible bidder for purposes of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The day before the town was to award the project, Barr filed a complaint in Superior Court against the town, seeking injunc-tive and declaratory relief. In its complaint, Barr alleged generally that the town\u2019s investigation fell \u201coutside the scope of what it was permitted to do pursuant to\u201d State law. Barr alleged also that the town \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in determining that Barr was not a responsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Barr subsequently moved for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory relief. In denying Barr\u2019s motion, the judge noted that his decision turned solely on the narrow, and potentially dispositive, legal issue whether, in determining that Barr was not a responsible bidder, the town was constrained to consider only DCAM\u2019s file on Barr and a statutorily mandated \u201cupdate statement\u201d to that file. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) <em>(a). </em>Because the judge concluded that the statute did not constrain the town in this manner, he determined that Barr was not entitled to summary judgment in its favor. The judge specifically declined to address \u201cwhether [the town\u2019s] investigation was fair and thorough,\u201d or the ultimate issue \u201cwhether [the town\u2019s] refusal to honor Barr\u2019s low bid was arbitrary.\u201d He then allowed the parties\u2019 joint motion, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), that the case be reported to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>A report by a judge in the Superior Court brings before us only the propriety of the ruling or order reported. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, </em>425 Mass. 79, 84 (1997). In this case, the order at issue resolved a pure question of law: whether G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D, prevents an \u201cawarding authority\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from conducting any independent investigation into bidder responsibility. We therefore accord \u201cno deference to the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>445 Mass. 304, 308 (2005). Nevertheless, we conclude, as did the judge, that an awarding authority may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>consider information bearing on a bidder\u2019s responsibility \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 outside that contained in DCAM\u2019s records on the bidder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Spurred by concerns \u201cin the press and elsewhere about corruption in the award and supervision of [public] construction contracts,\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>380 Mass. 805, 806 (1980), in 1980 the Legislature enacted a wholesale reform of the Commonwealth\u2019s public bidding statutes, St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55, now codified at G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A, 44B-44D, 44E, 44F-44H (1980 statute). Even prior to the 1980 statute, with certain exceptions, contracts for the construction of public buildings were required to \u201cbe awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder.\u201d <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>457 Mass. 248, 259 &amp; n. 13 (2010), comparing G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as amended through St. 1977, c. 968, with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55. The 1980 statute retained this requirement, but provided additional guidance on the meaning of \u201cResponsible\u201d and \u201c[eligible.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (1). See <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 259-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">To be \u201cResponsible\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, a bidder must \u201cdemonstrably possess[] the skill, ability and integrity necessary to faithfully perform the work called for by a particular contract, based upon a determination of competent workmanship and financial soundness in accordance with the provisions of [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That section, in turn, requires that bidders obtain a certificate of eligibility from DCAM, which it grants based on assessments of the bidder\u2019s performance on past and current projects. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) <em>(a). </em>Although the department will review assessments submitted by a contractor\u2019s prior private clients, see 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06 (2005), private firms, unlike public entities, are under no obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tion to report a contractor\u2019s performance to DCAM. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (16). General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) (a), requires also that bidders submit \u201cupdate statement[s]\u201d with their bids; these are self-prepared documents listing the public projects that bidders have completed since obtaining their certificate of eligibility. See 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.01, 4.04(6), 8.06 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We have described at length the threefold function of these statutory requirements. See generally <em>Brasi Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>456 Mass. 684, 689-691 (2010), and cases cited. First, they assure a minimum level of contractor competence, one safeguarded by DCAM through its certification process. <em>Id. </em>at 690. Second, they establish DCAM as a clearinghouse of information between and \u201camong individual awarding authorities.\u201d 8 Final Report to the General Court of the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings 351 (Dec. 31, 1980) (Ward Commission Report). Third, they provide awarding authorities with \u201cguidelines issued by an expert authority\u201d \u2014 that is, DCAM \u2014 on how to determine whether a bidder can successfully complete a construction contract in a timely manner. See <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 260. Prior to these reforms, many awarding authorities would deem almost all bidders responsible and eligible, \u201cregardless of their competency or experience, and the selection of a contractor was based solely on price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After enactment of the 1980 statute, however, awarding authorities were able to avail themselves \u201cof an effective system for screening out those contractors who are unqualified.\u201d 8 Ward Commission Report, <em>supra </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Yet, even under the 1980 statute, the entity responsible for making a final determination of bidder responsibility remains the awarding authority, not DCAM. This principle was well established under the public bidding statute that existed prior to 1980. See <em>Capuano, Inc. </em>v. <em>School Bldg. Comm. of Wilbraham, </em>330 Mass. 494, 495-496 (1953). And, under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (6), it remains the awarding authority that must \u201cdeter-min[e] who is the lowest responsible and eligible bidder.\u201d Were this language not plain enough, the legislative history of the 1980 statute discloses that \u201cthe assumption\u201d behind the legislation was that \u201cawarding authorities will normally be in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>position to evaluate the qualifications of those desiring to bid on its projects.\u201d 8 Ward Commission Report, <em>supra </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Certainly, an awarding authority\u2019s discretion in determining whether a bidder is responsible and eligible is not unconstrained. The awarding authority may only contract with a bidder certified by DCAM. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D. Even in selecting among certified bidders, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (6), requires that awarding authorities \u201cshall consider the information submitted by the bidder in the update statement.\u201d DCAM regulations require further that awarding authorities \u201cmust review the [cjontractor\u2019s certification file from DCAM.\u201d 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.04(2) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">However, nothing in either the statute or DCAM\u2019s regulations expressly precludes the awarding authority from conducting an independent investigation into the past performance of potential bidders. Moreover, the statutory requirement that awarding authorities in fact read and consider information related to a bidder\u2019s performance in at least some past projects does not support the inference Barr suggests, that the Legislature wished to prevent awarding authorities from considering the bidder\u2019s performance in a wider sample of such projects, as the town did here. Nor does permitting awarding authorities to conduct independent background investigations compromise the principle that \u201call general contractors and subbidders [be placed] on an equal footing in the competition to gain the contract.\u201d <em>John T. Callahan &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>430 Mass. 124, 128 (1999), quoting <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757-758 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The statutory requirement that contracts be awarded to the lowest qualified bidder is intended to \u201cfacilitate[] the elimination of favoritism and corruption as factors in the awarding of public contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758. Barr emphasizes that, in the present case, the town administrator agreed that the town\u2019s investigation of Barr was \u201cmore extensive\u201d than its investigation of Statewide, the next lowest bidder. The town administrator explained that he devoted greater attention to Barr because his initial inquiries revealed particular cause for concern with respect to Barr\u2019s performance. Barr, however, contends that the town\u2019s conduct demonstrates that if awarding authorities are permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>investigate the background of contractors independently, they will perform only cursory reviews of preferred bidders while searching for flaws in disfavored firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We are persuaded that any such risk is adequately addressed by other aspects of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44D (6), requires an awarding authority to notify DCAM in the event that it \u201cdetermines that the low bidder is not responsible and eligible.\u201d Should DCAM conclude that the prevailing bidder obtained its contract by fraud, collusion, corruption, or other impropriety, it may begin proceedings to decertify the offending contractor. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (15). Further, disappointed bidders may file complaints with the Attorney General, who is \u201ccharged with investigating allegations of violations of the competitive bidding statute and enforcing its provisions.\u201d <em>Brasi Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Bidders may also challenge contract awards by filing a complaint in the Superior Court. Where an awarding authority rejects a bidder \u201cfor lack of competence,\u201d that decision should be \u201cjustified on the record\u201d compiled by the authority. <em>Fred C. McClean Heating Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westfield Trade High Sch. Bldg. Comm.., </em>345 Mass. 267, 274 (1962). Where an awarding authority decides to supplement the record before it as to one bidder but not as to another, that decision should also be justifiable on the record, as should an awarding authority\u2019s decision to deny a bidder any opportunity to respond to the results of an independent investigation. Cf. <em>Siemens Bldg. Techs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 759, 765 (2003) (recognizing that conduct of awarding authority may be challenged as \u201cillegal or arbitrary\u201d); <em>Capuano, Inc. </em>v. <em>School Bldg. Comm. of Wilbraham, supra </em>at 496. Indeed, Barr raised just such a claim in the pending Superior Court proceedings, maintaining that the town acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in determining that Barr was not a responsible bidder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We note also that the potential class of plaintiffs in such an action is not necessarily limited to the low bidder on each contract; we have specifically interpreted standing requirements under the public bidding statute in a liberal manner in order to safeguard \u201cthe important role played by individual bidders in securing compliance with the bidding statutes.\u201d <em>Modern Continental Constr. Co. </em>v. Lowell, 391 Mass. 829, 836 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In light of these overlapping protections against the arbitrary or fraudulent award of public building contracts, we are not convinced that the \u201cequal playing field\u201d established by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, would be compromised by allowing awarding authorities to conduct their own investigations of bidder responsibility. In any event, as noted above, the statute contains no language effecting a blanket ban on such investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We are mindful also, as the Inspector General and the Attorney General point out, that the information garnered from an awarding authority\u2019s independent investigation of a bidder may at times be of equal or greater recency and relevance than the information in DCAM\u2019s certification file and the bidder\u2019s update statement. DCAM\u2019s certification file need include only a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of a contractor\u2019s public sector projects, and will not necessarily reflect performance in any of the contractor\u2019s private sector work. 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.06(2). Accordingly, DCAM\u2019s certification file may exclude a significant portion of the work history of contractors with extensive experience, or with experience primarily in private sector construction projects. Awarding authorities should not be precluded from assembling a more complete picture of a contractor\u2019s qualifications than that available from the certification file and update statement alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In sum, we cannot conclude that the town exceeded its statutory authority by conducting an investigation into Barr\u2019s performance in past projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Attorney General and the Inspector General on behalf of the town of Holliston (town), as well as that of Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., on behalf of Barr Incorporated (Barr).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The project is estimated to cost approximately $4.9 million.
