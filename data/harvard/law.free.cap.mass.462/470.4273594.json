The defendant was convicted on retrial; the jury at his first trial were unable to agree on a unanimous verdict. The defendant contends, among other things, that State and Federal double jeopardy protections precluded the judge at the second trial from instructing the jury on accessory liability where no such instruction was provided to the first jury. We conclude that the instruction given at the second trial was appropriate, because it would have been supported by the evidence introduced at the first trial, and, in the circumstances of this case, did not invite the jury to convict on a theory of the crime abandoned or foreclosed by the Commonwealth at the first trial. We discern no other error that would warrant relief, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>We briefly recite the facts the jury could have found at the second trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reserving certain additional facts for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">On the evening of April 7, 2007, several bullets were fired into a window at 168 Fletcher Street in Lowell. One of those bullets hit Vuthavy Phay, a guest at a party being held at that house. Phay died from his injuries. At the time of the shooting, the defendant was in a dating relationship with a resident of 168 Fletcher Street, Jennifer Chhea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jennifer lived there with her parents and siblings. The eldest of her siblings, her brother John, was a member of the \u201cAsian Boyz\u201d gang. The defendant was a member of a rival gang, \u201cTRG Grey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The jury reasonably could have inferred that these rival gang affiliations were a source of tension between John and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>defendant. The jury heard testimony that John, as well as other family members, disapproved of Jennifer\u2019s relationship with the defendant, and would not allow the defendant into their house. In her testimony, Jennifer suggested also that when John learned the defendant had been in their house, he threatened the defendant with physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Less than a week before the murder, Jennifer told the defendant that she had engaged in sexual relations with another man. On April 7, the day of the shooting, Jennifer told him that she was pregnant. The defendant reacted angrily, throwing her on the bed and punching her.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Later the same day, the defendant met with his friend Roth Em, who had also previously dated Jennifer. Em had recently quarreled with Jennifer, expressing his disdain for her brother John\u2019s gang. At trial, Em testified that, on April 7, he, the defendant, and two other men had gone together to Fletcher Street. Em stated that he and the defendant walked up an alley behind 168 Fletcher Street. From the alley, the defendant shot several rounds into one of the building\u2019s windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">If not himself the shooter, Em was the only percipient witness to the shooting. Jennifer\u2019s middle brother, Bunthomg, testified that he saw the defendant with a gun outside the building immediately after the shooting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Bunthorng heard, but did not see, the shots being fired, and therefore could not testify to whether it was Em or the defendant who had fired the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">On June 28, 2007, a grand jury returned indictments charging the defendant with murder in the first degree, possession of a firearm, possession of a loaded firearm, and possession of ammunition. The defendant\u2019s first trial began before a Superior Court jury on March 10, 2009, and terminated on March 24, when the trial judge declared a mistrial after receiving two notes from the jury declaring that they were \u201chopelessly\u201d and \u201ctruly\u201d deadlocked. The defendant\u2019s retrial before a second jury commenced on August 11, 2009, with a different judge presiding. This jury convicted him of murder in the second degree, and also of each of the firearms charges. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant\u2019s primary claim on appeal concerns the variance between the instructions to the two juries. He contends that the additional instruction on accessory liability given to the second jury, which he characterizes as explaining a theory of guilt withheld from the first jury, violated State and Federal protections against double jeopardy. As explained in part 2.a, <em>infra, </em>the defendant\u2019s argument misconceives the relationship between accessory and principal liability and is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendant argues also that the judge improperly admitted evidence of his gang affiliation, that certain testimony by a substitute medical examiner violated the right to confront the witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that the foreperson had an impermissible personal connection with a prosecution witness. We discern no error in the admission in evidence of gang affiliation or in the selection of the jury. Further, while certain portions of the substitute medical examiner\u2019s testimony were improperly admitted, the testimony did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">a. <em>Double jeopardy. </em>The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d This language, and parallel Massachusetts statutory and common law, generally preclude the Commonwealth from trying a defendant more than once for the same offense. See G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 7; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>410 Mass. 174, 176 (1991). However, an exception to this mle is made where a prior trial terminated in a mistrial due to \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 461 (1973), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The trial judge\u2019s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict \u201chas long been considered the \u2018classic basis\u2019 for a proper mistrial.\u201d <em>Blueford </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>132 S. Ct. 2044, 2047 (2012), quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 509 (1978). So long as the Commonwealth \u201cpresents evidence legally sufficient to convict\u201d at the first trial, double jeopardy will not generally \u201cbar retrial after a mistrial [is] declared because of a \u2018hung jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 794, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>798-799 (1985), citing <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 479 (1974). Unless there is evidence of bad faith by the judge or the prosecutor, retrial is appropriate even where jury deadlock may have resulted from judicial errors or omissions. See <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>456 Mass. 146, 152, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 425 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 752 (2000) (even if judge\u2019s failure to give joint venture instruction to deadlocked jury had been error, such error would not have precluded retrial absent showing of bad faith). At a subsequent trial, the judge is not bound to repeat the mistakes and omissions made in instructing the jury at the first trial. See <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 153; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lorenzo, </em>570 F.2d 294, 299 (9th Cir. 1978) (declaration of mistrial rendered harmless any errors in jury instructions at first trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The present case falls squarely within these principles. At the defendant\u2019s first trial, the judge instructed the jury on the elements of each offense without informing them that the defendant could be convicted of murder as a joint venturer regardless whether he physically possessed the firearm and personally pulled the trigger.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant recognizes that the Commonwealth was entitled to a broader instruction, but points out that the Commonwealth did not object to the judge\u2019s omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On August 3, 2009, eight days before the defendant\u2019s retrial commenced, we issued our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Za-netti, </em>454 Mass. 449 (2009) <em>(Zanetti). </em>In that case, we observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that our prior decisions had \u201crenounce[d] the false distinction between a principal and an accomplice,\u201d and had \u201crecognized that the accomplice commits the crime no less than the principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464-465, and cases cited. We therefore explained that \u201cjudges are to instruct the jury that the defendant is guilty if the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 467-468, regardless whether as principal or accomplice. The instructions given at the second trial accorded with <em>Zanetti, supra', </em>the judge in fact quoted verbatim from the jury instructions set forth in that case. See <em>id. </em>at 470 (Appendix). The defendant did not object to the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Because the instructions at the first trial contained no reference to joint venture liability, the jury at that trial could have been left with the impression that, to find the defendant guilty of murder, they had to determine unanimously that he had personally fired the fatal shot. Any such impression would have been erroneous. See <em>id. </em>at 466, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s contentions, the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to retry the defendant does not depend on whether the first jury would have been deadlocked had they been given a complete instruction on the law of murder, one that made clear that the defendant\u2019s guilt did not depend on whether he personally had fired the gun. There is no allegation, and no evidence, suggesting that the judge\u2019s failure to provide an instruction on joint venture liability at the first trial was intended to precipitate a mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 448 (1988) (\u201cthe burden is on the defendant!] to show judicial bad faith or prosecutorial \u2018goading\u2019 or \u2018overreaching\u2019 \u201d). The judge at the second trial was not bound to repeat the omission made at the first trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 752 (rejecting \u201cdefendant\u2019s claim that a more pointed instruction would have avoided the deadlock\u201d). See also <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485 (1971). The judge at the retrial correctly provided that jury with a complete instruction on the law of murder, including participation in a murder other than as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Cornelius, </em>845 F.2d 1401, 1404 (6th Cir. 1988), is unavailing. In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>defendant was tried on a charge of murder as an accomplice and on a conspiracy charge. The judge instructed only on the conspiracy charge, and the jury convicted, but the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the conviction because of insufficient evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court subsequently determined that the defendant could be retried on the theory of accomplice liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1403. In granting the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that when the first trial terminated without the judge charging the jury on murder, the defendant was no longer in jeopardy of a conviction of any crime other than conspiracy. The defendant\u2019s jeopardy for murder, as an accomplice or otherwise, had therefore terminated. <em>Id. </em>at 1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The event that terminated jeopardy in <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Cornelius, supra, </em>was the judge\u2019s failure to present one of the charged crimes to the jury. That case simply does not extend to situations where a charged crime is presented to the jury, thus continuing the defendant\u2019s jeopardy, but the jury deadlock on whether to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Nor can the prosecutor\u2019s acquiescence to the instructions provided at the first trial be construed either as an election to try the case on a principal rather than a joint venture theory of liability, or as abandonment of a joint venture theory. Contrast <em>State </em>v. <em>Quitog, </em>85 Haw. 128, 146, 148-149 (1997) (prosecutor expressly urged jury in closing argument to convict defendant not on crime charged but instead on lesser included offenses). Liability as a principal and liability as an accomplice are not distinct theories of liability for the jury or the prosecutor to choose between. See <em>Zanetti, supra </em>at 468. As a result, the considerable reliance placed by the defendant on <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>456 Mass. 146, 155-160 (2010) (Cowin, J., dissenting), is misplaced. Double jeopardy protections do not preclude the instruction given at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">b. <em>Evidence of gang affiliation. </em>The Commonwealth introduced evidence, over objection, that the defendant was a member of a gang; that his girl friend Jennifer\u2019s brother, John, was a member of a rival gang; and that several people at the scene of the shooting, including the victim, were also members of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>rival gang. There was evidence also that Em, the defendant\u2019s alleged accomplice, had argued with Jennifer over her brother\u2019s gang affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We have recognized repeatedly that evidence of a defendant\u2019s gang membership risks prejudice to the defendant in that it may suggest a propensity to criminality or violence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, </em>441 Mass. 329, 333 (2004). Nevertheless, \u201cgang affiliation evidence is admissible to show motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>John, </em>442 Mass. 329, 337 (2004). Such evidence may be relevant also to prove joint venture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swafford, supra </em>at 332-333. \u201c[I]t is within the discretion of the judge to weigh the probative value of [gang affiliation] evidence against its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, 437 </em>Mass. 197, 201 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In the present case, evidence of the antagonistic relationship between the two gangs was relevant to show motive. Although the defendant\u2019s anger at Jennifer could be explained without reference to gang affiliation, that his gang affiliation was not the only possible motive does not require exclusion of the gang evidence. \u201cThe prosecutor is \u2018entitled to present as full a picture as possible of the events surrounding the incident itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weeks, 77 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1, 10 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269-270 (1982). Without the evidence that John, who was opposed to his sister\u2019s relationship with the defendant, was a member of a rival gang, and that members of that gang were gathered at Jennifer\u2019s residence, the jury would have been left to speculate as to why the defendant fired into a crowded residence rather than targeting Jennifer specifically. Further, because there was testimony suggesting that Em sympathized with the defendant\u2019s gang, evidence of the defendant\u2019s gang affiliation was relevant to whether Em and the defendant were acting in concert, and thus to the defendant\u2019s potential joint venture liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smiley, </em>431 Mass. 477, 484 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In addition, the judge limited any prejudicial effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s gang affiliation by asking members of the venire at voir dire whether evidence of gang membership would affect their impartiality, and by providing strong limiting instructions to the jury, reminding them of their oaths and their answers at voir dire. These curative actions closely resembled those that we have described with approval in other cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 505 (1999). In the circumstances of this case, and in light of the measures adopted by the judge to limit the risk of prejudice, we cannot conclude that the admission of limited testimony on gang affiliation constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">c. <em>Substitute medical examiner. </em>The medical examiner who testified at trial to the victim\u2019s cause of death had not conducted the autopsy. Instead, he relied on an autopsy report prepared by another medical examiner. The substitute examiner opined that, based on his review of the first examiner\u2019s file, his opinion was that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. He testified also to certain details of the wound as described in the autopsy report and to the victim\u2019s physical characteristics. The Commonwealth concedes that the substitute examiner was without personal knowledge of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant did not object to any of the substitute examiner\u2019s testimony, and we therefore review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> notwithstanding the constitutional dimension of his claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 356 (2010). Under this standard, we will accord the defendant relief only \u201cif we have a serious doubt whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error[s] not been made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>439 Mass. 340, 345 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 174 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>A medical examiner who did not personally perform an autopsy on the victim may properly testify as to his or her professional opinion concerning the victim\u2019s cause of death based on data collected by another medical examiner, so long as that data are independently admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 388 (2008). Thus, the substitute examiner could properly state his independent opinion as to the likely cause of death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>461 Mass. 126, 132 (2011), citing <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705, 2722 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Consistent with the Sixth Amendment and traditional protections against hearsay, however, a substitute medical examiner may not testify on direct examination to the facts, data, and conclusions stated in an autopsy report. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 391 &amp; n.13. The decision whether to elicit testimony from the report underlying the substitute examiner\u2019s testimony \u201cis a strategic one left to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 338 (2002). Accordingly, the prosecutor should not have elicited testimony on the description of the fatal wound contained in the nontestifying medical examiner\u2019s files, or of the victim\u2019s weight, height, and general physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We are confident, however, that this hearsay testimony did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The substitute examiner\u2019s testimony was relevant only to establishing the cause of death; his opinion testimony as to the cause of death was properly admitted. The hearsay testimony had no bearing on the key issue at trial, whether the defendant in fact participated in the shooting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore discern no risk that the erroneously admitted testimony had more than a \u201cvery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>slight effect\u201d on the jury, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983) (applying prejudicial error standard), let alone that it had a substantial influence upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">d. <em>Juror partiality. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim of error concerns a prior acquaintance between the jury foreperson and a State trooper who testified for the Commonwealth. The juror in question, juror no. 16, was a high school teacher and baseball coach. At the beginning of the fifth day of trial, he submitted a note to the judge stating that he was \u201cfamiliar with\u201d the trooper, who had testified on the fourth day. See note 9, <em>infra. </em>In his note, the juror explained that he had not recognized the trooper\u2019s name when the witness list was read to potential jurors, and had not seen the trooper for \u201cmany years (over 10).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The judge consulted with the prosecutor and defense counsel on whether to excuse the juror. After speaking with the trooper, the prosecutor represented that juror no. 16 \u201cmay have been [the trooper\u2019s junior varsity] basketball coach, but it\u2019s over twenty years ago.\u201d The trooper suggested also that the juror had been his theology teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In accordance with the procedure established in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jackson, 376 Mass. 790, 800-801 (1978), the judge conducted a colloquy with the juror. The juror stated again that he believed he had taught the trooper \u201cmany years ago,\u201d although he could not remember the capacity in which he had known the trooper. Not only was the juror\u2019s recollection of the trooper vague and indistinct, the juror stated explicitly that he remained able to evaluate and potentially reject the trooper\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201cWhether to accept the declaration of a juror that he or she is disinterested lies within the broad discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stroyny, </em>435 Mass. 635, 639 (2002). We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>only set aside such determinations in light of clear error, such as \u201csolid evidence of a distinct bias.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>447 Mass. 494, 500 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>445 Mass. 481, 499 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision not to excuse juror no. 16. The juror\u2019s indistinct recollection that, more than a decade prior, a witness likely had been one of his many students, does not establish probable bias.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 488 (2010) (\u201cdeliberating juror\u2019s child . . . awaited [felony] prosecution by the same district attorney\u2019s office prosecuting the defendant\u201d). Accordingly, the tenuous prior acquaintance between the trooper and juror no. 16 did not require that the juror be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The parties did not submit a complete transcript of the first trial.

Further, both juries heard testimony from Bunthorng that he had, under oath, initially identified Em as the one he saw carrying the gun. Had the first jury been aware that they need not be unanimous on whether Em or the defendant fired the gun, see <em>infra, </em>they might have convicted the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Em testified also that he feared that members of the Asian Boyz gang were \u201clooking for [him],\u201d and that he had communicated this information to the defendant, with whom he had a close relationship.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Munoz, 461 Mass 126, 141 n.20 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 686 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The cause of death, a gunshot wound to the head, was not a subject of dispute at trial. Nonetheless, the defendant\u2019s appellate brief suggests that, absent the substitute examiner\u2019s testimony, the defendant would have argued that the victim might have survived had he received prompt medical attention. There was no evidence of an undue or unusual delay in transporting the defendant to the hospital. We cannot discern how the brief time lapse between the shooting and the victim\u2019s arrival at the hospital would have assisted the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 668 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>2 Allen 136, 142 (1861) (\u201cif a person inflicts a wound with a deadly weapon in such manner as to put life in jeopardy, and death follows as a consequence of this felonious and wicked act, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>alter its nature or diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated in producing the fatal result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">In any event, the substitute examiner\u2019s ultimate opinion, that the nature of the defendant\u2019s wound \u201cwould make survival extremely unlikely,\u201d was not only elicited on cross-examination, but was also an ultimate opinion properly admissible even on direct examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Indeed, the issue of juror no. 16\u2019s prior acquaintance with the testifying trooper came to the fore on the fifth day of trial. Subsequently, after deliberations had commenced, the juror initially selected as foreperson had to be excused. Defense counsel and the prosecutor jointly suggested that juror no. 16, then an alternate, take his place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
