L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A (\u00a7 72A), must be held before the Commonwealth may seek an indictment pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54 (\u00a7 54), against a defendant who is alleged to have committed offenses when he was between fourteen and seventeen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>years of age, but was not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday. Because we conclude that the clear language of \u00a7 72A requires that a hearing be held prior to the Commonwealth\u2019s proceeding on an indictment pursuant to \u00a7 54, we affirm the Juvenile Court judge\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>Pursuant to \u00a7 72A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Juvenile Court has jurisdiction over alleged juvenile offenders who are not apprehended until after they have reached the age of eighteen. Section 72A sets forth a two-tiered inquiry for a judge to undertake. First, the judge must determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offenses charged. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porges, </em>460 Mass. 525, 528 (2011). If there has been a finding of probable cause, the judge either may order the defendant discharged, if discharge is consistent with the protection of the public, or dismiss the case, if the public interest requires that the defendant be tried. If a criminal complaint is issued, the case then proceeds in accordance with the ordinary course of criminal proceedings, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 30, and G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, to the criminal session of a District or Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 72A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porges, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Section 54 is the means by which prosecutors may try juveniles, who have committed a certain class of offenses between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years, as youthful offenders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 223 (1999). Where a juvenile \u201chas been proceeded against by indictment,\u201d the Superior Court clerk remits the indictment to the Juvenile Court for trial. G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4. See \u00a7 54; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Prior to 1996, for the Commonwealth to prosecute a juvenile as an adult, it had to request a transfer hearing, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, after which a Juvenile Court judge determined whether the juvenile should be tried as an adult.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the judge determined that the juvenile should be tried as an adult, the case was transferred to be tried in the Superior Court Department or a criminal session of the District Court Department. R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 2.1, at 420 (2d ed. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">By St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 7, the Legislature repealed G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61, and amended \u00a7 54, which was aimed primarily at \u201caddressing] growing concem[s] about violent crimes commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>ted by juveniles,\u201d by creating a youthful offender classification. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dale D., </em>431 Mass. 757, 760 (2000), quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 213 n.8 (1997). See R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.1, at 422-423. The concurrent repeal of \u00a7 61, and amendment of \u00a7 54, allowed prosecutors to \u201cproceed [directly] against a child by indictment in a Juvenile Court if the child [was] considered a \u2018youthful offender,\u2019 \u201d without having to request a transfer after a hearing from a Juvenile Court judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 518 (2001), citing G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 54.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>The Commonwealth alleges, inter alia, that, between the ages of sixteen and seventeen, the defendant committed several crimes including various acts of rape of a child. The defendant was not apprehended until 2008 when he was twenty-six years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">A complaint then issued in the Suffolk County Division of the Juvenile Court Department (Juvenile Court) against the defendant for rape of a child, indecent assault and battery on a child, and threatening to commit a crime. The defendant was subsequently arraigned on the complaints in the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In 2009, while the case was pending, the Commonwealth sought youthful offender indictments against the defendant. The grand jury returned youthful offender indictments charging two counts of vaginal rape of a child as well as oral and digital rape of a child. He was arraigned in the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The defendant moved to dismiss the youthful offender indictments because he had not been afforded a transfer hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, prior to being indicted. The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that, where the offenses were alleged to have been committed prior to his seventeenth birthday and the defendant was not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday, a hearing must be conducted pursuant to \u00a7 72A. The Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the judge erred in dismissing the youthful offender indictments because the defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 72A hearing. As with all matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of statutory construction, we look first to the language of the statute. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983) (\u201cthe primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute\u201d). When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we interpret it according to its \u201cordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775 (2000), citing <em>Victor V </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 793, 794 (1996). \u201cOf course, this meaning must be reasonable and supported by the purpose and history of the statute.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Collector &amp; Treas. of Arlington, </em>422 Mass. 455, 457-458 (1996), citing <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Section 72A, insofar as relevant here, states that, \u201c[i]f a person commits an offense or violation prior to his seventeenth birthday, and is not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday, the court, <em>after a hearing, shall </em>determine whether there is probable cause\u201d (emphasis added). Here, it is undisputed that the defendant satisfies the two conditions that trigger \u00a7 72A, namely, he is alleged to have committed offenses prior to his seventeenth birthday and was not apprehended until he was twenty-six. We conclude that the language, \u201cafter a hearing, shall,\u201d is clear and unambiguous, therefore the judge correctly concluded that the defendant was entitled to a \u00a7 72A hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth argues that \u00a7 72A is inapplicable because the Legislature intended it to apply only to juveniles whom the Commonwealth wishes to charge by criminal complaint, and not by indictment. In support of this contention, the Commonwealth points to the fact that \u00a7 72A only references the dismissal of a \u201cdelinquency complaint\u201d as opposed to dismissal of complaints <em>and </em>indictments in the clause, \u201cthe court shall dismiss the delinquency complaint and cause a criminal complaint to be issued.\u201d According to the Commonwealth, this clause limits the applicability of \u00a7 72A to those cases that are brought by complaint. We disagree. Under the clear language of the statute, once the two conditions that trigger \u00a7 72A are satisfied, \u201ca <em>delinquency complaint shall be filed </em>in the Juvenile Court\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forges, </em>460 Mass. 525, 528 (2011). Because a transfer hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ing would precede any indictment, there is no need for the Legislature to make reference to the dismissal of an indictment. Moreover, \u00a7 72A provides instruction as to the manner in which the case ought to proceed if it is not discharged, that is, \u201caccording to the usual course of criminal proceedings and in accordance with the provisions of [G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 30].\u201d General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 30, states, in relevant part, that the District Court judges \u201cshall commit or bind over for trial in the superior court persons brought before them who appear to be guilty of crimes not within their final jurisdiction.\u201d Therefore we conclude that only after a Juvenile Court judge has determined that a delinquency complaint should be dismissed and a District Court criminal complaint issued may the Commonwealth proceed by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The Commonwealth also argues that \u00a7 54 does not require compliance with \u00a7 72A because \u00a7 54 states, \u201c[t]he court shall proceed on the complaint or the indictment ... in accordance with [\u00a7\u00a7 55-72], inclusive,\u201d thus omitting \u00a7 72A. We do not interpret this language as exempting the Commonwealth from complying with the requirements of \u00a7 72A. Instead, we conclude that the Legislature excluded the class of individuals to whom the provisions of \u00a7 72A apply from those who may be directly indicted under \u00a7 54. See, e.g., <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Illyrian Gardens, Inc., </em>401 Mass. 822, 824 (1988) (by explicitly giving Hampden County division of Housing Court concurrent jurisdiction, Legislature implicitly denied such jurisdiction to other divisions of Housing Court). Because the Legislature has explicitly included individuals to whom \u00a7 72 applies with those who may be subject to indictments pursuant to \u00a7 54, we conclude that the omission of \u00a7 72A is purposeful. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72 <em>(a) </em>(Juvenile Court has jurisdiction over offender apprehended after seventeenth birthday but prior to eighteenth birthday). See also G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72 <em>(b) </em>(Juvenile Court has jurisdiction over person who attains eighteenth birthday pending final adjudication of case).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Section 54 makes no procedural distinction between complaints and indictments. Therefore if we follow the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u201cno transfer hearing under \u00a7 72A is mandated under any part of \u00a7 54, as only \u00a7\u00a7 55-72 needed to be followed to proceed to trial subsequent to the indictment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>youthful offender,\u201d to its logical conclusion, a transfer hearing also would never be necessary where the Commonwealth proceeds by complaint. If \u00a7 54 indeed only requires that a judge follow G. L. c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 55-72 for <em>indictments, </em>thereby obviating the need to comply with \u00a7 72A, then only \u00a7\u00a7 55-72 need to be followed for <em>complaints </em>as \u00a7 54 applies the same procedures for both. Because such an interpretation of \u00a7 54 would render the language of \u00a7 72A superfluous, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>429 Mass. 136, 140 (1998) (\u201cA basic tenet of statutory construction requires that a statute \u2018be construed \u201cso that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In any event, the purpose of \u00a7 72A is, in part, to give the Juvenile Court jurisdiction over cases where a juvenile offender is not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday, and if public interest requires, transfer the case to the Superior Court. If, as the Commonwealth suggests, \u00a7 72A is inapplicable, no court would be able to exercise jurisdiction over an adult such as the defendant, as this case does not fall under \u00a7 72. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 60 (with certain limited exceptions, Juvenile Court only has jurisdiction over cases of juvenile offenders under age seventeen). See also <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 466, 470 (1963) (\u201c[G. L. c. 119] primarily prescribes procedures in juvenile sessions for children under seventeen years of age\u201d). We note that indictments of juveniles between the ages of fourteen and seventeen pursuant to \u00a7 54 are tried in the Juvenile Court, whereas if a Juvenile Court judge determines that an adult defendant should be tried for juvenile offenses pursuant to \u00a7 72A, the case is transferred to the Superior or District Court. It is clear that, where the Legislature intended to vest the Juvenile Court with jurisdiction over adults, it has expressly so provided. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 72 &amp; 72A.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The Commonwealth also would have us infer from the 1996 revisions to G. L. c. 119, that the Legislature intended to eliminate the requirement of a \u00a7 72A transfer hearing. We do not agree. There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 54 to support the inference that it was designed to supersede or repeal \u00a7 72A. See St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>1996, c. 200. \u00a7 13A. Moreover, in 1996, the Legislature rewrote, but did not repeal \u00a7 72A. Had the Legislature intended to eliminate the requirement of a \u00a7 72A transfer hearing, it could have done so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 514 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 512 (1977) (\u201ca statute is not to be deemed to repeal or supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or clear implication\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We also reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the protections afforded to defendants who are properly entitled to \u00a7 72A hearings have already been provided to the defendant through the grand jury proceedings. According to the Commonwealth, because probable cause is determined in grand jury proceedings, the first prong of a \u00a7 72A hearing is satisfied. It also argues that, by placing violent offenses within the purview of \u00a7 54, the Legislature intended to eliminate the second prong of \u00a7 72A, namely, the judicial determination whether it is within the public interest to allow the Commonwealth to proceed with prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">A probable cause determination differs from that made in grand jury proceedings in many respects including that a judge makes the determination, not a grand jury, and a defendant may present a defense and cross-examine witnesses affording significant due process protections not available before a grand jury. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>393 Mass. 523, 533 (1984), citing A <em>Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 104, 107 (1978) (probable cause hearings in juvenile courts serve the same function as those in adult courts); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass. 843, 855-856 (1973) (defendants must be given opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present a defense at probable cause hearing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 416 (2002) (both parties given an opportunity to present evidence at \u00a7 72A transfer hearing). Consequently, a probable cause determination by a grand jury is an insufficient alternative to a clear statutory mandate with markedly different procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Even assuming that a grand jury finding of probable cause satisfied the first prong of \u00a7 72A, nothing in an indictment proceeding satisfies the second prong of \u00a7 72A. The fact that a judge has discretion in fashioning a sentence following a youth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ful offender adjudication is of no consequence. As the Appeals Court pointed out in its comparative analysis of transfer decisions under \u00a7 61 and \u00a7 72A, \u201c[a] \u00a7 72A transfer presents an important, but altogether different inquiry: whether an individual who is alleged to have committed a crime while a juvenile, but who has \u2018aged out\u2019 of the Juvenile Court\u2019s jurisdiction before being apprehended, will be subject to <em>any </em>prosecution <em>at </em>all\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 415. Although \u00a7 54 replaced the transfer procedure in \u00a7 61, the distinction between \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 72A is instructive. Its legislative history makes clear that \u00a7 54 was fashioned as a response to violent offenses committed by juveniles and mandated harsher punishments for those juveniles. Section 72A on the other hand, as discussed, was created to address the circumstance in which a juvenile offender has \u201caged out\u201d of the Juvenile Court\u2019s jurisdiction and, further, grants judicial discretion whether the prosecution may proceed altogether. The text and legislative history of \u00a7 54 do not demonstrate any clear or deliberate attempt to address the unique problem of \u201caging out\u201d of Juvenile Court jurisdiction. Therefore, we conclude that grand jury proceedings are not an adequate substitute for a \u00a7 72A transfer hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the judge did not err in dismissing the youthful offender indictments where the defendant was alleged to have committed offenses between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, was apprehended after his eighteenth birthday, but was not afforded a \u00a7 72A hearing. We remand the matter to the Juvenile Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 72A, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201cIf a person commits an offense or violation prior to Ms seventeenth birthday, and is not apprehended until after Ms eighteenth birthday, the court, after a hearing, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that said person committed the offense charged, and shall, in its discretion, either order that the person be discharged, if satisfied that such discharge is consistent with the protection of the public; or, if the court is of the opinion that the interests of the public require that such person be tried for such offense or violation instead of being discharged, the court shall dismiss the delinquency complaint and cause a criminal complaint to be issued.
