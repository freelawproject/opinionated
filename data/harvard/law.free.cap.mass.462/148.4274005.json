We consider the city\u2019s appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we transferred from the Appeals Court on our own motion, from the denial of its motion for summary judgment, based on the ground that it was immune from suit pursuant to the recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. The city argues that the judge erred in denying its motion, and that it is entitled to immediate appellate review of the denial under the doctrine of present execution. Although we hold that the doctrine does not apply in the circumstances of this case, we nonetheless consider the merits of the city\u2019s appeal, and conclude the denial of its motion for summary judgment was appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>In the summer of 2007, Marcus participated in a softball league organized by an organization called \u201cCoed Jewish Sports.\u201d Marcus joined the league after mailing an application and an eighty dollar registration fee to the organization. Payment of the registration fee entitled Marcus to participate in the league, receive a team T-shirt, and attend a cookout hosted by the league at the end of the season.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">A payment of $1,200 by Coed Jewish Sports to the city\u2019s parks and recreation department secured the league a permit. The permit in turn reserved for the league the use of McGrath Field, a property owned and maintained by the city, for eight two-hour blocks between June and August, 2007. Marcus had no knowledge of or participation in the permit application process undertaken by Coed Jewish Sports, and never applied directly to the city for any such permit. According to the city, the $1,200 payment was used to defray approximately $12,000 in annual maintenance and administrative costs that it incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>in operating McGrath Field in 2007, including grass cutting and trimming, fertilization, and aeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On July 8, 2007, while participating in a league game, Marcus was sitting in a grassy area watching the game and waiting for his turn at bat. The area was shaded by several nearby trees, which stood on adjacent property owned by Temple Shalom. Marcus heard a cracking sound and realized that a tree was falling in his direction. He was unable to avoid the falling tree, which struck him in the back. Marcus suffered two fractured vertebrae, shattered right and left shoulder blades, and various other injuries as a result of the tree\u2019s impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">b. <em>Procedural history. </em>Marcus filed his complaint in the Superior Court against the city and the other defendants (see note 1, supra) on July 2, 2009. With regard to the city, he alleged that it had a duty to maintain McGrath Field in a careful, safe, and prudent manner; it was negligent in poorly maintaining the property and, specifically, allowing the allegedly rotten tree and its branches to overhang its property without proper maintenance; and as a result of the city\u2019s negligence, he suffered serious physical injuries. In its answer, the city denied liability and asserted that, in any event, it was immune from liability under the recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. On June 15, 2010, the city filed its motion for summary judgment in which it presented, among other things, its claim of immunity from suit pursuant to G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge denied the city\u2019s motion on the ground that there remained genuine issues of material fact. Its appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">c. <em>Recreational use statute. </em>The recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C (\u00a7 17C), provides that any person<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201chaving an interest in land . . . who lawfully permits the public to use such land for recreational, conservation, scientific, educational, environmental, ecological, research, religious, or charitable purposes without imposing a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>or fee therefor . . . shall not be liable for personal injuries or property damage sustained by such members of the public . . . while on said land in the absence of wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct by such person. Such permission shall not confer upon any member of the public using said land, including without limitation a minor, the status of an invitee or licensee to whom any duty would be owed by said person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00a7 17C (a). The statute further provides that \u201c[t]he liability of any person who imposes a charge or fee for the use of his land by the public for [any of the above enumerated] purposes . . . shall not be limited by any provision of this section.\u201d \u00a7 17C <em>(b). </em>Section 17C applies with equal force to governmental and private landowners. See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass. 233, 237 n.7 (2004); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>406 Mass. 632, 634 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The city contends that the doctrine of present execution entitles it to immediate review of the interlocutory order denying its motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The premise underlying its claim is that \u00a7 17C provides a landowner in its position with immunity from suit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">a. <em>Doctrine of present execution. </em>As a general matter, \u201cthere is no right to appeal from an interlocutory order unless a statute or mle authorizes it.\u201d <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>403 Mass. 592, 597 (1988). \u201cThe policy underlying this mle is that \u2018a party ought not to have the power to interrupt the progress of the litigation by piecemeal appeals that cause delay and often waste judicial effort in deciding questions that will turn out to be unimportant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 521 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004), quoting <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779 (1979). However, a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to this general mle lies in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>doctrine of present execution, under which an immediate appeal is appropriate \u201c[1] where the interlocutory ruling \u2018will interfere with rights in a way that cannot be remedied on appeal\u2019 from the final judgment, and [2] where the matter is \u2018collateral\u2019 to the merits of the controversy.\u201d <em>Elles </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Quincy, </em>450 Mass. 671, 674 (2008), quoting <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Ricker, supra </em>at 597-600. See, e.g., <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 520-522 (interlocutory appellate review appropriate to consider denial of motion to dismiss filed pursuant to \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H); <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 688 (1999) (interlocutory appellate review appropriate to consider Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss based on claim of immunity from suit pursuant to Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Under this rule, litigants claiming immunity may only avail themselves of the doctrine of present execution if \u00a7 17C provides immunity from suit, rather than merely an exemption from liability for ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 31 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988). This result obtains because, \u201c[i]f ... the asserted right is one of freedom from suit, the defendant\u2019s right will be lost forever unless that right is determined now,\u201d whereas \u201cif the asserted right to immunity is but a right to freedom from liability . . . [the defendant\u2019s] right could be vindicated fully on appeal after trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. at 688 (only orders denying immunity from suit enjoy benefit of present execution doctrine, because \u201c[t]he right to immunity from suit would be \u2018lost forever\u2019 if an order denying it were not appeal-able until the close of litigation . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The city\u2019s motion for summary judgment asserted a claim of immunity from suit, but in other pleadings, the city claimed immunity from liability. The city has a right to interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>appeal only if \u00a7 17C provides immunity from suit, rather than merely an exemption from liability for ordinary negligence. In evaluating whether \u00a7 17C provides immunity from suit or merely an exemption from liability, we first examine the plain language of the statute. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). Section 17C provides that a landowner making land open to the public for recreational uses free of charge \u201cshall not be <em>liable </em>for personal injuries or property damage sustained by such members of the public [unless there is wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct]\u201d (emphasis added). In other words, where the landowner does not impose a fee or charge, \u00a7 17C merely provides an exemption from liability for ordinary negligence claims; it does not provide immunity from suit. Even if a landowner can claim the full scope of immunity available under the statute, that landowner will still be liable for \u201cwilful, wanton, or reckless conduct,\u201d and thus is not immune from suit. See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>(a). </em>We need go no further than the plain text of \u00a7 17C to conclude that the statute provides only immunity from liability. Thus, the city is not entitled to an interlocutory appeal from the denial of its motion for summary judgment under the doctrine of present execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">b. <em>Exemption from liability for negligence under \u00a7 17C. </em>Nevertheless, we address the city\u2019s claim that in the circumstances of this case, it qualified for \u00a7 17C\u2019s exemption from liability for ordinary negligence as a matter of law, and that, therefore, its motion for summary judgment should have been granted. We choose to do so because the claim has been briefed fully by the parties, it raises a significant issue concerning the proper interpretation of the recreational use statute, and addressing it would be in the public interest. See, e.g., <em>Boxford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>458 Mass. 596, 601 n.13 (2010), citing <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">i. <em>Payment of fee. </em>The city asserts it must be exempt from negligence liability because Marcus himself paid no admission fee or other charge to the city in exchange for playing softball on McGrath Field.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of the claim, the city points to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>decision of this court and one of the Appeals Court where the plaintiffs had not paid entrance or admission fees to gain access to public recreational facilities, although some kind of registration fee was paid to the public landowner in connection with the sports activities the plaintiffs had come to watch. See <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84, 85-86 (1997) <em>(Seich); Whooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910 (2003) <em>(Whooley). </em>These cases are very different on their facts from the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The statute, by its terms, focuses on whether the landowner \u201clawfully permits the public to use such land for recreational . . . purposes without imposing a charge or fee therefor.\u201d \u00a7 17C (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, the issue is whether the landowner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>charges a fee for the particular use to which the plaintiff puts the land. More specifically, and contrary to the city\u2019s apparent reading, \u00a7 17C does <em>not </em>provide an exemption from liability for ordinary negligence if the landowner imposes a charge or fee for a particular use of recreational land, but the user does not personally or directly pay the charge to the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">For present purposes, the salient point in <em>Seich, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Whooley, supra, </em>is that the landowners permitted members of the public to use the recreational facilities at issue to attend and watch youth athletic games free of charge, and the plaintiffs in both cases were, in fact, using the facilities in question in such a manner at the time each was injured: each had entered, free of charge, the particular facility (gymnasium or hockey rink) to watch a child (daughter or grandson) play in a game. That a payment was made in each case to the landowner to enable the child to participate in the game had no bearing on each injured plaintiff\u2019s own recreational use of the property in question, for which there was no charge. See <em>Seich, </em>426 Mass. at 86; <em>Whooley, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 910. Here, in contrast, Marcus paid Coed Jewish Sports to be able to play in softball games on a field owned by the city, Coed Jewish Sports in turn paid a fee charged by the city in order to reserve the field for the softball games,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Marcus was injured while he was participating as a player in one such game on the field. That Marcus did not pay directly to the city its permit fee to reserve McGrath Field is not material. What matters is that the city imposed this fee or charge for the exclusive use of the field during the reserved blocks of time; Coed Jewish Sports paid the fee on behalf of its league players, including Marcus; and he was injured while playing a game on the field during one of the reserved blocks of time. In the circumstances, Marcus was not participating in a recreational use of the city\u2019s property free of charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ii. <em>Purpose of payment. </em>Finally, the city urges that because its charge to the league was not a \u201cfee,\u201d but instead \u201crepresents administrative and operational costs,\u201d it is not divested of the exemption from liability for ordinary negligence under \u00a7 17C <em>(a). </em>The city reads <em>Seich, </em>426 Mass. at 86, and the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 561-562 (2009) <em>(Dunn), </em>to mean that if, as the city claims to be an undisputed fact, the monies paid by Coed Jewish Sports were used by the city merely to cover a portion of the operating and administrative costs associated with maintaining McGrath Field,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the city\u2019s exemption from negligence liability under \u00a7 17C remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We disagree. The <em>Seich </em>and <em>Dunn </em>cases signify that when a landowner imposes a charge intended solely to reimburse it for marginal costs directly attributable to a specific user\u2019s recreational use of the property, the landowner remains exempt from ordinary negligence claims under \u00a7 17C. See <em>Seich, supra </em>(concluding that portion of town\u2019s youth basketball league registration fee that was used to pay custodians to keep gymnasium open for league games after regular hours \u201cis not the equivalent of the town imposing a fee for the use of its land for recreational purposes\u201d); <em>Dunn, supra </em>(where organization holding event on City Hall Plaza under one-time entertainment license paid city for security and janitorial services associated with event, payment \u201cproperly categorized as a reimbursement, rather than a \u2018charge or fee\u2019 within the meaning of [\u00a7 17C]\u201d; city therefore retained exemption from negligence liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">On the record before us, the city has not established that the payment at issue is the type of reimbursement contemplated by <em>Seich, supra, </em>and <em>Dunn, supra. </em>We take as undisputed that the city dedicated the $1,200 received from Coed Jewish Sports to the upkeep of McGrath Field \u2014 that is, the payment became part of the $12,105.85 the city spent in 2007 for the various purposes listed in note 11, <em>supra. </em>But the fact that the city used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the permit fee received for general field upkeep is insufficient in itself to shield the city from ordinary negligence liability under \u00a7 17C (a). In other words, there is no evidence in the summary judgment record to support the conclusion that the payment from Coed Jewish Sports was used to reimburse the city for marginal costs that it would not have incurred but for the league\u2019s particular use of McGrath Field during the summer of 2007. Consequently, summary judgment was properly denied on the city\u2019s claim that it was exempt from negligence liability as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, the city\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion for summary judgment is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">There are other defendants that are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association and the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The statute defines \u201cperson\u201d broadly to include \u201cany governmental body, agency or instrumentality, a nonprofit corporation, trust, association, corporation, company or other business organization and any director, officer, trustee, member, employee, authorized volunteer or agent thereof.\u201d G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Although the city did not address the doctrine of present execution in its initial brief to the Appeals Court, Marcus argued that the city was not entitled to immediate appellate review under the doctrine. In our order transferring the appeal from the Appeals Court to this court, we requested that the parties submit supplemental briefs on the issue whether G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, \u201cwhere applicable, provides an immunity from suit (as opposed to exemption from liability) such that the denial of a defendant\u2019s [dispositive motion] on the basis of the statute is immediately appealable under the doctrine of present execution.\u201d The city then filed its supplemental brief arguing that it is entitled to immediate appellate review under the doctrine, and Marcus filed a supplemental brief taking the opposite position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We previously have allowed an interlocutory appeal from a denial of a motion for summary judgment based on government immunity from suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). See <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>408 Mass. 621, 624 (1990). As a consequence, there is no merit to Marcus\u2019s claim that the city has essentially waived its right to appeal pursuant to the doctrine of present execution by not filing a motion to dismiss. We have never required this doctrine to be asserted at the earliest possible stage of litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">There is no dispute that the city owns the land in question and that the plaintiff was engaged in a \u201crecreational\u201d activity as contemplated by the recreational use statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84 (1997) <em>(Seich), </em>the plaintiffs were the parents of a child who was participating in a basketball league organized by the town\u2019s recreation department. The parents had paid a sixty-five dollar registration fee to the town in order for their daughter to participate; the fee covered the basketball league\u2019s incidental costs. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 85 &amp; n.3. In the plaintiffs\u2019 suit for damages relating to injuries sustained by the mother while she was watching her daughter\u2019s basketball game, this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the town, concluding that the town was entitled as a matter of law to the exemption from negligence liability under \u00a7 17C. <em>Id. </em>at 86. We reasoned that the registration fee was a charge for participation in the basketball league itself, not for use of the school\u2019s gymnasium, <em>id. </em>at 85, and the town charged no admission fee for the plaintiffs to be spectators at the game. <em>Id. We </em>quoted with approval the observation of the motion judge that \u201c[wjhether or not the plaintiffs ever went to the school to watch their daughter, they still had to pay a fee for her to register with the basketball team. On the other hand, even if the plaintiffs did not register their daughter to play on the team, the plaintiffs, along with any other member of the public, could have gone to the school and observed the basketball game without paying a fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In <em>Whooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 909 (2003), the plaintiff went to an ice hockey rink owned by the Commonwealth to watch her grandson play ice hockey. She was injured in a fall on her way to the bleachers. <em>Id. </em>at 909. She claimed that the youth hockey league in which her grandson participated had paid a fee to use the rink, <em>id. </em>at 910, but she did not pay any fee to be a spectator. Following <em>Seich, </em>the Appeals Court concluded that the plaintiff was a spectator who, like any other member of the public, could enter the rink facility free of charge and watch any hockey game being played, and that in those circumstances, the town could claim exemption from negligence liability under G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. <em>Whooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The same focus is evident in G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>{b), </em>which provides in its first sentence that \u201c[t]he liability of any person who imposes a charge or fee for the use of his land by the public for the purposes described in [G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C (a),] shall not be limited by any provision of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We discuss later in part 2.b.ii, <em>infra, </em>another aspect of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Seich, </em>426 Mass. at 86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The city disputed this at oral argument, describing the payment by Coed Jewish Sports as an unenforced \u201cconvenience\u201d rather than as a confirmed reservation of the field. This is contrary to the affidavit of a city parks and recreation department employee, which stated that the fee paid by Coed Jewish Sports \u201callowed the league to reserve McGrath Field.\u201d At the least, these conflicting statements are enough to create a genuine issue of material fact, making the case inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In his affidavit, the employee averred that the $1,200 fee from the league was used to \u201cdefray\u201d part of the $12,105.85 in costs incurred by the city for operating McGrath Field in 2007, including $256.96 in administrative costs and $11,848.89 in maintenance costs. Maintenance costs included grass cutting and trimming, fertilization, aeration, seed slicing, and irrigation repairs. Administrative costs included the time spent processing permit requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Although the city is not entitled to summary judgment, presumably it may attempt to prove at trial that the fee was used solely as reimbursement for marginal costs directly attributable to the league\u2019s particular use of McGrath Field; if it did so successfully, the exemption from liability for negligence would apply. The city did admit at oral argument, however, that the money is not used \u201cexclusively for the benefit of the league.\u201d Additional discovery may be needed on this issue. However, as explained in the text, showing only that the city budgeted the entirety of the fee paid by Coed Jewish Sports for administrative and maintenance costs associated with McGrath Field\u2019s general upkeep will not allow the city to claim exemption from negligence liability under G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
