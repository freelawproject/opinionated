Count I of the complaint alleged breach of contract,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Count II alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A. Safety filed an answer denying the allegations and raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>numerous affirmative defenses. On October 23, 2008, after extensive discovery, Boazova filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the ground that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to Count I and, therefore, she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that count. Safety filed a cross motion for summary judgment as to both counts of the complaint. After a hearing, a judge denied Boa-zova\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, granted Safety\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment, and ordered that the complaint be dismissed. Judgment entered for Safety on November 25, 2008. Boazova appealed. A divided panel of the Appeals Court affirmed, <em>Boazova </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 438 (2010), and we granted Boazova\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed facts contained in the summary judgment record, reserving some facts for later discussion in conjunction with specific issues. On June 26, 2001, Boazova purchased a house in Arlington that had been constructed in 1947. It is a two-story, wood-framed, single-family structure built against the side of a hill and supported by a concrete foundation, with a full basement and garage below the house. Around 1958, a concrete patio was built along the rear wall of the house at a grade that was higher than the home\u2019s foundation. Subsequently, a cement \u201ccant\u201d (an angular raised area) was installed along the edge of the patio to direct water away from the house. However, there was no waterproofing barrier or membrane between the patio and the rear wall of the house to prevent water from entering the structure\u2019s wooden frame. Approximately fifteen to twenty years ago, the house was covered with vinyl siding that extends down to the surface of the patio.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">At the time she bought the house, Boazova also purchased a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy from Safety. The policy period relevant to these proceedings was from June 26, 2005, to June 26, 2006. At sometime prior to August 1, 2005, Safety modified the terms of the policy by means of an indorsement entitled \u201cLimited Fungi, Wet or Dry Rot, or Bacteria Coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On August 1, 2005, while renovating the kitchen of Boazova\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>house, a contractor discovered severe deterioration of the wooden sill plate that rested on top of the concrete foundation at the base of the home\u2019s rear wall, as well as of the adjoining floor joists and wall studs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Boazova described the area as \u201cmoist and falling apart\u201d and stated that the floor underneath the bottom kitchen cabinets was \u201cspongy and mushy.\u201d She reported the damage to Sanviti Insurance Agency, Inc., which, in turn, prepared a property loss notice that was forwarded to Safety. Safety assigned Craig Gillespie, a claims adjuster, to investigate Boazova\u2019s claim. On August 18, 2005, he visited Boazova\u2019s property and observed the deteriorated area.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Shortly thereafter, Gillespie retained the services of Robert G. Wilkin, a professional engineer associated with CBI Consulting, Inc., to conduct a full inspection and evaluation of the damage to Boazova\u2019s house. Wilkin met with Boazova, viewed the claimed damage, and prepared a written report for Safety detailing his observations and opinions. In his report, Wilkin concluded that \u201cthe cause of the deterioration of the wood sill below the rear wall [was] the placement of the concrete patio slab adjacent to the wall and above the sill. . . . The concrete enclosed the sill between the plaster ceiling and the patio concrete so that water seeping onto the top of the foundation could not dry and the sill rotted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">By letter dated October 19, 2005, Safety denied insurance coverage to Boazova. In the letter, Gillespie stated that Boazova had \u201cinformed [Safety] that ground and/or surface water entered [her] sill and rear wall due to installation of a pavement patio prior to [her] owning the residence.\u201d Relying on an exclusion in her homeowner\u2019s policy that states that Safety \u201cdo[es] not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by[:] Water Dam-\" age,\u201d Gillespie informed Boazova that because \u201cthe water entered [her] home through the rear wall of [her] dwelling and the sill area,\u201d the damage was not covered under her policy. Subsequently, Gillespie reinspected Boazova\u2019s house. By letter dated May 2, 2006, he reaffirmed Safety\u2019s denial of her claim because the damage (1) was caused by a combination of surface water, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>deterioration, settling, and improper construction of the concrete patio; and (2) was not encompassed within the indorsement, which provides $10,000 in coverage for fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria, where the loss was not the result of a peril insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Boazova proceeded to hire John W. Mroszczyk, a professional engineer, to inspect her house, which he did on August 28, 2006. In his written report, Mroszczyk stated that \u201c[bjecause of the concrete patio, the sill plate and about 10 to 12 inches of the exterior were below grade. This permitted moisture to migrate down to the foundation.\u201d It was his professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, that \u201c[t]he cause of the rotted sill plate, wall studs, and floor joists [was] the concrete patio that was poured directly against the house. This permitted moisture to migrate to the top of the foundation, rotting the clapboard siding, the lx exterior, and eventually the sill plate, floor joists, and wall studs.\u201d Mroszczyk further opined that \u201c[t]he collapse in the outer part of the floor joists, due to the rot, eventually would have resulted in a complete failure of the floor system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The present action ensued. In his memorandum of decision and order dated November 21, 2008, denying Boazova\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting Safety\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment, the judge found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and concluded that Safety\u2019s denial of coverage for the claimed loss was proper, as a matter of law, based on the terms of Boazova\u2019s policy. First, the judge stated that because \u201cthe rotted wood on Boazova\u2019s property as described by numerous experts constitute[d] wet and/or dry rot,\u201d the indorsement that specifically provided limited coverage for loss caused by fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria must serve as the basis for her claim. Next, the judge stated that even if the language of the policy were construed in favor of Boa-zova such that coverage applied to fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria resulting from a peril insured against, namely hidden seepage or leakage of water, Boazova still would need to prove that the damage occurred during the policy period. This, the judge concluded, she could not do. According to the judge, it was \u201cundisputed that the water emanated from the outside and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>seeped or leaked in through the gap between the concrete patio and the rear wall of the house. The inspectors report[ed] that it was this gap and the placement of the patio, built sometime before Boazova purchased the property, that ultimately caused the damage.\u201d The judge stated that because the patio, in its present state, was in existence prior to the time that Boazova purchased the house in 2001, she was unable to satisfy her burden of proving that the \u201chidden seepage\u201d provision covered this particular damage. Finally, the judge continued, even if Boazova had met her burden of establishing coverage, Safety had adequately shown that the specific policy exclusion for loss caused by surface water, irrespective of any other cause or event, precluded recovery for an otherwise covered claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002); <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). We review a decision to grant summary judgment de novo. See <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 215 (2003). \u201cIn a case like this one where both parties have moved for summary judgment, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment [has entered].\u201d <em>Albahari </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brewster, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 248 n.4 (2010). See <em>DiLiddo </em>v. <em>Oxford St. Realty, Inc., </em>450 Mass. 66, 70 (2007). A party seeking summary judgment may satisfy its burden of demonstrating the absence of triable issues, see <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989), by showing that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of its case. See <em>Kourouva-cilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The proper interpretation of an insurance policy is a matter of law to be decided by a court, not a jury. See <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). Like all contracts, if the language of an insurance policy is unambiguous, then we construe the words \u201cin their usual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998), quoting <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 280 (1997). Where the policy language is ambiguous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cdoubts as to the intended meaning of the words must be resolved against the insurance company that employed them and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 239, 243 (1959). \u201cThis rule of construction applies with particular force to exclusionary provisions.\u201d <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at 282. \u201cHowever, an ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between the parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 466 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">An insured bears the initial burden of proving that the claimed loss falls within the coverage of the insurance policy. See <em>Markline Co. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 139, 140 (1981); <em>Tumblin </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 318, 320 (1962). Once the insured does this, the burden then shifts to the insurer to show that a separate exclusion to coverage is applicable to the particular circumstances of the case. See <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Talhouni, </em>413 Mass. 781, 785 (1992); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 557, 563 (1943); <em>Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321 (1991). Finally, where the insured seeks to establish coverage through an exception contained within an exclusion to coverage, the burden shifts back to the insured to prove coverage for the claimed loss. See <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox, Inc., </em>424 Mass. 226, 230-231 (1997); <em>Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wynn, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 824, 826 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The thrust of Boazova\u2019s argument is that the judge erred in determining that she had failed to meet her burden of establishing coverage under the policy and that Safety, by contrast, had satisfied its burden of proving that her loss was specifically excluded from coverage. In Boazova\u2019s view, her loss was caused by hidden seepage of water, which, she contends, is one of the covered perils insured against enumerated in Safety\u2019s \u201call risk\u201d insurance policy. Further, she continues, because it was hidden seepage, not surface water, that caused the damage to her house, the so-called \u201canticoncurrent cause\u201d provision in the exclusions portion of her policy is inapplicable. Accordingly, Boazova contends that her homeowner\u2019s policy provided coverage for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>loss. Although the language of the policy and the indorsement is challenging to even the most careful reader because of the way it connects various coverages, exclusions, and exceptions, we conclude that Boazova\u2019s claimed loss \u2014 the deterioration and rotting of the wooden sill plate, adjoining floor joists, and wall studs \u2014 is excluded from coverage by unambiguous provisions in the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We set forth in some detail the specific language of Boazova\u2019s policy that guides our analysis. As to the initial matter of coverage, the relevant section of Boazova\u2019s policy, which was modified by the indorsement, and which we shall refer to as the \u201chidden seepage\u201d provision, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 PERILS INSURED AGAINST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cCOVERAGE A \u2014 DWELLING and COVERAGE B \u2014 OTHER STRUCTURES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201cWe insure against risk of direct loss to property described in Coverages A and B only if that loss is a physical loss to property. We do <em>not </em>insure, however, for loss: . . . <em>Caused by: </em>... . (e) Any of the following: ... (9) Constant or repeated seepage or leakage of water or the presence or condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor, over a period of weeks, months or years <em>unless such seepage or leakage of water </em>or the presence or condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor and the resulting damage <em>is unknown </em>to all \u2018insureds\u2019 <em>and is hidden </em>within the walls or ceilings or beneath the floors or above the ceilings of a structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201c3. Excluded under Section I \u2014 Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201cUnder items 1. and 2., <em>any ensuing loss to property </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>described in Coverages A and B <em>not excluded or excepted in this policy is </em>covered.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Boazova\u2019s expert, Mroszczyk, and Safety\u2019s expert, Wilkin, agreed that Boazova\u2019s claimed loss was caused by the repeated seepage or leakage of water from her concrete patio down onto the top of her home\u2019s foundation, and that such damage had been hidden from Boazova\u2019s view until she started to renovate her kitchen. In his written report dated September 13, 2006, Mroszczyk opined that the placement of the concrete patio \u201cpermitted moisture to migrate to the top of the foundation, rotting the clapboard siding, the lx exterior, and eventually the sill plate, floor joists, and wall studs.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[t]he current situation is the result of rot and deterioration over an extended period of time,\u201d that \u201c[t]he rot and deterioration was hidden,\u201d and that, \u201c[wjere it not for the water, the structure would still be intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In his written report dated September 2, 2005, Wilkin opined that \u201cwater seeping onto the top of the foundation could not dry and the sill rotted,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he condition of the sill was hidden from view.\u201d During his deposition testimony on November 3, 2007, Wilkin further explained his opinion by stating that \u201cinstead of putting in a waterproofing barrier or membrane of some type to keep water from the patio side of the exterior of the building from entering through the wood framing and landing on the sill and rotting ... the wood at the top of the foundation wall, the water that landed ... on the patio would run against the building . . . and seep through the joints in the patio onto the wood framing that was below grade and wet the framing.\u201d Wilkin also testified that the process that resulted in the deterioration of the sill was \u201c[pjretty much continuous\u201d; that it had occurred over a period of weeks, months, or years; and that the damage was not visible prior to any dismantling of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Based on the expert opinions of Mroszczyk and Wilkin, it would appear that Boazova\u2019s claimed loss was caused by one of the policy\u2019s enumerated perils insured against, namely unknown and hidden seepage of water and, accordingly, would be insured. However, our analysis does not end there because, under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>section of the policy, such loss is covered <em>only </em>to the extent \u201cnot excluded or excepted in this policy.\u201d We therefore must consider next whether Boazova\u2019s claimed loss was excluded or excepted in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The relevant section of Boazova\u2019s policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c1. We do not insure for loss <em>caused directly or indirectly </em>by any of the following. Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss. . . . c. Water Damage, meaning: (1) Flood, <em>surface water, </em>waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind . . . .\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The term \u201csurface water\u201d is not defined in the policy. However, we have described it as \u201cwaters from rain, melting snow, springs, or seepage, or floods that lie or flow on the surface of the earth and naturally spread over the ground but do not form a part of a natural watercourse or lake.\u201d <em>DeSanctis </em>v. <em>Lynn Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>423 Mass. 112, 115 n.6 (1996). See 5 J.A. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 3145, at 463 (1970) (\u201c \u2018surface water\u2019 is water which is derived from falling rain or melting snow, or which rises to the surface in springs, and is diffused over the surface of the ground, while it remains in such diffused state, and which follows no defined course or channel, which does not gather into or form a natural body of water, and which is lost by evaporation, percolation, or natural drainage\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 846 comment b, at 199 (1979) (\u201cThe term \u2018surface water\u2019 is used to describe water that occasionally accumulates from natural sources and that has not yet evaporated, percolated into the earth or found its way into a stream or lake\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Both of the experts described the origin of the seeping water and how it likely infiltrated Boazova\u2019s house. Mroszczyk opined in his written report that the manner in which the concrete patio was added to the house \u201cpermitted moisture to migrate to the top of the foundation, rotting the clapboard siding, the lx exterior, and eventually the sill plate, floor joists, and wall studs.\u201d Wilkin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>agreed, in even more specific terms, with Mroszczyk\u2019s assessment of the cause of Boazova\u2019s loss. In an affidavit dated August 4, 2008, Wilkin opined that \u201cthe rotting of the wooden sill and other wooden framing elements of the rear wall of the Insured Property was the result of a moist or wet condition caused by surface water in the form of rain or snow falling onto the concrete patio at the rear of the house, running along the surface of the concrete patio to the rear wall of the house, and then running down into gaps and joints in the patio onto the wood framing of the rear wall which was below the grade of the concrete patio.\u201d Boazova has not challenged this opinion from Wilkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">There was no evidence that water seeped into the walls or beneath the floor of Boazova\u2019s kitchen from an internal source, such as a broken pipe. To the contrary, during her deposition testimony on May 8, 2008, Boazova stated that when her contractor opened the wall during the renovation process, he did not find any leaking pipes. Given that the patio was higher than the grade of the house\u2019s foundation, the water that accumulated thereon simply flowed along the patio and seeped into Boazova\u2019s house. The mere migration of water from the patio into the wooden sill, floor joists, and wall studs did not change its essential character as \u201csurface water.\u201d See <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>USAA Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>733 A.2d 965, 969-971 (D.C. 1999) (water from melting snow that had collected on outdoor patio, which flowed naturally down stairs and into homeowners\u2019 basement, did not lose character as surface water); <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>American Nat\u2019l Gen. Ins. Co., </em>211 S.W.3d 928, 936 (Tex. Ct. App. 2007) (ordinary meaning of \u201csurface water\u201d in homeowners\u2019 insurance policy reasonably included rain water that collected on surface of raised patio and flowed into house). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Union Auto. Indem. Co., </em>323 Ill. App. 3d 741, 748 (2001) (given highly developed state of society\u2019s infrastructure, \u201caverage reasonable person would not limit surface water to water whose flow has not been altered in any way by paved surfaces, buildings, or other structures\u201d); <em>State ex rel. State Fire &amp; Tornado Fund of the N.D. Ins. Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>North Dakota State Univ., </em>694 N.W.2d 225, 233 (N.D. 2005) (rain water did not lose character as surface water simply by being diverted underground through steam tunnel). Contrast <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Exch., </em>800 P.2d 1006, 1009 (Colo. 1990) (runoff from melted snow lost character as surface water when diverted by man-made trenches because trenches were \u201cdefined channels\u201d that prevented \u201cpercolation, evaporation, or natural drainage\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that Boazova\u2019s claimed loss was caused, either directly or indirectly, by <em>surface water </em>that seeped or leaked into the wooden frame of her house. As such, under the explicit terms of the policy, her loss is excluded from insurance coverage. Had the seeping water originally come from within Boazova\u2019s house, it would not have been \u201csurface water\u201d and, therefore, would not have been excluded from coverage under that policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Boazova\u2019s attempt to differentiate \u201chidden seepage\u201d from \u201csurface water\u201d in order to obtain insurance coverage is unavailing because, even if we were to view these terms differently, which we do not in the circumstances presented here, coverage still would be precluded. The language at the beginning of the exclusions section of the policy, stating that \u201c[s]uch loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss,\u201d is known as an \u201canticoncurrent cause\u201d provision. This provision entirely bars insurance coverage where a claimed loss is caused by a combination of covered and excluded perils, and we have upheld the inclusion of such language in an insurance policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Alton </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 611, 613-615 (1993) (recognizing that anticoncurrent cause provision entirely barred coverage where excluded peril directly or indirectly caused loss, even though contributing cause of loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>may have been covered peril); <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 30-31 (1993) (suggesting anticoncurrent cause provision in general exclusions would operate to foreclose coverage notwithstanding insured\u2019s claim that covered peril was efficient proximate cause of loss).

App. Ct. 341, 346-347 (2007) (where exclusion did not include anticoncurrent cause provision, damage to property caused by both covered and excluded perils was covered by policy). An anticoncurrent cause provision in an insurance policy does not create an ambiguity and, therefore, will be given effect according to its express terms. See <em>Alton </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., supra. </em>See generally <em>Beacon Hill Civic Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 320-321 (1996) (principles governing freedom of contract dictate that express terms of contract be enforced unless contrary to public policy). Our jurisprudence has never suggested, and neither party has argued, that denying enforcement of an anti-concurrent cause provision in a homeowners\u2019 insurance policy is necessary to protect some aspect of the public welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We add that the \u201cvast majority of [Sjtates\u201d that have considered the matter have upheld and applied anticoncurrent cause provisions when construing the language of insurance policies. <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Meggison, supra, </em>quoting Pate, Recent Developments in Property Insurance Law, 33 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 659, 663 (1998). See, e.g., <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>499 F.3d 419, 429-431 (5th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1310 (2008) (anticoncurrent cause provision unambiguous and enforceable to exclude coverage where residence was destroyed by combination of covered peril [hurricane winds] and excluded peril [flooding]); <em>Front Row Theatre, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Cos., </em>18 F.3d 1343, 1347-1349 (6th Cir. 1994) (anticoncurrent cause provision that explicitly excluded coverage for flood damage relieved insurer from liability where flooding was contributing cause of damage); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Cooper </em>v. <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>184 F. Supp. 2d 960, 962 (D. Ariz. 2002) (in light of anticoncurrent cause provision, insured could not recover for loss caused by mold, which was expressly excluded from coverage, even though covered water event also may have contributed to loss); <em>Assurance Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>Jay-Mar, Inc., </em>38 F. Supp. 2d 349, 352-354 (D.N.J. 1999) (insurance policy language excluding from coverage losses caused by excluded peril acting concurrently or sequentially with included peril did not violate public policy); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Bongen, </em>925 P.2d 1042, 1045 (Alaska 1996) (insurer may expressly preclude coverage when damage to insured\u2019s property is caused by both covered and excluded risks); <em>Pakmark Corp. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>943 S.W.2d 256, 262 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997) (anticoncurrent cause provision excluded coverage for damage caused by combination of flooding [excluded peril] and sewage backup); <em>South Carolina Farm Bur. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>380 S.C. 506, 510-513 (2009) (anticoncurrent cause provision and policy exclusion for underground water pressure damage precluded coverage for damage to insureds\u2019 swimming pool). See generally Phillips, Concurrent Causation Versus Efficient Proximate Cause in First-Party Property Insurance Coverage Analysis, 36 Brief 32, 35-39 (2007) (surveying fifty States on causation analysis in first-party property insurance matters).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We recognize that when construing insurance policy language, it is appropriate \u201cto consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993), quoting <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). However, an insured cannot prevail simply by claiming an expectation of coverage, because most insureds typically expect that all of their losses will be covered. In the circumstances presented here, Boazova satisfied her initial burden of proving that her claimed loss \u2014 the deterioration and rotting of the wooden sill plate, adjoining floor joists, and wall studs \u2014 fell within the coverage of her homeowner\u2019s policy, namely the \u201chidden seepage\u201d provision. Safety then satisfied its burden of showing that the exclusion for damage caused directly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>indirectly by surface water was applicable to Boazova\u2019s claim. In light of the anticoncurrent cause provision in the exclusions section of Boazova\u2019s policy, where the excluded peril \u2014 surface water \u2014 was a direct or indirect cause of the damage to Boazo-va\u2019s home, Safety was not obligated to provide insurance coverage \u201cregardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Ella Boazova alleged that as a direct result of Safety Insurance Company\u2019s denial of her request for insurance coverage, she sustained damages of not less than $96,366.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">No suggestion has been made that Boazova knew about the damage to the wooden sill plate, floor joists, or wall studs before its discovery on August 1, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Boazova\u2019s argument is clear that she regards the <em>cause </em>of her loss and the basis for her claim to be the hidden seepage of water, not wet or dry rot, which she considers to be the <em>result </em>of the seepage. Based on the opinions of the experts, the seeping of the water and the rotting of the sill plate, floor joists, and wall studs worked hand in hand to cause the damage to Boazova\u2019s house. That said, in light of the focus of Boazova\u2019s argument, we need not discuss the intricacies of the policy\u2019s coverage for fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria because this coverage \u201conly applies when such loss or costs are a result of a Peril Insured Against that occurs during the policy period . . . .\u201d As will be discussed, our conclusion that Boazova\u2019s loss was not one of the covered perils insured against negates the coverage for fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The inclusion of an \u201canticoncurrent cause\u201d provision in an insurance policy is designed to circumvent the doctrine of efficient proximate cause whereby coverage is afforded as long as the predominant cause of the loss is a covered peril. See <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 27 (1993) (\u201c[if the proximate] cause is an insured risk, there will be coverage even though the final form of the property damage, produced by a series of related events, appears to take the loss outside of the terms of the policy\u201d); <em>Lynn Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Meriden Fire Ins. Co., </em>158 Mass. 570, 574-575 (1893); <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 765-766 (1974). See also <em>Alton </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 611, 614-615 (1993) (\u201ctrain of events\u201d principle to determine efficient proximate cause of loss not applicable where insurer excludes coverage by anticoncurrent cause provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
