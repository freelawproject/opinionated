L. c. 265, \u00a7 26A (parental kidnapping statute), after his five year old nonmarital son,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whom we shall call G.G., disappeared while in the defendant\u2019s care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982), the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment <em>(McCarthy </em>motion). The thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument was that the Commonwealth could not prove, as it must under the parental kidnapping statute, that he acted \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d in allegedly taking G.G. To the extent the Commonwealth relied on G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (\u00bf&gt;),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to satisfy this element of the crime, the defendant argued that the operation of that statute in these circumstances gave rise to an unconstitutional violation of his right to equal protection because it discriminated against him on the basis of his gender. See art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *A Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s <em>McCarthy </em>motion on the basis of the unconstitutionality of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>{b), </em>as applied, and we granted the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Because the indictment may properly rest on the application of another, gender-neutral statute, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), and because, in these circumstances, the defendant cannot raise an as-applied constitutional challenge to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>{b), </em>in a <em>McCarthy </em>motion, we reverse the order allowing the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence presented to the grand jury was as follows.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 1, 2003, G.G. was bom to D.C., his mother, and the defendant. D.C. and the defendant were never married. The defendant is listed as G.G.\u2019s father on his birth certificate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The family lived together until G.G. was \u201cclose to two\u201d years old. After D.C. and the defendant separated in 2005, G.G. remained in the care of D.C., and the defendant orally agreed to pay $125 per week in child support, which accounted for half of the cost of G.G.\u2019s daycare. Three weeks after making this agreement, the defendant unilaterally reduced the amount to thirty dollars per week. After the reduction, D.C. sought an order for child support in the Probate and Family Court. In approximately April, 2007, when G.G. was almost four years old, the defendant acknowledged paternity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a Probate and Family Court judge ordered that $125 per week be withdrawn from his paycheck. The defendant did not then seek, nor did the judge issue, any orders regarding custody or visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">More than one year later, in June, 2008, the defendant filed a complaint in the Probate and Family Court for joint custody of G.G. and for visitation rights. At that time, the defendant had not had contact with G.G. for almost one year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant and D.C. also had conversations in which the defendant indicated his desire to reenter G.G.\u2019s life, and, after the defendant met D.C. and G.G. at a restaurant on July 27, 2008, D.C. agreed that the defendant would have weekend visits with G.G. at the defendant\u2019s home in Lynn. The first two such visits (August 1-3 and August 8-10, 2008) took place without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On Sunday, August 17, 2008, however, G.G. went missing. Like the previous two weekends, G.G. was scheduled to spend the weekend with the defendant; according to D.C., he had been dropped off at the defendant\u2019s home on Friday, August 15, 2008, at about 4 p.m. When D.C. arrived at the defendant\u2019s home on Sunday afternoon to pick up G.G., no one came to the door or answered the telephone. After four hours of trying to get in touch with the defendant, D.C. contacted the Lynn police. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Eventually, fire fighters were able to enter the defendant\u2019s apartment through an open second-floor window. They found the defendant locked inside another room of the apartment. G.G. has not since been found. Although several witnesses testified to the contrary before the grand jury,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant told police that he had not been with G.G. that weekend, and had not seen him since his visit the previous weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant was indicted and charged with parental kidnapping. Pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26A, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant, \u201cwithout lawful authority,\u201d held G.G. permanently or for a protracted period of time, or took G.G. from his lawful custodian. To prove the absence of the defendant\u2019s lawful authority, the Commonwealth relied on G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>That statute sets forth a default rule for custody of nonmarital children, requiring that, \u201c[i]n the absence of an order or judgment of a [Pjrobate and [Fjamily [Cjourt relative to custody, the mother shall continue to have custody of a child after an adjudication of paternity or voluntary acknowledgment of parentage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In his <em>McCarthy </em>motion, the defendant argued that, as G.G.\u2019s \u201cbiological father,\u201d he was automatically a custodial parent, at least absent a court order divesting him of custody. The Commonwealth argued in response that G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>granting ongoing custody of nonmarital children to their mothers absent modification by court order, established the defendant\u2019s lack of lawful authority and was thus sufficient to support the indictment. The defendant countered that, as applied to him, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>operated as an unconstitutional denial of his right to equal protection, pursuant to art. 1, because it discriminated against the defendant on the basis of his gender. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Superior Court judge agreed and, after a hearing, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We granted a joint application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Pursuant to <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163, \u201cat the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest him\u201d (citations omitted). While ordinarily courts do not \u201cinquire into the competency or sufficiency of the evidence before the grand jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>373 Mass. 591, 592 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>323 Mass. 205, 211-212 (1948), <em>McCarthy </em>allows a court to dismiss an indictment where the grand jury receive <em>\u201cno </em>evidence of criminality\u201d on the part of the accused. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 650 (1991). \u201c[A] requirement of sufficient evidence to [indict] is considerably less exacting than a requirement of sufficient evidence to warrant a guilty finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 451 (1984), citing <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 848-849 (1973). With these principles in mind, we turn to an assessment of the defendant\u2019s <em>McCarthy </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The crime of parental kidnapping requires that an individual, \u201cbeing a relative of a child less than eighteen years old, <em>without lawful authority, </em>holds or intends to hold such a child permanently or for a protracted period, or takes or entices such a child from his lawful custodian\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26A. \u201cThe grand jury must be presented with evidence on each of the . . . elements, but the defendant here challenges only the evidence concerning the element of\u201d lawful authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>453 Mass. 880, 884 (2009). Therefore, the Commonwealth must have put forward some evidence before the grand jury to establish \u201cprobable cause,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra, </em>to believe that the defendant, in taking or holding G.G., acted \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In the context of a parental kidnapping charge, the Commonwealth can prove that an individual lacks lawful authority over his child in a number of ways \u2014 by operation of a range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of statutes or by court order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where an element of a crime can be proved \u201cin any one of several ways,\u201d and \u201can indictment properly charges its commission in all those ways,\u201d the defendant \u201cshould be convicted if it is proved that he committed the crime in any of those ways.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowe, </em>315 Mass. 217, 219-220 (1943). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheremond, </em>461 Mass. 397, 405 (2012) (holding that indictment for murder in the first degree \u201ccharges murder by whatever means it may have been committed, regardless of the theory of murder presented to the grand jury\u201d). Because he has been charged with parental kidnapping, the defendant can be convicted if the Commonwealth can establish his lack of lawful authority over G.G. in any way in which that element can be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">For this element, the Commonwealth relies on the application of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>\u201cThe statute governing nonmarital children, G. L. c. 209C, establishes a comprehensive scheme for determining paternity and for establishing child support, visitation, and custody rights for children bom outside of a marriage.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 544 (2010). As part of this comprehensive scheme, under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>\u201cthe child\u2019s mother is vested with sole physical and legal custody, and that custody arrangement continues even after paternity is established until modified by a court.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 545. The defendant raises an as-applied constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>challenge to the operation of that statute, claiming that it unlawfully discriminates against him on the basis of his gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201c[W]e generally decline to reach constitutional questions where . . . there is a readily available statutory ground that renders such a decision unnecessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>449 Mass. 227, 234 (2007). As a result, if the evidence presented to the grand jury is sufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to present \u201cany evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra </em>at 450, that the defendant lacked lawful authority over G.G. on a basis other than the operation of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>we need not consider the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s indictment permissibly may rest on a different statutory ground. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), which provides that \u201c[i]f either parent. . . relinquishes care of the child or abandons the child and the other parent is fit to have custody, that parent shall be entitled to custody,\u201d properly vests custody in D.C., G.G.\u2019s mother. The defendant had a three-year custodial absence from G.G.\u2019s life, including a one-year complete \u201cdisappearance],\u201d in the words of defense counsel. During this period, D.C. acted as G.G.\u2019s sole custodian.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When the defendant did try to reenter G.G.\u2019s life, he first sought out D.C.\u2019s permission, in apparent recognition of her role as G.G.\u2019s custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">This evidence is sufficient for the Commonwealth to meet its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>burden to put forth \u201cany evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra, </em>that the defendant had \u201crelinquished] care\u201d of G.G. to D.C., G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(c), </em>and thereby that the defendant lacked lawful authority, as required for a parental kidnapping charge, upon the expiration of D.C.\u2019s permission at the end of the weekend visit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In any event, we would be loath to permit a defendant to raise an as-applied constitutional challenge to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>in the circumstances presented by this case. The defendant did not pursue his remedy to obtain sole or shared physical custody of G.G. in the Probate and Family Court. Instead, according to the grand jury testimony, he allegedly took G.G., to the exclusion of his custodial parent, and now asserts his custodial rights in a kidnapping prosecution. The proper avenue of redress would have been to file for physical custody of G.G. in the Probate and Family Court pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 10, and there challenge the default rule in favor of D.C.\u2019s custody. If a Probate and Family Court judge, after consideration of the defendant\u2019s petition pursuant to the standards set forth in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), refused to enter an order granting the defendant either joint or sole physical and legal custody, the defendant could then have pressed his challenge on appeal. See <em>Fathers &amp; Families, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, </em>460 Mass. 508, 510 (2011); <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003). In light of its expertise, the Probate and Family Court is particularly well suited to hear such a claim in the first instance. See <em>Click </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>383 Mass. 290, 293-294 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">To hold otherwise would allow unmarried noncustodial fathers simply to take their children, without judicial process, and to the exclusion of custodial mothers, and air their grievances with the application of the statutes governing nonmarital children in the subsequent criminal prosecution for parental kidnapping. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>We have generally sought to encourage resolution of disputes in court and discourage resort to such \u201cself-help.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596, 600 (1983) (defendant may not use force to resist unlawful arrest, absent excessive force by arresting officer, as there are \u201clegal processes available to restore his liberty\u201d and thus \u201cself-help by an arrestee has become anachronistic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Ensuring that individuals do not resort to self-help is particularly important in these circumstances, to protect the safety of nonmarital children who are the subject of custody disputes. Resort to self-help in custody disputes \u201cis an irresponsible . . . remedy. Not only does self-help make the eventual placement of the children an arbitrary consequence but it breeds reprisal in kind . . . .\u201d <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>433 So. 2d 1015, 1018-1019 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983), quoting <em>Application of Lang, 9 </em>A.D. 2d 401, 408 (N.Y. 1959). In adjudicating custody disputes over nonmarital children, courts utilize the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d analysis. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 545 (2010), quoting G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a). Undoubtedly, a touchstone of this inquiry is the child\u2019s safety. See <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, supra </em>at 658 (best interests inquiry relates to child\u2019s \u201chealth, safety, or welfare\u201d). Allowing unmarried, noncustodial fathers to take a child first and raise as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of the custody statutes later would place the child\u2019s safety at risk and thus contravene the child\u2019s best interests. Whatever right nonmarital, noncustodial fathers have to custody \u201cwill not be enforced to the detriment of the child.\u201d <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this context, our policy is to discourage self-help and encourage resort to the Probate and Family Court for resolution of disputes over child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">An as-applied constitutional challenge is particularly inappro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>priate in this case because the defendant had acquiesced to the arrangement regarding physical custody that he now challenges. General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 11 <em>(b), </em>specifically contemplates that parents of nonmarital children may \u201cmake agreements regarding custody,\u201d and provides that courts shall approve those agreements absent a finding that they are not in the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant and D.C. had apparently reached such an agreement regarding physical custody following their separation in 2005, and this did not change even in 2008, when the defendant sought in the Probate and Family Court shared legal custody and regular visitation. This arrangement did not confer upon him any lawful authority over G.G. at the end of the August 15-17, 2008, weekend. Any indication of his future intention to seek physical custody was foreclosed by his filing in the Probate and Family Court, where he sought only joint legal custody and visitation rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, had the defendant received what he sought in the Probate and Family Court \u2014 legal custody \u2014 he still would not have had lawful authority to take G.G. beyond the time permitted by D.C. on the day in question, except as to any court-ordered visitation. The defendant\u2019s filing for legal, rather than physical, custody is indicative of his intention to relinquish the right to custody that he now purports to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>This conclusion is consistent also with our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>459 Mass. 572 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1739 (2012). In <em>Powell, </em>we held that a defendant could not bring an as-applied constitutional challenge to his convictions under the firearm licensing statute \u2014 which makes it unlawful to carry a firearm without a license or firearm identification card \u2014 where he never attempted to obtain a license, and thus could not demonstrate \u201cthat a denial of the issuance of [a license] would have been rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. The defendant in that case \u201cchose instead ... to violate the law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 590, and carry a firearm without the proper licensing. We have applied this principle repeatedly in subsequent cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>461 Mass. 44, 58-59 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, </em>460 Mass. 723, 725 (2011). To raise a proper as-applied constitutional challenge, the defendant, like the defendants challenging the firearm licensing statute in <em>Powell </em>and its progeny, must show that he would have been denied custody before he can challenge the constitutionality of the custody statutes as applied to him. Having not pursued fully his remedy in the Probate and Family Court, or demonstrated any interest in physical custody of G.G. in the three years before his disappearance, the defendant cannot now raise such a constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-15\">See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>458 Mass. 540, 544 n.6 (2010), citing <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Sec., </em>435 Mass. 536, 543 n.12 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-16\">The defendant was indicted also for misleading a police officer in connection with a criminal investigation, G.

In that case, the father and mother of the nonmarital children were \u201cboth sharing a household and together raising and supporting the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. In such circumstances, we held that, even without a court order granting the father custody, the statute could not be construed as rendering him a noncustodial parent because \u201cthe statutory provision does not state that an adjudicated father shall <em>not </em>have custody in the absence of such an order or judgment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 77. Accordingly, the Probate and Family Court judge was without authority to order the father to pay child support. To hold otherwise, we noted, \u201cwould raise potential constitutional problems.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">This holding, however, does not apply to the instant case. The defendant had not provided comparably consistent care and support for G.G. and, most obviously, had not been living with G.G. for some time. Indeed, except for the two previous weekends, he had not even seen G.G. for about one year at the time of G.G.\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">According to the testimony of an investigating officer before the grand jury, $125 per week was withdrawn from the defendant\u2019s paycheck for child support pursuant to court order. The mandated support payments, beginning two years after the defendant and D.C. separated and G.G. remained with his mother, leave unaffected our conclusion that the Commonwealth put forward sufficient evidence before the grand jury that the defendant \u201crelinquishe[d] care\u201d of G.G. to D.C. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c). The custodial arrangement between the defendant and D.C. remained the same both before and after the payments were ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">As we held in <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>C.M.J., supra, </em>G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>does not deprive custodial fathers of their right to custody of their nonmarital children. Thus, where a mother of a nonmarital child relinquishes care of the child to the father, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), properly vests custody in the father notwithstanding G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>Because G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), by its operation and terms, is gender neutral, it comports with equal protection principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Whatever parental interest the defendant claims does not compel a contrary result, as we previously explained that a parent\u2019s interest in his relationship with his child is not absolute, because the \u201coverriding principle\u201d in determining the right of a parent to custody \u201cmust be the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>427 Mass. 1201, 1203 (1998), quoting C.C. v. A.B., 406 Mass. 679, 691 (1990). \u201c[T]he first and paramount duty of courts is to consult the welfare of the child. To that governing principle every other public and private consideration must yield.\u201d <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Agreements between parents in the upbringing of their children are generally favored. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31 (\u201cWhere the [divorcing] parents have reached an agreement providing for the custody of the children, the court may enter an order in accordance with such agreement, unless specific findings are made by the court indicating that such an order would not be in the best interests of the children\u201d); <em>Custody of Zia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 248 n.16 (2000) (\u201cIt goes without saying that we encourage parental agreement in the sensitive area of child custody when it is possible and in the best interests of the child\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The defendant\u2019s particular filing \u2014 for joint <em>legal </em>custody \u2014 was not before the grand jury. The investigating officer testified before the grand jury only that the defendant filed \u201cfor visitation and or joint custody.\u201d The ambiguity of this testimony means that the grand jurors were unaware that the defendant had sought only \u201cinvolvement ... in major decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31, and not a right to shared physical custody of G.G. Because we consider this filing only as to the propriety of the defendant\u2019s as-applied constitutional challenge, and not in our assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence before the grand jury, we may take judicial notice of the defendant\u2019s application for joint legal custody. \u201cAs to . . . related proceedings, a court may also take judicial notice of the records of other courts.\u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 530 (2002), quoting P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 2.8.1, at 26 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
