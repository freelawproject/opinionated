L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3). In open court, the defendant was sentenced to incarceration for one year in a house of correction. Thereafter, a sentence to community parole supervision for life (CPSL)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also entered on the docket. The defendant subsequently filed an \u201cemergency motion to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the sentence,\u201d arguing that the CPSL portion of the sentence should be vacated. The motion was denied, and we transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The defendant claims, among other issues, that the imposition of CPSL is discretionary, not mandatory, under the terms of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3). We agree and conclude that, because it is evident from the record that the sentencing judge mistakenly believed that imposition of CPSL was mandatory, we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing to ensure proper exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Statutory framework. </em>General Laws c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178G, provides \u201can extensive statutory registration scheme for sex offenders, in order to protect the public from \u2018the danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders\u2019 and to aid law enforcement officials in protecting their communities by providing them with information.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>450 Mass. 657, 659-660 (2008), quoting <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 769 (2006). A convicted sex offender must register with the sex offender registry board (board), G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E, which then determines the individual\u2019s classification level. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2). That classification, in turn, dictates the sex offender\u2019s obligations with respect to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">There are three classification levels. At all three levels, offenders \u201cmust register with the board, provide home and work addresses, notify the board of any changes, and verify their information at regular intervals.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maker, </em>459 Mass. 46, 48-49 (2011), citing G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E-178FV2. Those at the lowest risk of recidivism are designated level 1 sex offenders, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (a), and must verify registration information with the board annually by mail. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178F. Level 2 and 3 sex offenders, those at \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d risk of reoffense, respectively, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(b), </em>(c), must meet the same registration require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ments, but \u201cwhile level 1 offenders can provide verification by mail, level 2 or 3 offenders must appear in person at their local police department.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maker, supra </em>at 49, citing G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178F/2.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Any sex offender required to register who \u201cknowingly: (i) fails to register; (ii) fails to verify registration information; (iii) fails to provide notice of a change of address; or (iv) who knowingly provides false information\u201d is guilty of the offense of failure to register. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a). A level 2 or level 3 sex offender convicted of failing to register \u201cshall, in addition to the term of imprisonment authorized by this subsection, be subject to community parole supervision for life.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kately, </em>461 Mass 575, 581 (2012) (assuming without deciding that CPSL is mandatory under this subsection).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">b. <em>Facts and prior proceedings. </em>In 1985, the defendant was convicted of rape and abuse of a child. As a consequence, the board classified the defendant as a level 3 sex offender, subject to the statutory registration requirements. A police investigation revealed that the defendant had provided false registration information from at least April to June, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The defendant was indicted for failure to register as a sex offender, second offense, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on November 20, 2008, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charge. On July 14, 2009, the prosecutor and the defendant, through his attorney, entered into a plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the defendant would plead guilty to the lesser offense of failing to register as a sex offender, first offense, pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3), and the defendant would agree to the Commonwealth\u2019s sentencing recommendation. According to the prosecutor, this recommendation called for the defendant to be sentenced to one year in a house of correction \u201cunder the provisions of [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3),] which would still provide for lifetime parole.\u201d The judge \u201caccepted]\u201d both the plea and joint recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>When the clerk announced the sentence in open court, however, CPSL was not mentioned: \u201cThe Court, in consideration of this offense, orders that you be confined in the house of correction at Pittsfield, in the county of Berkshire, for the term of one year.\u201d At some point thereafter, the imposition of CPSL was memorialized on both the docket and the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On March 11, 2010, almost eight months later, the defendant filed a motion to correct the sentence, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), requesting that the court \u201cvacate the portion of the sentence that calls for [CPSL],\u201d on the basis that the judge erred in treating the imposition of CPSL as mandatory rather than discretionary. In a supplement to the motion, the defendant also argued that CPSL must be vacated because \u201cit was not imposed in court while [the] defendant was present, thereby violating his constitutional right to be present at sentencing.\u201d The same judge who heard the defendant\u2019s plea denied this motion, stating, \u201cI agree with the Commonwealth that CPSL is mandatory under [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3)]. In addition, the transcript indicates that the defendant, as part of the plea, accepted this condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant renews his arguments on appeal, claiming that imposition of CPSL under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3), is discretionary, and that he did not have sufficient notice of the CPSL because it was not announced in open court as part of his sentence. We address each point in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">a. <em>Whether imposition of CPSL under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H </em>(a) <em>(3), is discretionary. </em>In determining whether G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3), permits judicial discretion, we start \u201cwith the language of the statute itself and \u2018presume, as we must, that the Legislature intended what the words of the statute say.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>453 Mass. 707, 713 (2009), quoting <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 687 (1986). \u201cThe statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984), citing <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983). However, when a criminal statute can \u201cplausibly be found to be ambiguous,\u201d the rule of lenity applies, and we \u201cgive the defendant the benefit of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The provision at issue, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3), requires that \u201c[a]ny person convicted under this subsection who is a level 2 or level 3 sex offender shall ... be subject to community parole supervision for life . . . .\u2019\u2019The operative language \u2014 \u201csubject to\u201d \u2014 is not defined in the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). While in many instances we look to \u201cusual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as . . . other legal contexts and dictionary definitions,\u201d <em>id.., </em>here, resort to such sources does not settle the meaning of the phrase \u201csubject to.\u201d Antonymous definitions of the phrase can be found in the very same dictionaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>In addition, our previous cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and those in other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> have reached differing results as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Having rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the plain language of the subsection unambiguously provides for mandatory CPSL, we turn to other accepted canons of statutory construction. We first review the statutory context. \u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper, no doubt, to look into the other parts of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Galvin, 388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983), quoting <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1823). Statutes should be read \u201cas a whole to produce an internal consistency.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The three subsections of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a), </em>set forth the penalties for failure to register for three differently situated groups of defendants. Subsection 178H <em>(a) </em>(1), which applies to those convicted of certain enumerated sex offenses,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides that defendants convicted under this subsection <em>\u201cshall... be punished by </em>a term of community parole supervision for life\u201d (emphasis supplied). Subsection 178H (a) (2), which applies to those level 2 and level 3 offenders convicted of a subsequent offense of failing to register, identically states that anyone convicted under the subsection \u201cshall <em>... be punished by </em>a term of community parole supervision for life\u201d (emphasis supplied). This language, on its face, requires the mandatory imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tion of CPSL for those convicted under the first two subsections. By contrast, the language of \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3), the provision at issue, reads: \u201cAny person convicted under this subsection who is a level 2 or level 3 sex offender shall . . . <em>be subject to </em>community parole supervision for life . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201cWhere the Legislature used different language in different paragraphs of the same statute, it intended different meanings.\u201d <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 324 (1998). See <em>DePierre </em>v. <em>United States, </em>131 S. Ct. 2225, 2234 (2011). We see no need to dispense with this general rule of construction in this case. The Legislature utilized clear language in the first two subsections imposing mandatory CPSL (\u201cshall ... be punished by\u201d) but subsequently adopted ambiguous language (\u201cshall ... be subject to\u201d) in \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3). This use of different language strongly suggests the legislative intent to convey a different meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3) reinforces this reading. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>453 Mass. 739, 746 (2009). Subsections 178H <em>(a) </em>(1) and (2) were added in July, 2006, see St. 2006, c. 139, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, while \u00a7 178H (a) (3) was added separately, effective December 20, 2006, see St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 4. The first version of the bill adding \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3) included language identical to the other subsections (\u201cshall. . . be punished by\u201d), see 2005 House Doc. No. 5234, \u00a7 4, but the final, approved version of the bill amended the text to its current form (\u201cshall ... be subject to\u201d). See St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 4. The Legislature thus considered and rejected specific language that would have required CPSL as a mandatory portion of a sentence, language it had included as part of statutory amendments to the same statute earlier the same year. This change counsels in favor of reading G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3), as calling for discretionary imposition of CPSL. See <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>451 Mass. 529, 537 n.14 (2008) (\u201cthe contemporaneous decision of the Legislature to adopt one form of a proposed bill and not another may highlight the intended meaning of the adopted language\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 736 (2005) (Marshall, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting <em>Transportation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maksyn, </em>580 S.W.2d 334, 338 (Tex. 1979) (\u201cThe deletion of a provision in a pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>bill discloses the legislative intent to reject the proposal. Courts should be slow to put back that which the [Legislature has rejected\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">This construction is also consistent with the statute\u2019s scheme and purpose. See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>446 Mass. 46, 50 (2006) (\u201cconstrue the statute as a whole, to ensure that the statute serves its intended purpose\u201d). The first two subsections, which require mandatory CPSL, refer to the most serious offenders: either those who committed particularly serious offenses (\u00a7 178H [a] [1]) or those who repeatedly failed to register (\u00a7 178H [a] [2]). Subsection 178H (a) (3), on the other hand, refers only to level 2 and level 3 sex offenders. Read in light of the first two subsections, \u00a7 178H (a) (3) applies only to those level 2 and level 3 offenders whose offenses are not as severe as those enumerated in \u00a7 178H <em>{a) </em>(1), as well as those offenders who have not been previously convicted of failing to register; in other words, it applies to those least deserving of mandatory CPSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">A contrary reading of the statute is unpersuasive also because, if read to require, rather than permit, CPSL, \u00a7 178H (a) (3) would render \u00a7 178H (a) (2) a nullity. It is a basic principle of statutory construction that a statute should \u201cbe construed \u2018so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998), quoting 2A B. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06 (5th ed. 1992). Subsection 178H <em>(a) </em>(2) specifically refers to \u201clevel 2 or level 3 offenders]\u201d who have previously been convicted of failing to register, whereas \u00a7 178H (a) (3) refers more generally to \u201clevel 2 or level 3 sex offenders].\u201d To read both sections as requiring mandatory CPSL would completely subsume \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(2) into \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H <em>(a) </em>(3), allows for discretionary imposition of CPSL.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>judge who indicated that he \u201cagree[d] with the Commonwealth that CPSL is mandatory under [G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H (a) (3)],\u201d was the same judge who accepted the defendant\u2019s plea and imposed the defendant\u2019s sentence. The judge could not have attempted to exercise discretion that he did not think he had. Therefore, the defendant must be resentenced<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> so that the judge may properly exercise his discretion in determining whether to impose CPSL as part of the sentence. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 305, 316 (1979) (\u201cthe remedy for an error in sentencing is not dismissal or new trial, but resentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">b. <em>Whether the defendant had sufficient notice of the CPSL. </em>The defendant next argues that the CPSL portion of his sentence should be vacated, without remand for resentencing, because the imposition of CPSL was not announced in open court. As a result, the defendant contends, CPSL was not properly imposed in the first instance, was not included as part of his sentence, and therefore could not be imposed on resentencing. We conclude that CPSL was properly imposed in the first instance despite the variance between the oral pronouncement in open court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>docketed written expression of sentence. This is because the defendant was on notice and had reason to understand that he was subject to CPSL as part of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\u201cA criminal defendant has the right to be present at his own sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vega-Ortiz, </em>425 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 2005). Consistent with this right, the oral pronouncement of a sentence generally controls over the written expression where there exists a \u201cmaterial conflict\u201d between the two. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz-Torres, </em>449 F.3d 61, 74 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Cosme-Piri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>549 U.S. 941 (2006), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Torres-Santiago </em>v. <em>United States, </em>549 U.S. 967 (2006), and cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mattei-Albizu </em>v. <em>United States, </em>549 U.S. 1313 (2007). However, \u201cno material conflict exists where the defendant is on notice that he is subject to the terms included in the written judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Here the defendant had ample notice of the CPSL portion of the joint recommendation and reason to understand that he was subject to CPSL as part of his sentence. A fair reading of the plea colloquy and hearing makes this clear. The judge accepted the joint recommendation of the parties that included CPSL. The prosecutor informed the judge, with both the defendant and his attorney present, that \u201clifetime parole\u201d was part of the recommended sentence. When asked by the judge if he had heard the joint recommendation, the defendant said that he had.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hiskin, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 639 (2007). Also, immediately after the judge imposed the sentence, defense counsel stated that the defendant would \u201cobviously\u201d be subject to CPSL and that one of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cincredibly significant concerns\u201d was his inability to pay the fees associated with CPSL. In response, the judge orally waived the global positioning system monitoring fees and counselling fees associated with CPSL. The defendant\u2019s concerns over such fees further indicate that he was aware that CPSL was part of his sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Accordingly, given the circumstances, although CPSL was not imposed in open court, there exists no conflict that is material between the sentence orally imposed and that memorialized on the docket. Because CPSL was properly imposed in the first instance, it remains available to the judge at his discretion on resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-15\">The Legislature has provided \u201cfor lifetime parole (\u2018community parole supervision for life\u2019 [CPSL]) for certain sex offenders,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number><em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. 422, 429 (2003), including those who fail to register with the sex offender registry board (board).

The indictment states that the defendant \u201cha[d] been previously convicted of a like offense,\u201d but the Commonwealth has submitted no evidence of a previous conviction of failing to register.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Commonwealth makes much of the fact that the word \u201cshall\u201d precedes the phrase \u201csubject to.\u201d This, it argues, clarifies that the Legislature intended the imposition of CPSL to be mandatory. We disagree. Even assuming \u201cshall\u201d as used in this statute is intended to be mandatory, this sheds no additional light on the meaning of \u201csubject to\u201d because a mandatory \u201cshall\u201d is consistent with either reading of the statute. Either the judge must consider imposing CPSL in his discretion, or must impose CPSL. To the extent \u201csubject to\u201d is conditional, the word \u201cshall\u201d does nothing to dispel its meaning; the question whether the judge has discretion can only be discerned by examination of the operative phrase \u201csubject to.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rama, </em>298 N.J.

While this list is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, it is unlikely that defendants and prosecutors will be unaware of the factors a judge would reasonably consider in deciding whether to impose CPSL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that we cannot remand for resentencing because to do so would upset the \u201ccontract\u201d between the Commonwealth and the defendant is without merit. The sentencing judge has the authority to reduce an agreed-on sentence without providing the Commonwealth with the opportunity to revoke the plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dean-Ganek, </em>461 Mass. 305 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>461 Mass. 256 (2012). The fact that the defendant agreed to CPSL did not deprive the judge of his discretion to reduce the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">This right derives from both the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
