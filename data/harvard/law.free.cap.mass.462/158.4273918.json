L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>445 Mass. 262 (2005) (Parra); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527 (2001) <em>(Kennedy). </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>once \u201cthe court is satisfied that probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person,\u201d that individual \u201cshall be committed to the [Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center)] for a period not exceeding 60 days.\u201d During that sixty-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>period, two qualified examiners will evaluate the individual and \u201cshall, no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis and their recommendation of the disposition of the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial \u201cshall be made within 14 days of the filing of the report of the two qualified examiners.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a). We have previously held that these deadlines are \u201cmandatory,\u201d and that any delay resulting in confinement beyond sixty days requires dismissal of the petition for civil commitment. <em>Parra, supra </em>at 263. Only \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justify even \u201ca very brief delay.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Because, in the present action, David Gangi was confined for sixteen days more than the statutory maximum, and because this delay was not justified by any extraordinary circumstances, we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for civil commitment must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>On July 28, 2010, the Commonwealth filed a petition in the Superior Court for the temporary commitment of Gangi as a sexually dangerous person. Gangi, who was serving a sentence for indecent assault and battery on a person over the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, was scheduled to be released on September 10, 2010. Multiple delays ensued, including continuances requested by Gangi\u2019s counsel. Probable cause, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a), was not found until January 7, 2011; at a hearing on that day, a Superior Court judge accepted Gangi\u2019s stipulation to the existence of probable cause. Any petition for trial that the Commonwealth wished to file was due not later than March 9, 2011, sixty days from the court\u2019s finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">No petition for trial was filed by that date. At a status conference on February 15, 2011, the Commonwealth learned that the qualified examiners\u2019 reports had not yet been filed. The forty-five day statutory deadline for filing of these reports expired one week later, on February 22. Six days later, on February 28, the Commonwealth contacted the Department of Correction (department) and learned that the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office had not sent to the department the notice of probable cause and that no qualified examiners had been assigned to evaluate Gangi. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The finding of probable cause, made on January 7, was not docketed until March 2, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">After the sixty-day deadline passed on March 9, 2011, Gangi moved to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for his civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person. On March 24, the qualified examiners\u2019 reports were filed, and the Commonwealth filed its petition for trial the same day. After a hearing, a different Superior Court judge denied Gangi\u2019s motion to dismiss, on the basis of the \u201cextraordinary procedural mishap for which the Commonwealth was not responsible and for which it should not be penalized.\u201d A single justice of this court denied Gangi\u2019s petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Gangi appealed from that denial to the full court pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, 434 Mass. 1301 (2001). We permitted his appeal to proceed according to the regular appellate process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cGeneral Laws c. 123A provides for the commitment of persons found to be sexually dangerous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>452 Mass. 194, 195 (2008). The statutory scheme, which is \u201ccivil and remedial in character,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>446 Mass. 583, 585-586 (2006), exists \u201cto protect the public \u2018from harm by persons likely to be sexually dangerous\u2019 by striking a balance between the public interest and a defendant\u2019s substantive due process rights.\u201d <em>Parra, supra </em>at 264, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 164 (2004). Among the rights afforded an individual subject to confinement under G. L. c. 123A are strict procedural deadlines governing commitment proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>454 Mass. 267, 278 (2009) (Ireland, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Legislature clearly was aware of the liberty interests at stake in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>G. L. c. 123A proceedings and fashioned a statutory scheme that takes place according to an expedited pace\u201d). The sixty-day deadline required by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>is \u201cmandatory to protect a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, and any delay by the Commonwealth that results in a confinement exceeding sixty days is a violation of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691, 693 (2006), quoting <em>Parra, supra </em>at 263. Such delays may be excused only where there exist \u201cextraordinary circumstances that would justify a very brief delay.\u201d <em>Parra, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Commonwealth concedes that the period of Gangi\u2019s commitment between the finding of probable cause and the petition for trial exceeded the sixty-day statutory maximum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the Commonwealth argues that the delay should be excused, and thus the petition for commitment not dismissed, because the delay was due to an error by the court clerk and the Commonwealth made diligent efforts to meet the statutory deadlines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We have previously considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 the same argument in both <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>and <em>Parra, supra. </em>In <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 529, the Commonwealth maintained that the clerk\u2019s office was at fault in failing to notify the treatment center of the orders of commitment and that \u201cit should not be penalized for the clerk\u2019s mistake.\u201d We held that the Commonwealth \u201cfailed to provide the defendant with the protections mandated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>statute\u201d and that this violation required dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for civil commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 530. In <em>Parra, supra, </em>we made clear that \u201cdismissal is the appropriate remedy for any violation of the sixty-day deadline, absent extraordinary circumstances that would justify a very brief delay.\u201d The fact that the department had not been \u201cnotified of the finding of probable cause\u201d \u2014 whether due to a failure by the clerk or the prosecutor \u2014 did not constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and the dismissal was accordingly affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 263, 267. Likewise, here, the clerk\u2019s error in failing contemporaneously to docket the finding of probable cause does not fall within the category of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Although qualified examiners are \u201cindependent experts appointed by the court,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>447 Mass. 313, 314 n.2 (2006), \u201c[i]t is the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the treatment center performs the examinations in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 830 n.6, citing <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 529-530. This is consistent with our general practice \u201cthat it is the responsibility of the bar, not the court staff, to attend to the progress of pending matters. . . . An appellant cannot claim excusable neglect simply because a clerk has committed an error.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>406 Mass. 641, 644-645 (1990). We reaffirm that, because the Commonwealth bears responsibility for ensuring that the treatment center receives notice of a probable cause determination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dismissal of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tion for violation of the sixty-day deadline may not be averted simply because of the clerk\u2019s failure to provide this notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Because \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d are not present, we do not consider whether the sixteen extra days of Gangi\u2019s confinement constitute a \u201cvery brief\u201d delay. Absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d any violation of the sixty-day statutory deadline, however brief, requires dismissal. See <em>Parra, supra </em>at 265. \u201c[Confinement without legal justification is never innocuous.\u201d <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the single justice denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is vacated, and a judgment shall enter in the county court granting Gangi\u2019s petition for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On the same day, the judge issued an order for Gangi\u2019s temporary commitment under G. L. c. 123 A, \u00a7 13 (a), and thereby purported to \u201creset\u201d the sixty-day \u201cclock\u201d for Gangi\u2019s period of commitment for evaluation. See note 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (e), permits the Commonwealth to request the temporary commitment of an individual scheduled to be released from a term of incarceration pending disposition of the petition. Gangi, while not challenging the initial delay between September, 2010, and January, 2011, has been \u201ctemporarily\u201d committed under this statute since the expiration of his criminal sentence in September, 2010. In light of his \u201cimmediate liberty\u201d interest in resolution of this dispute, <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Treatment Ctr., </em>458 Mass. 186, 188 n.6 (2010), we allowed the appeal to proceed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Commonwealth concedes also that the reports from the qualified examiners were filed well beyond the forty-five day deadline. We need not concern ourselves with this violation, however, because \u201c[i]n terms of a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, the relevant period is the sixty-day time period.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 831 (2003) (holding that delay in filing of qualified examiners\u2019 report did not interfere with defendant\u2019s liberty interest where petition for trial was still filed within sixty-day deadline, and thus dismissal was error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The Commonwealth concedes that the efforts of a Superior Court judge essentially to reset the clock by issuing a second order for temporary commitment was \u201cjudicial error amounting (in retrospect) to a nullity.\u201d The Commonwealth does, however, argue that this error became the \u201claw of the case\u201d and excused the delay. The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine applies to \u201cquestions decided upon an earlier appeal in the same case,\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>424 Mass. 1, 8 (1996), quoting <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 599 (1940), and, even then, does not apply where \u201cthe decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, supra, </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera-Martinez, </em>931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862 (1991). The law of the case doctrine thus has no bearing here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Moreover, even if relevant, nothing of record suggests that the Commonwealth had insufficient time to meet the sixty-day deadline. Knowing that a probable cause determination had been made by the judge on January 7, 2011, the Commonwealth was on notice of a potential problem on February 15, when the judge noted that the reports had not yet been received. Indeed, the Commonwealth should have realized even earlier that something might be amiss, as no notation regarding the finding of probable cause had been made on the docket (to which the Commonwealth had access), and the examiners had not yet requested information from the Commonwealth related to Gangi\u2019s previous sexual offenses pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In any event, the Commonwealth was aware that the reports had not been filed on February 22, 2011 (the forty-five day deadline), yet waited until February 28,2011 to inquire of the department. At that time, the Commonwealth did not issue an expedited request, but instead only did so one week after the sixty-day deadline had expired. This is in contrast to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 828, where, on realizing that the report had not been filed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>deadline, the Commonwealth made an immediate request for the report. That request led to the report being filed within eight days and a petition for trial being filed within the sixty-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The motion judge, in excusing the delay, relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 31, 34-35 (2009), which excused the failure to adhere to the deadline for trial set forth in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a), where the defendant acquiesced to the delay. That statute specifically contemplates that the trial of an alleged sexually dangerous person may be delayed for good cause or in the interests of justice. G. L. c. 123 A, \u00a7 14 (a). The statute setting forth the deadline for a petition for trial, however, permits no exceptions to the sixty-day requirement. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a). Just as \u201cit would be inappropriate to import the constraints of [G. L. c. 123A,] \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>which allows no extension of its sixty-day limit, into [G. L. c. 123A,] \u00a7 14 <em>(a),\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeBella, </em>442 Mass. 683, 689 (2004), it would be inappropriate to import the exceptions set forth in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>into G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Furthermore, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra </em>at 34, itself contrasted the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201csole burden and. . . sole power\u201d to meet the G. L. c. 123 A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>deadline with the deadline of setting a trial date, because \u201cthe Commonwealth has neither the sole responsibility nor the sole power to bring the defendant to trial in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The motion judge noted also that, because Gangi himself had requested continuances, his argument concerning the delay was \u201cdisingenuous, at best.\u201d The record, however, indicates that these continuances, which included Gan-gi\u2019s motion for funds to hire an expert psychologist, all occurred before his stipulation to probable cause. After the stipulation, nothing of record indicates delay occasioned by Gangi. Gangi has not challenged the period of delay occurring before the finding of probable cause, and the requests for continuances have no bearing on the proper application of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>in the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
