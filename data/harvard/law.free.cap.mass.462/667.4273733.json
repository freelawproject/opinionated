Because the circumstances of the trial do not support an inference that the trial judge acted out of a desire to preempt an acquittal by the jury, and because the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to support a conviction on both charges, we conclude that retrial is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>The defendant\u2019s claims require, among other things, consideration of the legal sufficiency of the evidence at trial. We therefore present the background facts in some detail, stating them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The defendant and the alleged victim, Carolina Marques, had been romantically involved. On October 30, 2004, Marques told the defendant that she was ending their relationship. Marques spent that night at the residence of Louis Albino, a friend of the defendant\u2019s from Marlborough High School, where they were both students.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">At about 5 a.m. the following morning, Albino was awakened by the sound of knocking on his apartment door; he did not respond. Soon thereafter, he heard sounds at his bedroom window. Recognizing the defendant through the window, Albino asked him what he was doing. The defendant indicated that he was looking for Marques. Despite Albino\u2019s protests, and his assurances that Marques was not in the apartment, the defendant opened the window, \u201cforcefully, and jumped right through\u201d it head first.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cReal[ly] angry\u201d and \u201canxious,\u201d the defendant asked Albino again where Marques was. Not immediately seeing Marques in the room \u2014 she was hiding under the covers of Albino\u2019s bed \u2014 the defendant searched the rest of the apartment, including Albino\u2019s mother\u2019s room. He eventually returned to the bedroom, this time seeing Marques. The defendant pushed Albino out of the room, and closed and locked the bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Through the door, Albino heard the defendant and Marques arguing. When, minutes later,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant opened the door, Marques was crying. Albino told the defendant to \u201cleave her alone,\u201d and the two began arguing as well. In the course of that argument, the defendant threatened to kill Albino.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant \u201cphysically moved\u201d Marques, \u201cbasically put[ting] her in the bathroom.\u201d Seeing this, Albino contacted a police officer with whom he had a personal acquaintance. He alerted the defendant that he had notified the police, and the defendant left, \u201cspeeding\u201d away from the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">b. <em>Proceedings. </em>The defendant was charged in the District Court with breaking and entering with the intent to commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>misdemeanor, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16A, and assault, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13 A. A jury trial began on May 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented testimony from Albino and from two other witnesses, both police officers. Marques did not testify, having not responded to the prosecutor\u2019s repeated attempts to speak with her before trial, and having failed to appear in response to a subpoena.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not seek a continuance, electing instead to proceed without her.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">After the Commonwealth\u2019s final witness had testified, the prosecutor asked for a sidebar, seeking \u201ca minute to see\u201d whether Marques had arrived. While they waited, the judge asked the prosecutor, \u201c[Wjhat\u2019s your last best offer for [the defendant] right now?\u201d The prosecutor reiterated her pretrial offer of a suspended, two and one-half year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The judge then indicated that he would likely be more severe, saying that, if the defendant were convicted on the assault charge, \u201che\u2019s got to do time.\u201d Defense counsel responded that, based on his observation of the trial thus far, and unless the judge were to grant his motion for a required finding of not guilty, it \u201clook[ed] like\u201d the defendant would be convicted of assault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Indicating that he was unlikely to grant the motion, the judge again warned defense counsel that he had not \u201cheard anything why I wouldn\u2019t, based on these circumstances . . . put [the defendant] in jail.\u201d The judge added, \u201c[T]he facts are kind of egregious and, I don\u2019t know why he wasn\u2019t charged with house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>invasion.\u201d At that point, the sidebar conference ended, and defense counsel conferred with his client. Almost immediately thereafter, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The defendant later moved, before the same judge, to vacate his pleas and obtain a new trial. After this motion was granted, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him on double jeopardy grounds, arguing both that the evidence against him at the first trial was insufficient to support convictions on either charge and that, regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence, he should not be forced to face retrial where the first trial terminated as a result of judicial impropriety. A different judge denied this motion, and the defendant sought relief in the county court. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>There is no question, and the Commonwealth does not dispute, that the defendant\u2019s plea was voidable at his option. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>393 Mass. 150, 169 (1984), citing <em>Letters </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>346 Mass. 403, 405, 406 (1963). Accordingly, the sole issue before us is whether the defendant, having recanted his plea, may be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">a. <em>Alleged judicial error. </em>\u201cCorresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing one whose guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tateo, 377 </em>U.S. 463, 466 (1964). We will not lightly preclude the Commonwealth from vindicating the societal interest in a fair adjudication of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Cf. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15 (1978). Rather, where a trial is aborted due to judicial impropriety or error, retrial will generally be barred only where the judge \u201cintended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,\u201d or otherwise intended to preempt the possibility of an acquittal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 752 (2000), and cases cited (\u201cAbsent evidence that the judge acted in bad faith, alleged judicial errors giving rise to a mistrial do not support a claim of double jeopardy\u201d). Evidence of bad faith need not be direct, and intent may be inferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cfrom objective facts and circumstances\u201d surrounding the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The record does not support the inference that the judge acted to prejudice the defendant. The judge assessed the evidence of guilt as being strong,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the record suggests that he expected the jury to agree. Indeed, the transcript of the sidebar conference suggests that all present, including defense counsel, believed that the jury would most likely convict the defendant on the more serious charge of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The defendant places considerable emphasis on Marques\u2019s failure to appear. While the Commonwealth\u2019s case might well have been stronger had Marques chosen to participate, her failure to appear did not prevent the Commonwealth from presenting a full account of the night\u2019s events through Albino\u2019s detailed testimony. We note that the prosecutor did not ask for a continuance when Marques failed to appear and had not previously sought in-hand service on Marques.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Given this context, the natural inference is that the judge did not act out of concern that the defendant would be acquitted. See <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>456 Mass. 146, 152, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 425 (2010) (judicial bad faith will not easily be inferred). We do not condone the judge\u2019s statements at sidebar. Nevertheless, so long as the judge did not act to prejudice the defendant, his actions do not preclude the Commonwealth from retrying the defendant and obtaining a fair adjudication of the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 679. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 311 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>When, after the close of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a criminal trial is aborted for reasons not attributable to the defendant, we \u201cexamine the evidence . . . to determine if it was sufficient to support a guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Hrycenko </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>459 Mass. 503, 507 (2011), quoting <em>Choy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 150. The Commonwealth may only retry the defendant on a charged offense if it presented, at the first trial, legally sufficient proof to sustain a conviction. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 797-798 (1985). The Commonwealth has met this burden as to both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">i. <em>Assault. </em>There is no doubt that the defendant properly could have been convicted of assault on Marques. Albino\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cphysically moved\u201d Marques to another room sufficiently evidenced an offensive touching and, thus, a battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983). This, in turn, suffices to show an assault. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>114 Mass. 303, 304 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">ii. <em>Breaking and entering. </em>The Commonwealth also presented sufficient evidence on the breaking and entering charge. A defendant violates G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16A, if he or she \u201c[1] breaks and [2] enters [3] a building [or other covered structure] [4] with intent to commit a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The Commonwealth presented testimony that the defendant opened and jumped through a bedroom window, which plainly suffices to establish the elements of breaking and entering a building. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>8 Pick. 354, 355 (1829). The defendant emphasizes that \u201c[i]n the lexicon of Massachusetts crimes there is no such crime as \u2018breaking and entering\u2019 unaccompanied by intent to commit a felony or a misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>461 Mass. 1011, 1012 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnicombe, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 934, 935 (1990). The Commonwealth, however, presented evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the defendant entered the apartment intending to commit an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The crime of assault may be committed in one of two ways: by attempting (or achieving) a battery, see part 2.b.i, <em>supra, </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>by engaging in objectively menacing conduct so as to place another in reasonable apprehension of an immediately threatened battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>436 Mass. 291, 294-295 &amp; n.4 (2002), and cases cited. In determining whether the defendant intended, upon breaking and entering the bedroom, to commit either of these forms of assault, the jury would have been entitled to rely upon the objective circumstances surrounding his entry. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lauzier, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 629 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>140 Mass. 451, 453 (1886). Here, whether or not those circumstances permit the inference that the defendant intended to attempt a battery at the time of entry,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> they might reasonably suggest that he intended to (and in fact did) commit an assault by objectively menacing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u201cIn determining whether an apprehension of anticipated physical force is reasonable, a court will look to the actions and words of the defendant in light of the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 349 (1990). As has been indicated before, erratic and unstable behavior, in the context of an escalating and emotional argument, can create a reasonable apprehension that \u201cforce might be used.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 181-182 (1995). See, e.g., <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Blacker, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 143-144 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Here, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the defendant\u2019s behavior was highly erratic and unstable, and quickly escalating. The defendant, who was \u201cangry\u201d and \u201canxious,\u201d had come to Albino\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night, looking for Marques. He entered the apartment forcibly, overcoming Albino\u2019s resistance and jumping in headfirst through the window. He then proceeded to search the whole apartment for Marques. On finding her in Albino\u2019s bed, he \u201cpushed [Albino] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>out of the [bed]room\u201d and locked the bedroom door, secluding Marques from her most obvious source of physical protection. The defendant could be heard through the door arguing with Marques, and he subsequently got into a verbal argument with Albino, during which the defendant threatened to kill Albino.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">To find that the defendant entered with the intent to commit an assault, the jury need not have speculated whether at the time of entry the defendant intended to search the apartment angrily, or to seclude Marques from Albino. It is enough that the jury could have inferred that the defendant intended, notwithstanding Marques\u2019s clear desire to avoid contact with him, to seek her out at 5 a.m., to force his way into a dwelling where she was the overnight guest of another man, and, given his anger, to argue heatedly with her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ro-bicheau, supra </em>at 181 (defendant \u201cgot out of his automobile, stood in the middle of the street in front of [the victim\u2019s] residence, yelled obscene language, and made an obscene gesture\u201d). Such behavior could reasonably have placed Marques in apprehension of an imminently threatened battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 350, for example, the defendant violated an abuse prevention order by appearing at the victim\u2019s house. When the victim opened her front door to retrieve a note left by him, the defendant rested against the door, preventing it from being closed. We determined that, in light of the preexisting tension between the parties, and because the defendant was subject to a legal duty to keep away from the victim, his imposed physical proximity with the victim was sufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Both <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, supra, </em>involved defendants prosecuted for abuse, G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, and subject to abuse prevention orders. However, the conduct punished by the relevant provision of the abuse statute \u201cclosely approximates the common law description of the crime of assault,\u201d and we have treated cases involving either crime interchangeably. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Further, while both Gordon and Robicheau were under preexisting legal duties to keep away from the victims of their assaults, the defendant, too, was under a legal duty not to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Albino\u2019s apartment without permission. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120 (criminal trespass). Neither Gordon nor Robicheau forcibly entered a dwelling in the middle of the night, physically overcoming the efforts of those inside to keep him out. We cannot, therefore, say that Albino\u2019s account of the defendant\u2019s actions discloses conduct any less \u201cerratic and unstable\u201d than that underlying the convictions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra. </em>The jury had before them sufficient evidence to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s intent at the time of entry to place Marques in reasonable apprehension of an imminently threatened battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Having presented sufficient evidence to support convictions at the first trial, and absent a showing that the trial judge acted out of a desire to prejudice the defendant, the Commonwealth may retry the defendant. The judge was correct in denying the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the county court where an order shall enter denying the petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Louis Albino attempted to resist and close the window, but the defendant\u2019s fingers were in the way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Albino was imprecise on the chronology of events but suggested that the entire sequence of events took, \u201cat the most,\u201d twenty minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Although considering Carolina Marques a \u201cnecessary and essential witness,\u201d the prosecutor did not obtain in-hand service of the subpoena, and was therefore unable to compel Marques\u2019s appearance by use of a bench warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The relevant portion of the transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-13\">The judge: \u201cChapter 265 on the assault if he\u2019s hooked on [sz'c] he\u2019s got to do time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-15\">Defense counsel: \u201cI thought that was part of the [inaudible] \u2014 maybe he\u2019s not going to get off on the A&amp;B, but it looks like he\u2019s going to get hooked on the assault unless something strange happens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">Although the import of defense counsel\u2019s statement is arguably ambiguous, the most natural reading is that he thought it likely the jury would vote to convict on the assault charge, the more serious of the two charges. This is the interpretation the Commonwealth adopts in its brief, and the defendant has not taken issue with that interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The defendant does not contend that he has suffered irremediable prejudice \u201cthat prevents the possibility of a fair [rejtrial.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 314 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The United States Supreme Court has not \u201cspecified] factors that might guide the lower courts in such an analysis.

Ct., No. Crim. A. 02-CR-335-1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 26, 2003), and cases cited. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>318 Fed.

Particularly in the context of a rapidly escalating and emotional situation, the Commonwealth must provide some evidence that the defendant did not simply act on the spur of the moment, or as the result of some later provocation, but instead possessed a preformed intent at the time of entry to commit a crime.
