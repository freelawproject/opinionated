Police located the defendant near the scene of the robbery suffering from an apparent gunshot wound to his back, but no witness was able to identify him as the robber. The defendant testified at trial, denying that he was the robber and claiming to have been shot in an unrelated incident by unknown assailants. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17. On appeal, the defendant argues that certain statements allegedly made by the fleeing robber were hearsay and should not have been admitted; that a statement attributed to the defendant contained in his medical records (\u201che was in a taxicab when he got shot\u201d) was inadmissible as hearsay; and that, even if not hearsay, the admission of the medical records violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Because we conclude that the trial judge erred in admitting the defendant\u2019s medical records under the statutory exception for business records, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78 (\u00a7 78), and that the disputed portion of the records was not shown to be admissible under the hospital records statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (\u00a7 79), we do not reach the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim. Determining that the erroneous admission did not prejudice the defendant, however, and that his other claims of error are without merit, we affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>found, reserving certain details for later discussion. In the early morning hours of January 28, 2007, Bienvenido Rodriguez was driving his taxicab, a minivan, when he responded to a dispatch call for a frequent passenger, David Christian, a bartender at a local tavern. Rodriguez picked up Christian, who sat in the first row of seats behind Rodriguez, and drove toward Christian\u2019s destination. As he was turning off Springfield Street, Rodriguez saw a man waving and stopped to pick him up. The man was wearing a dark jacket and a hat that covered his ears and most of his face; he asked to be taken to Lowell Street and got into the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">After driving a few blocks, the man told Rodriguez in Spanish to stop. He then grabbed Rodriguez\u2019s head, brandished a knife, and demanded that Rodriguez show him where he kept his money. A brief struggle ensued before Rodriguez brought the taxicab to an abrupt stop. At some point, Rodriguez gestured to the driver\u2019s side visor, where he kept his money secured by an elastic band. The robber took the money from the visor; he then left the taxicab and ran in the direction of a bridge underpass located at the intersection of Parker and Market Streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Rodriguez got out and pulled a .40 caliber pistol from his waistband.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He struggled with the weapon for a moment, ejecting one live round from the chamber while attempting to disengage the safety. He then fired at least one shot in the direction of the fleeing robber.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Christian, who initially did not realize what was happening, remained in the taxicab throughout the encounter and attempted to reach Lawrence police on his cellular telephone. Michael Caraballo, another taxicab driver who worked for the same company as Rodriguez, drove by Rodriguez\u2019s taxicab just after it had come to a stop. Caraballo and Wilfredo Colon, Carabal-lo\u2019s passenger, both saw Rodriguez struggling with the front-seat passenger. Caraballo pulled over near the bridge at Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>and Market Streets to make radio contact with the taxicab company, then drove back to Rodriguez\u2019s taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Caraballo and Colon observed Rodriguez get out of his taxicab and fire his gun at the robber as the man ran toward the bridge. Rodriguez, Caraballo, and Colon each heard the man exclaim and indicate that he had been hit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He stumbled and momentarily fell to the ground, dropping his hat; he then continued running down Parker Street before turning left onto Market Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Responding to a radio broadcast regarding the incident, Officer Eric Cerollo of the Lawrence police department reached the area less than five minutes after the shooting. He drove around the area in search of the robber, who had been described as a light-skinned Hispanic male in a black leather jacket. Cerollo passed Market Street and turned onto Springfield Street. He had traveled between thirty yards and forty yards when he observed the defendant emerge from an alley between two houses and wave for help. The defendant was wearing a light shirt and no jacket. A Lawrence detective, who also had been in the area, drove down Springfield Street at the same time as Cerollo. The officers approached the defendant, who told Cerollo that he had been shot. Cerollo noticed \u201ca dark blood spot\u201d on the back of the defendant\u2019s shirt; when the defendant opened his shirt, Cer-ullo saw blood \u201cpouring out\u201d from an apparent gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The defendant was transported by ambulance to Lawrence General Hospital, where he denied that he had been in a taxicab before being shot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant was transferred to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston for surgery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>surgery,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> another detective and a police lieutenant interviewed the defendant at the hospital; the defendant consented to audio recording of the interview and signed an acknowledgment of his Miranda rights. The defendant told the detective that he had argued with his wife and left their apartment wearing a black leather shearling jacket and matching hat, and went for a long walk. He first said he had been shot on Market Street. He then said that he had been approached on Parker Street near Market Street by a car full of \u201cpunks,\u201d and that one of the passengers said he wanted the defendant\u2019s jacket. The defendant heard a \u201cpow,\u201d fell, then got up and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Police recovered one spent shell casing and one live round of ammunition from the ground near Rodriguez\u2019s taxicab. Police also found the robber\u2019s fur-lined hat on a sidewalk approximately ten feet behind the taxicab.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) collected from the exterior of the hat was later found to be a match for the defendant\u2019s DNA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Witnesses described the robber as a light-skinned, clean-shaven Hispanic male of average height and medium build, who had been wearing a dark coat and a hat.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial testimony as to where he was shot placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>him several blocks away from the location he had described to the detectives and, consequently, away from the location of the robbery. He denied having been in a taxicab that night, having robbed a taxicab driver, or having been shot by one. He also denied owning the fur-lined hat found at the scene of the robbery and introduced in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The defendant argues that evidence of the fleeing robber\u2019s statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. He claims also that the statement, recorded in his medical records, that he was in a taxicab when he was shot was improperly admitted as a business record and, in any event, violated his right to confront the doctor who authored the report. The defendant contends that, without the erroneously admitted evidence, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The robber\u2019s statements. </em>The defendant challenges testimony from three witnesses regarding statements or exclamations made by the robber just after Rodriguez fired his gun, each to the effect that the robber reacted to having been shot. The defendant argues that the statements or exclamations constitute inadmissible hearsay admitted substantively to establish that the robber was in fact hit by the bullet fired from Rodriguez\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Caraballo testified, without objection, that the robber said, \u201c \u2018He hit me, he hit me\u2019 or \u2018crap\u2019 or something like that.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Colon testified, also without objection, that the robber said, \u201cI got hit, I got hit.\u201d Rodriguez answered a series of questions regarding the sequence of events that began with the robber running from the taxicab and continued to the point that Rodriguez fired his gun. When the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid you see anything occur as [the robber] was running?\u201d Rodriguez was permitted to respond, over the defendant\u2019s objection, \u201cI heard that he said, \u2018Oh, my mother, my mother.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cI heard that he said,\u201d suggests that Rodriguez heard about the robber\u2019s statement from another person and was therefore not testifying from personal knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 657 (2002) (witness may not testify unless evidence supports finding that witness has personal knowledge of matter about which he is testifying). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 602 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony. The question asked Rodriguez to recount a personal observation; based on his answer, provided through a Spanish language interpreter, it may fairly be inferred that Rodriguez was testifying from personal knowledge to what he heard the robber exclaim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the testimony of all three witnesses was properly admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, either as a spontaneous utterance, see Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 803(2), or as an expression of a \u201cpresent physical condition such as pain.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 803(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">A statement is admissible as a spontaneous utterance if \u201c(1) there is an occurrence or event \u2018sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>observer,\u2019 and (2) if the declarant\u2019s statement was \u2018a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623 (2002), quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (5th ed. 1999). We have viewed the circumstances of being shot, or witnessing a shooting, as sufficiently startling to impede normal reflective thought processes. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>456 Mass. 280, 296, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 181 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 391-392 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 215, 222-223 (1973). The witnesses testified that, after the gun was fired, they saw the robber fall and then heard the robber state he had been \u201chit\u201d or utter an exclamation from which it could be inferred that he had been hit. The context and nature of the utterances indicate that the robber was reacting to the experience of sudden pain from a gunshot wound. Because both criteria of the spontaneous utterance exception were satisfied, the testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">This evidence also supports a finding that the testimony related to the robber\u2019s \u201cexpressions of present pain.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>343 Mass. 655, 658 (1962). See <em>Roosa </em>v. <em>Boston Loan Co., </em>132 Mass. 439, 439 (1882). The rule was discussed in <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>7 Cush. 581, 586 (1851):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201cThe rule of law is now well settled, and it forms an exception to the general rules of evidence, that where the bodily or mental feelings of a party are to be proved, the usual and natural expressions of such feelings, made at the time, are considered competent and original evidence in his favor. And the rule is founded upon the consideration, that such expressions are the natural and necessary language of emotion, of the existence of which, from the very nature of the case, there can be no other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Whether the expressions are \u201creal or feigned\u201d is for the jury to determine \u201cby the manner of them, and the circumstances under which they are proved to have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Evidence of such expressions is limited to \u201csuch complaints, exclamations and expressions as usually and naturally accompany, and furnish evidence of, a present existing pain or malady.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>evidence could properly have been admitted as an expression of the robber\u2019s present pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">2. <em>Medical records. </em>At Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a treating physician drafted a one-page report two days after examining the defendant; the report noted, \u201cThe patient states that he was minding his own business while he was in a taxicab when he got shot.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The doctor was not called to testify. Instead, after the judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s statement would have to be redacted if the document were offered under the hospital records statute, \u00a7 79, the Commonwealth sought to establish, through testimony of an \u201cinformation specialist\u201d from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, that the defendant\u2019s hospital medical records qualified as business records. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. The defendant objected, arguing that hospital medical records could not be admitted pursuant to \u00a7 78, but must be admitted, if at all, under \u00a7 79.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge overruled the objection and allowed the medical record that included the defendant\u2019s statement to the doctor to be admitted as a business record. On appeal, the defendant argues also that introduction of the report violated his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment, an argument not made at trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Where a defendant claims that the admission of an out-of-court statement violates his rights under the confrontation clause, we undertake a two-step inquiry. First, we examine whether the statement is admissible under ordinary evidence rules, \u201ci.e., whether it qualifies as a hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Nesbitt, 452 Mass. 236, 243 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>450 Mass. 422, 431 n.6 (2008). If it is admissible pursuant to a hearsay exception, we then consider \u201cwhether admission of the statement is prohibited by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. 534, 548 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">a. <em>Business records exception. </em>In order to determine whether a hearsay exception supports admission of the defendant\u2019s statement, we must first determine whether the defendant\u2019s hospital medical records were properly admitted as business records under \u00a7 78.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have not previously addressed whether hospital medical records, ordinarily admitted through \u00a7 79, may also be admitted as business records under \u00a7 78. The Commonwealth argues that the language of \u00a7 78 supports a broad definition of business records that includes medical records within its ambit, and that \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 79 provide alternative avenues for establishing the admissibility of hospital medical records. In other words, if a party establishes that a hospital medical record meets the statutory predicates to admissibility set forth in \u00a7 78, the Commonwealth contends that the document should be admissible under that provision even if it would not be admissible under \u00a7 79.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that hospital medical records are not admissible under \u00a7 78, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the judge erred in admitting the doctor\u2019s report as a business record.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We begin by examining the statutory scheme governing admission of business and hospital records, applying settled principles of statutory construction. \u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that \u2018statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oil-ers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 162 (2010), quoting <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Statutes that relate to the same subject matter are not to be construed \u201cin a way that produces absurd or unreasonable results when a sensible construction is readily available.\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>400 Mass. 444, 453 (1987). Where two statutory provisions conflict, \u201cwe have stated that the more specific provision, particularly where it has been enacted subsequent to a more general rule, applies over the general rule.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215-216 (1997), citing <em>Lukes </em>v. <em>Election Comm\u2019rs of Worcester, </em>423 Mass. 826, 829 (1996). See 2B N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 51:2 (7th ed. 2008) (\u201cWhere a conflict exists the more specific statute controls over the more general one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Section 78 permits business records to be admitted to prove the truth of statements contained therein if the judge finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201c(1) the entry, writing, or record was made in good faith; (2) in the regular course of business; (3) before the beginning of the civil or criminal proceeding in which it is offered; and (4) it was the regular course of such business to make such memorandum at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence, or event, or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. 535, 548 (2011), citing G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have said that business records meeting these requirements are presumed to be reliable, and therefore admissible, \u201cbecause entries in these records are routinely made by those charged with the responsibility of making accurate entries and are relied on in the course of doing business.\u201d <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 406 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">By contrast, \u00a7 79 provides that \u201c[rjecords kept by hospitals, dispensaries or clinics, and sanatoria\u201d in accordance with State law may be admitted in evidence \u201cso far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases.\u201d Section 79 also includes the specific limitation that nothing contained in the records \u201cshall be admissible as evidence which has reference to the question of liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A related provision governs the admissibility, after certain preconditions have been met, of specified \u201chospital medical records, relating to medical, dental, hospital services, prescriptions, or orthopedic appliances rendered to or prescribed for a person injured, or any report of any examination of said injured person.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G (\u00a7 79G). Such reports are admissible as evidence of the diagnosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>prognosis, and opinions of a physician as to the proximate cause of the condition so diagnosed. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Law </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>457 Mass. 349, 352 (2010); M.S. Brodin &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.11.3, at 539 (8th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Subject to the preconditions and limitations set forth in these provisions, we have considered the contents of hospital medical records to be reliable, \u201cbecause the entries relating to treatment and medical history are routinely made by those responsible for making accurate entries and are relied on in the course of treating patients.\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 685 (1992), citing <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 528 (1978).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the presumptive reliability of hospital medical records, because sections of G. L. c. 233 governing admission of hospital medical records contain specific limitations, the Legislature could not have intended that those limitations could be circumvented merely by invoking \u00a7 78 as the basis for admissibility. See <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Annino, </em>460 Mass. 790, 796 (2011), quoting <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 601 (2010) (we \u201cendeavor to interpret a statute to give effect \u2018to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Our decisions have long recognized that the specific limitations set forth in \u00a7 79 may preclude admission of some aspects of a medical record. In <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 531, we established a four-part test \u201cto determine the admissibility of material contained in a hospital record.\u201d As to the first of these prongs, we have said that \u201cthe document must be the type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>record contemplated by [\u00a7 79].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we interpret the terms of \u00a7 79 liberally, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, </em>457 Mass. 387, 394 (2010), we recognize that the Legislature has created a statute that is limited in scope and \u201cis not to be interpreted as rendering admissible all the contents of hospital records.\u201d <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 528. The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 78 provides an alternative avenue for the introduction of hospital medical records would undermine these limitations and nullify our long-standing interpretation of \u00a7 79. Moreover, although a presumption of reliability is attributed to business as well as to hospital medical records, the provisions of G. L. c. 233 concerning admissibility of these respective types of records were enacted to address different concerns.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Section 78 was enacted as a legislative response to the perception that common-law hearsay rules regarding business records \u201cwere wholly inadequate to meet the needs and realities of a modem industrial and commercial society.\u201d <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., supra </em>at 409 (Liacos, J., concurring), citing 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1521, 1522, 1561a, 1561b (Chad-bourn rev. ed. 1974). The common-law hearsay exception for business records, which permitted a written record made in the usual course of business to be admitted in evidence only if the author had died, see <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Framingham Gas Fuel &amp; Power Co., </em>202 Mass. 359, 366-367 (1909), was regarded as having little relation \u201cto the practical trustworthiness of the documents offered,\u201d 5 J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1561a. The Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 78 reflected its recognition of the reliance that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the modem commercial world placed on the accuracy of routine records created in the course of doing business, and addressed the need for a mle of evidence that embodied society\u2019s confidence in the reliability of those records. See <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., supra </em>at 410 (Liacos, J., concurring), quoting 5 J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1530 (business records \u201care the ultimate basis of calculation, investment, and general confidence in every business enterprise.... It would seem that expedients which the entire commercial world recognize as safe could be sanctioned, and not discredited, by courts of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Section 79, by contrast, was enacted \u201cprimarily to relieve the physicians and nurses of public hospitals from the hardship and inconvenience of attending court as witnesses to facts which ordinarily would be found recorded in the hospital books.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gogan, </em>389 Mass. 255, 263 (1983), quoting <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 482 (1920). As Professor Wigmore described, \u201camidst the day-to-day details of scores of hospital cases, the physicians and nurses can ordinarily recall from actual memory few or none of the specific data entered; they themselves rely upon the record of their own action; hence, to call them to the stand would ordinarily add little or nothing to the information furnished by the record alone.\u201d 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1707 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s decision to authorize the introduction of medical opinions through \u00a7 79G is particularly significant in light of the absence of any similar provision in \u00a7 78 permitting admission of opinions in business records. See <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980), and cases cited. It is apparent that the Legislature, through its enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 79 and 79G, intended that medical records be treated differently from the records of other businesses. Cf. <em>Ricciardi </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>811 F.2d 18, 21-22 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir. 1987) (contrasting separate Massachusetts statutes governing business records and medical records with Federal Rules of Evidence, which contain only one rule governing such records which is \u201cnot specifically aimed at hospital records\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Our understanding of the differences between the provisions on business and medical records was expressed in an early decision, <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>278 Mass. 101, 109-111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>(1932), which addressed the relationship between \u00a7 79 and the common-law public records exception. In that case, the plaintiff sought to admit the statement of a decedent that had been recorded in her hospital record. He claimed that the statement, offered to support his claim of liability, was admissible as a declaration of a deceased person under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 65, and that the record was admissible as a public record; as such, the plaintiff claimed, the entry \u201cconstituted prima facie evidence that the fact so stated was true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that \u00a7 79 provided for the admission in evidence of records relating to treatment and medical history, but that evidence of liability was not admissible. We said that \u00a7 79 \u201cby its true construction does not give probative force to entries in hospital records which as to their admissibility and evidentiary value depend upon other provisions of the statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110-111. Interpreting the separate provisions within G. L. c. 233 \u201cso as to constitute an harmonious and consistent body of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 111, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201cThe final clause of \u00a7 79, to the effect that entries in such hospital records shall not be competent upon the question of liability, forbids the use of declarations of deceased persons in the way here urged. Hospital records do not become admissible as general public records to any greater or other extent than permitted by said \u00a7 79.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Since that time, our decisions have concluded consistently that where a patient\u2019s medical records are involved \u2014 that is, where the documents involve \u201cmedical facts\u201d about a patient, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577, 580 (1971) \u2014 admissibility of those records must be determined under \u00a7 79. See <em>McClean </em>v. <em>University Club, </em>327 Mass. 68, 75 (1951) (\u201cHospital records are hearsay evidence which are made competent evidence subject to the conditions and limitations prescribed by the statute\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>457 Mass. 387, 394-395 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>413 Mass. 570, 573-574 (1992); <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 685 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 579-580.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We conclude that the business records hearsay exception in \u00a7 78 may not be used to expand the scope of the hearsay exception for hospital medical records. The admissibility of statements in medical records is limited by the provisions in G. L. c. 233 relating to hospital records, including \u00a7\u00a7 79 and 79G. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of his medical records under \u00a7 78 should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">b. <em>Hospital records exception. </em>Our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s medical records were not admissible under \u00a7 78 does not resolve whether the hearsay statement at issue was otherwise admissible under \u00a7 79. We conclude that it was not. As the judge determined implicitly, the statement recorded in the defendant\u2019s hospital medical records \u2014 \u201cpatient states that he was minding his own business while he was in a taxicab when he got shot\u201d \u2014 does not, on its face, bear any apparent relationship to the defendant\u2019s treatment or medical history. Thus, without testimony or additional evidence to establish that the statement was germane to the defendant\u2019s treatment or medical history, see <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 531 (1978), the defendant\u2019s statement contained in his medical records was not admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule provided by \u00a7 79.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">c. <em>Confrontation clause. </em>Because we conclude that the portion of the defendant\u2019s medical records containing his statement was not admissible under any exception to the rule against hearsay, we need not reach the question whether introduction of the statement violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>534, 548 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>455 Mass. 437, 441 (2009). Nevertheless, because the issue has been fully briefed by the parties and amicus curiae, we discuss briefly the relationship between medical records and the confrontation clause. See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 522 (2007) (addressing claim where \u201cfully briefed and argued\u201d and resolution would aid public policy in eliminating uncertainty on issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The confrontation clause bars the admission of testimonial out-of-court statements by a witness who does not appear at trial unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had an earlier opportunity for cross-examination. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004). Whether a particular statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d lies at the core of this analysis. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 823-824 (2006). In <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 312 n.2 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz), the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cmedical reports created for treatment purposes\u201d are not testimonial under the Sixth Amendment. Cf. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 376 (2008) (\u201cstatements to physicians in the course of receiving treatment\u201d are not subject to Sixth Amendment strictures). Although directed to different concerns, the class of medical records that do not constitute testimonial statements, as articulated by the Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>is substantially similar to the type of hospital records admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>under \u00a7 79. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>423 Mass. 373, 376 (1996), quoting <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra </em>at 531 (\u00a7 79 \u201ccontemplates recorded information that relates to medical treatment and to history obtained \u2018for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Because of these similarities, where statements contained in hospital medical records demonstrate, on their face, that they were included for the purpose of medical treatment, that evident purpose renders the statements both nontestimonial as to the author of the record, and as falling within the scope of \u00a7 79. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 340, 343-345 (2005) (\u201cThere is no doubt in this case that the medical personnel obtained and recorded the information contained in the medical records for the purpose of treating the defendant\u201d; \u201c[t]he notations . . . clearly are related to evaluating his condition at the time of his admission\u201d and are therefore non-testimonial). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 241-242 (1998) (holding, prior to <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>that references to reported cause of wife\u2019s injuries were plainly admissible under \u00a7 79, but statements reporting ultimate conclusion of crime charged should have been redacted).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">d. <em>Effect of erroneously admitted statement. </em>Having determined that, in this case, it was error to admit the defendant\u2019s medical records as business records, we consider whether the error prejudiced the defendant. See note 17, <em>supra. </em>An error is not prejudicial if it \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(1994). If we cannot conclude \u201c \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 then it is prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra. </em>We conclude that there was no prejudice from the erroneous admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case was not dependent on the asserted admission by the defendant, but focused on evidence that police found the defendant with a gunshot wound to his back not far from the scene of the robbery, and within only minutes of Rodriguez\u2019s shooting the robber as he fled. Witnesses testified that the robber fell (a description that matched the defendant\u2019s own statement regarding his response to having been shot in the back by \u201cpunks\u201d), and exclaimed or stated he had been \u201chit.\u201d Additionally, DNA evidence connected the defendant to the robber\u2019s black, fur-lined hat, as did the defendant\u2019s own admission that on the night in question he had been wearing a hat that matched his black leather shearling jacket. Thus, there was strong circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt that was strengthened by evidence of the defendant\u2019s numerous inconsistent statements to police regarding his whereabouts and actions on the night of the robbery. See <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 106, 111 (1994) (\u201cInconsistent statements may be interpreted as showing consciousness of guilt\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 348 (1957) (consciousness of guilt may be inferred from defendant\u2019s wilfully false statements).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Committee for Public Counsel Services in support of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Bienvenido Rodriguez was licensed to carry the firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The testimony varied as to how many times and in what direction Rodriguez fired the gun.

See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(2)(A) (2012). In order for a statement to be admissible as an admission of the defendant, the judge must make a preliminary finding of fact that the defendant made the statement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>459 Mass. 165, 174 (2011); Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 104(a). Because the relevance of the statement is conditional on this preliminary finding of fact, the judge must also instruct the jury to consider the evidence only if they find that the defendant made the statement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 234 (2000) (statements made by coventurers); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 22 &amp; n.1 (1980) (dying declaration). See also Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 104(b). In light of the evidence in this case, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant made the statement that he was shot only if they concluded from other evidence that he was the person shot by Rodriguez and, therefore, was the person who robbed Rodriguez. Because we conclude that the statement is admissible on other grounds we need not address whether, in the unique circumstances of this case, the statement would have been admissible as an admission of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The pertinent paragraph of the report reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In essence, this is a 36-year-old male who was transferred from an outside facility status post GSW to the back exiting his abdomen.

The parties agree, as the Commonwealth states in its brief, that the defendant intended to cite \u00a7 79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Although the defendant objected to the introduction of the treating physician\u2019s report at trial, the objection was not based on his right to confrontation or any other alleged constitutional infirmity. Consequently, any violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution would be reviewed for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>461 Mass. 126, 129-130 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Although the defendant argues in his brief that the statement attributed to him by the doctor was irrelevant to treatment and diagnosis and therefore was inadmissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (\u00a7 79), he did not argue explicitly that the admissibility of hospital records is limited to that statute. At oral argument, however, counsel for the defendant reiterated his claim, made below, that the Commonwealth had impermissibly used G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78 (\u00a7 78), to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the limitations of \u00a7 79. We therefore consider the defendant\u2019s claim to have been preserved and review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that, because the defendant\u2019s statement in the doctor\u2019s report was not admitted for its truth but for its falsity and, thus, was not hearsay, we need not reach the question whether the statement was properly admitted under \u00a7 78. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 116-117 (2002). Here, although the statement also could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>used to impeach the defendant\u2019s trial testimony that he was not in the taxicab, it was not admitted for that purpose; its primary function was to place the defendant in the taxicab where the robbery he was charged with committing took place. This view of the evidence is supported by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, in which he stated: \u201cI\u2019d suggest to you he was in the taxicab and that he wasn\u2019t minding his own business unless his business was robbing the taxicab driver.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Section 78 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cAn entry in an account kept in a book or by a card system or by any other system of keeping accounts, or a writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, shall not be inadmissible in any civil or criminal proceeding as evidence of the facts therein stated because it is transcribed or because it is hearsay or self-serving, if the court finds that the entry, writing or record was made in good faith in the regular course of business and before the beginning of the civil or criminal proceeding aforesaid and that it was the regular course of such business to make such memorandum or record at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.

Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 356-358 (2010) (because objection at trial to admission of certificates of drug analysis would have been futile under our decisional law prior to <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>we treat confrontation clause claim as preserved on appeal). Had the defendant preserved his constitutional claim, our review would be to determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 586 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Where, however, it is unclear whether a statement relates to treatment or medical history, the party offering the records must establish through additional evidence that the record is admissible under \u00a7 79. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 16 (1985) (party offering medical records bears burden of establishing admissibility). Such evidence will ordinarily be offered through the testimony of medical personnel who treated the patient and are in a position to provide medical context about the information contained in the document. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, </em>457 Mass. 387, 393 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeOliveira, </em>447 Mass. 56, 62 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 855 (2010). In-court testimony from the author of a medical record, introduced to establish that it was made for purposes of medical treatment, also addresses any confrontation clause issues concerning that record because the author is made available for cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">A trial judge is not required to instruct on consciousness of guilt; the evidence suggesting consciousness of guilt may simply be left \u201cfor the jury\u2019s reflection unadorned by comment either by [counsel] or the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 435-436 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
