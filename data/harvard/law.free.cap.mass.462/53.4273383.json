The defendant appeals from his conviction and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. He argues there were errors relating to the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses; the trial judge\u2019s instruction concerning consciousness of guilt was erroneous; and his trial counsel was ineffective in several respects. The defendant raises other claims that we discuss <em>infra. </em>For the reasons discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>below, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. We also decline to exercise our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to order a new trial or enter a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Evidence at trial. </em>We recite the facts as the jury could have found them. In May of 1994, the defendant was a member of Los Solidos, a gang active in the city of Springfield. At that time, Los Solidos was \u201cat war\u201d with rival gangs, including La Familia and the Latin Kings. The conflicts between the gangs arose from disputes over drug territory. The victim, Sylvia Ramirez, was a member of La Familia, serving as that gang\u2019s \u201cgodmother.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was an \u201cenforcer\u201d for Los Solidos. In this capacity, he was responsible for enforcing various gang rules and ensuring that gang \u201cmissions\u201d were completed. On missions, Los Solidos gang members would exact violence against rival gang members as a means of dealing with various disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Members of Los Solidos often congregated and socialized at the apartment of Jessica Nieves, located at the comer of State and Terrence Streets in Springfield. On May 27, 1994, the day before Ramirez was killed, approximately fifteen members of Los Solidos, including the defendant, gathered at Nieves\u2019s apartment. Erasmos Santos Vega, a \u201csoldier\u201d in Los Solidos, was also at the apartment that day. (Soldiers held the lowest rank in the strict hierarchy of Los Solidos.) Vega made his living stealing cars; he also stole them for Los Solidos. The defendant told Vega of his desire to be elevated to the position of \u201cchief warlord\u201d by the \u201cpresident\u201d of Los Solidos, Miguel Moure, and that it would be necessary to \u201chit five people\u201d to be promoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Later that day, Moure made an appearance at Nieves\u2019s apartment. After saluting Los Solidos members present, Moure went into the apartment\u2019s bathroom with the defendant and discussed the need to \u201cdo something.\u201d The defendant subsequently sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>moned Vega to the bathroom, where he informed Vega that he was responsible for procuring a car for an upcoming mission. The defendant and Vega then left the bathroom and went into the adjacent bedroom, where they were joined by Moure. The defendant repeated his wish to \u201chit five people,\u201d and the three then discussed where the mission should take place. The defendant suggested Locust Street in Springfield because it was the home of the La Familia\u2019s godmother. After Moure confirmed that Locust Street would be the site of the first hit, the defendant told Vega again that it was his responsibility to procure a car for the mission, and that if he failed to do so he would be subject to a \u201cbounce\u201d \u2014 a beating at the hands of Los Soli-dos enforcers. The defendant thereafter told Nieves that Ramirez, as godmother of La Familia, \u201chad to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">At some point after the end of the meeting in the bedroom, the defendant and another member of Los Solidos took out two guns \u2014 referred to as the \u201cChrome 9\u201d and the \u201c44\u201d \u2014 belonging to Los Solidos that were stored in Nieves\u2019s bedroom. The defendant cleaned the \u201cChrome 9\u201d and some ammunition before reinserting the ammunition in the gun. Later the same night, Vega stole a car from a parking lot in Holyoke, drove the car back to Springfield, and parked it in a prearranged location.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The next day, May 28, three members of Los Solidos \u2014 Wilfredo Rosado, Jose Carrasquillo, and Travis DeJesus \u2014 met on High Street in Springfield, outside of Dejesus\u2019s apartment. DeJesus held the position of a \u201cwarlord\u201d in Los Solidos; Rosado and Carrasquillo were both soldiers. Among Dejesus\u2019s responsibilities was distributing weapons for Los Solidos missions. To that end, DeJesus provided the \u201cChrome 9\u201d firearm to Carrasquillo. Rosado, Carrasquillo, and DeJesus were then joined by the defendant, who asked DeJesus if Rosado and Carrasquillo knew \u201cwhat was up.\u201d DeJesus confirmed that the two knew \u201cwhat to do\u201d; Rosado testified at trial that he had understood the goal of the mission was to kill a member of La Familia on Locust Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The defendant, Rosado, and Carrasquillo then retrieved the car that Vega had stolen the day before. They departed for the mission, with Rosado driving, Carrasquillo occupying the front passenger seat, and the defendant sitting in one of the rear seats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>As Rosado began to drive down Walnut Street, the defendant, apparently nervous and stuttering, abruptly asked to be let out of the car, stating that he needed to get to \u201cthe Getty,\u201d a gasoline station near Nieves\u2019s apartment where Los Solidos members often congregated. Rosado offered to give the defendant a ride, but the defendant declined and instructed them, \u201cYou guys just keep going.\u201d Rosado then let the defendant out of the car. The defendant did not tell Rosado and Carrasquillo to abort or otherwise abandon the mission, and Rosado and Carrasquillo continued driving to Locust Street.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Rosado drove down Locust Street a first time, and saw two different groups of people congregated outside: a group containing some children, and another that included some La Familia gang members, identifiable by their gang colors. When Rosado drove down the street a second time, only the group of La Fa-milia members remained outside. Rosado then slowed down as he approached the group of La Familia members, and Car-rasquillo pointed the \u201cChrome 9\u201d out of the window and fired five or six shots. Ramirez, who was sitting on the front steps of 190 Locust Street with several friends, was struck on the right side of her head by a projectile fired from the \u201cChrome 9\u201d; the projectile may have ricocheted off of a hard surface before striking her. After the shooting Rosado drove the vehicle to Edwards Street in Springfield, where he and Carrasquillo wiped it down and set it on fire. Ramirez died as a result of a brain injury sustained from the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Three weeks later, on June 20, 1994, two Springfield police officers went to Nieves\u2019s State Street apartment to retrieve Rabi\u00f3la Ocampo, a fifteen year old girl who was classified as a \u201crunaway,\u201d and who they suspected was staying in the apartment with Nieves. When the officers arrived, they knocked on the door and identified themselves. At the time there was a group of more than ten people gathered in the apartment. The defendant was present and was holding the \u201cChrome 9\u201d that had been used by Carrasquillo on May 28. Looking through the door\u2019s peephole, the defendant observed the police, quickly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>retreated into the living room, and threw the gun under a couch. Nieves eventually allowed the officers into apartment. While there, the police located Ocampo as well as Frances Gonzalez, another fifteen year old runaway who was at the time the defendant\u2019s girl friend. They also found \u2014 and seized \u2014 three guns, including the \u201cChrome 9\u201d that was under the couch. After the police left, the defendant said, \u201cDamn, I hope Jerry<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> doesn\u2019t buy it. That\u2019s the gun that killed Sylvia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Approximately one week after the police came to Nieves\u2019s apartment, Gonzalez went to Puerto Rico, where she stayed with the defendant\u2019s mother. In early July, the defendant also departed for Puerto Rico, joining Gonzalez and staying with his mother. Two months after their arrival in Puerto Rico, Gonzalez and the defendant ended their relationship. Gonzalez was picked up by her father and returned to Springfield; the defendant remained in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">b. <em>Other facts.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The initial investigation into Ramirez\u2019s death focused on Frankie Velazquez and Pedro Cotto, two members of Los Solidos who had been identified to the police by La Familia members. Although Velazquez and Cotto were charged with Ramirez\u2019s murder, the charges against them were dropped after the police began to have doubts about the accounts provided by the members of La Familia. Subsequent statements provided by various members and associates of Los Solidos implicated several members, including Moure, Carrasquillo, Vega, and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Indictments of these four individuals followed, although not all at the same time. The defendant was initially indicted for conspiracy to commit murder on September 13, 1994. In June of 1995, he was arrested in Puerto Rico on the conspiracy charge and extradited to Massachusetts. On January 11,1996, the defendant was indicted as an accessory before the fact to murder, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2. Moure, Carrasquillo, Rosado, and Vega also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>were charged with the murder of Ramirez or with being an accessory before the fact to her murder. Carrasquillo was tried and found not guilty of murder in June, 1995. Moure was tried and convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree in December, 1995. The defendant similarly was tried and convicted as an accessory before the fact to murder in September, 1996.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Rosado, who had been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, later entered into a \u201ccooperation agreement\u201d with the Hampden County district attorney\u2019s office, pursuant to which he testified at the three trials just described. Rosado later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and so much of the murder indictment as would constitute manslaughter, and was sentenced to from twelve to fifteen years in State prison. Vega had been charged as an accessory before the fact to murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Vega testified as a witness for the prosecution at the defendant\u2019s and Moure\u2019s trials. Vega subsequently pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge and to so much of the accessory charge as would constitute manslaughter, and was sentenced to from nine to ten years in State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal was entered in this court on February 23, 1998; on September 21, 1998, the court granted a stay of his appeal to allow the defendant to file a motion for a new trial. That motion was not filed in the trial court until May 5, 2008. The trial judge held a nonevidentiary hearing on the motion in March of 2009, and thereafter denied it in a comprehensive memorandum of decision. The defendant\u2019s appeals from his conviction and the denial of his new trial motion have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>When this court reviews a defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial in conjunction with his direct appeal from an underlying conviction of murder or accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree, we review both under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (\u00a7 33E). See note 1, <em>supra. </em>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>450 Mass. 704, 711 (2008); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. Nieves, 429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 294 &amp; n.8 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">a. <em>Testimony of Rosado and Vega. A </em>number of the defendant\u2019s claims of error concern the trial testimony of Rosado and Vega. Specifically, he argues that the prosecutor knowingly and improperly failed to correct allegedly false testimony by these witnesses about their cooperation agreements; and his trial counsel was ineffective in not challenging the admissibility of Rosado\u2019s and Vega\u2019s testimony on several different grounds. The defendant\u2019s claims relating to the testimony of Rosado and Vega were the subject of his motion for a new trial. We review the motion judge\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348 (2004), and \u201caccord special deference to the action of a motion judge who was also the trial judge,\u201d as in this case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shu-man, </em>445 Mass. 268, 272 (2005). Under \u00a7 33E, the standard of review we apply to both claims focuses on whether the alleged errors created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice; we must examine in particular \u201cwhether there was an error . . . (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 393 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">(i) <em>Claim of prosecutorial misconduct: misleading testimony concerning nature and terms of cooperation agreement. </em>At trial, Rosado testified pursuant to his cooperation agreement with the district attorney\u2019s office. His testimony provided details concerning the May 27, 1994, meeting of Los Solidos members in Nieves\u2019s apartment and statements he heard the defendant make at that time concerning the mission to kill Ramirez; Rosado\u2019s conversation on May 28 with the defendant, Carrasquillo, and DeJesus; and the actual execution of the mission on May 28, including driving the car stolen by Vega to Locust Street where Ramirez was killed, and the defendant\u2019s exit from that car before Rosado and Carrasquillo reached Locust Street. Vega similarly testified under his cooperation agreement. His testimony included, as topics, the May 27 meeting in Nieves\u2019s apartment, the defendant\u2019s desire to be elevated to the position of chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>warlord in Los Solidos, and Vega\u2019s own role in stealing the car for the mission on the defendant\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Rosado stated, in response to questions on direct examination by the prosecutor about Rosado\u2019s understanding of his cooperation agreement, that his cooperation would be \u201ctaken into consideration,\u201d and \u201cfor all I know, I\u2019m doing life.\u201d On cross-examination he stated that \u201c[tjhere was no deal worked out,\u201d but confirmed that he was \u201choping for some consideration from the District Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d The defendant asserts that this testimony was false and misleading in relation to the true terms of the agreement that Rosado\u2019s counsel in fact had worked out, and the prosecutor\u2019s presentment of the false view through Ro-sado violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights. The defendant asserts that Vega failed to reveal that, in exchange for a written statement provided to police on August 26, 1994, the \u201cprosecution team\u201d intervened and postponed for two weeks his being sent to a State prison to serve a sentence imposed in a separate case in a different county, during which time he was held in custody in one and then a second county jail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant argues that Vega\u2019s presentation of \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d testimony concerning his cooperation agreement and the prosecutor\u2019s elicitation of this testimony deprived him of the opportunity to inform the jury of issues affecting Vega\u2019s bias and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The motion judge rejected these claims, determining that the entire sum and substance of the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement with each witness was that the witness would be given \u201cconsideration\u201d in exchange for his testimony, \u201cand nothing more.\u201d The judge further concluded that the prosecutor had not misled the jury by declining to correct the witnesses\u2019 statements that they were not aware of any \u201cdeal\u201d made by their lawyers with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the Commonwealth, and that they were only \u201choping\u201d for consideration. The judge agreed with the Commonwealth that it would have been reasonably clear to the jury that the witnesses were not suggesting they did not have cooperation agreements, but rather indicating that under the terms of those agreements, the amount of \u201cconsideration\u201d \u2014 i.e., the actual reduction in the sentences the prosecutor might recommend be imposed after a guilty plea by the witness \u2014 was not yet defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">A defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated where the prosecution does not disclose evidence that is material to the issue of guilt, including \u201c[ejvidence tending to impeach the credibility of a key prosecution witness . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 715 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. 1, 8 (1982). \u201cUnderstandings, agreements, promises, or any similar arrangements between the government and a significant government witness [are] exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 715-716. Furthermore, \u201cwhere the witness\u2019s credibility is a critical issue in the case, the requirements of due process also mandate that the jury be aware of \u2018evidence of any understanding or agreement as to a future prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, 361 </em>Mass. 454, 460 (1975), quoting <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-155 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The record supports the motion judge\u2019s analysis and subsequent rejection of the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial error and violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. There is no dispute that the prosecutor informed the defendant\u2019s counsel before trial that both Rosado and Vega had entered cooperation agreements with the Commonwealth. Moreover, the prosecutor explicitly stated in his opening that both Vega and Rosado had done so, and made the point again in his direct examination of each witness. As the judge found, nothing in the record indicates there was any specificity to either cooperation agreement beyond a commitment by the district attorney that \u201cconsideration\u201d would be given to the witness with respect to resolution of the pending charges against him after he testified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 710-713, 713-714 (upholding motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>judge\u2019s conclusion that Commonwealth had promised to dismiss or at least reduce specific drug charges against witness in consideration for his testimony at defendant\u2019s trial but had not disclosed existence or terms of agreement to defendant; order granting new trial affirmed). Any equivocation by Rosado or Vega concerning the terms of his cooperation agreement appeared to reflect the witness\u2019s uncertainty regarding the exact contours of the consideration he would receive. As the motion judge noted, this court has recognized that \u201cthe very nature of the situation may well require that [the agreement\u2019s] terms be vague as the consideration given may be dependent on the degree of cooperation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">(ii) <em>Admissibility of Rosado\u2019s testimony. </em>The defendant argues that Rosado improperly agreed to testify to a specific version of events in exchange for consideration, irrespective of the truth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the investigation into Ramirez\u2019s murder, Rosado provided three written statements to police. On cross-examination, he conceded that the first and second statements were mostly \u201clies,\u201d but that his third and final statement, provided on September 29, 1994, was truthful. The defendant argues that a review of Rosado\u2019s testimony at the earlier murder trial of Jose Carrasquillo would have revealed that in exchange for \u201cconsideration,\u201d Rosado agreed to testify in conformity with his final statement to police without regard for its truth, and the terms of this agreement rendered his testimony inadmissible under this court\u2019s unrelated decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rosado, 408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Mass. 561, 565 (1990).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the defendant\u2019s view, his trial counsel failed to pick up on this fatal flaw in Rosado\u2019s testimony, with the result that counsel improperly failed to challenge its admissibility in the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">As indicated, the defendant presented this claim in his motion for a new trial. The judge reviewed the portion of Rosado\u2019s testimony in the Carrasquillo trial on which the defendant premised his claim in the context of the entirety of Rosado\u2019s testimony at that trial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201ca fair reading of Rosado\u2019s entire testimony is that he was testifying in conformity with his final statement not because he had promised to stick to it under any and all circumstances without regard to its truth or falsity, but simply because it was truthful.\u201d The judge went on to reason that at the Carrasquillo trial, very competent defense counsel had never sought to exclude Rosado\u2019s testimony on the basis that Rosado had agreed, impermissibly, to testify in a particular way without reference to the truth, or even raised the issue at all; similarly, in the trial of Miguel Moure, no such claim had been raised at trial or on appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that at the defendant\u2019s trial as well as, on a more extensive basis, at Moure\u2019s trial, Rosado had testified that his final statement to the police was the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The judge\u2019s consideration of what approach was taken to Rosado\u2019s similar testimony introduced at the two previous and related trials was appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>408 Mass. at 563-565. Moreover, our own reading of the transcripts of Rosado\u2019s testimony at the Carrasquillo and Moure trials<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> supports the judge\u2019s view that Rosado had not agreed, as the condition of receiving prosecutorial \u201cconsideration\u201d in his own case, to testify to the contents of his third statement regardless of whether it was true.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no error in the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sion of Rosado\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial, and his counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge it.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">(iii) <em>Voluntariness of Vega\u2019s statements. </em>The defendant argues that Vega\u2019s trial testimony should have been suppressed and not presented at trial because it was derived from Vega\u2019s statements to the police that were made involuntarily.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The motion judge stated that there was some support in the record for the finding that Vega<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was pressured and threatened at the hands of the police before he gave his initial statement, but the police actions \u201cfell far short\u201d of the type of misconduct that would justify exclusion of Vega\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">As a general matter, \u201cpersons not themselves the victims of illegal government conduct typically lack standing to assert the constitutional rights of others.\u201d <em>LaFrance </em>v. Bohlinger, 499 F.2d 29, 34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>LaFrance </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>419 U.S. 1080 (1974). Cf. <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>661 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (party challenging statute on equal protection grounds may generally not claim standing to vindicate third party\u2019s constitutional rights). A basis for excluding evidence does exist where it is derived from government misconduct that is \u201cdistinctly egregious.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scardamaglia, </em>410 Mass. 375, 380 (1991). We agree with the motion judge that the record contains no evidence suggesting that Vega was subject to \u201cextreme coercion or torture,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 378 n.l, or to \u201cdistinctly egregious\u201d conduct at the hands of police. <em>Id. </em>at 380. See note 17, <em>supra. </em>In addition, as the judge observed, Vega\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial came two years after his alleged mistreatment by the police, and he entered into the cooperation agreement with the district attorney\u2019s office only after he was represented and advised by independent counsel \u2014 factors that removed or at least mitigated any taint associated with the earlier alleged mistreatment by police.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As with Rosado, we find no error associated with the admission of Vega\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial, and therefore, no ineffectiveness of counsel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">b. <em>Consciousness of guilt instruction. </em>At trial, the judge, over the defendant\u2019s objection, instructed the jury on consciousness of guilt. On appeal, the defendant challenges the fact that the instruction was given, as well as its contents. His challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the fact of the instruction was preserved, and therefore we review the claim for prejudicial error. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. 535, 556 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 453 (2008). We review the contents of the instruction under \u00a7 33E to determine whether, if there was error, it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">A consciousness of guilt instruction is permissible where \u201cthere is an \u2018inference of guilt that may be drawn from evidence of flight, concealment, or similar acts,\u2019 such as false statements to the police, destruction or concealment of evidence, or bribing or threatening a witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. at 453, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584 n.4 (1982). Furthermore, \u201c[fjlight is perhaps the classic evidence of consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 277 (1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, supra </em>at 583 (\u201cEvidence that a person flees from the scene of a crime or from his usual environs may be probative of a consciousness of guilt regardless of whether he has actual knowledge that he is being sought by the police\u201d). Here, the evidence showed that when the police came to Nieves\u2019s apartment on June 20, 1994, the defendant was holding the \u201cChrome 9\u201d and hastily took steps to hide it; the defendant was upset when the police found and seized the weapon, stating to his compatriots that it was the gun used to kill Ramirez; the \u201cChrome 9\u201d in fact was shown by forensic testing to have been the murder weapon; the defendant did not return to Nieves\u2019s apartment after June 20; and he left Massachusetts for Puerto Rico within a few weeks, not to return until approximately one year later, under arrest for conspiracy to commit the murder of Ramirez. Although it is true that the \u201cChrome 9\u201d weapon is not directly connected to the charge of accessory before the fact to murder of Ramirez, its link to the crime is obvious, and the jury could infer that the defendant was worried that seizure of the weapon used in the murder would connect him to the crime. That the defendant did not leave Springfield until some weeks after June 20 is not dispositive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. at 553 (three weeks between murder and defendant\u2019s flight justified consciousness of guilt instruction). Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s alternate explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tion for his trip to Puerto Rico did not detract from the sufficiency of the evidence of consciousness of guilt, but rather created a jury question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>431 Mass. 86, 97 (2000), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 470-471 (1982) (\u201cWhen there are multiple possible explanations for a defendant\u2019s flight, it is for the jury to decide if the defendant\u2019s actions resulted from consciousness of guilt or some other reason\u201d). The judge did not abuse his discretion or commit other error of law in instructing the jury on consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We turn to the contents of the instruction given. The defendant argues that the judge misstated vital facts when he told jurors that they had \u201cheard evidence suggesting that the defendant may have fled from Massachusetts <em>after he discovered that he was about to be charged with the offense for which he is now on </em>trial\u201d (emphasis added). As just stated, the evidence at trial would permit an inference that as of June 20, 1994, the defendant was aware the police might connect him in some way to the murder of Ramirez, but we agree that there was no evidence the defendant fled the Commonwealth \u201cafter he discovered that he was about to be charged\u201d with accessory before the fact to murder; this portion of the judge\u2019s charge was erroneous.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tu Trinh, </em>458 Mass. 776, 782 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Despite this error, no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice was created because the judge\u2019s misstatement of the evidence was unlikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. 728, 742 n.21 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Immediately after the misstatement quoted above, the trial judge reemphasized the jurors\u2019 exclusive role as fact finders,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and told them that he mentioned the evidence \u201conly to illustrate the legal point involved,\u201d namely, that evidence of flight, if proved by the Commonwealth, might be considered by them as evidence of consciousness of guilt, although there were other, innocent explanations of and inferences to be drawn from flight if the jury found it to have occurred \u2014 in other words, all the considerations set forth by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. at 585-586 &amp; n.6. We are confident that the judge\u2019s comprehensive consciousness of guilt instruction was sufficient to insulate the jury from the erroneous misstatement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tu Trinh, </em>458 Mass. at 782. Moreover, the case against the defendant was strong; the evidence suggesting flight was a small part of the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">c. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>We have reviewed a number of the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claims in earlier sections of this opinion; we consider the remaining claims here. The defendant argues that the decision of trial counsel to call as a defense witness Ricardo Negron, a newly-joined member of Los Solidos in May of 1994, was manifestly unreasonable and constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. 93, 102 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 822 (1998) (\u201cA decision whether and when to call a witness is a matter of tactical strategy, giving rise to error only when the decision to call the witness was \u2018manifestly unreasonable when made\u2019 \u201d). This is a relatively high burden: \u201cOnly \u2018strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent\u2019 are manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, supra </em>at 98, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass. 345, 353 (1982). If counsel\u2019s behavior falls below this threshold, we evaluate whether the resulting error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Here, the motion judge found that counsel\u2019s decision to call Negron could not be deemed manifestly unreasonable, because counsel believed, based on the interview his investigators conducted with Negron, that Negron would testify that no meeting occurred in Nieves\u2019s apartment on May 27,1994 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 testimony that could reasonably be thought to help undermine the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case and the credibility of the various witnesses called by the Commonwealth who testified that the plan to murder Ramirez was formed on May 27, and the defendant was the one who gave the orders to carry it out.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge also found that counsel believed, again based on his investigators\u2019 interview, that Negron would testify he was shot before Ramirez was killed \u2014 testimony that had the potential of undermining the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that Negron was shot in retaliation for the murder of Ramirez by individuals who were members of La Familia.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is true that Negron did not testify wholly as the defendant\u2019s trial counsel expected. The defendant on appeal argues that Negron\u2019s testimony \u201ceffectively destroyed the defense,\u201d and even if Negron had testified in accordance with the report provided to defense counsel by his investigators, the effect \u201cwould have been only slightly less devastating.\u201d These broad, conclusory statements do not persuade us that the motion judge\u2019s characterization of defense counsel\u2019s decision to call Negron was in error; as the judge stated, in the end, while one might conclude that Negron had not helped the defendant and even may have harmed his case, such an \u201cobservation is made with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.\u201d But what matters in evaluating counsel\u2019s trial strategy is whether the plan to call Negron was unreasonable <em>\u201cwhen </em>made\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. at 102. We agree with the judge that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">d. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and closing argument. </em>The defendant argues that the prosecutor made several improper assertions and arguments in his opening statement and closing argument that, considered together, deprived the defendant of a fair trial and require reversal of his conviction. He takes exception in particular to what he describes as the prosecutor\u2019s (1) repeated, inflammatory references to and characterizations of gangs and the defendant\u2019s immersion in the violent gang world \u2014 a tactic, the defendant contends, that improperly urged guilt by association; (2) unjustified attacks on the defendant\u2019s counsel; and (3) insertion and use of facts not in evidence. We analyze the defendant\u2019s claim \u201cin light of the entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>437 Mass. 554, 565 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 432 (1984). Taken as a whole, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing does not warrant reversal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>454 Mass. 245, 258 (2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1527, and cert. denied sub nom. <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>130 S. Ct. 1525 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">(i) The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, and to a greater extent, his closing argument, included vivid characterizations of gangs and what he described as gang life and the world of gangs \u2014 in his words, life \u201cinside the belly of the beast.\u201d Enthusiastic rhetoric is permissible, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 629 (1993); the prosecutor\u2019s rhetoric was perhaps at, but not over, the edge of proper argument. The prosecutor appeared to focus on the nature of the \u201cgang world\u201d because in addition to the defendant, a number of critical witnesses for the Commonwealth \u2014 including Rosado and Vega \u2014\u25a0 were themselves part of the Los Solidos gang, and the prosecutor was acknowledging and dealing with this reality directly. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s case centered on gang affiliations and the \u201cwar\u201d between Los Solidos and La Familia. It is also significant that the judge included in his final instructions a very forceful admonition to the jury that they could not find the defendant guilty because he was a member of a gang, and that the evidence of gang membership was relevant only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>question of motive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>450 Mass. 395, 399, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 893 (2008) (evidence of gang affiliation permitted on issues of motive and joint venture).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">(ii) In his closing, the prosecutor stated that members of La Familia \u201cknew\u201d that Ramirez had been killed by members of Los Solidos, and in effect told the jury that Negron was shot shortly after the Ramirez murder by La Familia members seeking to avenge the killing. Defense counsel did not object to this assertion. We agree with the defendant that there was an insufficient factual foundation for the inference asserted by the prosecutor, namely, that within one hour after Ramirez\u2019s murder, La Familia members had substantive knowledge that Los Solidos was responsible for the murder, and La Familia therefore shot Negron in retaliation. Even if the evidence were sufficient to support an inference that La Familia members harbored suspicions of Los Solidos members\u2019 involvement in Ramirez\u2019s death, it was improper for the prosecutor to suggest that these suspicions equated with proof that members of Los Solidos were in fact responsible for the murder. However, the prosecutor\u2019s improper statement warrants reversal only if it prejudiced the defendant in light of the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument, the trial testimony, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>454 Mass. at 258. We find no prejudice here. The prosecutor\u2019s suggestion about La Familia\u2019s responsibility for shooting Negron and what it meant, although improper, was a relatively brief point of focus in his argument. Moreover, the suggestion was that La Familia knew that Los Solidos was responsible for the murder, not specifically the defendant. The judge\u2019s instructions made clear that the jury must find the Commonwealth had proved the elements of the crime charged with respect to the defendant himself, not Los Solidos as a whole.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">e. <em>Additional issues. </em>We briefly discuss two additional issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>raised by the defendant. First, to the extent that the prosecutor may have cross-examined the defendant improperly concerning whether he could have been charged with another crime, defense counsel\u2019s objection to this line of questioning was sustained, and the prosecutor did not raise the issue in his closing argument. Second, in his reply brief, the defendant argues that the motion judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for limited discovery and an evidentiary hearing as part of his effort to investigate Dejesus\u2019s role in the Ramirez murder. Having reviewed the record, we discern no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeVincent, </em>421 Mass. 64, 67 (1995) (appellate courts generally defer to sound discretion of trial judge in determining whether motion for new trial requires evidentiary hearing). Furthermore, \u201c[wjhen the motion judge is also the trial judge, as in this case, [he] may use [his] \u2018knowledge and evaluation of the evidence at trial in determining whether to decide the motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>453 Mass. 54, 64 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>440 Mass. 589, 596 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>452 Mass. 662, 673 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">f. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>In conducting our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the entire case under \u00a7 33E, we find no basis to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction, but add one comment on an issue not raised by the defendant. In his final instructions to the jury, the trial judge addressed the topic of witness credibility generally, and added as part of the instruction that the jurors could \u201cconsider any cooperation agreements, requests for consideration of a lower sentence or offers of assistance by the commonwealth . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The judge did not include any further instruction concerning the need to evaluate the credibility of a witness who was a party to a cooperation agreement with the government with any particular or special care. It would have been preferable for the judge to give a fuller and more cautionary instruction to the jury about their evaluation of Rosado\u2019s and Vega\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 75, 78 (2001) (\u201cAlso problematic is the fact that the judge here failed to instruct the jury that a witness\u2019s agreement to provide testimony in exchange for consideration with respect to pending charges does not constitute governmental endorsement of the witness\u2019s veracity\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. at 263-264, 266 (discussing proper handling of witness\u2019s plea agreement \u201ccontingent on the witness\u2019s telling the truth\u201d at defendant\u2019s trial).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Cf. also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>421 Mass. 400, 413 (1995) (discussing jury instruction on evaluating cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ibility of immunized witness). The terms of the cooperation agreements that the Commonwealth had entered into with Rosado and Vega unquestionably were different than the plea agreement at issue in Ciampa; as discussed earlier, the defendant challenges at least one of these agreements because, in contrast to the agreement in <em>Ciampa, </em>it did <em>not </em>include an explicit requirement that the witness (Rosado) testify truthfully. Nonetheless, given the circumstances \u2014 both witnesses had themselves been charged with committing or being an accessory to the murder of Ramirez \u2014 it would have been preferable for the judge to give a fuller and more cautionary instruction to the jury about their consideration of Rosado\u2019s and Vega\u2019s testimony. We conclude, however, that the judge\u2019s instruction, as given, does not constitute an error requiring reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. The jury were apprised of the terms of the cooperation agreements to which Rosado and Vega were parties, and all participants at the trial \u2014 the prosecutor, the defendant\u2019s counsel, and the judge \u2014 emphasized that both witnesses were testifying pursuant to those agreements. There is no likelihood that a more pointed instruction on the jurors\u2019 need to view the testimony of these two witnesses with particular caution and to make their own judgments about whether the witnesses were testifying truthfully \u201cwas likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion\u201d about the witness\u2019s credibility.

Furthermore, the \u201copportunity\u201d to spend two weeks in the custody of a sheriff rather than the Department of Correction while serving a long sentence hardly seems the type of preferential treatment or benefit that would be likely to influence a witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\">The defendant frames this argument as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u2014 that his trial counsel failed to challenge the admissibility of Rosado\u2019s testimony on the ground that the witness had agreed with the Commonwealth to testify only to a specified version of events without regard to whether it was true. We need not focus specifically on counsel\u2019s performance but consider whether there was an error in admitting the testimony of Rosado, and, if so, whether the error \u201cwas likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>408 Mass. 561, 565 (1990), this court stated that \u201can agreement to testify in a particular way, without reference to the truth, is plainly an improper agreement; is inadmissible over objection; and, over objection, would bar the testimony of a witness who had made such an agreement, as long as that agreement remained in effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The judge in this case also had been the trial judge in the Carrasquillo case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moure, </em>428 Mass. 313 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel included copies of the transcripts of Rosado\u2019s testimony at the two earlier trials in the record appendix in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\">We agree also with the judge that the affidavit filed by the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>trial counsel in the present case, stating that counsel was unaware of this court\u2019s <em>Rosado </em>decision at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, is not dispositive; the affidavit does <em>not </em>state that trial counsel believed Rosado to be testifying that he had agreed to testify in conformity with his September 29 statement without regard for the truth, and in any event, we have concluded that such an interpretation is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">As with his claim about Rosado\u2019s testimony, the defendant presents this claim about Vega under the heading of ineffective assistance of counsel, but we focus on the underlying error asserted, namely, that Vega\u2019s trial testimony was inadmissible because it was the product of coercion. See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The defendant included in his motion for a new trial a claim that Rosado\u2019s statements to the police were also the product of coercion; the motion judge addressed the two claims of coercion together. The defendant does not repeat the argument about Rosado on appeal. We discuss only Vega here, but note that in conducting our review of the entire record under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have not found significant evidence supporting a claim that Rosado\u2019s statements to the police were the product of coercion and inadmissible on that ground \u2014 assuming the defendant would have standing to raise such a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The record contains several documents that relate to Vega\u2019s statements to the police, including his motion to suppress evidence of his statements, the related memorandum of his counsel, and his own supporting affidavit; an excerpt of Vega\u2019s testimony in the Moure trial; and his testimony in this trial. We have reviewed these documents, and find in them allegations of being denied counsel by the police, but no allegations of physical violence by the police. Based on the record before us, whatever mistreatment Vega may have suffered at the hands of the police, we agree with the motion judge that the alleged mistreatment would not warrant the exclusion of Vega\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The defendant also claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing, during Vega\u2019s cross-examination, to use Vega\u2019s claims that his statements were involuntary. However, we again agree with the motion judge that this argument fails because defense counsel effectively cross-examined Vega and elicited from him some testimony concerning possible mistreatment at the hands of police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In connection with his general claim, the defendant argues that his counsel\u2019s ineffective representation deprived him of a more favorable standard of review of various claims (not \u201cpreserved\u201d by counsel), because his claims are subject to review under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard, rather than the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). In advancing this argument, the defendant focuses in particular on the admission of the testimony of Rosado and Vega. We need not address the defendant\u2019s claim because, as discussed, we have found no error in the admission of this testimony. We note, however, that the defendant\u2019s argument runs contrary to the approach taken to ineffective assistance of counsel claims in both Federal and Massachusetts courts. See <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>130 S. Ct. 1473, 1482 (2010), quoting <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96-97 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Indeed, it would be impossible for such evidence to exist, given that the defendant was not charged with the crime of accessory before the fact to murder until eighteen months later, in January, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The defendant asserts that this misstatement constituted structural error not subject to a harmless error analysis, citing <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 309-310 (1991).

Here, the defendant does not argue, and there is no evidence, that the trial judge was not impartial or was in any way biased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The judge stated: \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying [evidence (i.e., evidence suggesting that \u2018the defendant may have fled from Massachusetts after he discovered that he was about to be charged with the offense for which he is now on trial\u2019)] is the fact or you should find that to be a fact. The facts are entirely your business and not mine. There was some evidence to that effect which you may accept or reject, as you see fit. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Negron also told the investigators, and testified at trial, that he heard about a plan to kill Ramirez from two other Los Solidos members, and not from the defendant; indeed, his trial testimony was that he overheard these two members tell the defendant about the plan in a conversation that occurred several days before the murder, not on May 27. This testimony, if believed, would suggest that the defendant played a less central role in relation to the conception and implementation of a plan to murder Ramirez, and was accordingly less culpable, than the Commonwealth sought to have the jury believe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\">There is one additional aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s closing that deserves comment. The prosecutor stated, in what appeared to be a reference to defense counsel, that he (defense counsel) had \u201cslapfped] those brave men [i.e., police officers] around,\u201d conduct that the prosecutor characterized as \u201calmost indecent.\u201d It is unclear whether the prosecutor was referring to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the police officers or an unrelated comment that counsel made in his closing argument. In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tu Trinh, </em>458 Mass. 776, 788-789 (2011). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Grandison, 433 Mass. 135, 143 (2001) (\u201cimproper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>for the prosecutor to suggest to the jury that it was impermissible for defense counsel to question the veracity of the police officers .... That is the essence of cross-examination\u201d). However, the prosecutor\u2019s statement does not constitute reversible error. It was a very brief comment made in passing during a long closing argument that was focused on other themes and points, and that was otherwise proper. We do not think this single comment reasonably could be thought to have affected the jury\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">None of the defendant\u2019s other arguments concerning the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement or closing argument has merit. The prosecutor did not vouch improperly for the credibility of several prosecution witnesses. Improper vouching occurs where an attorney \u201cexpresses a personal belief in the credibility of a witness . . . or . . . indicates that he or she has knowledge independent of the evidence before the jury verifying a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989), and cases cited. No such assurances were made here. The prosecutor did not insinuate any facts not present in the evidentiary record. The defendant\u2019s contention appears to be based on a misreading of what the prosecutor was stating with respect to the witnesses lohn Matos and Vega. We find no misstatement, and in any event, these challenged remarks did not go to \u201cthe heart of the case\u201d and could not \u201cpossibly [have] made a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusions.\" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 807 (2009), and cases cited. The trial judge properly instructed the jury that neither opening statements nor closing arguments constituted evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 806-807.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The judge\u2019s instruction on witness credibility was the following: \u201cNow, as I told you, your function is to assess the credibility of the witnesses. In determining credibility, you should consider the conduct and the demeanor of the witness while testifying, the frankness or lack of frankness while testifying, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the testimony, the probability or improbability of the testimony, the opportunity or the lack thereof to see or know the facts concerning which the witness testified, the accuracy of the witness\u2019s memory, the degree of intelligence shown by the witness. You should consider the character and the appearance of the witness here at trial as well as any bias that he or she may have shown. <em>You may consider any cooperation agreements, requests for consideration of a lower sentence or offers of assistance by the commonwealth to a witness in evaluating the witness\u2019s credibility </em>[emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cNow, members of the jury, you have enormous power in this regard.
