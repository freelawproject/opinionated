A judge in the Superior Court preliminarily enjoined the defendant Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) from proceeding with a summary process action to evict the plaintiff, Henrietta Eaton, from her home, following a foreclosure sale of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>by the defendant Green Tree Servicing, LLC (Green Tree), as mortgagee. The judge ruled that Eaton likely would succeed on the merits of her claim that for a valid foreclosure sale to occur, both the mortgage and the underlying note must be held by the foreclosing party; and that because Green Tree stipulated that it held only Eaton\u2019s mortgage, the foreclosure sale was void, and the defendants therefore were not entitled to evict Eaton. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., the defendants petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for relief from the preliminary injunction. The single justice denied the petition and reported his decision to a panel of that court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">For the reasons we discuss herein, we conclude as follows. A foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage must comply with all applicable statutory provisions, including in particular G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14. These statutes authorize a \u201cmortgagee\u201d to foreclose by sale pursuant to a power of sale in the mortgage, and require the \u201cmortgagee\u201d to provide notice and take other steps in connection with the sale. The meaning of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d as used in the statutes is not free from ambiguity, but we now construe the term to refer to the person or entity then holding the mortgage and also either holding the mortgage note or acting on behalf of the note holder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, we exercise our discretion to treat the construction announced in this decision as a new interpretation of the relevant statute, only to apply to foreclosures under the power of sale where statutory notice is provided after the date of this decision. We vacate the preliminary injunction and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>1. Background..<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 12, 2007, Eaton refinanced the mortgage on her home in the Roslindale section of Boston (Roslindale property) by executing a promissory note payable to BankUnited, FSB (BankUnited, or lender), for $145,000. That same day, she also executed a mortgage, referred to in the mortgage itself as a \u201c[s]ecurity [instrument.\u201d The mortgage is separate from, but by its terms clearly connected to, the promissory note. The parties to the mortgage are Eaton as the \u201c[borrower,\u201d BankUnited as the \u201c[l]ender,\u201d and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the \u201cmortgagee.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Under the mortgage executed by Eaton, MERS as mortgagee (or its assignee) holds legal title to the Roslindale property with power of sale \u201csolely as nominee\u201d of the lender Bank-United (or its assignee). However, \u201cif necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns) has the right to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and sell the Property; and to take any action required of Lender \u201d7</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The mortgage also contains a series of covenants that run exclusively between BanlcUnited as lender and Eaton. The final covenant, entitled \u201cAcceleration; Remedies,\u201d empowers the lender, on default by Eaton, to \u201cinvoke the STATUTORY POWER OF SALE and any other remedies permitted by applicable law.\u201d In this regard, the covenant obligates the lender, in invoking the statutory power of sale, to mail a copy of a notice of sale to Eaton.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On April 22, 2009, MERS assigned its interest as mortgagee to Green Tree and recorded the assignment in the Suffolk County registry of deeds. The record contains no evidence of a corresponding transfer of the note. The note was indorsed in blank by BankUnited on an undetermined date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Later in 2009, after Eaton failed to make payments on the note, Green Tree, as assignee of MERS, moved to foreclose on her home through exercise of a power of sale contained in the mortgage. A foreclosure auction was conducted in November, 2009; Green Tree was the highest bidder. The identity of the note holder at the time of the foreclosure sale is not known from the record. On November 24, 2009, Green Tree assigned the rights to its bid to Fannie Mae, and a foreclosure deed was recorded in the Suffolk County registry of deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">On January 25, 2010, Fannie Mae commenced a summary process action in the Boston division of the Housing Court Department to evict Eaton. Eaton filed a counterclaim, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that the underlying foreclosure sale was invalid because Green Tree did not hold Eaton\u2019s mortgage note at the time of the foreclosure sale and therefore lacked the requisite authority to foreclose on her equity of redemption in the Roslindale property. A Housing Court judge subsequently granted a sixty-day stay of the summary process action to give Eaton an opportunity to seek relief in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Housing Court judge also ordered Eaton to make use and occupancy payments during the pendency of her action. On April 8, 2011, Eaton filed a complaint in the Superior Court for injunctive and declaratory relief. The complaint sought a declaration that the foreclosure sale of Eaton\u2019s home and the subsequent foreclosure deed were null and void, and that Eaton was the owner in fee simple of the Roslindale property; a preliminary injunction to stay the summary process action in the Housing Court; and a permanent injunction barring Fannie Mae from taking steps to obtain possession of or convey the Roslindale property. For the purposes of Eaton\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction only, the defendants stipulated that Green Tree did not hold Eaton\u2019s mortgage note at the time of the foreclosure. After hearing, the Superior Court judge (motion judge) allowed the motion and preliminarily enjoined Fannie Mae from proceeding with Eaton\u2019s eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; </em>Loan, 452 Mass. 733, 741 (2008). The conclusions of law of the judge below are \u201csubject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.\u201d <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 616 (1980), quoting <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>508 F.2d 259, 267 n.24 (5th Cir. 1975). In considering a request for a preliminary injunction the judge evaluates the moving party\u2019s chance of success on the merits and its claim of injury. <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra </em>at 617. Because the defendants do not dispute the likelihood of irreparable harm to Eaton if Fannie Mae proceeds to seek her eviction through the summary process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>action, we confine our discussion to evaluating Eaton\u2019s likelihood of prevailing on the merits of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>As indicated, the motion judge determined that a foreclosure by sale requires the foreclosing mortgagee, at the time of the sale, to hold both the mortgage and the underlying mortgage note; and that if the mortgagee does not hold the note, the foreclosure sale is void. Based on this view, she concluded that because Green Tree, the assignee of the mortgage, had stipulated that it did not hold the mortgage note executed by Eaton when the sale took place, Eaton was likely to succeed in proving that the foreclosure sale was void and that the defendants had no authority to evict her and take possession of her home. See <em>Bank of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>460 Mass. 327, 333 (2011) (challenging evicting party\u2019s entitlement to possession \u201chas long been considered a valid defense to a summary process action for eviction where the property was purchased at a foreclosure sale\u201d). The defendants argue that in reaching this conclusion, the judge misread the Massachusetts common law, and that, in any event, the statutory scheme applicable to exercise of a power of sale gave Green Tree absolute authority, as \u201cmortgagee,\u201d to foreclose. They also claim that Green Tree, as the assignee, had a contractual right to foreclose pursuant to the express terms of the mortgage. We begin with a brief overview of the common law of mortgages and then address the statutes governing exercise of a power of sale in a mortgage. Finally, we review the preliminary injunction in light of the relevant principles discussed and the terms of Eaton\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">a. <em>Common law. </em>A real estate mortgage in Massachusetts has two distinct but related aspects: it is a transfer of legal title to the mortgage property, and it serves as security for an underlying note or other obligation \u2014 that is, the transfer of title is made in order to secure a debt, and the title itself is defeasible when the debt is paid. See <em>U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. 637, 649 (2011) (Ibanez) (Massachusetts is a \u201ctitle theory\u201d State in which \u201ca mortgage is a transfer of legal title in a property to secure a debt\u201d); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>330 Mass. 261, 263 (1953), and cases cited (legal title held by mortgagee is \u201cdefeasible upon the payment of money or the performance of some other condition\u201d); <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>11 Mass. 469, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>475 (1814) (mortgage deed \u201cpurports to convey to the mortgagee a present estate in fee simple, defeasible on the performance of a certain condition by the mortgagor\u201d). See also <em>Negron </em>v. Gordon, 373 Mass. 199, 204 (1977) (\u201c[T]he mortgagee holds bare legal title to the property subject to defeasance on the mortgagor\u2019s performance of the obligation secured by the mortgage. It is only for the purpose of securing the debt that the mortgagee is to be considered owner of the property\u201d [citations omitted]); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Gray 152, 153 (1856) (\u201cThe true character of a mortgage is the pledge of real estate to secure the payment of money, or the performance of some other obligation\u201d); <em>Maglione </em>v. <em>BancBoston Mtge. Corp., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 90 (1990) (\u201cSo it is that the mortgagor retains an equity of redemption, and upon payment of the note by the mortgagor or upon performance of any other obligation specified in the mortgage instrument, the mortgagee\u2019s interest in the real property comes to an end\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Following from these principles, a mortgage separated from the underlying debt that it is intended to secure is \u201ca mere technical interest.\u201d <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>15 Gray 461, 465 (1860). See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>123 Mass. 58, 59 (1877) (\u201cThat the debt is the principal and the mortgage an incident, is a rule too familiar to require citations in support of it\u201d). However, in contrast to some jurisdictions, in Massachusetts the mere transfer of a mortgage note does not carry with it the mortgage. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>149 Mass. 106, 114 (1889). See also 1 F. Hilliard, Mortgages 221 (2d ed. 1856) (\u201cThe prevailing doctrine upon this subject undoubtedly is, that an assignment of the debt carries the mortgage with it. This rule, however, is by no means universal, and is subject to various qualifications in the different States of the Union\u201d). As a consequence, in Massachusetts a mortgage and the underlying note can be split. See <em>Lamson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>305 Mass. 238, 245 (1940) (\u201cThe holder of the mortgage and the holder of the note may be different persons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under our common law, where a mortgage and note are separated, \u201cthe holder of the mortgage holds the mortgage in trust for the purchaser of the note, who has an equitable right to obtain an assignment of the mortgage, which may be accomplished by filing an action in court and obtaining an equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>order of assignment.\u201d <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. at 652, citing <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>149 Mass. at 114. See <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>15 Gray at 465 (\u201cThe party holding such legal estate [i.e., mortgagee holding only mortgage without underlying note] no doubt holds the same in trust for the party owning the debt, where the entire debt secured by a mortgage has been parted with\u201d); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Gray at 154 (where indorsee of note is without assignment of mortgage securing the note, \u201cthe law may well imply the intention of the parties that the mortgage is thenceforth to be held by the mortgagee in trust for the indorsee. In other words, such a transaction might manifest a resulting trust\u201d); <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bancroft, </em>12 Gray 365, 367 (1859) (\u201cA mortgage cannot be made available without connecting it with the debt or duty secured thereby. To one who has not the debt, it is of no value as property, as it could at most be only resorted to as a trust for the benefit of the holder of the note\u201d). See generally 1 F. Hilliard, Mortgages at 216 n.(c) (\u201cThe assignment of a mortgage, without the debt, creates at most a <em>naked </em>trust\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>id. </em>at 217 (\u201c[The mortgage] has no determinate value. If it should be assigned, the assignee must hold the interest at the will and disposal of the creditor who holds the bond\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Consistent with the principles just described \u2014 that is, the basic nature of a mortgage as security for an underlying mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>note, and the role of a \u201cbare\u201d mortgagee as equitable trustee for the note holder \u2014 it appears that, at common law, a mortgagee possessing only the mortgage was without authority to foreclose on his own behalf the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption or otherwise disturb the possessory interest of the mortgagor. See <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>11 Gray 267, 269-270 (1858) (former assignee of mortgage note and mortgage who had retransferred note and canceled unrecorded mortgage assignment might still hold technical legal title to mortgage property as mortgagee but has no equitable right to disturb mortgagor\u2019s possessory interest and cannot bring action to foreclose mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption because no money is due from mortgagor to him; only mortgagee with interest in underlying debt can so enforce mortgage). See also <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>15 Gray at 465 (\u201cAs a purchaser [of a mortgage without the underlying note], [defendant] must have known that the possession of the debt was essential to an effective mortgage, and that without it he could not maintain an action to foreclose the mortgage\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Brother, </em>263 Mass. 61, 62 (1928).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>b. <em>Statutory provisions. </em>The defendants take issue with the applicability of decisions such as <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>15 Gray at 465, <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>226 Mass. 582, 585 (1917), and <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>11 Gray at 269-270, to this case. They argue that in any event, G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14, expressly authorized MERS (and its assignee) to foreclose because the mortgage in this case contained a power of sale. Accordingly, we turn to this statute, as well as related statutory provisions that together govern mortgage foreclosures under a power of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It has long been recognized that statutes are a key source of authority generally governing mortgages. See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>14 Pick. 399, 400-401 (1833) (\u201cThe law of mortgage in this [Commonwealth, is a mixed system, derived partly from the common law in regard to real property, partly from the rules and maxims of the English [CJourts of [Cjhancery, but principally from various statutes\u201d). Statutes play an especially significant role in connection with mortgage foreclosures effected under a power of sale. See <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. at 646, quoting <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dick, </em>187 Mass. 207, 211 (1905) (\u201cone who sells under a power [of sale] must follow strictly [statutory] terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The \u201cstatutory power of sale\u201d is set out in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under this statute, if a mortgage provides for a power of sale, the mortgagee, in exercising the power, may foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>without obtaining prior judicial authorization<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cupon any default in the performance or observance\u201d of the mortgage, <em>id,., </em>including, of course, nonpayment of the underlying mortgage note.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 21 provides, however, that for a foreclosure sale pursuant to the power to be valid, the mortgagee must \u201cfirst comply[] with the terms of the mortgage and with the statutes relating to the foreclosure of mortgages by the exercise of a power of sale.\u201d See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dick, </em>187 Mass. 207, 211-213 (1905) (where notice of foreclosure sale was given in newspaper other than one named in mortgage agreement\u2019s power of sale, foreclosure was void, and plaintiffs were entitled to redeem mortgaged property approximately twenty years after sale; laches is no defense to void sale). See also <em>Tamburello </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>321 Mass. 445, 446-447 (1947) (where foreclosure sale conducted in bank office nine-tenths of one mile from mortgaged premises, sale was not \u201con or near the premises\u201d as required by G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21; sale held void).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In addition to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, itself, the \u201cstatutes relating to the foreclosure of mortgages by the exercise of a power of sale,\u201d <em>id,., </em>are set out in G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C. See <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. at 645-646. Principal among these is c. 244, \u00a7 14 (\u00a7 14), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\"><em>\u201cThe mortgagee </em>or person having his estate in the land mortgaged, or a person authorized by the power of sale, . . . <em>may, upon breach of condition and without action, do all the acts authorized or required by the power, </em>but no sale under such power shall be effectual to foreclose a mortgage, unless, previous to such sale, [the notice provisions set forth in this section are followed<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> ]\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The defendants argue that by its plain, unambiguous terms, this section authorized Green Tree, as the assignee of MERS, to foreclose because Eaton\u2019s mortgage identified MERS, its successors and assigns as the \u201cmortgagee\u201d with the \u201cpower of sale.\u201d We disagree that \u00a7 14 is unambiguous. The section is one in a set of provisions governing mortgage foreclosures by sale, and that set in turn is one component of a chapter of the General Laws devoted generally to the topic of foreclosure and redemption of mortgages. The term \u201cmortgagee\u201d appears in several of these statutes, and its use reflects a legislative understanding or assumption that the \u201cmortgagee\u201d referred to also is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the holder of the mortgage note. Thus, G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 17B, one of the foreclosure by sale sections closely related to \u00a7 14, deals with the notice required to be given as a condition to seeking a deficiency owed on a note after a foreclosure sale, and reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cNo action for a deficiency shall be brought ... by <em>the holder of a mortgage note </em>or other obligation secured by mortgage of real estate after a foreclosure sale <em>by him . . . </em>unless a notice in writing of the <em>mortgagee\u2019s intention to foreclose </em>the mortgage has been mailed, postage prepaid, by registered mail with return receipt requested, to the defendant sought to be charged with the deficiency at his last address <em>then known to the mortgagee, </em>together with a warning of liability for the deficiency, <em>in substantially the form </em>[set out in this section] ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">By its terms, \u00a7 17B assumes that the holder of the mortgage note and the holder of the mortgage are one and the same; the section\u2019s drafters appear to have used the terms \u201cholder of a mortgage note\u201d and \u201cmortgagee\u201d interchangeably.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, the statutory form of the notice required by \u00a7 17B<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> bolsters our interpretation of \u00a7 17B; the statutory form language plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>envisions that the foreclosing mortgagee (\u201cthe mortgage held by me\u201d) and the note holder (\u201cyou may be liable to me in case of a deficiency\u201d) are one. And the same underlying assumption \u2014 that is, an identity between the mortgagee and the underlying note holder \u2014 also underlies several other sections in c. 244. See, e.g., G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 19 (providing that person entitled to redeem mortgage property \u201cshall pay or tender to the mortgagee\u201d amount due and payable \u201con the mortgage\u201d); \u00a7 20 (requiring \u201cmortgagee\u201d who has been in possession of mortgage property to account for rents, profits, and expenses, and directing that any account balance be deducted from or added to amount \u201cdue on the mortgage\u201d); \u00a7 23 (authorizing court to determine what amount not in dispute is \u201cdue on the mortgage,\u201d and to order it paid to \u201cmortgagee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cWhere the Legislature uses the same words in several sections which concern the same subject matter, the words \u2018must be presumed to have been used with the same meaning in each section.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wynton W., </em>459 Mass. 745, 747 (2011), quoting <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 188 189 (1969).

There is no applicable statutory language suggesting that the Legislature intended to proscribe application of general agency principles in the context of mortgage foreclosure sales.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we interpret G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C (and particularly \u00a7 14), and G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, to permit one who, although not the note holder himself, acts as the authorized agent of the note holder, to stand \u201cin the shoes\u201d of the \u201cmortgagee\u201d as the term is used in these provisions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The defendants and several amici argue, to varying degrees, that an interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d in the statutes governing mortgage foreclosures by sale that requires a mortgagee to hold the mortgage note will wreak havoc with the operation and integrity of the title recording and registration systems by calling into question the validity of any title that has a foreclosure sale in the title chain. This follows, they claim, because although a foreclosing mortgagee must record a foreclosure deed along with an affidavit evidencing compliance with G. L. c. 24, \u00a7 14, see G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 15; see also G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 4, there are no similar provisions for recording mortgage notes; and as a result, clear record title cannot be ascertained because the validity of any prior foreclosure sale is not ascertainable by examining documents of record.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> They argue that if this court requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>mortgagee to have a connection to the underlying debt in order to effect a valid foreclosure, such a requirement should be given prospective effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In general, when we construe a statute, we do not engage in an analysis whether that interpretation is given retroactive or prospective effect; the interpretation we give the statute usually reflects the court\u2019s view of its meaning since the statute\u2019s enactment. See <em>McIntyre, petitioner, </em>458 Mass. 257, 261 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2909 (2011). However, there are several considerations that compel us to give the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d we announce here only prospective effect. As the previous discussion reflects, the use of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d in the statutory scheme governing mortgage foreclosures was not free of ambiguity, and while the decisions of this court in years and centuries past provide support for the general proposition that, under our common law, a mortgage ultimately depends on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>connection with the underlying debt for its enforceability, none of our cases has considered directly the question whether a mortgagee must also hold the note or act on behalf of the note holder in order to effect a valid foreclosure by sale. It has been represented to us by the defendants and several amici that lawyers and others who certify or render opinions concerning real property titles have followed in good faith a different interpretation of the relevant statutes, viz., one that requires the mortgagee to hold only the mortgage, and not the note, in order to effect a valid foreclosure by sale. We have no reason to reject this representation of prior practice, and in that context, we recognize there may be significant difficulties in ascertaining the validity of a particular title if the interpretation of \u201cmortgagee\u201d that we adopt here is not limited to prospective operation, because of the fact that our recording system has never required mortgage notes to be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">This court traditionally has given prospective effect to its decisions in very limited circumstances, but those have included circumstances where the ruling announces a change that affects property law. See <em>Papadopoulos </em>v. <em>Target Corp., </em>457 Mass. 368, 385 (2010); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 565 (1982). In the property law context, we generally apply our decisions prospectively out of \u201cconcern for litigants and others who have relied on existing precedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 662 (1987). In addition, there may be particular reason to give a decision prospective effect where \u2014 as the argument is made here \u2014 \u201cprior law is of questionable prognosticative value.\u201d <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Edgar\u2019s, Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 402, 407 (1994). Where a decision is not grounded in constitutional principles, but instead announces \u201ca new common-law rule, a new interpretation of a State statute, or a new rule in the exercise of our superintendence power, there is no constitutional requirement that the new rule or new interpretation be applied retroactively, and we are therefore free to determine whether it should be applied only prospectively.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 721 n.10 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005). In the exceptional circumstances presented here, and for the reasons that we have discussed, we exercise our discretion to hold that the interpretation of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14, and related statutory provisions that we adopt in this opinion is to apply only to mortgage foreclosure sales for which the mandatory notice of sale has been given after the date of this opinion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">c. <em>Preliminary injunction. </em>Although we apply the rule articulated in this case prospectively, we nonetheless apply it to Green Tree\u2019s appeal because it has been argued to this court by Eaton. See <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>DeGagne, </em>368 Mass. 45, 48-49 (1975) (party seeking relief may be entitled to benefit from rule announced in case, even when other \u201csomewhat similarly situated [parties] are not afforded the benefit of retroactive application of the principles established by that first appellate determination\u201d). Cf. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, </em>376 Mass. 907, 918-919 (1978) (Kaplan, J., concurring) (suggesting that when newly announced rule is given prospective effect, that rule may still apply to the case at bar if parties raised issue; declining to apply new rule, however, where parties appeared to accept that old rule would apply to them). See generally <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. at 663-665 (Abrams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (discussing reasons in favor of applying new rule given general prospective application to particular litigants involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The motion judge granted the preliminary injunction based on her determination that as a matter of still applicable common law, for a foreclosure by sale to be valid, the mortgage and the mortgage note must be unified physically in the possession of the foreclosing mortgagee. We have focused principally on the statutes governing mortgage foreclosure by sale and have concluded that where a mortgagee acts with the authority and on behalf of the note holder, the mortgagee may comply with these statutory requirements without physically possessing or actually holding the mortgage note. Eaton\u2019s verified complaint alleges that at the time of foreclosure in this case, Green Tree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>as assignee of MERS, was neither in possession of Eaton\u2019s mortgage note nor \u201cauthorized by the holder of the note to carry out the foreclosure.\u201d However, Eaton makes this allegation solely on \u201cinformation and belief.\u201d As a general rule, an allegation that is supported on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d does not supply an adequate factual basis for the granting of a preliminary injunction. See <em>Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danahy, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 493-494 (1986), and cases cited (noting that although preliminary injunction may be based on affidavits and verified complaint, allegations based only on information and belief would be insufficient to support preliminary injunction). See also M.G. Perlin &amp; S.H. Blum, Procedural Forms Annotated \u00a7 106:1 (6th ed. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The motion judge\u2019s decision on the preliminary injunction does not consider the question of Green Tree\u2019s (or MERS\u2019s) authority to act on behalf of BankUnited or an assignee of Bank-United in initiating foreclosure proceedings, and our examination of the Superior Court record suggests that this issue was not raised below. In the circumstances, we conclude that Eaton\u2019s allegation on information and belief that Green Tree was not authorized by the note holder to carry out the foreclosure sale did not offer an adequate factual basis to support the preliminary injunction that was issued. Consequently, the order granting the preliminary injunction must be vacated. On remand, Eaton may renew her request for a preliminary injunction, and in that context seek to show that she has a reasonable likelihood of establishing that, at the time of the foreclosure sale, Green Tree neither held the note nor acted on behalf of the note holder.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate the grant of the preliminary injunction, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The term \u201cmortgage note\u201d is used in this opinion to refer to the promissory note or other form of debt or obligation for which the mortgage provides security; and the term \u201cnote holder\u201d is used to refer to a person or entity owning the \u201cmortgage note.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by Adam J.

(MERS), is a Delaware nonstock corporation owned by its members. See Arnold, Yes, There is Life on MERS, 11 Prob. &amp; Prop. 32, 33 (1997) (Arnold). MERS is mortgagee of record for mortgage loans registered on the MERS electronic registration system, which tracks servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in those loans; the system allows these servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests to be traded electronically between members without the need to record publicly each mortgage assignment. See <em>id. </em>In particular, when the beneficial interest in a loan is sold, the note is transferred by indorsement and delivery between the parties, and the new ownership interest is reflected in the MERS system. MERS remains the mortgagee of record so long as the note is sold to another MERS member; no aspect of such a transaction is publicly recorded. See <em>In re Agard, </em>444 B.R. 231, 248 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2011); <em>MERS, Inc. </em>v. Romaine, 8 N.Y.3d 90, 96 (2006). If an ownership interest in, or servicing right to, a mortgage loan is transferred by a MERS member to a nonMERS member, an assignment of the mortgage from the MERS member to the non-MERS member is publicly recorded and the loan is \u201cdeactivated\u201d within the MERS system.

D. Mass. 2011), the defendants suggest that because a mortgage and note can be separated, with the mortgage held in trust for the note holder, a mortgagee with \u201cbare legal title\u201d should be able independently to foreclose on the mortgage property as the trustee of the note holder, and thereafter account to the note holder for the sale proceeds. The argument, however, fails to take into account the nature of the trust at issue. This trust is an equitable device that may qualify as a resulting trust, see <em>Young </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Gray 152, 154 (1856); it is not an express trust that vests specific, independent authority in the trustee to foreclose on the trust property or to take other affirmative acts. A resulting trust \u201cis a reversionary, equitable interest implied by law in property that is held by a transferee, in whole or in part, as trustee for the transferor or the transferor\u2019s successors in interest.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 7 (2003). The duties of a trustee of a resulting trust are limited \u2014 he or she \u201cis under a duty to merely transfer the trust property or the reversionary portion thereof to the reversionary beneficiary or in accordance with that beneficiary\u2019s directions. Until the property is so transferred, the title holder remains trustee with a duty to preserve the affected property and its product and to perform any other duties appropriate to the resulting-trust relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7 comment e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In her memorandum of decision granting the preliminary injunction, the motion judge relied on <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>15 Gray 461 (1860), as well as <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>226 Mass. 582, 585 (1917), a case in where the court reiterated that \u201cpossession of the note was essential to an enforceable mortgage, without which [the] mortgage could [not] be effectively foreclosed.\u201d The defendants, as do a number of amici, argue that these cases merely provide support for the proposition that a mortgagee has no authority to foreclose if the underlying mortgage debt has been paid. This proposition clearly is true, but we do not agree that it is the basis of the court\u2019s decision in either <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>11 Gray 267, 269-270 (1858), or <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Winchester, supra </em>(although it does appear to be the basis in <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Adams, supra). </em>More to the point, the general principle quoted and described in the text in connection with these cases, namely, that a mortgage ultimately depends on the underlying debt for its enforceability, is a separate proposition, and one stated by the court in all three decisions. See <em>Culhane </em>v. <em>Aurora Loan Servs. of Neb., </em>826 F. Supp. 2d 352, 365 (D. Mass. 2011) (\u201cwhile both <em>Wolcott </em>and <em>Crowley </em>state that a mortgage cannot be foreclosed where the underlying debt has been discharged, this is but one application ... of the broader rule that a mortgagee must have a valid claim to the debt before attempting foreclosure\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Brother, </em>263 Mass. 61 (1928), the court held that the plaintiff creditor could not reach and apply, in payment of the defendant\u2019s debt, a mortgage purportedly remaining with the defendant as mortgagee, because the mortgage was security for the underlying note, and the defendant previously had assigned the note to its true owner.

L. c. 244, \u00a7 17B, would lead to the absurd result of requiring the deficiency action be brought by the \u201cholder of the mortgage note,\u201d while obligating the \u201cmortgagee\u201d to provide notice of the action to the mortgagor, with the result that a mortgagee\u2019s noncompliance with the statute could impair the note holder\u2019s right to collect a deficiency. We will not follow this interpretive path. See <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000) (court seeks to arrive at \u201csensible construction\u201d of statute, and \u201cshall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The form of notice provided in G.

L. c. 244, \u00a7 14, to support their position that a mortgagee not possessing the note can foreclose. See, e.g., McKenna <em>vs. </em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., U.S. Dist Ct., Civil Action No. 10-10417-JLT (D. Mass. Mar. 21, 2011); <em>Valerio </em>v. <em>U.S. Bank, N.A., </em>716 F. Supp. 2d 124, 128 (D. Mass. 2010) (noting that G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14, \u201cis addressed to mortgagees, not note holders\u201d). See also <em>Aliberti </em>v. <em>GMAC Mtge., LLC, </em>779 F. Supp. 2d 242, 249 (D. Mass. 2011), citing <em>Valerio, supra. </em>See generally Peterson <em>vs. </em>GMAC Mtge., LLC, U.S. Dist. Ct., Civil Action No. 11-11115-RWZ (D. Mass. Oct. 25, 2011), citing McKenna, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Valerio, supra. </em>However, all of these cases effectively rely on a plain language analysis of the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d as contained in \u00a7 14, and do not analyze the term in the context of the broader statutory scheme or against the backdrop of the common law. Cf. <em>Culhane </em>v. <em>Aurora Loan Servs. of Neb., </em>826 F. Supp. 2d 352, 367 (D. Mass. 2011) (in order to foreclose under Massachusetts law, mortgagee must \u201cpossess the legal title to the mortgage <em>and </em>either hold the note or establish that it is servicing the loan on behalf of the note holder\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The dictionary definition of \u201cmortgagee\u201d is consistent with the construction we give to the term. \u201c[M]ortgagee\u201d is defined as \u201c[o]ne to whom property is mortgaged; the mortgage creditor, or lender.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1104 (9th ed. 2009). This definition does not draw a clear distinction between a mortgagee and a note holder; in fact, it points the other way, suggesting that the mortgagee <em>is </em>the note holder (i.e., lender). As noted by the Supreme Court of Kansas, the legal dictionary definition reflects the fact that the law \u201cgenerally understands that a mortgagee is not distinct from a lender.\u201d <em>Landmark Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Kesler, </em>289 Kan. 528, 539 (2009). Accord <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>2 A.3d 289, 295 (Me. 2010), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>(\u201cThe plain meaning and common understanding of mortgagee is \u2018[o]ne to whom property is mortgaged,\u2019 \u201d meaning mortgage creditor or lender).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Although the defendants focus only on G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 14, we note that G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, providing for the statutory power of sale, reflects the same legislative understanding or assumption about the term \u201cmortgagee\u201d as we have found animates c. 244, \u00a7 14, namely, that the \u201cmortgagee\u201d holds both the mortgage and the mortgage note. The section of the 1912 statute that inserted the \u201cstatutory power of sale\u201d into the General Laws (see note 16, <em>supra), </em>also enacted and inserted the \u201cstatutory condition,\u201d which currently appears as G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 20. See St. 1912, c. 502, \u00a7 6. In addition to the common source of these two sections, their language and structure demonstrate that they are meant to be read together. Section 20 of c. 183 describes the \u201cstatutory condition\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cProvided, nevertheless, except as otherwise specifically stated in the mortgage, that <em>if the mortgagor, </em>or his heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns <em>shall pay unto the mortgagee </em>or his executors, administrators or assigns <em>the principal and interest secured by the mortgage, </em>and shall perform any obligation secured at the time provided in the note, mortgage or other instrument or any extension thereof, and shall perform the condition of any prior mortgage [and shall pay all appropriate taxes and insurance obligations] . . . and shall not commit or suffer any strip or waste of the mortgaged premises or any breach of any covenant contained in the mortgage or in any prior mortgage, <em>then the mortgage deed, as also the mortgage note or notes, shall be void\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The \u201cstatutory power of sale\u201d set out in G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 21, picks up directly from where \u00a7 20 ends: \u201cBut upon any default in the performance or observance <em>of the foregoing or other condition, </em>the mortgagee or his executors, administrators, successors or assigns may sell the mortgaged premises\u201d (emphasis added). Given the shared roots and integrated structure of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 21, the presumption that the Legislature intends the same term to have the same meaning where it has used that term in different but related statutes, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wynton W., </em>459 Mass. 745, 747 (2011), seems compelling in relation to the term \u201cmortgagee.\u201d And because \u00a7 20, by providing that the \u201cmortgagee\u201d is to be paid the principal and interest owed by the mortgagor, contemplated that the mortgagee is holding or entitled to enforce the mortgage note, it is only reasonable to interpret \u201cmortgagee\u201d in \u00a7 21 to have the same meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The defendants also cite <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. at 648, in support of their argument that a mortgagee having no connection with the mortgage note may foreclose. Their reliance is misplaced. In <em>Ibanez, </em>we addressed only the issue whether the plaintiff banks, or any party in a similar position, could validly foreclose on a mortgage through exercise of a power of sale if they did not hold the mortgage at the time they provided the statutorily prescribed notice of sale to the mortgagors and other interested parties. <em>Id. </em>at 649-651. We did not address the authority of a party possessing the mortgage alone, without the mortgage note, to foreclose. Nor did we do so in <em>Bevilacqua </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>460 Mass. 762, 776 n.10 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">An agency relationship arises \u201cfrom the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act.\u201d <em>Harrison Conference Servs. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>394 Mass. 21, 24 (1985), quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1(1) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Eaton asserts also that the result we reach here is compelled by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), codified in Massachusetts at G. L. c. 106. She argues in substance that the note is a negotiable instrument, and that pursuant to art. 3 of the UCC, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 3-301 \u2014 3-312, only certain categories of persons are entitled to enforce negotiable instruments. Under her view, because Green Tree did not fall within any of the categories of persons entitled to enforce negotiable instruments, it was not entitled to enforce the note through foreclosure. We need not resolve Eaton\u2019s UCC argument. We perceive nothing in the UCC inconsistent with our view that in order to effect a valid foreclosure, a mortgagee must either hold the note or act on behalf of the note holder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In its amicus brief, REBA asserts that the contemporary secondary mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>market exacerbates the title problem because, as we recognized in <em>Ibanez, </em>458 Mass. at 649, the secondary market operates, permissibly, so that \u201cunderlying notes will be held by one entity for the benefit of the bond holders and the mortgages held by a servicer,\u201d and if the servicer conducts the foreclosure \u201cthere will be no evidence of record that will establish that the mortgagee was also the holder of the note at the time of the foreclosure.\u201d In effect, REBA argues, because \u201cthe essence of the MERS system is that MERS does not hold the underlying notes . . . and holds the mortgages only as nominee for the holder of the note,\u201d there will effectively be a presumption that the mortgagee did not hold the note at the time of the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We respond to REBA\u2019s concerns <em>infra, </em>but it is significant that MERS\u2019s current \u201cRules of Membership,\u201d version 3.12, most recently revised in March, 2012 (MERS rules), appear to recognize that there needs to be a connection made between the mortgage and the underlying debt as a condition precedent to an effective foreclosure by sale. See Rule 8(l)(a) of the MERS rules (requiring member owner of note or servicer initiating foreclosure on note secured by MERS mortgage first to effectuate assignment of mortgage \u201cto the note owner\u2019s servicer, or to such other party expressly and specifically designated by the note owner\u201d); Rule 8(l)(e)(i) of the MERS rules (obligating member note owner or servicer \u201cto execute the assignment of the Security Instrument from [MERS] to the note owner\u2019s servicer, or to such other party expressly and specifically designated by the note-owner . . . and promptly send the assignment of the Security Instrument ... for recording in the applicable public land records\u201d); Rule 8(l)(d) of the MERS rules (revoking authority of MERS certifying officers to initiate foreclosure proceedings in MERS\u2019s name on or after July 22, 2011). Finally, as we just stated, we read the relevant mortgage foreclosure statutes to authorize a party who holds the mortgage directly and who serves as the agent of the note holder to qualify as the \u201cmortgagee\u201d entitled to foreclose under the power of sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">It would appear that at least with respect to unregistered land, a foreclosing mortgage holder such as Green Tree may establish that it either held the note or acted on behalf of the note holder at the time of a foreclosure sale by filing an affidavit in the appropriate registry of deeds pursuant to G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 5B. The statute allows for the filing of an affidavit that is \u201crelevant to the title to certain land and will be of benefit and assistance in clarifying the chain of title.\u201d Such an affidavit may state that the mortgagee either held the note or acted on behalf of the note holder at the time of the foreclosure sale. See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 54B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">As noted at the outset of this opinion, the mortgage identifies MERS as mortgagee, but one that acts as the \u201cnominee\u201d of the lender. It is not clear what \u201cnominee\u201d means in this context, but the use of the word may have some bearing on the agency question. We express no opinion whether MERS or Green Tree was acting as agent of the note holder or with the note holder\u2019s authority at the time of the foreclosure sale. Eaton is entitled to pursue discovery on this issue in connection with her Superior Court action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
