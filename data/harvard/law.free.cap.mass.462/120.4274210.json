Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 101.00 (2010) (code), permits the installation of any one of four types of approved \u201cfire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems\u201d in buildings throughout the Commonwealth. See 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 907.14.3 (2008). In 2006, the city of Springfield (city) enacted an ordinance that, in essence, proscribes the installation of all but one of the systems allowed by the code. See \u00a7 7.13.035 (ordinance) of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Springfield (city ordinances). The question before us is whether the code preempts the ordinance. We hold that it does.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 1972, the Legislature empowered the State board of building regulations and standards (board) to \u201cadopt and administer a state building code.\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 93. See St. 1972, c. 802; St. 1974, c. 541. Pursuant to this authority, the board set forth four alternatives for required \u201cfire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems,\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 907.14.3 (2008),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which alert local fire departments when an alarm has been sounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>In November, 2006, Title 7 of the Springfield city ordinances, entitled \u201cHealth and Safety,\u201d was amended with the enactment of the ordinance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ordinance requires that all buildings in the city utilize the fourth option contemplated by the code, which it described as a \u201c[c]ity approved Radio Box.\u201d Under the terms of the penalty provision of the ordinance, failure to comply \u201cshall be punished by a fine of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per calendar day\u201d and \u201ceach calendar day on which the violation exists shall be deemed to be a separate offense.\u201d \u00a7 7.13.050 of the city ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Contrary to the ordinance, but in compliance with the code, the plaintiff, St. George Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Western Massachusetts, Inc. (church), installed a system of the sort set out as the first alternative in the relevant code provision during its April, 2009, renovations to the St. George Greek Cultural Center. After an inspection by the city\u2019s fire department in June, 2009, the city sent an \u201cinvoice\u201d detailing a $3,000 \u201c[violation fine\u201d owed by the church. The church appealed to the board, which ruled that the church had complied with the code. The board held that it was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to grant [the church] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the specific relief it ultimately seeks\u201d (i.e., invalidation of the ordinance) because the board is \u201cwithout authority to strike down an ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The church then filed an action in the Superior Court seeking a judgment declaring the ordinance and its penalty provision invalid. Arguing that the ordinance is unenforceable as contrary to the code and the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the church moved for summary judgment; a Superior Court judge allowed the church\u2019s motion, thereby invalidating the challenged provisions. After the city appealed, we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review a decision to grant summary judgment de novo. See <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 215 (2003). \u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">b. <em>Declaratory judgment. </em>At the outset, the city objects to the appropriateness of the church\u2019s declaratory judgment action. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, the Superior Court \u201cmay on appropriate proceedings make binding declarations of right, duty, status and other legal relations sought thereby ... in any case in which an <em>actual controversy </em>has arisen and is specifically set forth in the pleadings\u201d (emphasis supplied). The city first argues that no \u201cactual controversy\u201d exists because \u201cthe record does not show that the [cjhurch has been cited for any violation of a Springfield [cjity [ordinance.\u201d The city characterizes the invoice purportedly assessing a $3,000 fine as \u201cdefective on its face\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>for failure to \u201cinclude any information about appeals . . ., the citing officer or the circumstances surrounding the alleged violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">An \u201cactual controversy\u201d plainly exists between the city and the church. An \u201cactual controversy,\u201d a requirement that is to be \u201cliberally construed,\u201d G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9, is presented where there exists \u201ca \u2018real dispute\u2019 caused by the assertion by one party of a duty, right, or other legal relation in which he has a \u2018definite interest,\u2019 in circumstances indicating that failure to resolve the conflict will almost inevitably lead to litigation.\u201d <em>Entergy Nuclear Generation Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>459 Mass. 319, 325 (2011), quoting <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>381 Mass. 648, 659 (1980). Regardless whether the \u201cinvoice\u201d describing a \u201c [violation fine\u201d was actually effective,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the dispute over the validity of the ordinance remains an \u201cactual controversy.\u201d A declaratory judgment action \u201cmay be used to secure determinations of right, duty, status or other legal relations under <em>...&amp;... </em>municipal ordinance or by-law . . . including determination of any question of construction or validity thereof which may be involved in such determination.\u201d G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 2. By maintaining its existing system, the church continues to violate the ordinance; in theory, the city could issue an enforceable violation notice at any time, with the fine increasing each day the church remains in violation of the ordinance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relief will therefore alleviate any \u201cuncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status and other legal relations.\u201d G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The city next argues that the church failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 3. This claim is unavailing. The church has already appealed to the board, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>correctly held that it did not have the power to invalidate the ordinance. The city does not suggest any other administrative remedy the church could have pursued. As no other avenue of administrative appeal has been authorized by which to strike down the ordinance, the church had no such remedy to exhaust. See <em>Ciszewski </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Bd., </em>367 Mass. 135, 141 (1975). Regardless, we have previously not required exhaustion in cases challenging a regulation\u2019s constitutionality, see <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10800 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>459 Mass. 603, 629-630 (2011), and cases cited, and we see no reason not to extend this exception to constitutional challenges to local ordinances, particularly where, as here, the parties have stipulated to all relevant facts, and therefore no additional agency fact finding is necessary for us to answer the purely legal question presented. See <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., </em>421 Mass. 382, 385 (1995).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">c. <em>Preemption. </em>Under the Home Rule Amendment, \u201c[a]ny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, which is <em>not inconsistent </em>with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court . . . .\u201d See G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13 (Home Rule Procedures Act). Insofar as the ordinance conflicts with G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 93, and the code, the church contends that it is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with a law enacted by the General Court and thus impermissible under the Home Rule Amendment. The city, however, maintains that the ordinance is not inconsistent with the code because it allows buildings in the city to utilize one of the four \u201cfire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems\u201d contemplated by the code. According to the city, such a narrowing of options does not render the ordinance more restrictive than, or inconsistent with, the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In assessing the inconsistency of local enactments with the General Laws, \u201c[t]he legislative intent to preclude local action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>must be clear.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155 (1973). This intent can be either express or inferred. In other words, local action is precluded either where the \u201cLegislature has made an explicit indication of its intention in this respect,\u201d or where \u201cthe purpose of State legislation would be frustrated [by a local enactment] so as to warrant an inference that the Legislature intended to preempt the field.\u201d <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In authorizing the development of the code, the Legislature has expressly stated its intention: to ensure \u201c[u]niform standards and requirements for construction and construction materials . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 95 (a). The Legislature has also defined explicitly the board\u2019s responsibility to \u201crecommend or require tests and approvals and specify criteria and conditions, of materials, devices, and methods of construction,\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]he board shall issue certification of such acceptability, which certification <em>shall be binding on all cities and towns\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 94 <em>(d). </em>Further, the statute establishing the board<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> states that the code \u201cshall be binding and have the full force and effect of law on January [1, 1975], in all cities and towns notwithstanding any special or general law to the contrary.\u201d St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 67. That statute further provides that, \u201c[a]ll by-laws and ordinances of cities and towns or regulations promulgated by any state boards, commissions, agencies or departments or any special acts ... in conflict with the state building code shall cease to be effective on January [1, 1975].\u201d St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 75, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 144, \u00a7 1. \u201cThe above quoted sections, together with the whole of [St. 1972,] c. 802[,] and its subsequent amendments, evince a clear legislative intent ... to create uniform standards throughout the Commonwealth for the construction of buildings and materials used therein . . . .\u201d <em>Shriners\u2019 Hosp. for Crippled Children </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 551, 560 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge </em>v. <em>State Bldg. Code Appeals Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 381, 384 (1993).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The intent to preempt local ordinances is reflected also in other sections of the chapter. <em>\u201cA </em>conclusion that the Legislature intended to preempt a subject may also be inferred if the Legislature has explicitly limited the manner in which cities and towns may act on that subject.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 155. Here, the Legislature has done just that, establishing a mechanism through which a municipality may request that the board allow it to utilize more restrictive standards than those required by the code. See G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 98. The city, however, did not seek board approval of its ordinance. Such a mechanism would serve no purpose had the Legislature not intended the code to preempt local building regulations. Any other view of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 98, would impermissibly render it superfluous. See <em>Banushi </em>v. <em>Dorfman, </em>438 Mass. 242, 245 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Our decision in <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra, </em>is instructive. The town of Wendell had adopted a bylaw regulating the use of pesticides. It required anyone who intended to apply pesticides in the town to give notice to the local board of health, which could then hold a public hearing at which any interested person could argue for or against the proposed use. <em>Id. </em>at 520-522. This bylaw, however, was adopted without regard to the Massachusetts Pesticide Control Act (MPCA), which comprehensively addressed the distribution and registration of pesticides. The MPCA also established a \u201cpesticide board\u201d within the Department of Food and Agriculture, and empowered a subcommittee of the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to register pesticides for general or restricted use. <em>Id. </em>at 526. We held that the bylaw was preempted by the MPCA. The effect of the bylaw, we concluded, would be to impose \u201cconditions on the use of a pesticide beyond those established on a Statewide basis under the [MPCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. To allow a locality to impose additional requirements and \u201csecond-guess the determination of the State board would frustrate the purpose of the [MPCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The same reasoning applies here. The Legislature intended to occupy a field by promulgating comprehensive<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> legislation and delegating further regulation to a State board. The board\u2019s regulations, in turn, set a Statewide standard as to what products and practices were permissible in a particular field, a process involving a discretionary weighing of relevant factors such as cost and safety. In response, the local government created an additional layer of regulation imposing requirements beyond those contemplated by the board. There is no meaningful distinction between these cases,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we reach the same conclusion here: the code preempts inconsistent local regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Where the Legislature demonstrates its express intention to preempt local action, inconsistent local regulations are invalid under the Home Rule Amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 39-40 (1999). Once the board has determined that a certain system is consistent with its responsibility to \u201creduce the cost of construction and maintenance over the life of the building without affecting the health, safety and security of the occupants or users of buildings,\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 95 <em>(b), </em>any subsequent local action amounts to \u201cin effect second-guessing\u201d the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra. </em>In addition, the ordinance would frustrate the achievement of the stated statutory purpose of having centralized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Statewide standards in this area. See <em>id. </em>Whether construing the Legislature\u2019s stated intention of ensuring uniformity in building regulations either as an explicit statement of its desire to foreclose local action, or as a statutory purpose that would be frustrated thereby, the ordinance cannot stand.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">If all municipalities in the Commonwealth were allowed to enact similarly restrictive ordinances and bylaws, a patchwork of building regulations would ensue. Other sections of the code also provide alternative means of compliance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Allowing the city\u2019s ordinance to stand would permit a similar narrowing of options in such sections, sanctioning the development of different applicable building codes in each of the Commonwealth\u2019s 351 cities and towns, precisely the result that promulgation of the code was meant to foreclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the New England Legal Foundation and NAIOP Massachusetts in support of the plaintiff; and the amicus briefs of the State Board of Building Regulations and Standards (board) and the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\"> \u201cAll fire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems required by 780 [Code Mass.

The invoice purportedly assessing the \u201cviolation fine\u201d provides the reason for the fine, cites the ordinance and its penalty provision as authority for the fine, and states the amount of the fine. In addition to the absence of any supporting authority for its position, the city maintains, in seemingly contradictory fashion, that the church\u2019s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies involved \u201cfailure to file an appeal\u201d of the very fine the city otherwise describes as defective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Indeed, the city has been vigilant about ensuring compliance with the ordinance, ordering the systems changed on 250 parcels of real property that were not in compliance.

The Legislature empowered the board \u201c[t]o formulate, propose, adopt and amend rules and regulations,\u201d i.e., the code, which would govern \u201cthe construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, demolition, removal, inspection, issuance and revocation of permits or licenses, installation of equipment, classification and definition of any building or structure and use or occupancy of all buildings and structures and parts thereof or classes of buildings and structures and parts thereof\u201d and \u201cthe standards or requirements for materials to be used in connection therewith, including but not limited to provisions for safety, ingress and egress, energy conservation, and sanitary conditions.\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 94 <em>(a). </em>Indeed, while specialized codes governing fire prevention and safety predated enactment of the code, these were incorporated into the code by G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 96, thus forming a comprehensive system of regulation at the State level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Contrary to the city\u2019s claim, <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7 (1979), is not applicable here. In <em>Lovequist, </em>we held that a local bylaw was not preempted by the State Wetlands Protection Act because it \u201csets forth minimum standards only, \u2018leaving local communities free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>adopt more stringent controls.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, quoting <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Falmouth, </em>358 Mass. 519, 526 (1970). Unlike the Wetlands Protection Act at issue in <em>Lovequist, </em>G. L. c. 143 and the code are intended to occupy the field of building regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The complaint suggests that only one vendor of the permitted \u201c[c]ity approved Radio Box\u201d actually exists, located in Wilbraham, a town located near Springfield. If so, the ordinance may also depart from the statutory purpose of avoiding \u201cunwarranted preferential treatment of . . . products.\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 95 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">According to the city\u2019s submissions, by mandating this \u201c[c]ity approved Radio Box,\u201d the city is attempting to circumvent third-party relay of fire alarms and thereby increase response times. We are not indifferent to the city\u2019s concerns. The Legislature, however, has placed in the board the responsibility for determining, on a Statewide basis, what \u201cfire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems\u201d are permitted in Massachusetts. The board has provided building owners throughout the Commonwealth with a choice from among four specified systems, a reflection of its judgment that all four options sufficiently protect public safety. Pursuant to the statute, the board has an obligation to \u201cmake a continuing study of the operation of the [code] ... to ascertain [its] effect upon the cost of building construction and the effectiveness of [its] provisions for health, safety, energy conservation and security.\u201d G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 94 (c). The board, which by statute must include the State fire marshal and the head of a municipal fire department, see G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 93, is best able to balance these objectives. Because of this expertise, the Legislature has delegated such decisions to the board, and we will neither second guess its determinations ourselves nor allow municipalities to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">But the city is not without recourse. First, it could avail itself of the statutory mechanism described above, G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 98, and request that the board allow it to utilize a more restrictive standard. Second, the city \u201cmay propose amendments to the state building code,\u201d which \u201cshall\u201d be considered at public hearings held twice annually. G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 97. Third, the city could pursue direct action in the Legislature to change the code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">There is no merit to the city\u2019s contention that the ordinance is no more restrictive than the code because it merely narrows the permissible options among State-approved alternatives. See <em>Connors </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 38 (1999) (rejecting argument that State law requires only \u201cfloor\u201d as opposed to \u201cceiling\u201d health coverage). By establishing the board, the Legislature intended to ensure Statewide uniformity in building practices. The board, in turn, has approved four \u201cfire protective signaling systems and automatic fire detection systems\u201d for use in buildings in the Commonwealth. The city\u2019s argument elides the fact that, by permitting only one of the State-approved options, it has also foreclosed three other such options. The facts of this case demonstrate the inconsistency of the city ordinance with the code: the code permits the church\u2019s system and the ordinance does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">For example, the code allows roofs of one-family and two-family residences to be made of at least eight different materials, 780 Code Mass.
