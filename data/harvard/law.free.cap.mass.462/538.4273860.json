L. c. 53, \u00a7 14 (\u00a7 14), and its application to the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of a minor political party.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\"><em>Background and procedural history. </em>In early 2008, a pair of candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency of the United States of America began collecting the signatures of registered voters on nomination papers circulating throughout the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The nomination papers bore the political designation \u201cLibertarian.\u201d These candidates, however, failed to secure the indorsement of the national Libertarian party at its convention in May, 2008. The Libertarian Association of Massachusetts (LAM) then contacted the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) and requested that the names of the persons who won the national party indorsement be substituted for the names of the candidates listed on the nomination papers being circulated in the Commonwealth. The Secretary refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where a preliminary injunction was issued requiring the Secretary to include the names of the nationally indorsed candidates on the ballot. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>584 F. Supp. 2d 316 (D. Mass. 2008) <em>(Barr I). </em>The Federal judge who issued the injunction subsequently granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, ruling that \u00a7 14 was unconstitutionally vague and its application to the plaintiffs violative of the equal protection clause to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>659 F. Supp. 2d 225 (D. Mass. 2009) <em>(Barr II). </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit) reversed the judge\u2019s ruling with regard to the equal protection clause. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>626 F.3d 99, 108-111 (1st Cir. 2010) <em>(Barr III). </em>It also abstained from interpreting \u00a7 14 or deciding the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d claim, positing that any \u201cclarification by judicial interpretation\u201d was best left to \u201cMassachusetts courts ... in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107-108, citing <em>Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. </em>v. <em>Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 499-502 (1941) <em>(Pullman </em>abstention). On remand, the District Court judge stayed the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d claim \u201cpending a state court interpretive clarification of the state statute,\u201d and dismissed all other claims without prejudice. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>755 F. Supp. 2d 293, 295 (D. Mass. 2010) <em>(Barr TV). </em>He also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent request to certify a question to this court regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 14. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>793 F. Supp. 2d 463, 465 (D. Mass. 2011) <em>(Barr V).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Consequently, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Secretary in the county court, seeking a declaration under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, that \u00a7 14 provides a minor party, which does not qualify as a \u201cpolitical party\u201d under Massachusetts law, a means to \u201csubstitute\u201d the names of presidential and vice-presidential candidates chosen at the minor party\u2019s national convention for those listed on nomination papers being circulated and signed by registered voters throughout Massachusetts. In the alternative, they sought a declaration that \u00a7 14 does not afford minor parties a substitution mechanism and that this failure violates art. 9 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Finally, the plaintiffs argued that, were the single justice unable to explicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the meaning of \u00a7 14, he must deem that provision unconstitutionally vague. The Secretary moved to dismiss this action on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that they failed to establish an \u201cactual controversy\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1. The single justice reserved and reported the matter without decision to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Before us, the Secretary reiterates his threshold argument concerning G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, and challenges the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. He contends that \u00a7 14 is limited in scope and, assuming arguendo it applies to presidential electors, requires only that vacancies be filled \u201cin the same manner\u201d as the \u201coriginal nomination,\u201d thereby obligating the plaintiffs and any candidates chosen at their national convention to fulfil the same requirements as the original candidates listed on the nomination papers \u2014 that is, by submitting nomination papers bearing the signatures of 10,000 registered voters. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>If the time between the national convention and the signature filing deadline is insufficient to complete this task, the Secretary contends, \u00a7 14 does not provide any additional recourse to minor parties or the candidates their members indorsed at a national convention. According to the Secretary, the lack of recourse in these circumstances is not unconstitutional because the protections of art. 9 are coextensive with those of the Federal equal protection clause, with which the Massachusetts ballot access provisions have been found to comport. See <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 108-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We conclude that this matter is properly before us. The plaintiffs have established an \u201cactual controversy\u201d because the initial dispute between the parties, while moot, is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 105, quoting <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911), and because our decision today will have an immediate impact in the ongoing Federal proceedings between the parties. On the merits, we conclude that \u00a7 14 applies to presidential electors and assume (but need not decide) by extension to the presidential and vice-presidential candidates the electors have pledged to support. Although \u00a7 14, as written, is not a model of clarity and its meaning not without uncertainty, we interpret it in a manner largely consistent with the interpretation proffered by the Secretary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Finally, aligning our analysis under art. 9 with that of the equal protection clause, we perceive no constitutional deficiency in the election law scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><em>Statutory framework. </em>Within the Commonwealth, only a certain subclass of active political organizations receives the formal label \u201c[political party\u201d and the corresponding benefits and privileges afforded that status. To attain that label, a political organization must either (1) have had a candidate for Statewide office gamer at least three per cent of the votes cast in the most recent biennial election; or (2) enroll a number of voters \u201cequal to or greater than one percent of the entire number of voters registered in the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 1. Once a political organization satisfies either requirement, it is eligible to conduct \u201cprimaries and caucuses for the nomination of city and town officers,\u201d <em>id., </em>among other things. If a political organization does not satisfy either requirement, it receives no formal recognition under Massachusetts law but may serve nonetheless as a \u201c[political designation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">One of the privileges of attaining party status is the ease with which a recognized political party may place its candidates on the ballot for the general election. With regard to presidential and vice-presidential candidates, the party\u2019s State committee need only submit a certificate of nomination to the Secretary bearing the surnames of the party\u2019s chosen candidates by the second Tuesday of the September preceding the election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8, first par. This certificate must include the names and residences of the selected presidential electors, along with a written acceptance and pledge by each to vote for the candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency named in the filing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Other candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>whether affiliated with a political organization or not, must follow a different path to the ballot. See G. L. c. 53, \u00a7\u00a7 6-10. This class of candidates must file nomination papers for their chosen presidential electors, signed by at least 10,000 registered voters. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6. These nomination papers must include the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, as well as the names and residences of the candidates for presidential electors who have pledged to vote for them. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8, first par. The papers also may include \u201cthe political designation, if any, which [the candidate] represents.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The nomination papers must be submitted to election officials through a two-step process. First, they must be provided to the registrars of the cities or towns in which the signatories reside, so that the registrars can certify whether the signatures belong to registered voters. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 7, second par. Next, the nomination papers \u2014 once certified \u2014 must be filed with the Secretary. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 10, first par. The deadlines for these submissions are precise, and intertwined: nomination papers must be filed with the Secretary by the last Tuesday in the August preceding the election, <em>id.] </em>they must be submitted to the local registrars for certification at least twenty-eight days before the deadline for filing with the Secretary, G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 7; and certification must be complete no later than the seventh day before the deadline for filing with the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn 2008, the deadline for submitting such nomination papers to local [registrars] was July 29. . . . In turn, the deadline for transmitting them to the Secretary was August 26.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The aforementioned provisions express the two routes by which the names of presidential and vice-presidential candidates may appear on the ballot for the general election.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties, however, contest whether the election laws, in particular \u00a7 14, provide a mechanism for <em>replacing, </em>in appropriate circumstances, the names of candidates who have qualified for ballot access.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">While we reserve our discussion of this statutory provision for later in the opinion, we recite here the pertinent part of \u00a7 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cIf a candidate nominated for a state, city or town office dies before the day of election, or withdraws his name from nomination, or is found ineligible, the vacancy . . . may be filled by the same political party or persons who made the original nomination, and in the same manner; or, if the time is insufficient therefor, the vacancy may be filled, if the nomination was made by a convention or caucus, in such manner as the convention or caucus may have prescribed, or, if no such provision has been made, by a regularly elected general or executive committee representing the political party or persons who held such convention or caucus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\"><em>Facts. </em>We turn now to the facts, which have been well-documented in the various Federal court opinions concerning this dispute. See <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 102-104; <em>Barr II, supra </em>at 226-227; <em>Barr I, supra </em>at 318-319.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In 2007, the LAM,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which was not then a recognized \u201cpolitical party\u201d under Massachusetts election laws, began preparing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the 2008 general election. In July and September, George Phil-lies, then-chair of the LAM, sent an electronic mail message (email) to the Secretary inquiring whether, if the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for whom the association collected signatures in Massachusetts did not receive the Libertarian party\u2019s indorsement at its national nominating convention, scheduled for May, 2008, the LAM could substitute on the ballot their names for the actual candidates selected. \u201cIn October of 2007, an aide to the Secretary responded that the Secretary\u2019s office could \u2018prepare a form that allows members of the party to request the substitution of the candidate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 103. Once nomination papers became available in February, 2008, Phillies began circulating papers listing himself as a presidential candidate and Chris Bennett as a vice-presidential candidate. The papers also named the requisite number of presidential electors and identified the slate\u2019s \u201cpolitical designation\u201d as \u201cLibertarian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In May, three months into this campaign, the Libertarian National Committee hosted its convention in Denver, Colorado. There, Phillies and Bennett competed for the national organization\u2019s indorsement. They ultimately lost to Bob Barr and Wayne A. Root, who became the organization\u2019s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">After the convention, Phillies returned to Massachusetts (where he had collected approximately 7,000 signatures on his and Bennett\u2019s nomination papers) and, on May 29, 2008, again corresponded with the Secretary\u2019s office, asking for the form mentioned in the previous exchange. In this e-mail, however, Phillies explicitly referred to the presidential and vice-presidential candidates listed on the nomination papers as \u201cstand-ins,\u201d and informed the Secretary that the \u201cactual candidates, who were not the same as the stand-ins, were chosen at the Libertarian Party national convention [in May].\u201d In response, an attorney in the elections division of the Secretary\u2019s office conceded that, \u201cin certain rare circumstances, [the office had authorized] ballot substitution,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but, she emphasized, the Secretary had \u201cnot applied a process which would obviate the statutory mechanism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>for a Presidential candidate of a political designation to seek ballot access when this mechanism remains available,\u201d nor had the Secretary \u201cinterpreted the election laws to authorize the use of placeholder names or stand-in candidates.\u201d Moreover, she noted, the deadline to submit nomination papers to the local registrars (July 29, 2008) was two months away; thus, unlike in previous circumstances where the Secretary had allowed candidate substitution, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>there was ample time to obtain the requisite number of signatures for the nominees selected at the national convention. Therefore, the aide recommended that the LAM stop collecting signatures for Phillies and Bennett and begin gathering signatures in support of Barr and Root.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Despite this recommendation, Phillies continued circulating the nomination papers for his and Bennett\u2019s candidacies, ultimately gathering well over the 10,000 signatures required by statute. He submitted these papers in a timely manner, and they subsequently were certified and filed with the Secretary, thereby qualifying Phillies and Bennett for ballot access. \u201cIn contrast, Barr and Root did not submit any nomination papers, did not provide any evidence that they had secured the necessary signatures, and did not identify any presidential electors.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Justiciability. </em>Before reaching the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we consider whether the instant action poses an \u201cactual controversy,\u201d such that declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">An actual controversy arises under our law where there is \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>real dispute caused by the assertion by one party of a legal relation, status or right in which he has a definite interest, and the denial of such assertion by another party also having a definite interest in the subject matter, where the circumstances attending the dispute plainly indicate that unless the matter is adjusted such antagonistic claims will almost immediately and inevitably lead to litigation.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Sch. of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 518 (1946). See, e.g., <em>Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State College Bldg. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 418, 423 (1979) <em>(Department of Community Affairs). </em>Accordingly, declaratory relief is reserved for real controversies and is not a vehicle for resolving abstract, hypothetical, or otherwise moot questions. <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 292-293 (1977). Within these constraints, however, the declaratory judgment act must be \u201cliberally construed,\u201d so as to effectuate its remedial goals of \u201cremoving], and ... affording] relief from, uncertainty and insecurity with regard to rights [and] duties.\u201d G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9. See <em>Entergy Nuclear Generation Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envt\u2019l Protection, </em>459 Mass. 319, 327-328 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Here, both the plaintiffs and the Secretary \u201cunquestionably [have] a \u2018definite interest in the subject matter\u2019 \u201d of \u00a7 14, see <em>Department of Community Affairs, supra, </em>a provision that, as both the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit have posited, is riddled with uncertainties in this context. See <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 106-107; <em>Barr II, supra </em>at 228-230; <em>Barr I, supra </em>at 320. The plaintiffs also have exposed these interests and uncertainties in litigation stemming from an identifiable dispute borne of the 2008 presidential election; they do not come to us with an abstract puzzle of statutory interpretation. See <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth. </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Comm\u2019n, </em>380 Mass. 785, 792 (1980), citing <em>Department of Community Affairs, supra </em>at 422-423 (\u201cQuestions of statutory interpretation, by themselves, do not rise to the level of actual controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Although this underlying dispute is technically moot (the 2008 election having arisen and concluded in the past), we previously have entertained petitions for declaratory relief \u201cwhere the issue was one of public importance, where it was fully argued on both sides, where the question was certain, or at least very likely to arise again in similar factual circumstances, and especially where appellate review could not be obtained before the recurring question would again be moot.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>410 Mass. 847, 851 (1991), quoting <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 121 (1991). See, e.g., <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 156, 159-160 (1985) (challenge to Massachusetts disaffiliation provision falls within exception to mootness bar for purposes of declaratory relief). The present case satisfies this standard. See <em>Barr III, supra, </em>citing <em>Illinois State Bd. of Elections </em>v. <em>Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U.S. 173, 187 (1979) (LAM\u2019s claims capable of repetition yet evading review because of \u201ctemporal parameters\u201d of ballot access procedures and association\u2019s inability to secure \u2014 or maintain \u2014 party status).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Compare <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra, </em>with <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 785 (1984) (no actual controversy where alleged violation of plaintiffs\u2019 right to gather signatures for initiative petition unlikely to recur in substantially same form).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Finally, given the broad, remedial purposes of the declaratory judgment act, even were we to recognize the flaws the Secretary has identified in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, \u201cwe [likely] would still exercise our discretion to consider the substantive issues raised therein.\u201d <em>Entergy Nuclear Generation Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envt\u2019l Protection, supra </em>at 328, citing <em>Southbridge </em>v. <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co., </em>371 Mass. 209, 214-215 (1976). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>posture of this case, which comes to us on the heels of a First Circuit opinion invoking the doctrine of the <em>Pullman </em>abstention, is unprecedented within the Massachusetts court system. See <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 107-108. While this fact alone could not compel us to exercise our jurisdiction under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, cf. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 575 (1982) (declining to answer definitively one of four certified questions from Federal District Court), it nonetheless informs the utility of our decision to do so. Despite the Secretary\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the Federal proceedings remain unresolved in light of the abstention order; pursuant to the First Circuit\u2019s directive, the Federal District Court explicitly stayed further consideration of the \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d claim in anticipation of State court clarification of the challenged provision, \u00a7 14. <em>Barr IV, supra </em>at 295. See 17A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 122.07 (3d ed. 2012) (describing procedural option of abstention). Thus, our decision today will \u201cserve[] the useful purpose and give[] the practical effect of terminating the uncertainty or controversy\u201d still present in those proceedings. <em>Perschall </em>v. <em>State, </em>697 So. 2d 240, 253 (La. 1997). We see no reason to delay a decision on the merits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 53, \u00a714. </em>Turning to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we first address the \u201ctwo types of imprecision\u201d the First Circuit identified in \u00a7 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cFirst, [the statute] refers to candidates seeking \u2018state, city or town office,\u2019 but provides no further elaboration as to the specific offices that are encompassed within that rubric.

Second, [\u00a7] 14 explains that vacancies \u2018may be filled by the same political party or persons who made the original nomination.\u2019 . . . [T]he reference to \u2018persons who made the original nomination\u2019 arguably could apply to the [LAM] or, alternatively, to the individuals who signed the nomination papers qualifying Phillies and Bennett for inclusion on the ballot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Barr III, supra </em>at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We resolve these imprecisions by reference to familiar canons of statutory interpretation, \u201c[o]ur primary duty in interpreting a statute [being] \u2018to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency </em>Fund, 456 Mass. 594, 601 (2010), quoting <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S.

Conversely, where the words of a statute are ambiguous, or seemingly in conflict with one another, we interpret the statute, \u201c \u2018if possible, so \u201cas to make it an effectual piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason\u201d \u2019 . . . and \u2018takfing] care to . . . carry out the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut.

While the individuals who fill those offices are elected by and serve the people of Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>exclusively, the men and women acting as presidential electors are selected by the people of Massachusetts to cast their votes, together with electors from the other States in the Union, for the highest elected Federal office, the presidency. Thus, presidential electors arguably serve both a State and a national purpose, and do not fit neatly within the construct of a \u201cstate . . . office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">These initial hurdles do not mean, however, that the Legislature necessarily intended to exclude presidential electors from the procedural dictates of \u00a7 14. They simply goad us to undertake a holistic evaluation of the election law regime, and to ascertain as we must \u201cthe intent of the statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which it relates.\u201d <em>DiGiacomo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 346 (2006). See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra </em>at 839 (courts \u201cshould not accept the literal meaning of the words of a statute without regard for that statute\u2019s purpose and history\u201d). Thus, we turn to the statutory scheme \u201cas a whole,\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, supra, </em>mindful that \u201c[t]he general purpose of the Legislature in enacting the statutes regulating . . . elections was to make a reasonably consistent and harmonious body of law . . . which should have the final result of filling the offices required by law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>250 Mass. 188, 190 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">First, with regard to the hybrid function of the presidential electors, we find instructive (in this limited fashion) the statutory definition of \u201cState officer.\u201d Under G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 1, that term explicitly includes United States Senators and Representatives from Massachusetts, who, like presidential electors, are elected by Massachusetts voters, yet serve a Federal function. Thus, to some extent, the Legislature anticipated the scope of the term \u201cState officer\u201d \u2014 a term analogous to \u201cstate . . . office\u201d \u2014 to extend beyond its literal meaning. Cf. <em>In re Green, </em>134 U.S. 377, 379 (1890) (\u201cAlthough [presidential] electors are appointed and act under and pursuant to the Constitution of the United States, they are no more officers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>agents of the United States than are the members of the state legislatures when acting as electors of federal senators, or the people of the States when acting as electors of representatives in Congress\u201d). But see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 38 (1968) (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is unnecessary in this case to decide whether [presidential] electors are state rather than federal officials . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">This suggests to us that the dual nature of presidential electors should not stand as an impediment to their inclusion under \u00a7 14, an inference bolstered by the Legislature\u2019s treatment of the position elsewhere. Throughout the statutory regime, the Legislature repeatedly includes the position of presidential elector within the class of offices chosen at a \u201cState election,\u201d see note 15, <em>supra, </em>quoting G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 1, and, accordingly, makes various provisions relevant to them. See, e.g., G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6 (signature requirement for nomination papers for \u201cany offices to be filled at a state election,\u201d including \u201cpresidential electors\u201d); G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 43A (order of offices listed on ballots at State election includes \u201cPresidential elector\u201d); G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 151. The Legislature also imposes myriad requirements on candidates for \u201cstate office\u201d that doubtless apply to candidates for presidential elector. See, e.g., G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 7 (imposing on \u201ccandidate[s] for . . . state officefs]\u201d contingent deadline for filing nomination papers with city or town registrars); G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 17 (obligating Secretary to \u201cprovide blank forms for the nomination of candidates for all state offices\u201d). We see no reason to assume that the Legislature would have employed the term \u201cstate . . . office\u201d differently in \u00a7 14, particularly where it has not enacted another provision relative to the filling of vacancies for presidential elector. Therefore, reading the statute as a whole and in light of its legislative purpose and scope, we conclude that the reference to \u201ccandidate[s] for . . . state . . . office\u201d in \u00a7 14 is intended to encompass candidates for presidential elector.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">From here, we face the more difficult question whether the presidential and vice-presidential candidates themselves come within the class of candidates governed by \u00a7 14. The plaintiffs contend that they must, simply by virtue of their association with the presidential electors. The Secretary, however, divorces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the candidates from their electors in this instance and argues that they cannot be considered candidates for \u201cstate . . . office\u201d because they seek offices \u2014 the presidency and vice-presidency \u2014 that are selected at a national convention of the Electoral College, not elected by the voters of Massachusetts alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We agree with the premise of the Secretary\u2019s argument: the President and Vice-President are elected to lead the United States as a whole and, therefore, occupy quintessentially national offices. Consequently, candidates for those positions should not themselves qualify as \u201ccandidates for . . . state . . . office[s]\u201d under \u00a7 14. This conclusion, however, only takes us so far and does not fully resolve the problem arising from the inextricable link between the presidential and vice-presidential candidates and their electors. Under G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8, the presidential electors must \u201cpledge\u201d their support to presidential and vice-presidential candidates, who, in turn, must list their slate of presidential electors on any nomination papers circulated throughout the Commonwealth. Thus, the public allegiance of the presidential electors, for whom the people technically cast their vote, see G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 78, is a prerequisite to having the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates printed on the ballot. See art. II, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">While this constitutionally and statutorily entrenched relationship between presidential electors and the candidates themselves lends credence to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that both should fall under the purview of \u00a7 14, it also gives us pause in a manner the parties do not contemplate. If we read \u00a7 14 as permitting some body (whether it be a minor party or political organization) to change the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates to whom electors are pledged, then what of the statutory duty of electors to vote for the candidates named in the filing? See G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8. Are we to read \u00a7 8 as embracing an \u201camended\u201d filing with the names of the substituted candidates, or to assume the electors\u2019 continued allegiance to the original candidates for whom they had pledged (in writing) to vote?<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In light of our ultimate interpretation of \u00a7 14, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>resolve these issues today. As discussed below, where a \u201ccandidate for a state . . . office\u201d nominated through nomination papers withdraws, the party or persons who had supported that nomination must utilize the same nomination procedures (i.e., the signature-gathering requirements of G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6) to gain ballot access for another candidate. Thus, whether they seek to change the names of the electors or the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates themselves, such parties or persons must submit a new filing. Under this interpretation, then, our concerns described above fall away.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">b. <em>Scope of \u201csubstitution\u201d mechanism. </em>Moving now to the second disputed portion of \u00a7 14, we consider the manner in which that provision allows for the filling of a vacancy where a candidate withdraws his or her nomination. First, we note that \u00a7 14 is applicable only when a candidate who has been nominated withdraws, dies, or is otherwise ineligible; thus, the candidate must complete the nomination requirements and formally withdraw before any vacancy is created or may be filled. See G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 13. On its face, then, this provision does not apply where a candidate seeks to transfer his or her signatures to another candidate midway through the nomination process.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Once a vacancy is created under \u00a7 13, it \u201cmay be filled by the same political party or persons who made the original nomination and in the same manner.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 14. In describing the imprecisions contained in this portion of the statute, the First Circuit concentrated on the first clause, asking whom the Legislature had empowered to fill a vacancy. See <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 107. The parties, however, offer conflicting interpretations of both clauses in this passage, and thus grapple over who the Legislature intended to have the authority to fill a vacancy, as well as the manner in which that authority may be exercised. We consider each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">With respect to who has the authority to fill a vacancy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>plaintiffs contend that the statutory language embraces \u201cthose persons or entities that requested, circulated, and filed the nomination papers\u201d \u2014 in these circumstances, the LAM. The Secretary rejects this construction of the statute, asserting that, although a candidate may identify himself or herself as \u201cLibertarian,\u201d the LAM itself does not have a right to dictate which, if any, \u201cLibertarian-affiliated\u201d candidates appear on the Massachusetts ballot because the organization has not achieved party status. Consequently, the Secretary reads the statute as applying to the 10,000 voters who actually signed the nomination papers for the original candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We agree with the Secretary\u2019s position that the LAM\u2019s status as a political designation has some relevance to this inquiry; the association cannot expect us to disregard its statutory status, or lack thereof, and permit it direct access to the ballot. See G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 1; G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8. However, it seems unreasonable to conclude, as the Secretary suggests, that the Legislature intended to restrict the pertinent language of \u00a7 14 to the actual signatories of the nomination papers. While it takes 10,000 certified signatures to \u201cmake\u201d the nomination, in a sense, it is contrary to reason and experience to assume that so large a group coalesces around a single candidate of their own accord. Rather, the candidates themselves, or the minor party or political organization with which they are affiliated, mobilize volunteers (or contract with a company) to collect the required signatures. See Note, Guarding the Treehouse: Are States \u201cQualified\u201d to Restrict Ballot Access in Federal Elections?, 80 B.U. L. Rev. 289, 297 (2000). Thus, the better interpretation of the statute comports with this reality and recognizes that some persons or entities must work on the voters themselves, to corral them and to secure their signatures in support of any given candidate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Despite the Secretary\u2019s fears, adopting this interpretation of the statute will not permit candidates unaffiliated with a recognized political party to circumvent the signature-gathering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>requirements of G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6. This is because, regardless of the identity of the \u201cpersons\u201d making the substitution, the plain language of the statute obligates them to fill the vacancy \u201cin the same manner\u201d as the original nomination. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 14. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986); <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985). In the case of candidates nominated by nomination papers, the \u201cmanner\u201d dictated by the Legislature is clear: the candidate must, among other things, gather the signatures of 10,000 voters, submit them for certification to local election officials, and subsequently file them with the Secretary. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7\u00a7 6-10. If \u201ctime is insufficient\u201d to complete this task, \u00a7 14 provides no other means by which a person or party can \u201creplace\u201d a candidate nominated through nomination papers: it plainly confines the limited alternative avenues for filling a vacancy to those candidates nominated by \u201cconvention or caucus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The plaintiffs do not, nor could they, put forth a compelling argument to overcome this unambiguous language. They nonetheless urge us to extrapolate from the latter provision \u2014 that contemplating \u201calternative\u201d mechanisms for filling a vacancy \u2014 a legislative intent to defer to the decisions of a minor party where the need to replace a candidate affiliated with it arises and the time to gather the requisite number of signatures is insufficient. This we cannot do. The Legislature has made no provision in the election laws for the internal processes of minor parties or political organizations (as opposed to those of recognized political parties) with regard to the indorsement of presidential candidates.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Rather, it has constructed a scheme where such candidates, like those running independently of a political party or organization, must go to the voters directly, and draw from them some \u201cmodicum of support,\u201d as evidenced through their signatures on nomination papers. See <em>Jenness </em>v. <em>Fortson, </em>403 U.S. 431, 442 (1971). The candidates\u2019 names, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>then, are not placed on the ballot simply because the minor party or political organization they might represent indorses them; such a privilege is reserved for candidates of recognized political parties, which have demonstrated a \u201cmeasurable quantum of community support\u201d by their performance in the preceding biennial election. <em>See American Party of Tex. </em>v. <em>White, </em>415 U.S. 767, 782 (1974) <em>(White). </em>Consequently, we decline to read into \u00a7 14 a legislative intent at odds with the processes delineated elsewhere in the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>D\u2019Avella </em>v. <em>McGonigle, </em>429 Mass. 820, 822-823 (1999), quoting <em>Boston Neighborhood Taxi Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>410 Mass. 686, 690 (1991) (\u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it is \u2018the sole function of the courts ... to enforce it according to its terms\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">3. <em>Article 9. </em>Notwithstanding the imprecisions it identified in \u00a7 14, the First Circuit proceeded to examine \u2014 and reject \u2014 the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the equal protection clause that, by refusing to allow substitution of minor party presidential and vice-presidential candidates, \u201cthe Secretary discriminates arbitrarily between recognized political parties and [minor parties or political organizations].\u201d <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 108-111. The plaintiffs now bring a more generalized claim of constitutional violation under art. 9,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which they contend affords the citizenry broader ballot access protections than does the Federal equal protection clause. The Secretary, in turn, argues that this court has interpreted the State and Federal provisions coextensively, such that we should conclude that art. 9, like its Federal counterpart, does not require the \u201csubstitution\u201d the plaintiffs seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a. <em>Interpretation relative to the Federal Constitution. </em>As an initial matter, we agree with the Secretary that, in this context, art. 9 does not extend any protections beyond the Federal constitutional requirements. We, therefore, reject the plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that our holding in <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int'l, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 83 (1983), is somehow dispositive of the issue at hand. There, we decided that art. 9, unlike the First and Fourteenth Amendments, guaranteed a candidate\u2019s right to solicit signatures for his nomination in a privately owned shopping center. <em>Id. </em>at 87-93. In doing so, we relied, in large measure, on differences in the language of art. 9, which does not require State action, and that of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, which do.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 88-90. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 372 (1985). We did not enlarge generally the scope of ballot access rights protected under art. 9 vis-a-vis the Federal Constitution, and significantly, we have not done so in other cases. Indeed, in every other context where this issue has arisen, we have treated the State and Federal constitutional safeguards in the same manner, leaving for another day \u201cthe question whether the art. 9 standard diverges in any way from equal protection.\u201d <em>Bachrach </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>382 Mass. 268, 273-274 n.12 (1981). See, e.g., <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, 396 </em>Mass. 156, 163 (1985); <em>Langone </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>388 Mass. 185, 199-200 (1983), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Bellotti </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>460 U.S. 1057 (1983). Cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Election Comm\u2019rs of Cambridge, </em>309 Mass. 303, 335 (1941) (concluding that analysis under State Constitution, including art. 9, sufficient to \u201cdispose of\u201d contentions under Federal Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As our decisions in <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int'l, Inc., supra, </em>and the cases cited imply, we have the inherent authority \u201cto interpret state constitutional provisions to accord greater protection to individual rights than do similar provisions of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 328 (2003), quoting <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>514 U.S. 1, 8 (1995). But the mere existence of that authority does not require us to exercise it at every turn. In arguing that we should do so here, the plaintiffs primarily rely on our historic invocation of it, and offer scant justification unique to ballot access guarantees to support heightening protections of them under our State Constitution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 346-351 (2012) (examining text, history, and prior interpretations of Massachusetts constitutional right against self-incrimination to determine that art. 12 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides more stringent protections for invoking right to silence than does Fifth Amendment to United States Constitution). They, in essence, offer \u201cno separate reasons, and we are unaware of any, to conclude that the Massachusetts Constitution affords them protection not provided by . . . the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra, </em>quoting <em>Langone </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">b. <em>Application. </em>Given our conclusion regarding the scope of protections under art. 9, we assess the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims within the familiar territory charted by the First Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201cCandidates for political office enjoy both a . . . right to participate equally in the electoral process and [to] associate with one another to achieve policy goals.\u201d <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>575 F.

See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 787-788 (1983). In theory and in practice, these rights intertwine with those of voters \u201cto associate with one another and cast their ballots as they see fit.\u201d <em>Ireland, supra, </em>citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 30 (1968). See <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 143 (1972) (\u201cthe rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">While these rights are fundamental, they \u2014 and the general principles to which they attach \u2014 do not amount to \u201can open sesame for minor parties and individuals who want to appear on the ballot with the major [party] candidates.\u201d <em>Ireland, supra, </em>quoting <em>Socialist Workers Party </em>v. <em>Hechler, </em>890 F.2d 1303, 1304 (4th Cir. 1989). Rather, they stand as foils to a State\u2019s entrenched authority to regulate elections, a practical necessity to ensure that our democratic processes remain fair, honest, and orderly. See <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974). Thus, to evaluate the constitutionality of State ballot access regimes, the United States Supreme Court has developed a \u201csliding scale\u201d approach, see <em>id., </em>through which courts \u201cweigh the \u2018character and magnitude\u2019 of the burden the State\u2019s rule imposes on [the plaintiffs\u2019] rights against the interests the State contends justify that burden, and consider the extent to which the State\u2019s concerns make the burden necessary.\u201d <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Twin Cities Area New Party, </em>520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997) <em>(Timmons), </em>quoting <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, supra </em>at 434. \u201cRegulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs\u2019 rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest. Lesser burdens . . . trigger less exacting review, and a State\u2019s \u2018important regulatory interests\u2019 will usually be enough to justify \u2018reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Timmons, supra, </em>quoting <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Here, the burdens the plaintiffs allege are twofold, and, it appears, framed differently than those asserted before the First Circuit. First, the plaintiffs contend that, absent a mechanism to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201csubstitute]\u201d the names of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates listed on nomination papers in Massachusetts for those indorsed at a national Libertarian nominating convention, the statutory scheme forces minor parties into the unfortunate position of selecting their nominees before the date on which nomination papers are released (typically, in February of a presidential election year), or waiting to do so until later in the election cycle, thereby depriving them of the full amount of time to collect signatures. Second, they contend, the absence of a substitution mechanism may impede the voting rights of qualified citizens who support a minor party. To this end, the plaintiffs elaborate on two scenarios, positing that (1) if the nationally indorsed candidates are not placed on the ballot, their supporters must resort to the \u201cwrite-in\u201d ballot, see G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 42; and (2) if the candidates nominated through nomination papers who do not earn the national indorsement are listed on the ballot alongside a minor party designation, voters may mistakenly believe that those candidates are \u201cthe minor party\u2019s chosen candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">To some extent, these burdens are significant. \u201cBut they cannot be considered in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Ireland, supra </em>at 756. That is, while the plaintiffs accentuate the dire consequences of a perceived tear in the statutory fabric (i.e., the absence of a \u201csubstitution mechanism\u201d), we are obligated to step back and contemplate the cumulative effect of the legislative tapestry. See <em>Libertarian Party of Wash. </em>v. <em>Munro, </em>31 F.3d 759, 761-762 (9th Cir. 1994) <em>(Munro) </em>(examining \u201centire scheme regulating ballot access\u201d where minor party challenged specific provision that granted major, but not minor, parties second opportunity to place candidates on ballot after filing deadline had passed). In doing so, we ask whether \u201cthe challenged laws \u2018freeze\u2019 the status quo by effectively barring all candidates other than those of the major parties,\u201d <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Blunt, </em>863 F.2d 1368, 1374 (8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 893 (1989), quoting <em>Jenness </em>v. <em>Fortson, </em>403 U.S. 431, 439 (1971), or \u201cwhether \u2018reasonably diligent\u2019 minor party candidates can normally gain a place on the ballot.\u201d <em>Munro, supra </em>at 762, quoting <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">When viewed in this context, the plaintiffs\u2019 purported right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201csubstitution\u201d loses what little theoretical traction it might have had when scrutinized on its own. As the First Circuit aptly noted, \u201c[t]he Massachusetts ballot access provisions at issue here are nondiscriminatory, \u2019\u2019 <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 109, and extend to all classes of candidates an \u201cequality of opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, quoting <em>Werme </em>v. Merrill, 84 F.3d 479, 485 (1st Cir. 1996). The laws subject \u201call political organizations ... to the same criteria for determining whether they qualify for recognition as political parties,\u201d <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 109; G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 1, and extend to all organizations unable to attain or maintain that status (as well as to candidates unaffiliated with a political party or organization) an alternate route to the ballot. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6. These provisions are not inherently unconstitutional, see <em>Libertarian Party of Me. </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>659 F. Supp. 2d 215, 222 (D. Me. 2009) <em>(Dunlap), </em>quoting <em>Jenness </em>v. <em>Fortson, supra </em>at 442 (differentiation among candidates permissible to ensure \u201csome preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support\u201d before printing candidate\u2019s name on ballot), nor are they unduly burdensome for candidates unaffiliated with the recognized political parties. See <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Blunt, supra </em>at 1374-1375. Indeed, as the facts of this case reveal, the LAM has secured party status in the past by garnering the requisite number of votes at a qualifying election, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>and candidates affiliated with the association have succeeded in satisfying the ballot access procedures of \u00a7 6. See <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Blunt, supra, </em>citing <em>White, supra </em>at 783-784 (ability of minor parties to fulfil ballot access requirements \u201cdemonstrates lack of burdensomeness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Where a ballot access regime is otherwise open and accessible to minor parties and their candidates, Federal courts have rejected claims akin to the one presented here. See <em>Munro, supra </em>at 761-762; <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>759 F. Supp. 2d 215, 223-226 (D.N.H. 2010) <em>(Gardner I), </em>aff\u2019d, 638 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.) <em>(Gardner II), </em>cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 402 (2011). For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has rebuffed a challenge to a particular State election law that, by granting major, but not minor, parties a \u201csecond opportunity\u201d to field a candidate after the filing deadline had passed, forced minor parties to hold their nominating conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tions relatively early in the election cycle. <em>Munro, supra </em>at 760-761, 766. Similarly, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire has denied a challenge (also arising from the 2008 presidential election) to a set of election laws that did not provide a means by which a minor party could replace a candidate running under its political designation. See <em>Gardner I, supra. </em>Notably, in this latter example, the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire framed its claim as a purported \u201cright to substitute candidacies in appropriate situations,\u201d namely, the situation presented here, in which one set of \u201cLibertarian\u201d candidates (Phillies and Bennett) lost the national party indorsement to another (Barr and Root).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 221-222. The District Court derided this construct as a \u201ceuphemism for a purported \u2018right to remove\u2019 the names of candidates from the ballot who were legally entitled to be on the ballot,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 222, and opined that the plaintiffs had \u201cfail[ed] to justify the relief sought by demonstrating how the statutory scheme that got both Phillies/Bennett and Root/Barr on the ballot as Libertarian Party candidates is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">While similar in kind to the right their brethren sought in New Hampshire, the novel right the plaintiffs ask us to recognize is better described as a right (seemingly, in the absolute) for a minor party itself to qualify for ballot access. As the plaintiffs must view it (but do not argue), the signatures collected on behalf of one pair of candidates bearing the \u201cLibertarian\u201d designation must signal the voters\u2019 support for the minor party, rather than the candidates. Only then could the plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to transfer those signatures from one slate of candidates to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">While there is no doubt some truth to this underlying contention, the concept is at odds with our statutory regime. Political organizations <em>themselves </em>only warrant deference, and only are entitled to direct access to the ballot, where they have satisfied the requirements for recognition as a \u201c[pjolitical party.\u201d G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>c. 50, \u00a7 1. Where a political organization is unable to meet this threshold, a candidate representing it must make use of the signature-gathering procedures of \u00a7 6. To allow the plaintiffs to transfer the signatures gathered in support of one slate of candidates bearing the \u201cLibertarian\u201d political designation for another indorsed at their national convention would subvert this scheme. It would, in essence, elevate the \u201cpolitical designation\u201d listed on the nomination papers above the candidates named therein, thereby propelling the minor party to something akin to a \u201cpolitical party,\u201d even where that minor party has not otherwise attained party status through the statutorily prescribed processes. It also would free the nationally indorsed candidates from having to establish any presence in the Commonwealth, even where the alternate ballot access procedures are free and open to all. No constitutional edict requires this level of contortion. See <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 440 n.10 (1992) (\u201climiting the choice of candidates to those who have complied with state election law requirements is the prototypical example of a regulation that... is eminently reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Finally, although we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 overarching assertion of a constitutional \u201cright of substitution,\u201d we nonetheless examine the ballot access regime to determine whether it unduly burdens the plaintiffs\u2019 recognized rights in the manner described above.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Firestone, </em>499 F. Supp. 1027 (N.D. Fla. 1980) (unconstitutional to prevent independent presidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>candidate from substituting name of running mate listed on nomination papers where State election laws requiring independent candidates to name running mates far earlier than majority party candidates found discriminatory). Of primary concern is the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the statutory regime imposes on them an unconstitutional dilemma, in which they must select their candidates early in the election cycle or lose some amount of time to collect signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The election laws prescribe the time period in which minor party candidates, as well as those unaffiliated with any political party or organization, must gather the requisite number of signatures from registered Massachusetts voters, and the dates on which those signatures must be filed with local election officials and the Secretary. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7\u00a7 6-9. They are silent on the inner workings of minor parties themselves, and thus, it remains the prerogative of those minor parties, the plaintiffs included, to select a nationally indorsed candidate (for whom they may then collect signatures in Massachusetts) at any time, and in any manner, they see fit. See <em>Dunlap, supra </em>at 220 n.5 (\u201cwhatever the date the Libertarian Party chose, it was its decision and the Party is in an awkward position to complain that its decision shortened the time within which it could collect signatures\u201d). That, in some cases, a minor party may have to think ahead to ensure that its candidate will receive the benefit of the full period allowed to collect signatures, or else fall within the restraints of a self-imposed abbreviated time frame, does not impose a significant burden. Cf. <em>McClure </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>386 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2004) <em>(Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 734, \u201cheld that a potential candidate was not significantly burdened by a statute that forced him to think ahead one full year before becoming an independent candidate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On this point, we find instructive Federal court decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>concerning the timing constraints imposed on candidates representing a minor party and those running independently relative to their counterparts from recognized political parties. See, e.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 790-796 (1983) ; <em>Dunlap, supra </em>221-223 &amp; nn.7, 8. Under one line of cases, such courts have considered the validity of deadlines for declaring and perfecting a minor party candidacy set farther from the date of the general election than those for major party candidacies. See, e.g., <em>Libertarian Party of Fla. </em>v. <em>State, </em>710 F.2d 790, 793 (11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 831 (1984) , and cases cited. While acknowledging that filing deadlines set in the winter or spring preceding the election effectively may preclude the full participation of minor parties by rendering them inflexible to changes in the political climate, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, supra </em>at 790-791, Federal courts readily have accepted a deadline set within ninety days of the general election. See <em>Cromer </em>v. <em>State, </em>917 F.2d 819, 825 (4th Cir. 1990). See also <em>Dunlap, supra. </em>Relatedly, the United States Supreme Court has examined the reasonableness of the time period in which a candidate could be expected to collect signatures. <em>White, supra </em>at 786-787. <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 738-740. In this regard, the Court has opined that an election law requiring candidates unaffiliated with a recognized political party to collect signatures at a pace of 13,542 per day for twenty-four days did not appear excessive, <em>id. </em>at 738, 740,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and similarly concluded that a fifty-five day period to secure 22,000 signatures was not \u201cunduly short.\u201d <em>White, supra </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">By comparison, in 2008, a candidate retrieving nomination papers on the first day they were available, February 6, would have had until July 29 (approximately 176 days) to gather the 10,000 signatures required to qualify for the ballot. From the day George Phillies contacted the Secretary\u2019s office regarding the national party\u2019s indorsement of Barr and Root (May 29), the plaintiffs would have had sixty days until the deadline. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>they would have had to gather approximately 170 signatures per day. Thus, the filing deadline and the wide berth of time permitted to collect a relatively low number of signatures provide flexibility sufficient to comport with the constitutional minimums, and in no way \u201cfreezeQ the status quo.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Given these modest burdens imposed on the plaintiffs, we agree with the First Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere need be only a rational basis undergirding the regulation in order for it to pass constitutional muster,\u201d <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 110, citing <em>Timmons, supra </em>at 358-359, a threshold that \u00a7 14 easily meets. As the First Circuit noted, the State\u2019s \u201cinterest in ensuring that a candidate makes a preliminary showing of a substantial measure of support [before] appearing on the ballot\u201d is legitimate. <em>Barr III, supra </em>at 111. Although this interest is discemibly less weighty in the context of presidential elections, in which \u201cthe outcome . . . will be largely determined by voters beyond the State\u2019s boundaries,\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, supra </em>at 795, it is not so diminished as to be impotent against the minimal burdens imposed on the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>At the core of this case lies a simple fact the plaintiffs choose to ignore: even after receiving the national indorsement of the Libertarian Party, Barr and Root made no effort to qualify themselves for ballot access in Massachusetts. They merely expected the Secretary to extrapolate from the signatures gathered on behalf of the Phillies and Bennett ticket a generalized support for the \u201cLibertarian\u201d political designation, which could then be applied to them. But the election laws do not \u2014 and, under the Constitution, need not \u2014 extend such a privilege to minor parties where a statutory mechanism exists through which they can demonstrate the generalized support necessary to obtain that privilege: that is, by becoming a recognized political party. The LAM has attained this status in the past and may do so again in the future. In the meantime, however, it and each of its candidates must adhere to the statutorily prescribed processes for gaining access to the ballot: they must go to the people of Massachusetts and request from them their support, as evidenced by their signatures on nomination papers. Whether another alternative, one designed specifically for minor parties or other political organizations that permits them to control \u2014 and to substitute \u2014 candidates bearing their political designation, would be a prudent policy choice is not for us to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The matter is remanded to the county court, where the single justice will enter a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\">As described <em>infra, </em>the Libertarian Association of Massachusetts (LAM) was not considered a \u201cpolitical party\u201d under Massachusetts law for the purposes of the 2008 general election.

First, they claim that a statutory framework that prohibits substitution infringes on the \u201cright to associate with the political party of one\u2019s choice,\u201d which encompasses \u201ca political party\u2019s substantial interest in ensuring . . . who will appear on a general election ballot as that party\u2019s candidate.\u201d <em>Langone </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>388 Mass. 185, 190, appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Bellotti </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>460 U.S. 1057 (1983), citing <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>385 Mass. 1201, 1204 (1982). Second, they assert that, by granting a right to substitute candidates for Governor and for city or town office, \u00a7 14 poses an undue burden on presidential and vice-presidential candidates vis-a-vis candidates for nonpresidential office. On the surface, neither of these arguments appears persuasive. See <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>759 F. Supp. 2d 215, 223-226 (D.N.H. 2010), aff\u2019d, 638 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 402 (2011) (rejecting Libertarian Party\u2019s analogous \u201cright to substitute\u201d and corresponding political association arguments against New Hampshire ballot access regime); <em>Libertarian Party of Me. </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>659 F. Supp. 2d 215, 223 (D. Me. 2009), quoting <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>495 F. Supp. 730, 733 (D. Me. 1980) (rejecting Libertarian Party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>claim of disparate treatment between candidates for presidential office and candidates for nonpresidential office because \u201cthe critical comparison is between \u2018candidates for the same office, not with candidates for other offices who are elected through a different process\u2019 \u201d). Regardless, given the paucity of these arguments, the second being proffered without any supporting citation, we do not consider them. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>412 Mass. 119, 130 (1992) (declining to consider due process argument where \u201ccursory presentation [of argument] fails to meet the basic requirements for appellate argument\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 740 (1974), the United States Supreme Court ultimately remanded the matter to the Federal District Court to evaluate whether \u201cthe available pool [of voters] is so diminished in size by the disqualification of those who voted in the primary that the 325,000-signature requirement, to be satisfied in 24 days, is too great a burden on the independent candidates for the offices of President and Vice President.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We address the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding voting rights, which they offer without any supporting case law, only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Even assuming that minor parties have \u201csome interest in preventing voter confusion of [their] nominated candidates with other candidates who also espouse Libertarian ideals,\u201d <em>Gardner II, supra </em>at 16, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence supporting their bald assertion that a substitution mechanism is vital to circumventing this concern. See <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 454 (2008) (rejecting presumption that \u201ca well-informed electorate will interpret a candidate\u2019s party-preference designation to mean that the candidate is the party\u2019s chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate\u201d). Moreover, although we recognize that the opportunity to \u201cwrite in\u201d the name of a candidate is not an ideal substitute for having the candidate\u2019s name printed on the ballot where restrictive access provisions are in place, see <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 799 n.26 (1983), it is an alternative in the circumstances presented here, where a candidate, by his own volition, wholly failed to qualify for ballot access. G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 42. See <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 156, 161 (1985) (finding no violation of right to vote, and positing that voter could write in candidate\u2019s name, where candidate did not satisfy disqualification provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">This is particularly evident where, as here, the State\u2019s asserted interest is not a pretext for insulating any entrenched political parties, see <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Celebrezze, supra </em>at 801-802, but, rather, a measured and reasonable attempt to regulate elections. See <em>Timmons </em>v. <em>Twin Cities Area New Party, </em>520 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>351, 364 (1997), citing <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 145 (1972) (\u201cStates certainly have an interest in protecting the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of their ballots and election processes as means for electing public officials\u201d); <em>American Party of Tex. </em>v. <em>White, </em>415 U.S. <em>767, </em>782-783 (1974) (\u201c[s]o long as the larger parties must demonstrate major support among the electorate at the last election, whereas the smaller parties need not, the latter, without being invidiously treated, may be required to establish their position in some other manner\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
