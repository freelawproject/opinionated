Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Averill Weeden, Belinda Jo Stark and Dawn Berryhill, the assault on Stark with intent to commit rape (\u00a7 220), the robbery (\u00a7211) of Berryhill, and the forcible rape (\u00a7261, subd. (2)) of Jacqueline H. It found true special circumstance allegations of multiple murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)) and robbery murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a) (17)(i)). After a penalty trial, the jury returned a verdict of death, and the trial court imposed that sentence. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b) .) As will appear, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">1. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"AD\">a. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">The prosecution presented a fact-intensive, circumstantial case of defendant\u2019s guilt, which interconnected three murders and the rape of a fourth victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">A central element in the case was the Shasta County Secret Witness program (Secret Witness), which was established as a telephone \u201chotline\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>receive information from citizens about crimes committed in the county. A month after Weeden\u2019s disappearance in 1985, an anonymous caller called the Secret Witness with information on the location of Weeden\u2019s body in exchange for reward money. This information led to the discovery of Weeden\u2019s body. Although the police suspected that defendant, Weeden\u2019s roommate, had been involved in her disappearance and was possibly the Secret Witness caller, there was insufficient evidence of his involvement in Weeden\u2019s death or that he was the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In 1986, defendant called the Secret Witness about seeking a reward for information on an unrelated burglary. During the call, defendant identified himself by name. The operator believed that he was the same person who had previously provided information on Weeden.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At the end of June 1987, Berryhill and Stark disappeared. Soon after-wards, the Secret Witness operator received a series of telephone calls from an unidentified caller, whom she believed to be the previous caller. He provided information leading to the discovery of the women\u2019s bodies, which were later located in the same rural area, within three-tenths of a mile of each other. The caller again received monetary rewards for the information provided. When the caller retrieved the reward money at a designated drop-off point, the police identified him as defendant. After the police later confronted defendant with this information, he made a series of incriminating statements, which eventually led to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">b. <em>Weeden\u2019s disappearance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In May 1985, Weeden lived in Redding and rented a room in her house to defendant. On Thursday, May 23, Eula Chartier, Weeden\u2019s mother, spoke to defendant several times on the telephone inquiring about her daughter\u2019s whereabouts. Defendant related that Weeden was at the store. On the last call, defendant exclaimed, \u201cHow in the hell am I supposed to know where she is.\u201d Unable to locate Weeden, Chartier reported to the police that her daughter was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">While searching for his sister, Bill Chartier asked defendant where she was. Defendant gave conflicting stories. Ray Morris, who was with defendant at the Weeden house on one occasion, told Chartier that he last saw Weeden riding off with defendant on the back of his motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Assigned to investigate the disappearance of Weeden, Redding Police Detective Dave Mundy spoke with defendant at the police department on June 3, 1985. Defendant appeared to be \u201crelaxed and self-assured\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>denied any involvement in Weeden\u2019s disappearance. He related that the last time he had seen Weeden was \u201ceither Thursday, Friday, or a Saturday.\u201d At that time, defendant drove Weeden on his motorcycle to a telephone booth, left her there while he went to another location to pick up some drugs for Weeden, returned to pick her up, and drove her back to her house. A week later, Detective Mundy spoke again with defendant, who confirmed this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">c. <em>The 1985 Secret Witness telephone calls and discovery of Weeden\u2019s body</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On June 19, 1985, an anonymous person called the Secret Witness, inquiring as to how much he would receive for information on the location of Weeden\u2019s body. Shirley Landreth, who answered most of the incoming calls for the Secret Witness, spoke to this person.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">On August 8, 1985, the same person (whose voice Landreth recognized) called and asked again about the amount of reward money he would receive for information on the location of Weeden\u2019s body. This time, having received authorization to pay the reward money, Landreth agreed with the caller on the amount. The caller then gave precise directions to a wooded area located off a trail behind an automobile body shop in Redding. In relating the distances, he used the term \u201cmeters.\u201d Claiming that he knew the identity of the person responsible for the Weeden killing, the caller offered to give information about the \u201cresponsible\u201d person if he received his reward money in a timely manner. He also related that there were six unsolved murders in Shasta County and he could give information to solve two others.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Based on the information provided by the caller, the police found Weeden\u2019s badly decomposed body. It had been covered with cardboard and what appeared to be an old carpet. An autopsy, performed on August 23, 1985, revealed that Weeden\u2019s skull and the bone at the top of her throat had been fractured \u201cat or near the time of death.\u201d The medical examiner opined that Weeden died from multiple traumatic injuries; either fracture, independently, or both fractures in conjunction, could have caused Weeden\u2019s death. The fractured bone in Weeden\u2019s throat was consistent with manual strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">After the discovery of Weeden\u2019s body, Landreth received four more telephone calls from the same caller in August 1985. On August 12, the caller said that the person who had lived with Weeden was responsible for her death. Although the caller refused to talk with Detective Mundy, he said he would call back and answer questions that the officer gave to Landreth.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>On August 15, 1985, the Secret Witness caller telephoned Landreth as promised. Responding to Detective Mundy\u2019s questions, the caller related that the person responsible for Weeden\u2019s death was named \u201cRobert\u201d or \u201cBob\u201d and had rented a room from Weeden; he knew this because he was \u201csort of with him\u201d; he was Bob\u2019s drug connection and had gone with him to collect the money; Bob had provided drugs to Weeden; and when Weeden could not pay for the drugs, Bob went out of control and strangled her with a nylon clothesline obtained from Weeden\u2019s backyard. The caller further related that the killing occurred Thursday night on a trail and the body was dragged to where it was found. He refused to admit that he had observed the killing. Landreth asked, \u201cIf Bob denies [the involvement], how can we nail him?\u201d The caller responded, \u201cTell Bob that Dave has talked to Frank\u201d and that \u201cit will scare the hmm [later described as a \u2018four-letter word\u2019] out of him.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">On August 15, 1985, the Secret Witness caller telephoned Landreth again and responded to more questions provided by Detective Mundy. The caller related that Weeden was picked up at dusk and killed with a six- to eight-inch rock at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. on Thursday; he knew it was Thursday because it had been a relative\u2019s birthday; and Bob drove Weeden on his motorcycle while the caller drove his own car. The caller reiterated that Weeden had been strangled beside the trail, dragged to where she was eventually found, hit with a rock to make sure that she was dead, and covered with leaves and branches. Bob returned later and covered Weeden\u2019s body with an object such as a blanket, towel, or rug. In describing where the police could find Weeden\u2019s glasses, the rope, and the rock, the caller again used the term \u201cmeters.\u201d When Landreth related that the police were unable to find the rope near the location of the body, the caller said that it could be found next to a shed in Weeden\u2019s backyard. The police later found a nylon clothesline there. The caller said that he would check the next day and warned that if he did not receive his reward money, they would not hear from him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On August 26, 1985, the same caller telephoned Landreth again. Responding to more questions provided by Detective Mundy, the caller described the clothing Weeden had worn and said that Bob covered the body with a rug. When asked if anyone had seen Bob return to the body, the caller responded that he did not know, although Bob had gone back several times on his dirt bike.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">d. <em>Defendant\u2019s additional statements to the police about Weeden\u2019s death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On September 4, 1985, Detective Mundy spoke with defendant again at defendant\u2019s house. Defendant reiterated that he had driven Weeden on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>motorcycle to a telephone booth, left her there while he retrieved some drugs, returned to Weeden, and then brought her back to her house. He believed this occurred on Friday night, May 24, because he recalled that the next day he attended a birthday party for his brother\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In November 1985, defendant telephoned Shasta County Sheriffs Detective Chester Ashmun. This time, he offered information on the cause of Weeden\u2019s death to the effect that she had been strangled and hit on the head. He wanted consideration on a possession of stolen property charge in an unrelated case and immunity in the Weeden case. Detective Ashmun responded that he might be able to help defendant on the unrelated case. After Detective Ashmun related this information, Detective Mundy telephoned defendant. Defendant offered to talk, conditioned upon receiving immunity on the Weeden case. Detective Ashmun responded that only the district attorney could grant immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The next day, November 21, 1985, Detective Mundy and Shasta County District Attorney Steve Carlton interviewed defendant at defendant\u2019s house. Defendant stated that close to the time of his nephews\u2019 birthdays, he returned to Weeden\u2019s house and found Morris strangling Weeden with a rope. Upon seeing defendant, Morris dropped Weeden. Defendant believed that she was dead. Another man, whom defendant did not know, pointed a gun at defendant. Morris used the same rope to tie defendant\u2019s hands. Morris and the other man placed defendant in the back of Weeden\u2019s truck with Weeden\u2019s body. They drove to the woods where they dumped Weeden\u2019s body. Although Weeden was already dead, Morris threw rocks at her body. Defendant convinced Morris not to shoot him by promising the men anything they wanted. After returning to Weeden\u2019s house, Morris threatened that if defendant turned them in to the police, they would kill him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">On December 10, 1985, Detective Mundy spoke with defendant again. Defendant repeated how Weeden had been strangled, but said he was not sure if Weeden was dead when Morris dropped her. This time, however, defendant claimed that Morris forced him, at gunpoint, to strike Weeden on the head with a rock to disguise how she died. During the interview, defendant used the term \u201cmeters,\u201d which led Detective Mundy to suspect that defendant was the Secret Witness caller. When asked if he was the caller, defendant denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">e. <em>The 1986 Secret Witness telephone calls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">On September 11, 1986, over a year after receiving the last telephone call from the Secret Witness caller, Landreth received a telephone call from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>person offering information on a burglary, unrelated to the Weeden case, in exchange for a reward. Landreth recognized the person\u2019s voice as the same caller who had made the 1985 anonymous calls regarding Weeden. The caller identified himself as \u201cBob\u201d or \u201cRobert Maury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A week later, the same person who had called Landreth about the unrelated burglary, and who Landreth believed had also called in 1985, called again. He wanted immunity on the Weeden case. The Secret Witness calls from this person stopped, but as shown below, resumed in August 1987, after the disappearances of Berryhill and Stark.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In the spring of 1987, defendant called Detective Mundy. Upset because his name had been leaked as a possible informant in an unrelated robbery trial, defendant taunted Mundy that he would never really know what had happened to Weeden and would \u201ctake Averill Weeden\u2019s death to [Mundy\u2019s] grave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">f. <em>The Jacqueline H. rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">On June 20, 1987, defendant began talking to Jacqueline H. and introduced himself as \u201cMaury as in hooray.\u201d Defendant drove Jacqueline H. on his motorcycle to her friend\u2019s house, where she stayed for a few hours. She returned home and then left her house about dusk to go to a fair. About one and one-half blocks from her house, Jacqueline H. saw defendant parked on the side of the road. She wondered why he was there since she had not divulged her home address. Defendant invited Jacqueline H. to a friend\u2019s party at the bike trails in Happy Valley. She accepted and he drove her on his motorcycle to the bike trails. Defendant then turned onto a dirt road off Happy Valley Road, drove on some smaller dirt trails for about a mile, and stopped in a clearing in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">When Jacqueline H. saw that there was no one around, she became scared and asked to be taken home. Fearing that she would be killed, Jacqueline H. took her driver\u2019s license from her purse and hid it in her back pocket. Initially, defendant said that they should wait for a few minutes. He then placed a rope around Jacqueline H.\u2019s neck and demanded that she remove her clothes as he tightened the slip knot around her neck. After Jacqueline H. removed her clothes, defendant ordered her to lie down. When she complied, he raped her. Afterwards, he drove Jacqueline H. home. Because Jacqueline H. felt that she had no one to turn to, she did not immediately tell anyone about the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In early August 1987, Jacqueline H. told her new boyfriend, Gary Minoletti, about the rape. In late August, after the disappearance of Berryhill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Jacqueline H. saw defendant drive up to a liquor store on his motorcycle. Recognizing him, Jacqueline H. asked defendant if his name was Bob; he said it was. Defendant asked Jacqueline H. if she was Berryhill. She then went inside the store and told Minoletti that the man who had raped her was outside. When Minoletti confronted him, defendant acknowledged that he was Bob Maury and asked, \u201cIs that Dawn?\u201d When Minoletti replied no, defendant commented that Jacqueline H. looked \u201cjust like\u201d Berryhill. Minoletti wrote down defendant\u2019s license plate number and reported the rape to the police that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Detective Mundy was in charge of the rape investigation and never told Jacqueline H. about the murder of Berryhill.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">g. <em>The disappearance of Berryhill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">On Monday, June 22, 1987, two days after the rape of Jacqueline H., Berryhill disappeared. Earlier that morning, Berryhill kicked her boyfriend, Mike Brumett, out of her South Market Street apartment. Later, Diana Williams (Berryhill\u2019s mother) was babysitting Berryhill\u2019s six-month-old baby at Berryhill\u2019s apartment and answered the telephone. The caller identified himself as \u201cBob\u201d and wanted Berryhill to wait for him because he would be a few minutes late. He asked if Berryhill was still living with her boyfriend. When Williams replied no, defendant commented \u201cgood,\u201d because he intended to rent Berryhill an apartment and would not rent it to her if she was still with her boyfriend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">About 2:00 p.m., not long after receiving a second telephone call from \u201cBob,\u201d Williams left Berryhill\u2019s apartment to find her daughter. She saw Berryhill talking to defendant in a park, about two blocks from the apartment. Defendant was sitting on a dark \u201cHonda-type\u201d motorcycle. Berryhill returned to the apartment with Williams. She told Williams that she was going to meet \u201cBob\u201d at 8:00 p.m., that she had already been with him that day, and that they were going to \u201cBig Mama\u2019s house\u201d to buy \u201cpot.\u201d Williams left Berryhill\u2019s apartment at 3:00 p.m., after giving her $100. That was the last time Williams saw her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Goldie Lane lived above Berryhill\u2019s apartment. About 9:00 p.m., on June 22, 1987, Berryhill asked Lane for a ride to buy some marijuana. Lane replied that her car\u2019s lights were not working, but offered to babysit for Berryhill if she could get a ride with someone else. Berryhill accepted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>said that she could get a ride with a guy on a motorcycle at the liquor store across the street. Several minutes later, Berryhill brought her baby to Lane\u2019s apartment and told Lane that she was going to \u201ccop some dope.\u201d Lane offered some money, but Berryhill declined because she had enough money. Berryhill showed Lane a roll of money, put it back in her purse, and left. That was the last time Lane saw Berryhill.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">That night, Bill Koeller went to Berryhill\u2019s apartment to retrieve some of Brumett\u2019s clothes for Brumett. Because Brumett thought Berryhill would become upset if he appeared, Koeller dropped Brumett down the street before proceeding to Berryhill\u2019s apartment. Koeller spoke to Berryhill in front of her apartment. When it was getting dark, he saw defendant approaching them from the liquor store across the street. Berryhill waved defendant over to her. After defendant approached them and spoke to Berryhill, Koeller decided to leave. As Koeller left the area, he saw Berryhill leaving with defendant on his \u201cHonda-like\u201d motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Just before dusk on June 22, 1987, James Horan saw Berryhill in an alleyway near her apartment. Horan wanted to buy marijuana, but Berryhill said she did not have any to sell at that time. While they were conversing, Horan saw Berryhill wave at a man crossing the street toward them. Although Horan gave a general description of the man at trial, he could not identify defendant as that man; he was too far away.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Because defendant matched the description of the man seen crossing the street toward Berryhill and leaving on the motorcycle, Detective Mundy questioned defendant about Berryhill several days after her disappearance. Defendant admitted that he knew a Dawn that lived across the street from the liquor store on South Market Street and that he had also met her in the park a couple of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">h. <em>The disappearance of Stark</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Stark also disappeared at the end of June 1987. Before her disappearance, Stark was staying with her friend; Lucy Gray, in Fall River Mills. Gray last saw Stark on June 24, 1987, two days after Gray\u2019s birthday. On Gray\u2019s birthday, Stark showed Gray a small chrome-colored gun that she earned in her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Gary Evans, Stark\u2019s boyfriend, last saw Stark around June 25, 1987. At that time, Stark told Evans that she was going to Nevada City to appear in court two or three days later for a traffic violation. Stark never appeared for her court appearance in Nevada City, scheduled on June 29, 1987. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Stark anticipated that she might have to spend some time in jail and she had a \u201chabit of coming and going,\u201d Evans did not become concerned when she failed to contact him. No one reported her disappearance to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">i. <em>More Secret Witness calls, discovery of defendant as the Secret Witness caller, and discovery of remains of Stark and Berryhill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On August 8, 1987, Landreth received a Secret Witness call from someone asking how much money he would receive for revealing the location of the body of a Gretchen Olsten. Landreth recognized the caller\u2019s voice as the same person who had made the 1985 telephone calls about Weeden and the 1986 call on an unrelated burglary. She related that she needed to contact the program\u2019s coordinator about a reward. Landreth then obtained authorization to offer a reward to the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">On August 17, 1987, the same person called several times. He told Landreth that Olsten\u2019s death had occurred about one and one-half months ago. He stated that if he gave directions to the body\u2019s location, he wanted to be paid that day without an autopsy confirmation of the person\u2019s identity. After Landreth and the caller agreed on a reward amount for an unidentified body, the caller gave specific directions to the body\u2019s location in a wooded area in Happy Valley. Landreth related this information to the sheriffs office. The caller called back that same day; Landreth said that the police could not locate the body. When she asked if there was a power line in the area, the caller replied that they were on the wrong road. The caller stated that when he picked up the reward money, he would leave information about the person responsible in an envelope. He volunteered that the \u201cboyfriend was responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Wanting to confirm her identification of the caller, Landreth taped \u201cone or two \u2022 sentences\u201d during a telephone conversation. She played the tape for Detective Mundy over the telephone and played it again for him in person. Having spoken to defendant before, Detective Mundy identified defendant as the person on the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">As prearranged, Detective Francis Brewer of the sheriff\u2019s office left $500 reward money for the caller at the pickup point in the office of a title company in Redding. Detective Brewer was told that in exchange for the reward money, the caller would leave information on the identity of the killer. Defendant entered the office and gave the title company\u2019s director an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>envelope in exchange for an envelope containing the reward money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brewer retrieved the envelope left by defendant and discovered it was empty. It was later determined that defendant\u2019s fingerprint was on the envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Based on the information provided by the Secret Witness caller, on August 17, 1987, the police found scattered, decomposed human bones in the Happy Valley area, the same general area where Jacqueline H. had been raped. Although the caller had indicated that the body was that of \u201cOlsten,\u201d the remains were later identified on October 16, 1987, as those of Stark.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The coroner could not determine the cause of death, but testified that photographs of the crime scene showed that Stark had been sexually assaulted and died an unnatural death. In examining the body, the coroner noted that the victim had suffered blunt trauma force to the upper jaw, which caused the dislodgement of one of her teeth. He opined that because of the severity of the injury and the lack of evidence that the body had responded to the injury, the injury had occurred at or near the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Sergeant Wooden discovered a blanket about 130 yards from where Stark\u2019s remains had been found. At trial, two women who had lived with defendant in 1985 identified the blanket. Although the blanket found was in worse condition, one woman viewed the blanket as identical, while the other woman thought that the blanket was similar to one they had seen in defendant\u2019s trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">After the discovery of Stark\u2019s unidentified body, Detectives Mundy and Newsome interviewed defendant about Berryhill\u2019s disappearance on August 26. Defendant theorized that Berryhill\u2019s boyfriend \u201ckilled her or whatever,\u201d but then later said he had \u201cno idea\u201d what had happened to her. He admitted that on the day he last saw Berryhill, he had taken her to buy marijuana, but she was unable to buy any because no one was home. He said that he had returned Berryhill, at noon, to her apartment where her mother was babysitting. Defendant denied that he took Berryhill anywhere that night and claimed that, instead, he had been on a date with a Leanne Thurman that night. Before his date, he was with his friend Dave Hancock at the home of Hancock\u2019s boss and told Hancock he wanted to be back home by 8:30 p.m. for his date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">On September 15, 1987, Landreth received another telephone call from the person whom she recognized as the Weeden and \u201cOlsten\u201d caller. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>caller wanted reward money for information regarding the body of Berryhill. The next day, the same person called Landreth three times. During the course of these telephone conversations, Landreth offered $500 for the location of an \u201cunidentified body.\u201d The caller replied that he had already divulged the body\u2019s identity the previous day. They finally agreed that if the caller\u2019s information led to Berryhill\u2019s body, he would receive $1,250, but that if it led to an unidentified body or the body was not Berryhill\u2019s, he would receive $500. The caller said that they would know it was Berryhill by her hair. When asked if Berryhill was no longer alive, he replied that he saw her boyfriend \u201cdo it to her.\u201d The Secret Witness program\u2019s advisory committee instructed Landreth to cooperate with law enforcement regarding any calls about Berryhill.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On the morning of September 22, 1987, the same caller telephoned Landreth five times. Detective Mundy monitored and taped two of the telephone conversations. During the course of the monitored conversations, Landreth lied and said that the call was not being recorded. She assured the caller that she could not recognize a person\u2019s voice since she talked to so many people every day. The caller described the area in Happy Valley where Berryhill\u2019s body was located and said that Berryhill had been strangled with a scarf. Mundy again recognized defendant\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On September 22, 1987, based upon the information received from the caller, the police found a decomposed body in the Happy Valley area, about three-tenths of a mile from Stark\u2019s body and close to the area where Jacqueline H. had been raped. The body (later identified as Berryhill\u2019s) was under a mattress and surrounded by dense brush and pine needles that had fallen from overhead trees. It appeared that the mattress had been placed over the body some time after the body had been placed there. There were pine needles in between the body and mattress, but relatively few pine needles on top of the mattress. A scarf was wrapped around the body\u2019s neck. It was later determined that Berryhill died from strangulation. The police found a .22-caliber bullet slug near the victim\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Later that day, after the body was found, Detective Mundy set up a surveillance at the title company office, the prearranged site where the caller would pick up the reward money. Detective Mundy saw defendant enter the office where defendant picked up the reward money. An officer took photographs of defendant entering and exiting the title company office. At trial, the title company\u2019s director positively identified defendant as the person who retrieved the reward money that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>On September 23, 1987, the police found BerryhilPs purse. The purse was unzipped and contained no money. Its contents, including documents with BerryhilPs name, were scattered around the purse. It appeared that the purse had been there for awhile; the top of the purse and the scattered contents had been bleached by the sun.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On September 30, 1987, the police searched defendant\u2019s briefcase at his brother\u2019s house. Inside, they found a flat boot string that was no more than five feet in length. One end of the boot string was knotted, while the other end was pulled through the opening of the knot to form a sliding loop.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On October 5, 1987, Detectives Newsome and Mundy interviewed defendant again. They showed defendant the boot string from his briefcase and a photograph of him entering the title company office, and accused him of killing the three women. At one point, Detective Newsome agreed to fix $580 in traffic tickets for defendant if he gave them the name of Jane Doe One, the unidentified corpse that was later identified as Stark. Defendant admitted that he knew \u201call kinds of girls\u201d who were missing, including Olsten, but denied that he killed anyone. When Newsome commented that defendant would need help if he had committed the murders, defendant asked to see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist would confirm that he did not commit the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On October 14, 1987, Landreth received two more telephone calls from the same Secret Witness caller. The caller was extremely upset that his anonymity had not been guaranteed and complained that the police had taken photographs of him picking up the Secret Witness reward money. He asked to meet with the Secret Witness coordinator to complain about the breach of the program\u2019s promise of anonymity to its callers. Landreth responded that she would try to reach the coordinator and asked him to call back.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The police asked Roy Del Carlo, a member of the Secret Witness\u2019s board of directors, to impersonate himself as the program\u2019s director and meet with defendant. Because the remains of the two people had not been identified yet, Del Carlo was asked to try and discover the identities of the bodies and the perpetrator. The caller called back and identified himself as Robert Maury. Landreth told defendant that she had arranged for him to meet with Del Carlo, the Secret Witness\u2019s coordinator, on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">On the next day, defendant called Del Carlo. Identifying himself as Robert Maury, defendant suggested that they meet that same morning. During their meeting, defendant was extremely upset that the police had photographed him claiming the Secret Witness reward money and had seized some of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>personal items. He was also irate because the police had questioned his family members and had accused him of being homosexual; his family thought he was a murderer. Defendant demanded that unless the police apologized and returned his items, he would print and post 10,000 posters and place an advertisement in the paper discrediting the Secret Witness. When Del Carlo asked if he could provide additional information about Stark\u2019s still unidentified body, defendant replied that a purse containing identification could be found near the body. Defendant wanted a reward for this information; Del Carlo promised to pay defendant if the information proved to be accurate and the purse was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Later that day, defendant took Del Carlo to the purse. Defendant pointed to an object underneath some brush. When they got closer, Del Carlo saw that the object was a purse or handbag. When asked about additional evidence that would help the police, defendant replied that he could find a nickel-plated gun at that location. During the search for the gun, defendant became nervous when he heard a dirt bike and abandoned the search. On the ride back, defendant claimed that his girlfriend\u2019s brother told him about the bodies, that he took defendant to the bodies, and that they took money and evidence from some of the purses. Defendant offered to take Del Carlo to the brother to be arrested if the identification revealed that the purse belonged to somebody that defendant knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">With the police, Del Carlo returned to and retrieved the purse, which was eight-tenths of a mile from Stark\u2019s body. The purse contained Stark\u2019s wallet, driver\u2019s license, and address book. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were on pieces of paper inside the wallet. \u201cBob\u201d had been written next to a telephone number on the back of the address book. \u201cNick\u201d was also written in parentheses. The police later determined that defendant had given that same telephone number to others to contact him. The purse did not contain any money or a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">On October 16, 1987, Del Carlo arranged to meet defendant to pay him $250 reward for the purse. Defendant said he would take Del Carlo to the gun. At the meeting, defendant again demanded an apology, and wanted his motorcycle back and some tickets fixed. He said that the Secret Witness had paid him $1,250 for the last body he had turned in. When Del Carlo asked how much it would cost to recover the gun, defendant replied that there would be no extra charge because it was part of the original deal. He was confident that the purse would identify Jane Doe One (Stark). He indicated that there were more bodies and evidence in the Happy Valley area and referred to another body that had been recovered with a rope or scarf tied around the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>On October 19, 1987, defendant spoke with Del Carlo on the telephone again. Defendant inquired if they could identify the victim from the identification in the purse; Del Carlo responded that he did not know. Defendant commented that he knew what the identification was, and it would identify the body. Defendant and Del Carlo met later that day. Defendant gave Del Carlo two traffic tickets to fix and showed him some anti-Secret Witness fliers that he intended to post.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">On October 20, 1987, defendant called Del Carlo. He said that because he had received his motorcycle back, he would not post the fliers. Defendant agreed to sign a document releasing the Secret Witness from liability for having divulged his identity as the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On October 21, 1987, defendant met Del Carlo and signed the release. Because the police could not locate a gun, Del Carlo inquired about it again. Defendant assured him that the gun was \u201cout there\u201d and that it was nickel-plated. He related that he would try to get a better location on the gun from his girlfriend\u2019s brother, and would take him there so that he would leave his footprints and the police could catch him. Defendant denied that he knew Stark. The police never found a gun near Stark\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">At defendant\u2019s suggestion, Detective Newsome arranged for Dr. Angela Cur\u00edale, a psychologist, to meet defendant on October 23 and 30, 1987. In between these two interviews, on October 26, Newsome spoke with defendant on the telephone and asked him about the cause of Stark\u2019s death. Defendant replied that Newsome already knew it. When Newsome guessed that she was strangled, defendant responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d During this conversation, defendant said that he would tell Dr. Cur\u00edale what he knew about Stark\u2019s death, and where he had been told the murder weapon was located. Detective Newsome then met with defendant in person after defendant demanded that the police return his property taken from his brother\u2019s house. During this meeting, defendant further represented that he would give up Stark\u2019s murder weapon when he met Dr. Cur\u00edale on October 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">During the interviews with Dr. Cur\u00edale, defendant claimed he did not know the cause of Stark\u2019s death. At the end of the October 30, 1987 session, Dr. Cur\u00edale saw defendant pull out what appeared to be a flat boot string from his pocket and quickly put it back. He commented that she should have searched his jacket while she had the chance; it would have given her some insight into who he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">j. <em>Defendant\u2019s arrest and subsequent events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">On November 6, 1987, the police arrested defendant. They searched defendant\u2019s residence and found a Yamaha motorcycle and a Honda motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>On November 7, 1987, Sandra Morton saw a newspaper article about defendant\u2019s arrest, which contained photographs of Stark and defendant. Morton, a bartender, recalled that defendant, Stark, and Evans had been in her bar in the Fall River Mills Hotel toward the end of June 1987. At the time, defendant was sitting alone with his chair leaning back against the wall and staring toward Stark. Morton noticed defendant because he had a \u201cstrange face\u201d and was sitting alone in a generally friendly atmosphere. Morton called the sheriffs office and positively identified defendant\u2019s photograph from a photographic lineup as the person she had seen in the bar staring at Stark. At trial, she also positively identified defendant as the person she had seen in the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Patricia Huff and Evelyn Snipes also recognized defendant\u2019s photograph in the newspaper. Huff recalled that she had seen defendant and Stark talking with each other in a liquor store one afternoon in late June or early July of 1987. Later that evening, she saw Stark and Evans together in the Fall River Mills Hotel bar, while defendant was seated by himself and staring in the direction of Stark. Snipes, a clerk at a market in Fall River Mills, recalled that she had seen defendant and Stark together at the market two or three times during the summer of 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">At defendant\u2019s request, Detective Newsome met with defendant at the county jail on'November 18, 1987. When Detective Newsome advised defendant of his Miranda rights, defendant said he wanted to talk, but only hypothetically, and insisted that the conversation not be taped. After they signed an agreement that defendant wrote to that effect, defendant discussed how he was going to \u201cbeat\u201d each criminal charge. Defendant claimed that Nick Pinada was a possible suspect and offered that if the prosecution granted him immunity on two or three of the cases, he would testify against Pinada regarding the murders of Stark and Berryhill. He related that Pinada knew Stark and had killed more than one person.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On January 28, 1988, the day after the preliminary hearing in this case was held, a newspaper reporter interviewed defendant in county jail. During the interview, defendant claimed that he had not been in Fall River Mills since 1977 and that he had never seen Stark \u201cin his life.\u201d When asked about his fingerprints that were found inside Stark\u2019s purse, defendant admitted that he had opened her purse. When asked about his fingerprints found on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>envelope that was left at the Secret Witness drop-off location, defendant said he did not know how they got on the envelope, but conceded that they were his fingerprints. Defendant claimed that \u201cthe real killer,\u201d an acquaintance of his, told him the location of the two women\u2019s bodies found in the Happy Valley area and that he had killed them. He also claimed that Morris had used \u201ca rope or something\u201d to strangle Weeden.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">k. <em>Other admissions made by defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">At trial, several witnesses testified regarding incriminating statements made by defendant. Norma Schwartz testified that on August 23, 1985, she worked with defendant in a restaurant and had an argument with him. He then threatened, \u201cListen bitch, I have killed before. And you\u2019ll [be] just one more. And I\u2019m going to snuff you out.\u201d Schwartz became frightened and reported the threat to her manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Beth Von Millanich (defendant\u2019s former girlfriend) testified that sometime in 1985, defendant related that his landlord had been murdered, that he was a suspect, and that he was excited that he was a suspect. Defendant appeared happy about his status as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In the summer or fall of 1986, defendant was in county jail on an unrelated matter. As a jail trusty, defendant delivered towels to other inmates in their cells. Defendant told Tracy Trantham, one of the inmates, that he knew who had killed Weeden and that she was a \u201csnitch\u201d and \u201cany snitch deserved to die.\u201d Several times, he said that he fantasized about \u201cstrangulation with sexual relations.\u201d Once, he asked Trantham if she had ever killed anyone. When she replied no, he related that he had. Defendant also told Trantham that he hated women and that \u201cthey had done a lot of things to bum him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In February and March 1987, defendant had a sexual relationship with Stapley, who lived next door to him in Happy Valley. While having sex together, defendant said that \u201cthey\u201d had killed the landlady and that he had been brought in for questioning on it. He laughed that he had \u201cgot off of that\u201d and bragged that the police could not \u201cget him for nothing\u201d and that he \u201ccan get off of anything.\u201d Defendant made her promise not to tell anyone about the landlady. At the time, Stapley thought defendant was lying because she had neither heard nor read anything about a landlady being murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In the summer or fall of 1987, defendant and Shelley Sly were at a bar while the movie Platoon was playing. Defendant told Sly that when he was in Vietnam he had to kill lots of men and women. He related that he had to strangle one and she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>2. <em>The Defense\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The primary theory of the defense at trial was that the prosecution had not proven its case against defendant. Regarding the Weeden murder charge, the defense relied on defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements to Detective Mundy and District Attorney Carlton that Morris killed Weeden and forced defendant to strike her with a rock after she was already dead. To support that defense, defendant presented evidence that Weeden had bought drugs with counterfeit money, that Morris had been involved with her in buying drugs, that he possessed Weeden\u2019s truck after her disappearance, that he disassembled the truck and sold its parts, and that he had been subpoenaed as a witness in defendant\u2019s trial but disappeared before trial. The defense theorized that Morris strangled Weeden over drugs and that he stole her truck after the killing. Defendant disputed that he made the 1985 Secret Witness calls regarding Weeden. He attempted to impeach Landreth\u2019s voice identification by establishing that her answering service took in 2,000 calls per day and that one month before the preliminary hearing, she received a telephone call and could not identify whether the caller was defendant, his brother, or someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Regarding the Jacqueline H. rape charge, defendant attempted to impeach Jacqueline H. by presenting evidence that she had prior convictions and current charges for theft-related offenses, that she was addicted to methamphetamine, and that she had failed to seek medical attention or report the alleged rape until over one month afterwards. A defense psychologist testified that acute paranoia may be caused by heavy use of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Regarding the Berryhill and Stark charges, the defense theory was that defendant discovered the bodies accidentally while taking routine walks in the Happy Valley area and that he made the Secret Witness calls to obtain reward money, consistent with his history of helping the police as a paid informant. To support his theory that Berryhill\u2019s boyfriend, Brumett, killed Berryhill, defendant presented evidence that Brumett was angry at Berryhill for throwing him out of the apartment, that he had threatened to kill Berryhill, and that he was waiting for Berryhill outside her apartment on the night of her disappearance. Defendant also attempted to impeach Koeller\u2019s identification of him as the last person seen with Berryhill by presenting evidence that Koeller could not identify defendant in a photographic lineup soon after Berryhill\u2019s disappearance and that a witness might have seen Berryhill on the following day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">To support his defense that the prosecution failed to prove how or when Stark died and that her death resulted from a homicide, defendant presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>testimony that several witnesses estimated they may have seen Stark in early July and that Stark had suffered a facial injury in a car accident before her disappearance. He denied that he knew Stark and attacked the reliability of the identifications of his presence with Stark.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">B. <em>The Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">1. <em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In addition to relying on the circumstances of the charged offenses, the prosecution introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s two prior felony convictions for receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">2. <em>The Defense\u2019s Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The defense presented evidence relating to defendant\u2019s mental condition, marijuana abuse, and family background, including the mental and physical abuse inflicted on him and his siblings by his alcoholic father. In addition, defendant read a statement to the jury in which he claimed he had a \u201cnormal childhood,\u201d denied that he suffered from depression, and declared, \u201cYou found me guilty of three murders, one rape, one attempted rape and one robbery. It\u2019s totally unrealistic for you to give me life in prison without parole. If you think I\u2019m guilty, you give me the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">A. <em>Jury Selection Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in granting several of the prosecutor\u2019s challenges for cause and in denying two of his challenges for cause.  Whether the contention is that the trial court erred in excluding prospective jurors who exhibited an anti-death-bias, or erred in failing to exclude prospective jurors who exhibited a pro-death-bias, the same standard applies. <em>(People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1229, 1318 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259].) \u201cA prospective juror may be challenged for cause based upon his or her views regarding capital punishment only if those views would \u2018 \u201cprevent or substantially impair\u201d \u2019 the performance of the juror\u2019s duties as defined by the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath.\u201d <em>(People v. Cunningham </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 975 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 25 P.3d 519], quoting <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412, 424 [105 S.Ct. 844, 852, 83 L.Ed.2d 841].) \u201cOn review of a trial court\u2019s ruling, if the prospective juror\u2019s statements are equivocal or conflicting, that court\u2019s determination of the person\u2019s state of mind is binding. If there is no inconsistency, the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>court will uphold the court\u2019s ruling if substantial evidence supports it.\u201d <em>(People v. Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 488 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">1. <em>Grant of Prosecutorial Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The prosecutor challenged nine prospective jurors for cause. The trial court granted eight of those challenges. Defendant now claims that the court erred in granting six of the eight challenges for cause. As will appear, because the challenged prospective jurors indicated either that they could not apply the death penalty under any circumstance, or were not prepared to impose the death penalty and were undecided as to their ability to do so, the trial court did not err in excusing them. <em>(People v. Cunningham, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 980-982.) Moreover, at the most, the potential jurors\u2019 statements were equivocal and conflicting regarding their ability to render a death verdict. Thus, we must defer to the trial court\u2019s determination of their states of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">a. <em>Prospective Juror Fred R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In his questionnaire and in response to the trial court\u2019s questions, Prospective Juror Fred R. stated that he might have problems applying the law to the case because he has opposed the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for \u201cmost of [his] adult life.\u201d Further voir dire revealed the extent of Fred R.\u2019s opposition against the death penalty: he stated that society\u2019s imposition of capital punishment was \u201cin a sense committing murder\u201d and that he could not participate in a procedure that imposes the death penalty on a person. On the other hand, he related that there was an \u201cextremely remote\u201d possibility that he could impose a death verdict, but that the decision would be an emotional one, rather than one based on his \u201cown reasoned conscience.\u201d (See <em>People v. Cunningham, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 980-981 [prospective juror who could apply death penalty only if victim was family member was properly excused].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Exploring this discrepancy, defense counsel asked Fred R. which factor weighed more heavily, the prospective juror\u2019s desire to comply with the law or his personal feelings about capital punishment. Fred R. replied, \u201cThat\u2019s very difficult because I don\u2019t believe in the law in this particular c\u00e1se.\u201d He could conceive of a situation that would cause him to follow the law as instructed and impose the death penalty, but \u201cit would be a surprise.\u201d During questioning by the prosecutor, Fred R. reaffirmed his belief that capital punishment was \u201csociety\u2019s version of murder,\u201d but stated that as a juror, he would have to take part in that process. To further clarify Fred R.\u2019s views, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>both the prosecutor and defense counsel asked him whether he could sign a verdict form imposing death if he was the foreman. Fred R. said he could not. Upon realizing that he would be required \u201cto take complete responsibility\u201d for something that he could not justify, Fred R. stated that he did not feel qualified within the law to sit as a juror in this case. He explained that his initial opinion that he could be seated as a juror in a capital case, although difficult, had been modified to the belief that he would <em>not </em>be qualified to sit as a juror. Juror Fred R. was properly excused. (See <em>People v. Cunningham, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 980 [prospective juror properly excused for cause when he stated that he could not look at defendant and inform him that he had decided defendant should die, and that he did not want to go through such proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">b. <em>Prospective Juror Wyonne W.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Prospective Juror Wyonne W. stated that she could follow the law and maintain an open mind and be willing to listen impartially to the evidence at the penalty phase. However, she later expressed doubts of her ability to \u201cbe a part of putting somebody to death, even if that person was a part of many deaths.\u201d When asked if she could entertain the idea of putting defendant to death after determining that he was guilty of three murders and listening to more evidence, Wyonne W. replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Juror Wyonne W. was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">c. <em>Prospective Juror Curtis B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Prospective Juror Curtis B. expressed uncertainty as to whether he could apply the law and impose the death penalty. His uncertainties appeared to stem from the fact that his wife and friends knew defendant and he feared that he would \u201chave to answer\u201d in his afterlife for a decision that would hurt someone else. When asked by defense counsel if he could impose the death penalty if, after rendering a guilt verdict and considering the evidence at the penalty phase, he concluded that it was warranted and the appropriate punishment, Curtis B. replied that he could not promise that. Juror Curtis B. was properly excused. (Cf. <em>People v. Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 428 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442] [voir dire question whether prospective juror could promise to vote for death if she felt that death was the appropriate verdict properly sought a commitment from her to perform her duty].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">d. <em>Prospective Juror Joe T.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">When asked if he could vote for the death penalty \u201cno matter what the circumstances were,\u201d Prospective Juror Joe T. replied, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>I\u2019m not certain.\u201d After further questioning, he stated that he could not envision any situation, as a juror, in which he could impose the death penalty. Juror Joe T. was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">e. <em>Prospective Juror Lori D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Expressing some uncertainty as to whether she could impose the death penalty, Prospective Juror Lori D. stated that she had taken an anti-death-penalty stance in recent years, that she did not think it was right to impose the death penalty, and that it could be \u201cmorally\u201d wrong. Defense counsel asked if she would be able to vote for death if, after listening to all the evidence, she determined that the aggravating circumstances were so substantial in comparison to the mitigating circumstances that it warranted death. Lori D. replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She was properly excused. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 981 [prospective juror properly excused because she could not personally impose death penalty despite viewing it as an appropriate punishment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">f. <em>Prospective Juror Joe H.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">When initially asked if he had strong feelings about the death penalty, Prospective Juror Joe H. responded that since he had never been asked about that subject, he could not say. Although Joe H. once agreed that he could impose verdicts of death or life without the possibility of parole, he later equivocated and said that he did not know if he could impose either penalty. Upon further questioning, Joe H. stated that he could not vote to impose the death penalty. He explained that he had never had to think about the subject, but that, upon reflection, he could not impose death. Juror Joe H. was properly excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">2. <em>Denial of Defense Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Defendant challenged Jurors Scott S. and Curtis L. for their alleged pro-death-penalty bias. Defendant faults the trial court for denying those challenges for cause. Here, the record shows that defendant accepted the jury after having exercised 23 of the 26 peremptory challenges allotted to him. To preserve a claim based on the trial court\u2019s overruling a defense challenge for cause, a defendant must show (1) he used an available peremptory challenge to remove the juror in question; (2) he exhausted all of his peremptory challenges or can justify the failure to do so; and (3) he expressed dissatisfaction with the jury ultimately selected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 976; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 121 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].) Defendant failed to satisfy any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of these requirements. Therefore, his claim of error is not preserved for appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 634 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Nevertheless, defendant asserts that his claim is preserved because he was justified in failing to use his available peremptory challenges to excuse the two jurors. He argues that given the large number of prospective jurors who had been exposed to pretrial publicity, it was likely that Scott S. and Curtis L., who had not been so exposed, would have been replaced with two jurors who were prejudiced by the pretrial publicity. However, defendant fails to give any record support for that claim. Moreover, defense counsel expressed no dissatisfaction with the jury. Thus, his argument is simply speculative. (See <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 121 [if defendant claims that the trial court wrongly denied challenge for cause, he must <em>demonstrate </em>that the right to fair and impartial jury thereby was affected].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Even if the issue were cognizable, defendant would not prevail. As shown below, defendant ultimately passed for cause one of the jurors he now contests. The other juror\u2019s statements were, at most, conflicting. Accordingly, we must defer to the trial court\u2019s determination of his state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">a. <em>Juror Scott S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">When asked by defense counsel to assume that defendant was found to have committed three deliberate and premeditated murders, and a rape and robbery without justification, Scott S. replied that the death penalty would be appropriate. However, he also said that he could keep an open mind regarding penalty. After questioning Scott S., defense counsel challenged him for cause. The record reflects that the trial court did not rule on the challenge at that time, but asked the prosecutor if he had any questions of Scott S. Apparently sensing that Scott S. was confused regarding the trial process, the prosecutor reviewed the guilt and penalty phases in more detail. He explained that the law required that the jurors be \u201cneutral\u201d on penalty at the start of the penalty phase and make their determination based on the evidence, including circumstances of the crime and defendant\u2019s background, presented at the penalty phase. After the explanation, Scott S. stated that he \u201cprobably could keep an open mind\u201d at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">After the trial court noted the inconsistent answers given to defense counsel and the prosecutor, Scott S. assured the court that he could keep an open mind on the penalty regardless of the findings made at the guilt phase. When defense counsel asked why his opinion had changed as to the appropriateness of the death penalty, Scott S. explained that when he initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>responded, he did not know that defendant\u2019s background was a relevant factor at the penalty phase. He assured defense counsel that even if he found defendant guilty of three murders, a robbery, and a rape, he could remain \u201ccompletely neutral\u201d regarding penalty. After the second round of questioning, defense counsel passed Scott S. for cause. Thus, it appears that after further questioning of Scott S., defense counsel changed his mind about Scott S.\u2019s ability to remain fair. Under these circumstances, defendant cannot now complain of the trial court\u2019s failure to grant his challenge of Scott S. for cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 791, 804 [83 Cal.Rptr. 401, 463 P.2d 753] [any challenge for cause must be seasonably made or is waived].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">b. <em>Juror Curtis L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">When asked by defense counsel whether he could consider imposing either death or life without parole if he concluded that defendant committed three premeditated and deliberate murders without justification, Curtis L. indicated twice that the decision would be hard, but that he would probably lean in favor of the death penalty. In addition, when asked if he could assure the parties that he would keep an open mind regarding punishment if he were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed \u201cthree heinous, premeditated, deliberate killings,\u201d Curtis L. responded, \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Later, the juror qualified those answers by emphasizing repeatedly that he believed he was an open-minded person and could remain so, that the appropriate punishment would depend on the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crime, and the evidence presented, and that he would follow the instructions. Moreover, Curtis L. stated that he was not opposed to the death penalty, but that he believed it should not be imposed \u201clightly\u201d and without \u201cmuch thought and soul searching.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s challenge for cause because Curtis L. stated he could keep an open mind and follow the instructions. We find that the trial court\u2019s retention of Curtis L. is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">B. <em>Pretrial Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">1. <em>Suppression Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Defendant claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress evidence pursuant to section 1538.5. He argues that the trial court should have suppressed all evidence of his Secret Witness telephone calls to Landreth relating to the three murder victims, including the content of those conversations, and all evidence resulting from the Secret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Witness calls, including evidence of his identity as the caller. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Defendant moved to suppress all evidence of the 1985 Secret Witness telephone calls regarding Weeden and the 1987 Secret Witness telephone calls regarding Berryhill and Olsten/Stark, including evidence of defendant\u2019s identity as the Secret Witness callers. In alleging a Fourth Amendment violation, defendant relied on representations that the Secret Witness program guaranteed anonymity to its callers. He argued that the police violated that guarantee of anonymity when they illegally taped his telephone conversations with Landreth without a search warrant, and illegally took photographs of and surveilled defendant at the title company drop-off point for the purpose of establishing his identity as the Secret Witness caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The following uncontradicted evidence was presented at the suppression hearing: The Secret Witness program of Shasta County was established by the Soroptimists, a private service organization, to aid law enforcement in investigating crimes. The program allows citizens to report information on crimes, with the possibility of receiving a reward. The program\u2019s advisory board consists of private citizens and representatives from various law enforcement agencies. Based on recommendations by various law enforcement agencies, the board decides the reward offers to be made in specific criminal cases and the proposed payoffs for information provided. The listed crimes and approved reward offers are publicized in the newspapers and on television and radio. The board has the authority to deny requests for cooperation from law enforcement. Landreth, the owner of an answering service, contracted with the Secret Witness program to receive calls and information from tipsters, assigned tipsters a code number for identification purposes, and relayed information to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Funding for the program was not provided by law enforcement, but by various service organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The police began recording the telephone calls between defendant and Landreth on September 21, 1987. Before that time, none of the calls between the Secret Witness caller and Landreth had been recorded or monitored by the police. However, the police decided to solicit the help of the Secret Witness program and monitor the telephone calls after they began to suspect that defendant was the Secret Witness caller on the August 1987 Olsten/ Stark calls and on the September 1987 Berryhill calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On August 8, 1987, Landreth received an inquiry about the reward money for the location of Olsten\u2019s body and recognized the caller\u2019s voice as the same person who had made the 1985 Weeden calls. She recorded one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>telephone calls on August 17 and played it for Detective Mundy to see if he could identify the voice independently. He too recognized the voice and believed that defendant was the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On September 15, 1987, Landreth received a new inquiry about the reward money for the location of Berryhill\u2019s body and again recognized the caller\u2019s voice as the same person who had made the 1985 Weeden calls and the August 1987 Olsten/Stark calls. In addition, the caller referenced distances in terms of meters. Landreth contacted Detective Brewer of the sheriff\u2019s office regarding the caller\u2019s request for reward money in exchange for information on the location of the Berryhill body.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On September 17, 1987, the Secret Witness board authorized payment of the reward money. Also, in response to the request by Detective Brewer, the board authorized Landreth to cooperate with law enforcement in the homicide investigations, including monitoring and recording the Secret Witness calls relating to Olsten/Stark, Berryhill, and Weeden and help in arranging the surveillance of defendant. Detective Brewer informed the board that the police suspected defendant had been the Secret Witness caller on all three homicide cases and, based on the known circumstances, considered him a suspect in at least one, if not all, of those homicides. They also believed defendant was using the Secret Witness program for financial gain in committing the criminal acts. To determine the identity of the Secret Witness caller, the police then taped subsequent Secret Witness calls and had Landreth arrange for defendant to pick up the reward money at a prearranged drop-off point on September 22. The police took photographs of defendant entering and exiting the drop-off point.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The media has reported that the Secret Witness program assures anonymity to its witness callers. Also, when a tipster makes a call to Landreth, she relates that the caller\u2019s identity will remain confidential, but that the information will be used by law enforcement. The reason the Secret Witness program guarantees anonymity is to provide a means for reluctant witnesses to provide information on crimes to the police. The Secret Witness board members, including those from various law enforcement agencies, agreed that the program guarantees anonymity only to witnesses, and not to criminals or tipsters who the police suspect are providing information on their own crimes. To guarantee anonymity to such a criminal would be contrary to the purpose of the Secret Witness program, i.e., to solve crimes. The coordinator of the Secret Witness program testified that although the program guarantees anonymity to a Secret Witness caller, a caller\u2019s identity remains confidential only as long as the caller keeps it a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion on the grounds that (1) no caller to the Secret Witness program could have had a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>expectation that the information divulged, or the caller\u2019s identity, would remain confidential if that information led the police to suspect the caller was the actual perpetrator, and (2) defendant waived any expectation of privacy as to his identity when he revealed his name during the 1986 call. The Attorney General argues that we need not decide the waiver issue because defendant\u2019s claimed subjective expectation of privacy was objectively unreasonable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u201cThe standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress is well established. We defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, express or implied, where supported by substantial evidence. In determining whether, on the facts so found, the search or seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, we exercise our independent judgment.\u201d <em>(People v. Glaser </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 354, 362 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 425, 902 P.2d 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 353 [88 S.Ct. 507, 512, 19 L.Ed.2d 576].) Its purpose is to \u201csafeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>(Camara v. Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523, 528 [87 S.Ct. 1727, 1730, 18 L.Ed.2d 930].) \u201cThe touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis is whether a person has a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California v. Ciraolo </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 207, 211 [106 S.Ct. 1809, 1811, 90 L.Ed.2d 210].) The analysis consists of a two-part inquiry: \u201cfirst, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThus a man\u2019s home is, for most purposes, a place where he expects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he exposes to the \u2018plain view\u2019 of outsiders are not \u2018protected\u2019 because no intention to keep them to himself has been exhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the open would not be protected against being overheard, for the expectation of privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.\u201d (Ka<em>tz, supra, </em>389 U.S. at p. 361 [88 S.Ct. at p. 516] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 351 [88 S.Ct. at p. 511].) Accordingly, the Fourth Amendment only protects against those government intrusions without warrant or probable cause that violate reasonable expectations of privacy. <em>(Oliver v. United States </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 170, 177-178 [104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740-1741, 80 L.Ed.2d 214].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In arguing that the content of all his conversations with Landreth, as well as his identity as the caller, should have been suppressed, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>does not distinguish between the pre-September 21, 1987, conversations that were not taped and the conversations that were taped, on and after that date. Regarding the untaped conversations, we perceive <em>no </em>governmental intrusion. Defendant called the Secret Witness program and provided Landreth all of the information <em>voluntarily.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Regarding the taped conversations, the police intrusion or surveillance was lawful: they monitored the telephone calls because they suspected that defendant was the Secret Witness caller and the killer of all three victims. (\u00a7 633.5.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, any expectation that the police would not monitor a telephone call <em>voluntarily </em>initiated by defendant to the Secret Witness program, presumably a law enforcement agent, is simply not an expectation that is objectively reasonable, warranting Fourth Amendment protection. Similarly, the police surveillance and photographing of defendant entering and exiting the drop-off point is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection since defendant knowingly exposed his whereabouts in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">By not differentiating between the unrecorded and unmonitored telephone calls and the recorded and monitored ones, it appears that defendant is really arguing that Secret Witness program\u2019s promise of anonymity and its <em>breach </em>by law enforcement violated his reasonable expectation of privacy and is therefore a search proscribed by the Fourth Amendment. We reject that argument for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">First, we fail to see how this alleged breach of a promise of anonymity rises to a Fourth Amendment violation, i.e., a governmental <em>intrusion </em>or interference that infringes upon a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the challenged search.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Second, defendant\u2019s claim that the Secret Witness program promised \u201ccomplete anonymity\u201d to all tipsters, including callers providing tips about crimes they have committed or are suspected of committing, is not supported by the record. Indeed, the trial court impliedly found otherwise. In its denial order, the trial court stated: \u201cNo caller to a secret witness program could have a reasonable expectation that the information he divulged would remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>confidential. The term confidential communication as defined in [Penal] Code Section 632, [subdivision] (c) includes only those communications carried on in circumstances that would reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desired it to be confined to the parties thereto. The obvious primary and publicized purpose of the secret witness program is to gather information helpful to law enforcement in apprehending and convicting persons responsible for criminal acts. The 1985 and 1989 newspaper clippings submitted in evidence as defendant\u2019s \u2018M-l\u2019 and \u2018M-2\u2019 provide, just prior to the guarantee of anonymity, that \u2018information provided will be used by police and sheriffs\u2019 investigators to gather evidence.\u2019 Any reasonable caller would know that the information provided would be passed on to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u201c[I]n the view of this Court, under present Federal Law, society is not prepared to recognize as reasonable or justifiable any expectation of anonymity by a caller to an anonymous witness program, such as Secret Witness, under circumstances in which the information the caller divulges reasonably gives law enforcement probable cause to believe that the caller may be the perpetrator of a serious crime to which the information relates. The primary purpose of such anonymous witness programs is the apprehension and conviction of criminals. The promise of anonymity is offered only for the purpose of inducing reluctant informers to provide information which assists in this primary purpose. The inducement derives from the protection from publicity or retaliation that the informer receives by remaining anonymous. People v. Callen [(1987)] 194 [Cal.App.]3d [558,] 563, [239 Cal.Rptr. 584] partially quoted by defendant in brief, also stresses that \u2018It is the promise of anonymity which allays the fear of criminal retaliation which otherwise discourages citizen involvement in reporting crime.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u201cAny reasonable voluntary provider of information to such a program must know that such information will be used to identify and apprehend the criminal perpetrator. If that information logically leads to an investigation of the caller as a suspected perpetrator, the reason for the promise of anonymity disappears, and the promise can no longer justifiably be relied upon by the caller, certainly not to the extent of evidence exclusion under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Although the trial court couched the expectation of privacy analysis in constitutional terms, it appears that the trial court was also making findings of fact. By finding that no reasonable person would believe that a <em>suspect\u2019s </em>identity would remain anonymous simply because he or she provided information, the trial court impliedly found that the Secret Witness program did not, in fact, guarantee anonymity under all circumstances. The evidence supports that implied finding of fact. A flier publicizing the program stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u201cAre you a witness to a crime . . . but afraid to tell anyone? Then \u2018Secret Witness\u2019 is for you. Are you a concerned citizen? Do you have knowledge of a crime? Are you afraid that if you tell, you\u2019ll be in danger? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cIf you have any information on a crime, the Secret Witness Program has a telephone answering service you can call or a post office box you can write. You can remain anonymous and not give your name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cIf a Secret Witness reward has been posted for a certain crime that needs to be solved and the information you reported leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible, the Secret Witness Program will pay you an award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cAnd . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cYou will remain unknown. This is Guaranteed! . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\u201cYou will not be involved.\u2014The authorities will develop their own evidence from your information. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Thus, the flier assures anonymity to those witnesses who fear retaliation if they come forward with information, and states that an award will be paid if the reported information leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible. When the stated purpose of anonymity (protection of fearful witnesses) and the intended puipose for the information (arrest and conviction of perpetrators) are considered together, the flier cannot reasonably be understood to assure readers that a criminal, by providing information on a crime, would be shielded from prosecution and conviction for that same crime. Moreover, the uncontradicted testimony at the suppression hearing reflects that the people associated with the Secret Witness program understood that the program only guarantees anonymity to witnesses, and not criminals or tipsters who the police suspect are providing information about their own criminal activities. Accordingly, we also reject defendant\u2019s claim that he did not voluntarily consent to the \u201csearch and seizure,\u201d i.e., the acquisition and use, of his Secret Witness statements, because they were obtained by fraud, subterfuge, and trickery.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment and due process claim. He argues that his Secret Witness statements to Landreth, including his admission or confession to Landreth that \u201cBob\u201d had killed Weeden, were involuntary because they were improperly induced by promises of anonymity and rewards.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">At trial, defendant failed to object to admission of his statements and raise the involuntariness claim on the constitutional grounds he now asserts. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>he has forfeited his claim on appeal. <em>(People v. Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 339 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846] [a claim of involuntariness generally will not be addressed for the first time on appeal]; <em>People v. Mayfield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 142, 172 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 836, 852 P.2d 331] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Defendant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve his current challenge to his SecretnWitness statements amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel. We disagree. For the reasons stated above, defendant\u2019s claim that he was induced by promises of complete anonymity is unfounded. Moreover, the Secret Witness program\u2019s offers of rewards and anonymity were not coercive, and a suppression motion could not have been properly granted on this ground. Coercive activity by the state is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession or admission is not voluntary. <em>(Colorado v. Connelly </em>(1986) 479 U.S. 157, 163 [107 S.Ct. 515, 519-520, 93 L.Ed.2d 473]; <em>People v. Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 989, fn. 14 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099].) Here, defendant initiated and instigated the negotiations for a reward, which had been generally offered to the public, in return for information about the missing victims. Defendant named his own terms in exchange for his statements, decided for himself with whom he would negotiate, and solicited and received the reward he wanted as a consideration for telling what he knew. Thus, defendant\u2019s desire to provide information to obtain a reward was entirely self-motivated. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Steger </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 539, 550 [128 Cal.Rptr. 161, 546 P.2d 665, 83 A.L.R.3d 1206]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 921, 933 [227 Cal.Rptr. 578]; <em>People v. Andersen </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 563, 582 [161 Cal.Rptr. 707]; see also <em>Hunter v. Swenson </em>(W.D.Mo. 1974) 372 F.Supp. 287, 301-302.) Under such circumstances, defendant\u2019s statements were clearly voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">2. <em>Alleged Incompetence of Counsel\u2014Failure to Renew Change of Venue Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Defendant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to renew a motion for change of venue after jury voir dire. On June 28, 1988, before voir dire, defendant filed a motion for a change of venue. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion without prejudice to renewal during jury selection. Following the denial, defendant petitioned for a writ of mandate, which was summarily denied by the Court of Appeal. Defendant filed a petition for review in this court <em>(Maury </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>Jan. 17, 1989, S008628), which was also summarily denied on March 2, 1989. A jury was then selected on June 9, 1989. Defendant did not renew the motion for change of venue after selection of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u201c[W]hen a trial court initially denies a change of venue motion without prejudice, a defendant must renew the motion after voir dire of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>jury to preserve the issue for appeal. Here, although expressly invited by the court to renew the motion after jury selection, defendant failed to do so.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 654-655 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 573, 941 P.2d 752]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hart </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 546, 598 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 976 P.2d 683]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 312 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].)  Recognizing the procedural default, defendant claims that his counsel was incompetent for failing to renew the motion after jury voir dire. The record fails to reveal any incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Defendant has the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 33 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249].) To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant \u201c \u2018must establish not only deficient performance, i.e., representation below an objective standard of reasonableness, but also resultant prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hart, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 623.) A court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 689 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674].) Tactical errors are generally not deemed reversible, and counsel\u2019s decisionmaking must be evaluated in the context of the available facts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 690 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2065-2066].) To the extent the record on appeal fails to disclose why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged, we will affirm the judgment unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, Tello </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134].) Moreover, prejudice must be affirmatively proved; the record must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (St<em>rickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 694 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In passing on a motion for change of venue, the trial court looks to the following factors, among others: the nature and gravity of the offense, the size of the community, the status of the defendant, the popularity and prominence of the victim, and the nature and extent of the publicity. <em>(People v. Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 505 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420].)  Defendant argues that because there was a reasonable likelihood that he could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Shasta County, defense counsel should have renewed the motion for change of venue. Reiterating many of the same arguments that had been presented to the trial court on the initial motion for change of venue, defendant points to the gravity and nature of the crimes, the small size of the community, and the extensive media coverage, including newspaper articles and television and radio broadcasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court heard the testimony of two defense experts who had reviewed the publicity about the case and conducted a public opinion survey in Shasta County. According to the survey\u2019s results, 90 percent of those surveyed recognized defendant\u2019s case. Of those who had heard of the case, 54 percent believed that defendant was guilty. One of the defense experts opined that, at the time of the evidentiary hearing, there was a reasonable likelihood that defendant would not get a fair trial in Shasta County. The prosecution\u2019s expert attacked the survey\u2019s validity and accuracy. In denying the motion for change of venue, the trial court found that the survey\u2019s results were inaccurate and biased and that the expert\u2019s opinion regarding the unlikelihood of a fair trial was also entitled to little weight. The court also found that there would be at least a year between the occurrence of most of the publicity and the start of trial, the publicity about the case was \u201cneither slanted against the defendant nor reflect[ed] a spirit of revenge in the community,\u201d and the victims and the defendant were not prominent members of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Defendant does not claim that defense counsel was incompetent in presenting the initial change of venue motion. Indeed, he now relies extensively on the same newspaper articles and television and radio broadcasts presented to the trial court by defense counsel. Rather, he argues that because many of the prospective jurors (including the actual jurors) had been exposed to some pretrial publicity, he could not receive a fair trial and counsel should have renewed the motion. Although, as defendant points out, seven of the 12 jurors and three of the five alternates had been exposed to pretrial publicity, our independent evaluation of the record reveals that, for the most part, few jurors recalled the specifics and none had formed a resolute impression of defendant\u2019s guilt. Instead, all of the jurors and alternates expressed that they could be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In light of these responses, counsel could have recognized that the effect of the publicity had not been as substantial as feared, especially after a year and one-half interim, and that a renewed motion to seek a change of venue would have been futile. <em>(People v. Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 314.) Indeed, defendant used only 23 of his 26 allotted peremptory challenges to excuse jurors from the panel and only three of his five challenges to excuse alternate jurors. \u201c \u2018The failure to exhaust peremptories is a strong indication \u201cthat the jurors were fair, and that the defense itself so concluded.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>[(1991)] 1 Cal.4th [324,] 393 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].) This last point can be decisive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 853-854 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)\u201d <em>(People v.

We will not second-guess counsel\u2019s preference for this particular jury over another, unknown jury panel. (See <em>People v. Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 314; <em>White v. State </em>(1996) 221 Ga.App. 860 [473 S.E.2d 539, 543]; <em>Solomon v. Commissioner of Correctional Services </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1992) 786 F.Supp. 218, 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">3. <em>Contentions Regarding Severance Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">a. <em>General principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Defendant makes several arguments complaining of the joinder of the Weeden murder and Jacqueline H. rape charges.  Joinder and severance of different criminal charges against the same defendant are governed by section 954, which states that an \u201caccusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, ... or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, . . . provided, that the court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried separately.\u201d As we have held, \u201cOffenses falling within this description, but charged in separate pleadings, may be consolidated for trial in order to promote judicial efficiency (see <em>People v. Mason </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 909, 935 [277 Cal.Rptr. 166, 802 P.2d 950]), and a trial court\u2019s rulings on joinder are reviewed for abuse of discretion <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1283-1284 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1]).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Koontz </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1041, 1074 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 46 P.3d 335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">b. <em>Severance of the Weeden murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Defendant made no motion to sever the Weeden murder count from the other charges. Defendant now claims that the trial court erred in failing, sua sponte, to sever his trial on the Weeden murder or to give limiting instructions, and that this error violated his right to due process and a fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and analogous provisions of the California Constitution. He also argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to move for severance and to request the appropriate limiting instruction. As explained below, we reject those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>i. <em>Failure to sever or to request severance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><em>People v. Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 939-940 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574], disposes of defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court had a sua sponte duty to sever.  There, we stated: \u201cSection 954, however, imposes no sua sponte duty of severance on trial courts. That section, as quoted above, requires the defendant to make a showing of \u2018good cause\u2019 in order to obtain severance, and defendant\u2019s failure to request a severance waives the matter on appeal. Nor do we find any authority to support defendant\u2019s argument that the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, or their California counterparts, impose such a duty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 940.) Because defendant failed to request severance of the Weeden murder count, he has forfeited his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Regarding defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we find neither incompetence of counsel nor prejudice resulting from his attorneys\u2019 failure to move for severance. (See <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 687-694 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2064-2068].) Defendant argues that a motion to sever, had it been made, should have been granted because the joinder of the Weeden murder case, which was \u201cvery weak,\u201d with the other charges, unfairly prejudiced him. In addition, he argues that his sole defense of duress could not be raised because the joinder of the multiple murder charges allowed the prosecution to allege the multiple-murder special circumstance, which resulted in the classification of the Weeden homicide as a death-eligible crime. However, the trial court would not have abused its discretion by denying a motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">First, the murder offenses fall within the same class of crimes and thus were properly joined. <em>(People v. Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1315 [murder offenses belong to the same class of crimes].) Second, there was a common and distinctive modus operandi in all of the murders. To be admissible to demonstrate a distinctive modus operandi, the evidence must disclose common marks or identifiers, that, considered singly or in combination, support a strong inference that the defendant committed the crimes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1316.) The victims were females who were acquainted with defendant. There was evidence that all three murder victims died from strangulation. Landreth testified that the same Secret Witness caller requested reward money in exchange for information on the location of the bodies of all three victims. Apart from these three victims, the Secret Witness program had never received any other requests for reward money in return for a tip on the location of a body. Moreover, the caller waited until after the bodies had decomposed to make the Secret Witness calls. Thus, evidence of the distinctive Secret Witness calls made by the same person on all three offenses reflected common elements of substantial importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Further, evidence relating to the Berryhill and Stark offenses would have been admissible at a separate Weeden murder trial on the issue of the identity of the Weeden caller. The evidence strongly indicated, particularly the surveillance of defendant at the Secret Witness drop-off point, that he made the Berryhill and Stark telephone calls. Indeed, defendant conceded that he had made these calls. On the other hand, defendant denied making the Weeden calls. Because Landreth believed that the same person made the Weeden, Berryhill, and Stark calls, evidence that defendant made the Berryhill and Stark calls was relevant to show that defendant made the Weeden calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Thus, the similarities of the offenses, together with evidence that defendant made all of the Secret Witness calls, were sufficient to establish a common modus operandi, raising a strong inference that defendant killed Weeden. Because evidence of the murders was cross-admissible, any likelihood of prejudice was dispelled. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 126 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980].) For that reason alone, no abuse of discretion would have occurred in denying severance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s assertions of prejudice are not supported by the record. First, the evidence in the Weeden murder case was far from weak. Defendant made inconsistent statements to the police. Initially, he denied any involvement in Weeden\u2019s disappearance, but then claimed that he was present during her murder and forced to strike her with a rock. Defendant made numerous admissions to Landreth (that Weeden\u2019s roommate \u201cBob\u201d or \u201cRobert\u201d had killed her), Detective Ashmun (that Weeden had been strangled and hit on the head with a rock), and Detective Mundy (that Morris had strangled Weeden and forced him to strike her with a rock). He made more admissions to Norma Schwartz (that he had killed before), Beth Von Millanich (that he was happy and excited about being a suspect in the murder of his landlord), Tracy Trantham (that he knew who had killed Weeden, that she was a \u201csnitch,\u201d that any \u201csnitch deserved to die,\u201d and that he had killed before), and Cheryl Stapley (that he had killed his landlady, that he had been brought in for questioning and laughed that he had \u201cgot off of that,\u201d and that he \u201ccan get off of anything\u201d). Finally, defendant told two or three different stories to Bill Chartier and taunted Detective Mundy that he would never really know what had happened to Weeden and Mundy would take her death to his grave.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Second, although the joinder of the murder charges gave rise to the special circumstance allegation (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), we will reject defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to and thereby improperly deprived of a duress defense. (See, <em>post, </em>at pp. 421-422.) Thus, defendant has failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>prejudice from the joinder and the resultant conversion of the Weeden murder into a death-eligible crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Because much of the incriminating evidence in the Stark and Berryhill charges would have been used in a separate Weeden murder trial to prove identity, and defendant has failed to establish prejudice from the joinder, the trial court would not have abused its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to sever had such a motion been made. No reasonable probability existed that, had defense counsel moved for severance, the motion would have been granted. Accordingly, defendant has failed to establish prejudice from counsel\u2019s omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">ii. <em>Failure to give limiting instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in failing to provide sua sponte an instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the Stark and Berryhill crimes in deciding defendant\u2019s guilt of the Weeden murder.  The trial court has no sua sponte duty to give a limiting instruction on cross-admissible evidence in a trial of multiple crimes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 942.) We similarly reject the claim that defense counsel was incompetent for failing to request a limiting instruction on the cross-admissible evidence. A reasonable attorney may have tactically concluded that the risk of a limiting instruction (suggesting to the jury that the evidence supporting the Stark and Berryhill murders was relatively strong) outweighed the questionable benefits such instruction would provide. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">c. <em>Severance of the Jacqueline H. rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the Jacqueline H. rape count. He claims that the prosecution argued and the trial court incorrectly agreed that the evidence on the charges relating to Weeden, Berryhill, and Stark was admissible in the Jacqueline H. case to identify defendant as the rapist. Defendant argues that the evidence was not relevant in the rape case because the issue there involved consent, not identity. He mischaracterizes the basis for both the prosecution\u2019s argument and the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Immediately before Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal of the assault with intent to commit rape charge relating to Stark and also moved to sever the rape charge relating to Jacqueline H. He explained that the purpose of the motion for acquittal was to \u201cset up a basis for severance.\u201d He conceded that there were \u201cclear grounds\u201d to join the rape count with the assault with intent to commit rape count, but argued that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>because there was insufficient evidence to support the assault charge, the trial court should dismiss that charge. He further argued that, once the assault count disappeared, there would be no basis to join the rape charge with the three murder cases. The prosecution responded that the motion for severance was untimely because it should have been made before trial, but that, in any event, evidence relating to the Jacqueline H. rape was relevant as to the identity of the murderer of the three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The trial court denied both motions. Although the court found the severance motion untimely, it then proceeded to rule on the merits. It found that evidence on the rape count would have been cross-admissible in a separate trial on the murder charges to establish the identity of the perpetrator and that the probative value of the cross-admissible evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect of joinder. Specifically, it found that the rape and the murders had the following similarities: defendant tightened a rope around Jacqueline H.\u2019s neck before he raped her; Weeden and Berryhill were strangled with a clothesline rope and scarf, respectively; defendant told Detective Newsome that he had heard that Stark had been strangled; and the bodies of Berryhill and Stark were found and Jacqueline H. was raped in the same general remote area of Happy Valley. In addition, the court found that the boot string that defendant showed Dr. Cur\u00edale was cross-admissible evidence on the murder and rape charges and that the evidentiary strengths of the murder and rape charges were relatively similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Because the trial court correctly ruled on the merits, we need not decide the timeliness issue. Murder and rape are assaultive crimes against the person and, as such, are \u201coffenses of the same class of crimes\u201d within the meaning of section 954 and were properly joinable. <em>(People v. Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 127; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 188 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) Because the statutory requirements for joinder were met, defendant can establish error only on a clear showing of prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Koontz, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1075.) He has failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">As the trial court ruled, the evidence of the rape would have been cross-admissible in separate trials on the murder charges. In addition to the similarities described by the court, there were other similarities relating to the murder and rape offenses. Berryhill, Stark, and Jacqueline H. were young, small, and slim women who knew defendant. Berryhill and Stark\u2019s disappearances and Jacqueline H.\u2019s rape occurred within a short period of time of each other. Thus, the incidents disclosed a distinctive modus operandi tending to establish the killer\u2019s identity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1316; <em>People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 28 [61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262].) Also, as with the Jacqueline H. offense, there was evidence that the attack on Stark was sexually motivated. Thus, evidence in support of the offenses against Stark and Jacqueline H. was cross-admissible on the issue of intent. <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>at p. 28; <em>People v. Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 508 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].) Because evidence of the murders and rape was cross-admissible, no abuse of discretion occurred in failing to sever. <em>(People v. Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">C. <em>Guilt Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Defendant contends the evidence, in several respects, was insufficient to support the judgment.  In reviewing a criminal conviction challenged as lacking evidentiary support, \u201c \u2018the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hillhouse, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 496.) The same standard of review applies to cases in which the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618]), and to special circumstance allegations <em>(People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414). An appellate court must accept logical inferences that the jury might have drawn from the circumstantial evidence. <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 11.) As will appear, we reject defendant\u2019s attempts to reargue the persuasiveness of the evidence and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support (1) the Stark murder and assault with intent to commit rape convictions, (2) the Berryhill murder and robbery convictions and robbery-murder special-circumstance finding, and (3) the Jacqueline H. rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">a. <em>Stark murder conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for Stark\u2019s murder and the assault of Stark with intent to commit rape. We conclude that there was substantial evidence to support both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Disputing that he even knew Stark, defendant claims that there was not enough evidence to prove that Stark\u2019s death resulted from a homicide, as opposed to an accidental death or suicide, or that he killed her. To the contrary, evidence of defendant\u2019s connection to Stark\u2019s death was overwhelming. First, evidence of the Secret Witness calls and the similarities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the victims established a pattern linking defendant with the killings. The jury could reasonably infer that defendant made all of the Secret Witness calls and provided information that only the killer or an eyewitness would know about Weeden, Stark, and Berryhill. On August 8, 1987, someone telephoned the Secret Witness program seeking a reward for information on the location of a body. Landreth recognized the caller\u2019s voice as the same person who had called with information on Weeden. She also believed that the caller was the same person who had called on September 11, 1986, and identified himself as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On August 17, 1987, when the caller gave directions to the body, he stated that the death occurred about one and one-half months ago, which coincided with the date of Stark\u2019s disappearance. He also related to Landreth that the boyfriend was responsible for the death and that he would leave information about the person responsible in an envelope when he retrieved the reward money. Although defendant left an empty envelope without any information as promised, the police found defendant\u2019s fingerprint on the envelope. Thus, defendant\u2019s fingerprint corroborated Landreth\u2019s belief that defendant was the Stark case Secret Witness caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Almost three months after Berryhill\u2019s disappearance, beginning on September 15, 1987, Landreth of the Secret Witness program began receiving a series of anonymous telephone calls relating to Berryhill. The caller had information on the location of Berryhill\u2019s body and began negotiating for reward money in return for that information. Landreth recognized the caller\u2019s voice as the same person who had previously called regarding Weeden and Olsten/Stark and decided to tape two of the telephone calls on September 22, 1987. Detective Mundy listened to the taped conversations and confirmed that the caller\u2019s voice belonged to defendant. In return for providing information on the whereabouts of Berryhill\u2019s body, the caller picked up the reward money at the title company office on September 22, 1987, as prearranged. During the surveillance, the police confirmed defendant\u2019s identity as the Berryhill case Secret Witness caller. Thus, there was ample evidence that defendant was the Secret Witness caller regarding all three women and that he knew that Stark had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Moreover, the similarities of the victims further linked defendant to the killings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Weeden, Stark, Berryhill, and Jacqueline H. were small, petite women that defendant knew. The disappearances of Stark and Berryhill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>occurred only one week and two days after the Jacqueline H. rape, and their bodies were found in the same general area where Jacqueline H. had been raped. Also, it was undisputed that defendant was familiar with and took walks in that area. Moreover, two residents saw a man matching defendant\u2019s general description drive his motorcycle into the wooded area where Stark\u2019s and Berryhill\u2019s bodies were later found. One witness testified that he saw the man at least twice, while the other witness said she saw him about five times and that he stayed in the woods for about an hour. The visits occurred about a month or two before the police searched the area. Thus, the jury could reasonably infer that, before and/or during the Secret Witness calls, defendant periodically checked to make sure the bodies were still there to ensure that he would receive his reward money. It could further reasonably infer that the reward money motivated defendant, at least in part, to kill the women.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Second, defendant\u2019s actions and statements to the police and others amply supported a finding of guilt. Several days after Stark\u2019s body had been found, defendant spoke with Detective Newsome. Despite the fact that the identity and gender of the body had not been determined, defendant noted similarities between that case and the Weeden case: both bodies were female and had been discovered in the woods. Also, despite the fact that Stark\u2019s purse was not close to her body, defendant took Del Carlo to Stark\u2019s purse and knew that the purse contained material that would identify the body. When asked by Del Carlo if there was additional evidence that would help the police in solving the crime, defendant related that he could show him the location of a .357-caliber nickel-plated gun. Although Stark owned such a gun, the police did not find it in her purse. Defendant\u2019s brother described a small pistol similar to the one owned by Stark; he told the police that defendant had asked him to dispose of it. A blanket, similar to one owned by defendant, was found close to Stark\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On October 26, 1987, defendant told Detective Newsome that he had heard Stark was strangled and that he would reveal the location of the murder weapon when he met with Dr. Cur\u00edale on October 30. Yet, during the interview with Dr. Cur\u00edale, defendant claimed he did not know anything about Stark\u2019s death. At the end of the interview on that date, defendant pulled out a boot string from his jacket and commented that Dr. Cur\u00edale should have searched his jacket because it would have given her some insight into who he was. Thus, the jury could reasonably infer from defendant\u2019s admissions, as well as the inconsistencies of his statements, that he had strangled Stark with a boot string and left her body in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Finally, the jury could reasonably reject defendant\u2019s claim that he did not know Stark and discovered the body accidentally. Defendant told a newspaper reporter that he had never seen Stark and had not been in Fall River Mills since 1977. However, three witnesses testified that they had seen defendant in Fall River Mills, either staring at Stark or with her before her disappearance. He also told the same reporter and Del Carlo that the \u201creal killer\u201d had confessed to the killings of Stark and Berryhill and that defendant discovered the location of their bodies from the killer. Thus, defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements conflicted with the testimony of impartial witnesses and with his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Defendant makes much of the fact that the experts could not determine the cause of Stark\u2019s death. However, the prosecution and defense experts agreed that Stark died of unnatural causes. Also, the evidence at the scene reasonably supported an inference of sexual activity or an effort to that end. Dr. Boyd Stephens, the coroner, concluded that someone besides Stark had removed her pants: her pants and underpants were away from the area where her body had decomposed and were not stained with decomposition fluids; one of her pant legs was partly reversed, with the pant leg rolled up; the pants zipper had been zipped down completely and her panties were completely inside out; and one of her socks and shoes were still on her foot. Further, there was no evidence explaining why Stark would be in a wooded, remote area by herself or that she frequented or ever visited the area. Moreover, it was undisputed that she had planned to travel to Nevada City from Fall River Mills to attend a court appearance on June 29, 1987, but never made it. Her boyfriend testified that he last saw Stark on or about June 25, 1987, when she told him of her travel plans. Her friend, Lucy Gray, believed that she last saw Stark on June 24, 1987. In light of defendant\u2019s extrajudicial admissions, Dr. Stephens\u2019s testimony, and the circumstances of Stark\u2019s disappearance, defendant\u2019s assertion that Stark\u2019s death resulted from an accident or suicide is simply speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Accordingly, the jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that defendant knew, strangled, and killed Stark; that he waited several months for the body and the evidence to decompose before attempting to gain reward money; that he was the Secret Witness caller who provided details about Stark that only the killer would know; and that he lied to the police, revealing a consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">b. <em>Stark assault with intent to commit rape conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Sufficient evidence also supported the conviction for assault with intent to commit rape.  \u201c \u2018The essential element of [assault with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>commit rape] is the intent to commit the act against the will of the complainant. The offense is complete if at any moment during the assault the accused intends to use whatever force may be required.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Davis, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 509.) \u201c\u2018[I]f there is evidence of the former intent and acts attendant to the execution of that intent, the abandonment of that intent before consummation of the act will not erase the felonious nature of the assault.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 509-510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Defendant argues that the prosecution failed to prove that he was the person responsible for the assault, that Stark did not consent to sexual intercourse, that someone intended to rape Stark, and that any sexual assault occurred before Stark\u2019s death. Based on Stark\u2019s clothing, as reflected above, Dr. Stephens concluded that someone besides Stark had removed her pants and that the scene was consistent with the occurrence of a sexual assault. Although defendant argues that the scene is also consistent with consensual sex, the jury could reasonably infer an assault from the evidence that Stark had suffered a fractured jaw at or near the time of death, that she was strangled and killed by defendant, and that nothing consensual had occurred. Moreover, the prosecution was not required to prove that a rape had occurred, but only that Stark had been assaulted with an intent to commit rape. Based upon Dr. Stephens\u2019s testimony and evidence that defendant forcibly raped Jacqueline H. in the same area less than a week before the assault, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant assaulted Stark with the intent to rape.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Davis, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 509-510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">c. <em>Berryhill murder conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Defendant argues that the evidence does not support the Berryhill murder conviction. He is wrong. First, there is credible evidence that Berry-hill was last seen with defendant before her disappearance and that she planned to meet with defendant on the night of June 22, 1987, to buy some marijuana at \u201cBig Mama\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Second, defendant told different stories about his plans on the night Berryhill disappeared. Defendant admitted to the police that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>with Berryhill on the day of her disappearance, but denied that he took her anywhere that night. Defendant claimed that on the night Berryhill disappeared, he had been on a date with a Leanne Thurman and that he had been late for his date because he had been with his friend Dave Hancock at the home of Hancock\u2019s boss. Although Hancock could not remember the precise date, he testified that, during the summer of 1987, he and defendant were at his boss\u2019s home when defendant related that he needed to return home because he was late for a date that night. Defendant drove off on his maroon Yamaha motorcycle for the date. Sometime afterwards, defendant revealed to Hancock that the date was with Berryhill, but that she had already left by the time he arrived. Thus, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant lied about his date with Thurman and that he was really with Berryhill on the night she disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Third, as with the Stark crimes, the jury could reasonably consider the similarities of the victims and infer that defendant made all of the Secret Witness calls and provided information that only the killer or an eyewitness would know about Weeden, Stark, and Berryhill. The caller (defendant) described the location of the body and said that Berryhill had been strangled with a scarf. When the police found Berryhill\u2019s body that same day, her body was covered with a mattress and pine needles. After removing the mattress, the police determined that a scarf was wrapped around the neck area of the vertebra; however, the scarf was not immediately evident. Goldie Lane, Berryhill\u2019s neighbor, identified the clothing and scarf found on Berryhill\u2019s body as the same items she had worn on the night of her disappearance. Finally, defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement to Landreth that he \u201csaw her boyfriend do it to [Berryhill]\u201d conflicted with his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Accordingly, the jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that defendant was the last person seen with Berryhill on the night before her disappearance; that he strangled her that night with the same scarf she wore when she left the house; that he waited several months for the body and the evidence to decompose before attempting to gain reward money; that he was the Secret Witness caller who provided details about Berryhill that only the killer would know; and that he lied to the police thereby revealing a consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">d. <em>Berryhill robbery conviction and robbery-murder special-circumstance finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Defendant asserts that the robbery conviction should be reversed because of insufficient evidence that Berryhill had any money on her when she was killed or that any money was taken by force or fear. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 20, fn. 8 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843], disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Sassounian </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 543, fn. 5 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 446, 887 P.2d 527].) Similarly, he argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the robbery-murder special-circumstance finding because the evidence showed the perpetrator\u2019s primary criminal goal was not to steal but to kill and the robbery was merely incidental to the murder. <em>(Morris, supra, </em>at p. 21.) To the contrary, there was substantial evidence that Berryhill was robbed and that she was murdered while defendant was engaged in the commission of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On the day of her disappearance, Berryhill told her mother that she was going to meet \u201cBob\u201d at 8:00 p.m. and go to \u201cBig Mama\u2019s house\u201d to buy marijuana. Williams gave her daughter $100. Before leaving the house on the night of her disappearance, Berryhill asked Lane for a ride to buy some marijuana. When Lane offered to babysit instead, Berryhill said she could get a ride from \u201ca guy on a motorcycle.\u201d Berryhill said she had enough money to buy \u201csome dope,\u201d showed Lane a roll of money, and placed it in her small hand purse. Soon afterwards, Berryhill was last seen riding off with defendant on his motorcycle. A larger purse was located near Berry-hill\u2019s body. Lane testified that Berryhill carried her marijuana in the larger purse. Although Berryhill did not put her money in that purse, Lane stated that the purse with the money could fit inside the larger one. Because there was no marijuana in Berryhill\u2019s marijuana purse and the purse with the money was missing, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant stole either the money or marijuana from Berryhill. Moreover, because Berryhill was killed by strangulation with her own scarf, and only two days earlier defendant had forced Jacqueline H. to submit to rape by threatening to strangle her, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant strangled and killed Berryhill while engaged in the commission of a robbery. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17).)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201c \u2018[W]hen one kills another and takes substantial property from the victim, it is ordinarily reasonable to presume the killing was for purposes of robbery.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 357 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].) Even \u201c \u2018[i]f a person commits a murder, <em>and after doing so takes the victim\u2019s wallet, </em>the jury may reasonably infer that the murder was committed for the purpose of obtaining the wallet, because murders are commonly committed to obtain money.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>That defendant may have harbored a concurrent intent to kill does not invalidate the robbery-murder special circumstance. <em>(People v. Barnett </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1160 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 121, 954 P.2d 384].) Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the robbery conviction and the robbery-murder special-circumstance finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>e. <em>Jacqueline H. rape conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the rape of Jacqueline H. on two grounds. First, he argues that Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony was incredible, based on the absence of visible injuries and evidence that Jacqueline H. failed to report the rape or seek help afterwards, had a reputation as a liar, was a drug addict and convicted thief, and may have suffered from drug-induced paranoia.  In deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask whether \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165].) Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huston </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 690, 693 [134 P.2d 758].) We resolve neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts; we look for substantial evidence. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].) The finding of guilt was amply supported by Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Second, defendant contends that, even if Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony is believed, she never expressly stated that the act of sexual intercourse was against her will. Thus, he argues, the evidence was insufficient to show lack of consent. Defendant\u2019s claim is based on the remarkable and unsupported assertion that, because lack of consent and force or fear are separate elements, the same evidence cannot be used to prove \u201cnon-consent\u201d and \u201cforce or fear.\u201d Contrary to his claim, evidence of force or fear is directly linked to the overbearing of a victim\u2019s will; the prosecution is required to demonstrate that the act of sexual intercourse was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Iniguez </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 847, 856 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 258, 872 P.2d 1183].) We agree with the Attorney General that there is ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that Jacqueline H. did not consent to sexual intercourse, i.e., her testimony that she feared for her life, that defendant rejected her request to take her home, that she disrobed and lay on the ground only after he placed and tightened a rope around her neck and ordered her to do so, and that, after the act of intercourse, she grabbed a screwdriver from a leather pouch attached to the motorcycle to protect herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">2. <em>Evidentiary Issues\u2014Voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Defendant contends that his statements to the district attorney and police in 1985 and to Dr. Cur\u00edale were involuntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a. <em>General principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In reviewing the voluntary character of incriminating statements, \u201c \u2018[t]his court must examine the uncontradicted facts surrounding the making of the statements to determine independently whether the prosecution met its burden and proved that the statements were voluntarily given without previous inducement, intimidation or threat. [Citations.] With respect to the conflicting testimony, the court must \u201caccept that version of events which is most favorable to the People, to the extent that it is supported by the record.\u201d \u2019 <em>([People v.

Vasila </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 865, 873 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 355].)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">A statement is involuntary if it is not the product of \u201c \u2018a rational intellect and free will.\u2019\u201d <em>(Mincey v. Arizona </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 385, 398 [98 S.Ct. 2408, 2416, 57 L.Ed.2d 290].) The test for determining whether a confession is voluntary is whether the defendant\u2019s \u201cwill was overborne at the time he confessed.\u201d <em>(Lynumn v. Illinois </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 528, 534 [83 S.Ct. 917, 920, 9 L.Ed.2d 922].) \u201c \u2018The question posed by the due process clause in cases of claimed psychological coercion is whether the influences brought to bear upon the accused were \u201csuch as to overbear petitioner\u2019s will to resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] In determining whether or not an accused\u2019s will was overborne, \u2018an examination must be made of \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u2014both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">A finding of coercive police activity is a prerequisite to a finding that a confession was involuntary under the federal and state Constitutions. <em>(People v. Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 778 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330], citing <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 167 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 521-522].) A confession may be found involuntary if extracted by threats or violence, obtained by direct or implied promises, or secured by the exertion of improper influence. <em>(Benson, supra, </em>at p. 778.) Although coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to establish an involuntary confession, it \u201cdoes not itself compel a finding that a resulting confession is involuntary.\u201d <em>(People v. Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1041 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>P.2d 544].) The statement and the inducement must be causally linked. <em>{Benson, supra, </em>at pp. 778-779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">b. <em>Admissibility of defendant\u2019s November 21, 1985, statements to district attorney and police</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On November 21, 1985, Detective Mundy and District Attorney Carlton interviewed defendant. During the tape-recorded interview, defendant related that he walked in on the murder of Weeden by Morris and another man, that they tied defendant up at gunpoint and took him with them to dispose of Weeden\u2019s body, and that they threatened to kill him if he told anyone about their involvement in the murder. The trial court allowed the jury to hear the taped interview and admitted the tape recording and transcript of the interview into evidence. Defendant contends that because his November 21 statements were involuntarily made, the trial court violated his due process rights in admitting them into evidence. His claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">First, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to rule expressly on the voluntariness of his November 21, 1985, statements. However, the record reflects no error. As part of his section 1538.5 pretrial motion to suppress evidence, defendant moved to suppress his November 21 statement. In rejecting defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim and denying the suppression motion relating to that statement, the trial court expressly found that the November 21 statements were \u201cvoluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d During trial, the trial court asked the parties whether the voluntariness of the November 21 statements was a \u201ccontested issue.\u201d The following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think we have any problem with the statements made in \u201985. Now, the defense is constrained from\u2014or at least we do not wish to stipulate to the admission of any of these statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then, again, we don\u2019t wish to be obstreperous either, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue of voluntariness as to the \u201985 statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Let me suggest that the parties get together and I think we can agree at least to disagree and form the issues so it can be done quickly Tuesday morning, if necessary. And whatever rulings would be necessary\u2014I certainly don\u2019t expect anything on the \u201985 tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: You don\u2019t expect anything what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]; Challenge on the voluntariness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Later, when the prosecutor introduced the tape and transcript of the interview into evidence, defense counsel objected only to the accuracy and use of the transcript.  Although the trial court did not expressly find that the November 21 statements were voluntarily made, such finding was implied from the court\u2019s order admitting the statement into evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 402, subd. (c) [\u201c[a] ruling on the admissibility of evidence implies whatever finding of fact is prerequisite thereto; a separate or formal finding is unnecessary unless required by statute\u201d]); <em>People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 367, 374 [81 Cal.Rptr. 675].) In light of defendant\u2019s failure to object to admission of the evidence on voluntariness grounds, the lack of an express finding on that issue was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant argues that if the trial court\u2019s admission implies a finding of voluntariness, such finding was erroneous. He claims that the November 21 statements were involuntary as a matter of law because they were induced by a promise of leniency on an unrelated possession of stolen property charge and an agreement that defendant\u2019s statements would not be used against him on the Weeden murder. The record fails to support defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In November 1985, before his court appearance on the unrelated stolen property case, defendant spoke to Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Ash-mun. Defendant volunteered that he had information on the Weeden homicide, and wanted \u201cconsideration\u201d on the case he was currently facing and \u201cimmunity\u201d on the Weeden case. Defendant stated that Weeden had been strangled and hit in the head. After defendant\u2019s statements, Detective Ash-mun said he <em>might </em>help defendant on the stolen property case if he had helpful information on the Weeden case. Detective Ashmun told Detective Mundy, the investigator on the Weeden case, that defendant had information about the Weeden murder and was willing to talk about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Detective Mundy met with defendant on November 20, 1985. Defendant told Detective Mundy that he would be willing to talk to him \u201cconditionally\u201d and that he wanted to talk about \u201cimmunity.\u201d Detective Mundy responded that he- \u201ccould not grant immunity, that it would have to come from the district attorney.\u201d The detective arranged to have another interview with defendant on the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">On November 21, 1985, Detective Mundy and District Attorney Carlton interviewed defendant at his residence. At the beginning of the interview, defendant informed them that he had pleaded guilty to the crime of possession of stolen property and was facing county jail time on the conviction. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>further stated that Detective Ashmun seemed to think that \u201cif I cooperated in this investigation, then I <em>might </em>not get no jail time . . . and that was one of the things <em>I would like to get out of this, </em>assuming I know anything that can help you.\u201d (Italics added.) When District Attorney Carlton began to reply, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you before . . .\u201d defendant interrupted and said, \u201cRight, I\u2019m not asking.\u201d The district attorney continued to say that he could not tell defendant whether he would benefit before they heard his statement and determine its truthfulness. Defendant then acknowledged, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll start off by telling you what happened that day,\u201d and \u201cyou can answer a couple of my questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Defendant gave a lengthy statement in which he blamed Morris and another man for Weeden\u2019s death. At the end of the interview, defendant explained that, if not for the impending jail commitment, he would never have come forward with the information. He reiterated that he wanted to avoid jail time and that Detective Ashmun said he <em>\u201cmight </em>be able to get off easy.\u201d (Italics added.) Although, as defendant argues, <em>his motivation </em>was to avoid jail time on the unrelated case, his further claim that the authorities promised consideration on the unrelated case in return for information on the Weeden case is unavailing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Similarly, no promises of immunity were made as to the Weeden case. At the beginning of the interview, defendant said he did not want to be arrested and jailed immediately for telling them \u201cthings that somebody else might not know.\u201d He stated, \u201cI know I can\u2019t get charged with murder because I didn\u2019t do it, a, immunity that way, <em>I\u2019m not really worried about it, immunity </em>that anything, see if I was to come up with some information that not very many people should know, I don\u2019t want that used against me, saying I did it just because I know that.\u201d (Italics added.) The district attorney informed defendant that immunity had \u201cnot been granted to you,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019re not being offered immunity,\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t have the power to give you immunity anyway, you understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Defendant replied, \u201cI understand that, but I don\u2019t wanna be thrown in jail for an accessory that I had nothing to do with, j\u2014just because ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201c[CARLTON]: <em>Okay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I happened to walk in on something, there\u2019s no reason I should have to go to jail for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201c[CARLTON]: <em>Okay, </em>I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not questioning that, what I\u2019m trying to talk to you about is, there has been some mention of, of immunity in this case and immunity has <em>not </em>been granted and you <em>don\u2019t have </em>immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201c[DEFENDANT]: [Inaudible], <em>I realize that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201c[CARLTON]: And if a, if it ever came to be, that we wanted to give you immunity, we\u2019d have to hear what you had to say and we\u2019d have to evaluate and investigate to determine whether we thought it was truthful or not. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201c[CARLTON]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: So I have nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201c[CARLTON]: Well, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not saying that. . . I\u2019m not saying that you, a, that immunity won\u2019t sometime be offered to you, but immunity would never be offered to you until we knew what we were getting.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Focusing on isolated fragments of the conversation, defendant argues that the district attorney implicitly assured defendant twice that the information would not be used against him. Twice, when defendant stated his desire that the volunteered information would not be used against him, the district attorney merely prefaced his responses with \u201cOkay.\u201d We fail to see how that phrase equates to such an agreement, especially in light of Carlton\u2019s express and repeated statements that immunity was <em>not </em>being granted at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Finally, defendant contends that the district attorney engaged in \u201cunethical conduct\u201d by violating then rule 7-103 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct, which provided, in pertinent part, that \u201cA member of the State Bar shall not communicate directly or indirectly with a party whom he knows to be represented by counsel <em>upon a subject of controversy </em>without the express consent of such counsel. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) However, defendant was represented by counsel only on an unrelated charge and not on the Weeden murder.  (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 494, 527 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 779, 862 P.2d 779] [Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \u201coffense-specific,\u201d i.e., it attaches only to those offenses for which adversary judicial criminal proceedings have begun].) He fails to establish the applicability of the rule to the district attorney\u2019s conduct or how an alleged breach of the ethical rule affected the verdict. Indeed, we fail to see how admission of defendant\u2019s statements \u201cseriously undermined his defense,\u201d as defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>claims, since his extrajudicial statements to the police formed the evidentiary basis for his defense that Morris killed Weeden.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">c. <em>Admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements to Dr. Cur\u00edale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Defendant claims that the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting certain statements that he made to Dr. Cur\u00edale, a psychologist with the Department of Corrections, on the grounds that they were made involuntarily and were privileged (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1012). Dr. Cur\u00edale interviewed defendant on October 23 and 30, 1987. At trial, defendant objected to admission of all of his statements during the interviews on the ground that they were made involuntarily and were more prejudicial than probative, under Evidence Code section 352. After an evidentiary hearing, which included a review of the entire taped interviews, the trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntarily made. It made the following findings: \u201cI think [defendant] voluntarily put himself in the position of being interrogated, with full knowledge that he was waiving his rights, and he fully understood what Dr. Curiale\u2019s position was and what her intentions were, and he demonstrated that constantly throughout the tapes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The trial court ruled that, under Evidence Code section 352, portions of the interviews were irrelevant and playing the entire tapes would be time-consuming. It instructed the prosecutor to edit the tapes. The court allowed the jury to hear limited portions of the taped interviews and admitted an edited transcript of those limited portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">After reviewing the record, we find that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntarily made. It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s statements to Dr. Cur\u00edale were made during noncustodial interviews. At the evidentiary hearing, Detective Newsome testified that during a September 29, 1987, interview with defendant at his brother\u2019s house, defendant initiated a discussion about talking to a psychiatrist and said he would be willing to talk to one if the police made the arrangements and payment. At another interview on October 5, defendant offered to talk to a psychiatrist again. When the police accused defendant of the murders and asked if he needed help, defendant denied that he killed anyone, declared that they could not prove it, and encouraged Detective Newsome to find \u201cthe best criminal psychologist or psychiatrist\u201d because he or she would say defendant was \u201cnot capable of these things.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>also challenged Detective Newsome to \u201ctake [him] to a jury trial to prove that [he] did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The police asked Dr. Cur\u00edale to interview defendant to assist them in determining if defendant committed the crimes and in obtaining information, evidence, or, if possible, a confession from defendant. On October 23, 1987, defendant met Dr. Cur\u00edale and Detective Newsome at the lobby of the Shasta Inn, but then spoke with Dr. Cur\u00edale alone. At the beginning of the interview, defendant stated: \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me that . . . things that I can say, can will be used against me and maybe you\u2019re not going to read me my rights, but you are going to advise me of the fact that whatever information you might get from me will be used against me and these will be turned over to the police whether it turns up people or not. I already know all that. I, I don\u2019t have to be here talking to you.\u201d Dr. Cur\u00edale responded, \u201cRight,\u201d and emphasized that, because she was working for law enforcement, the privilege and confidentiality \u201crests with them.\u201d Defendant replied that he understood. Also, at some point, defendant commented that the interview was probably being taped. Before the interview ended, they agreed to meet again.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On October 30, 1987, defendant met Dr. Cur\u00edale in the same lobby. During the interview, Dr. Cur\u00edale commented that defendant had not told her anything more than what she had read in the police reports or newspapers. Defendant responded, \u201cI told you the first time I met you that I would never tell you anything that I knew would be a mistake or could get me thrown in jail . . . there\u2019s no way that I\u2019m gonna ever tell you anything that you\u2019re gonna be able to use to throw me in prison, I have not lied to you in that respect.\u201d When Dr. Cur\u00edale responded, \u201cNo you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ve been very consistent in that, but I\u2019m not interested in what gets you to prison,\u201d defendant expressed his skepticism by stating, \u201cSure you are, because whatever I tell you, you\u2019ll tell them, now if I was to hire you, and a, or the County was to hire you on my behalf or whatever and the anonymity and everything laid with between us, well then, you know, might be a different story. But right now, they\u2019re pulling your strings, not me and not the County, well I guess in a way the County, but like a mental health program.\u201d Detective Newsome and Dr. Cur\u00edale testified that defendant ended both interviews himself and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Thus, the evidence reflects that defendant offered to talk with a psychologist, voluntarily met with Dr. Cur\u00edale twice, knew that he was not required to talk with her, was not in custody during the interviews, and was free to end the interview and leave at any time, which he did. Even though he understood that his statements were not confidential, would be related to the police, and could be used against him, defendant freely spoke with Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Cur\u00edale. <em>(People v. Henderson </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 86, 97-98 [137 Cal.Rptr. 1, 560 P.2d 1180].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Nevertheless, defendant claims that his statements were involuntary because (1) he was intoxicated by marijuana during the interviews, (2) Dr. Cur\u00edale used psychological manipulation to coerce his incriminating statements, and (3) law enforcement coerced defendant into seeing a psychologist by harassing him and his family. The evidence reflects otherwise. Regarding the intoxication allegation, both Dr. Cur\u00edale (who saw and heard defendant during the interviews) and Detectives Newsome and Mundy (who overheard defendant during the interviews) testified that he did not appear to be under the influence of a drug, that he appeared to understand the questions asked of him, that he responded and asked questions appropriately, and that his conversations were coherent and intelligent. Although defendant smoked a cigarette that he said was marijuana during the October 30, 1987, interview, Dr. Cur\u00edale stated that his behavior did not change after smoking it. Moreover, absent state coercion, defendant cannot complain that any self-induced intoxication rendered his statements involuntary. (See <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 163 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 519-520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Regarding the psychological manipulation claim, although the evidence reflects that Dr. Cur\u00edale tried to trick defendant into admitting his guilt, defendant recognized the attempted ruse and refused to succumb to any deception. In an attempt to get more information from defendant, Dr. Cur\u00edale represented that she was \u201coff duty,\u201d implying that she was no longer working for the police. Also, Dr. Cur\u00edale attempted to elicit incriminating evidence by comparing defendant to a notorious killer who had received much publicity and by promising that defendant would be in her book. As the trial court correctly found, the evidence reflects that defendant did not believe her and was not influenced by Dr. Cur\u00edale\u2019s techniques. Deception does not necessarily invalidate an incriminating statement. <em>(People v. Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 167; see also <em>Illinois v. Perkins </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 292, 297 [110 S.Ct. 2394, 2397, 110 L.Ed.2d 243] [\u201cmere strategic deception\u201d not coercive].) \u201cThe courts have prohibited only those psychological ploys which, under all the circumstances, are so coercive that they tend to produce a statement that is both involuntary and unreliable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ray, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 340.) In this case, Dr. Cur\u00edale\u2019s ploys do not fall into that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Regarding defendant\u2019s harassment claim, there is conflicting evidence. Defendant\u2019s brother testified that Detectives Newsome and Mundy repeatedly accused defendant of being gay, illiterate, and a mass murderer, and having a split personality. On the other hand, although the detectives told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>defendant and his family they believed he was guilty of one or more of the murders, they denied making the first three accusations. With respect to this conflicting testimony, we must accept that version of events which is most favorable to the People, to the extent that it is supported by the record. <em>(People v. Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 166.) On the other hand, the detectives admitted that they considered the possibility that defendant may have had a split personality (\u201cgood Bob/bad Bob\u201d) and may have mentioned that possibility to defendant and his family. Even if the police had mentioned to defendant and his family of their belief in a \u201cgood Bob/bad Bob,\u201d this does not amount to official coercion. Defendant initiated the topic of a psychiatrist and offered to talk to one for the purpose of exonerating himself. Indeed, during the interview, he repeatedly denied any responsibility for the murders, in accordance with his planned purpose. Thus, defendant\u2019s will was not overborne when he spoke to Dr. Cur\u00edale. <em>(Lynumn v. Illinois, </em>supra, 372 U.S. at p. 534 [83 S.Ct. at pp. 920-921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On the claim of privilege, because defendant failed to object to admission of his statements on this ground, it is forfeited. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 448 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 853 P.2d 992]; <em>People v. Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 49 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534, 23 A.L.R.4th 776].) In any event, the claim is meritless. The evidence is uncontradicted that the purpose of Dr. Cur\u00edale and the police for the interview was to obtain information and evidence from defendant, and <em>not </em>to conduct psychological treatment or a psychological evaluation or render a diagnosis. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henderson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 97-98; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabral </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 820, 826-828 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 866].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finally, even if defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary, their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279 [111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302]; <em>People v. Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 509-510 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].) Although the taped statements were lengthy, the prosecution admitted only limited portions of the interviews. During the edited version, which the jury heard, defendant stated that he had \u201cno conscience,\u201d and that, although he did not serve in Vietnam, he wanted to \u201crape, bum, pillage, kill\u201d the Viet Cong. He commented that the Secret Witness program \u201cbred crime by paying people to turn in bodies\u201d and that \u201ca person could almost make a living by killing people and later turning in their bodies for the reward.\u201d At the end of the interview, defendant pulled out what appeared to be a boot string from his pocket and told Dr. Cur\u00edale that she should have searched his coat while she had the chance because it would have given her insight into who he was. However, defendant steadfastly denied any responsibility for the murders and offered no information about them. Given the overwhelming evidence against defendant, admission of his statements was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>d. <em>Admissibility of polygraph evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Defendant challenges the exclusion of evidence that he passed a polygraph examination. According to defendant\u2019s offer of proof, he \u201cpassed\u201d the polygraph test regarding the death of Weeden. He argued that evidence of the test results was relevant to identify Weeden\u2019s murderer and he sought to introduce the polygraph evidence to support his extrajudicial statements that someone else killed Weeden. Defendant requested an evidentiary hearing to establish the \u201cvalidity\u201d of the polygraph examination and the examiner\u2019s \u201cexpert qualification.\u201d Relying on Evidence Code section 351.1, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing. Defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to present a defense and call favorable witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Evidence Code section 351.1 provides that the results of a polygraph examination or the opinion of a polygraph examiner \u201cshall not be admitted into evidence in any criminal proceeding . . . unless all parties stipulate to the admission of such results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Here, the trial court properly excluded the expert testimony regarding defendant\u2019s polygraph examination. Excluding such evidence does not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer </em>(1998) 523 U.S. 303, 312 [118 S.Ct. 1261, 1266, 140 L.Ed.2d 413] [per se military rule excluding all polygraph evidence in court-martial proceedings does not abridge defendant\u2019s Fifth or Sixth Amendment right to present defense].) In finding that a per se rule excluding all polygraph evidence was not arbitrary or disproportionate in promoting the legitimate interest of ensuring that only reliable evidence is introduced at trial, the high court stated: \u201d[T]here is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable. To this day, the scientific community remains extremely polarized about the reliability of polygraph techniques.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 309 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1265] .) \u201cThis lack of scientific consensus is reflected in the disagreement among state and federal courts concerning both the admissibility and the reliability of polygraph evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 310-311 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1265], fn. omitted.) Implicit in the Legislature\u2019s passage of Evidence Code section 351.1 is the conclusion that \u201c[L]ie detector tests themselves are not considered reliable enough to have probative value.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 764 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].) A per se rule excluding polygraph evidence is a \u201crational and proportional means of advancing the legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence.\u201d <em>(Scheffer, supra, </em>at p. 312 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1266] .)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Moreover, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, his defense was not significantly impaired by exclusion of the polygraph examination results. Although defendant <em>chose </em>not to testify, exclusion of the polygraph evidence did not preclude him from introducing any factual evidence of the charged offense and did not prohibit him from testifying on his own behalf. <em>(United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. atpp. 316-317 [118 S.Ct. atpp. 1268-1269]; see also <em>People v. Espinoza </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 806, 818 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 838 P.2d 204] [exclusion under Evid. Code, \u00a7 351.1 of defendant\u2019s offer to take a polygraph test did not violate due process; defendant was not foreclosed from effectively challenging prosecution\u2019s case or from presenting crucial exculpatory evidence].) Rather, defendant was barred merely from introducing expert opinion testimony to bolster his own credibility, in support of his extrajudicial statements. <em>(Scheffer, supra, </em>at p. 317.) \u201cA polygraph is not so crucial that its absence precludes a defendant from mounting a defense.\u201d <em>(In re Aontae D. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 167, 175 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 176].)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In <em>People v. Wilkinson </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 72 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 294], review granted December 11, 2002, SI 11028, we will decide whether Evidence Code section 351.1\u2019s exclusion of polygraph evidence is absolute or whether a defendant, on a proper showing, is entitled to a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>hearing regarding the admissibility of proposed defense polygraph evidence. <em>(People v. Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24, 30-32 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]; <em>Frye v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 293 Fed. 1013, 1014 [34 A.L.R. 145].) Even if the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test remains applicable to polygraph evidence notwithstanding the enactment of Evidence Code section 351.1, we note that defendant\u2019s offer of proof was woefully inadequate. He failed to present an offer of proof that polygraph evidence was generally accepted in the scientific community. <em>(People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 264 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3]; <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164, 1212 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 49, 920 P.2d 1254]; <em>People v. Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1122 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36].) Defendant merely asserted that he would proffer evidence of the \u201ccompetency\u201d of the polygraph examination results, without saying what that evidence was or what he specifically sought to show. Thus, he is in \u201c \u2018 \u201cno position to assign error in the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>at p. 1212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">3. <em>Alleged Ineffectiveness of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Defendant contends that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance for (1) failing to object to evidence of Landreth\u2019s voice identification of defendant as the Weeden case Secret Witness caller, (2) failing to request a cautionary jury instruction relating to voice identifications, (3) failing to object to hearsay statements, and (4) failing to object to Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony. These contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>a. <em>Failure to object to preliminary hearing voice identification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">At the preliminary hearing, defendant cross-examined Landreth while acting as his own cocounsel. At trial, Landreth testified that at the preliminary hearing, she recognized defendant\u2019s voice as the same person who had called the Secret Witness program in regard to Weeden, \u201cOlsten,\u201d and Berryhill. There was no objection to this testimony. Defendant argues that counsel should have objected because Landreth\u2019s voice identification at the preliminary hearing (which she made \u201conly to herself\u2019) was unreliable and the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. The Attorney General responds that because the identification procedure during the preliminary hearing was not unduly suggestive and Landreth\u2019s voice identification of defendant was reliable, counsel was not required to object since an objection would have been futile. We need not decide the merits of the claim because the record reveals that counsel\u2019s failure to object to testimony regarding Landreth\u2019s voice identification can reasonably be attributed to a choice of trial tactics because it was not critical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In 1985, Landreth spoke with the Secret Witness caller about the Weeden case at least six times. On September 11, 1986, Landreth received a telephone call from someone she recognized as the same person who had made the 1985 Secret Witness calls. The caller gave her information regarding an unrelated burglary and revealed his name. Landreth recalled that the caller may have said, \u201cWell, this is Bob\u201d or may have said his name was \u201cRobert Maury.\u201d A week later, on September 19, the same person called again, this time asking Landreth for immunity on the Weeden case. She realized that the September 11 caller, who identified himself as \u201cBob\u201d or \u201cRobert Maury,\u201d was the same person as the Weeden case Secret Witness caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In August 1987, Landreth began receiving a series of telephone calls from the same caller regarding the location of \u201cOlsten\u2019s\u201d body. Landreth recognized that the voice belonged to the same person as the caller on the Weeden case and the unrelated burglary. She taped one of the telephone calls and played it for Detective Mundy to confirm that the voice belonged to the same Robert Maury whom she had spoken to before. Detective Mundy confirmed Robert Maury was the person on the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">During closing argument, defense counsel repeatedly attacked as unreliable Landreth\u2019s recognition of defendant\u2019s voice during the series of telephone calls. Thus, the record indicates that counsel believed that Landreth\u2019s recognition of defendant\u2019s voice in 1985 to 1987 was the critical evidence, and <em>not </em>her voice identification at the preliminary hearing.  Whether to object to arguably inadmissible evidence is a tactical decision; because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>trial counsel\u2019s tactical decisions are accorded substantial deference, failure to object seldom establishes counsel\u2019s incompetence. <em>(People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1121 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1].) We cannot say that counsel\u2019s decision not to object to evidence of Landreth\u2019s preliminary hearing voice identification was not a legitimate tactical choice. <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 841, 844 [76 Cal.Rptr. 242] [failure to object to lineup procedure may have been legitimate tactical decision].)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In addition, because other independent evidence established that defendant was the Weeden case Secret Witness caller, counsel\u2019s failure to object to Landreth\u2019s preliminary-hearing voice identification was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">b. <em>Failure to request cautionary instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Defendant claims that counsel was incompetent for failing, to request a pinpoint instruction for Landreth\u2019s preliminary-hearing voice identification, similar to CALJIC No. 2.92 (eyewitness identification). Because her voice identification was not crucial evidence, the failure to give a cautionary instruction as to that evidence was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">c. <em>Failure to object to hearsay statements of Morris</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Bill Chartier, Weeden\u2019s brother, testified that Morris related that he saw Weeden riding off with defendant, on the back of defendant\u2019s motorcycle, and \u201cthat\u2019s the last time she was ever seen.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to this testimony. Defendant now claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Morris\u2019s hearsay statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Here, given the overwhelming evidence establishing defendant\u2019s guilt of the Weeden murder, it is not reasonably probable that a determination more favorable to defendant would have resulted, in the absence of counsel\u2019s omission. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 694 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2068].) The evidence reflected that defendant was the Secret Witness caller regarding all three murder victims. He knew the location of the bodies of the victims and used this information for financial gain. In addition, defendant made numerous admissions regarding Weeden\u2019s death to Landreth, Detective Ashmun, Detective Mundy, and various acquaintances, and gave several conflicting stories to Chartier regarding Weeden after her disappearance. Defendant argues that Morris\u2019s hearsay statement was the only direct evidence that rebutted defendant\u2019s assertion that Morris killed Weeden. Not so. In the spring of 1987, after he had told Detective Mundy that Morris killed Weeden, defendant declared that Detective Mundy \u201cwould never really know what happened to Averill Weeden\u201d and that Mundy would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>take her death to his grave. Because defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the issue of deficient performance need not be reached. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">d. <em>Failure to object to Jacqueline H. \u2019s testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Defendant contends that defense counsel were incompetent for failing to object to Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony on the ground that her testimony was coerced by the district attorney, in violation of his right to due process. Analogizing to accomplice testimony cases, defendant claims that Jacqueline H. agreed to testify in conformity with her preliminary hearing testimony in return for benefits promised by the district attorney. The evidence fails to support his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201c1 \u201c[A] defendant is denied a fair trial if the prosecution\u2019s case depends substantially on accomplice testimony and the accomplice witness is placed, either by the prosecution or the court, under a strong compulsion to testify in a particular fashion.\u201d [Citation.] Thus, when the accomplice is granted immunity subject to the condition that his testimony substantially conform to an earlier statement given to police [citation], or that his testimony result in defendant\u2019s conviction [citation], the accomplice\u2019s testimony is \u201ctainted beyond redemption\u201d [citation] and its admission denies defendant a fair trial. On the other hand, although there is a certain degree of compulsion inherent in any plea agreement or grant of immunity, it is clear that an agreement requiring only that the witness testify fully and truthfully is valid.\u2019 (Fn. omitted.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Badgett </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 330, 358 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 635, 895 P.2d 877].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">At trial, the district attorney asked Jacqueline H. if any promises were made to her in return for her testimony. Jacqueline H. replied, \u201cI have been offered nothing. . . . Except for not having to do time in jail, in the same jail with [defendant].\u201d At the time of trial, a burglary charge and bad check charge were pending against Jacqueline H. Both crimes had occurred and, obviously, both charges had been filed after Jacqueline H.\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony in which she testified that defendant had raped her. Jacqueline H.\u2019s attorney, representing her on both criminal cases, confirmed that the district attorney promised only that Jacqueline H. would not serve any time in the same jail with defendant in return for her testimony. Thus, the district attorney\u2019s promise was not conditioned on Jacqueline H. testifying in a particular fashion or on the testimony\u2019s achieving a particular result.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Moreover, unlike the accomplice cases, there was not \u201ca certain degree of compulsion\u201d inherent in Jacqueline H.\u2019s agreement with the district attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>She did not avoid prosecution or receive a favorable criminal disposition in exchange for her testimony. Instead, as the Attorney General points out, Jacqueline H. was simply receiving an express assurance that the prosecution would make every effort to protect her from her assailant, an assurance any victim would reasonably expect from the prosecution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Nothing about the agreement was improperly coercive. Thus, counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony on that ground. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gurule </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 617 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 345, 51 P.3d 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">4. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed various acts of misconduct during both the guilt and penalty phases, including misconduct during opening and closing arguments and introducing inflammatory and prejudicial evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, he did not object to any of these instances at trial.  Because an objection could have cured any harm, the contentions are not cognizable on appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Hillhouse, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Defendant argues that there was no waiver because objections would have been futile. We have reviewed the comments defendant cites and find no pervasive misconduct indicating the futility of objecting. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill-house, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 501-502; <em>People v. Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1212-1213 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969].) Many of the prosecutors\u2019 comments were fair inferences drawn from the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 700 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640].)  Moreover, the prosecutors\u2019 use of \u201cI believe\u201d before their argument that death was the appropriate penalty was not an improper injection of their personal beliefs, but simply a permissible \u201crhetorical device\u201d to urge the jury, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to return a verdict of death. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 722 [\u201c T think,\u2019 \u201d preceding the argument that defendant should \u201c \u2018have no recourse to our sympathies,\u2019 \u201d did not improperly inject prosecutor\u2019s personal beliefs into the argument].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Regarding some of the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct, defendant claims defense counsel were ineffective for not objecting.  However, deciding whether to object is inherently tactical, and the failure to object will rarely establish ineffective assistance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill-house, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 502; <em>People v. Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1223 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].) As we explain, this is not one of those rare cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">First, defendant claims that defense counsel should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cserial killer theme\u201d during the opening and closing arguments in which the prosecutor often improperly referred to the crimes as \u201cmurders,\u201d to the perpetrator as a \u201ckiller,\u201d to the murders as part of a series of killings by the same person, and to defendant as a \u201cserial killer.\u201d These references appear to be apt descriptions of the crime and the person who committed them. <em>(People v. Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 840 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436] [use of the word \u201cexecution\u201d was an apt description of the crime].) Moreover, counsel could have reasonably concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments, as well as his characterizations of the defense expert\u2019s testimony, were fair inferences drawn from the evidence. Thus, counsel cannot be faulted for failing to object. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 387 [counsel not ineffective for failing to make fiitile objections].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Second, defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly introduced various statements defendant made to Landreth, the police, Dr. Cur\u00edale, and Shelley Sly, and that defense counsel was incompetent for failing to object to these statements as inflammatory and prejudicial, improperly reinforcing the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cserial killer theme.\u201d However, these statements were parts of interviews or conversations in which defendant made admissions establishing consciousness of guilt or made false statements as part of his attempt to evade detection and deceive the police. Evidence Code section 356 permits introduction of statements \u201con the \u2018same subject\u2019 \u201d or which are necessary for the understanding of the statements already introduced. <em>(People v. Breaux </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 281, 302 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 821 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>585].) The isolated statements defendant cites were themselves either admissions or necessary to understand the context of defendant\u2019s admissions, and were relevant to show a culpable state of mind. Thus, counsel could reasonably have chosen not to object to the evidence or to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to such evidence during argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Third, defendant faults defense counsel for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comparison of defendant to Nazi leaders Adolf Eichmann (during closing argument at the guilt phase) and Adolf Hitler (during closing argument at the penalty phase). However, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cone of the main executioners at a Nazi concentration camp,\u201d without reference to a specific name, was made only to point out that multiple murderers can look like \u201ccommon, ordinary looking\u201d people, such as defendant. <em>(People v. Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 180 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960] [prosecutor\u2019s references to notorious murderers who committed heinous crimes for irrational purposes but apparently were legally sane was not misconduct], overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 823, in. 1 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].) Nor did the prosecutor refer to Hitler by name or compare defendant to Hitler. He simply noted that the anniversary of the beginning of World War II fell on that day of trial and argued that defendant \u201cwaged a war on society and society had to struggle back,\u201d as it did during World War II. The prosecutor did not suggest that the offenses charged against defendant were as heinous as those committed by Eichmann or Hitler. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 180.) Counsel was not incompetent for failing to object. <em>(People v. Harpool </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 877, 886 [202 Cal.Rptr. 467] [counsel is not required to make futile objections or motions merely to create a record impregnable to assault for claimed inadequacy of counsel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Fourth, defendant claims that, during the penalty phase closing argument, the prosecutor improperly argued that defendant \u201cforfeited his right to sympathy and redemption.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the prosecutor did not tell the jury it <em>could </em>not consider sympathy, but properly argued that under the facts of the case, defendant does not <em>deserve </em>sympathy.  \u201cAlthough a jury is entitled to consider sympathy in its penalty determination\u2014and it would be improper to suggest otherwise [citation]\u2014 the jury is not <em>required </em>to feel sympathy for murderers. The prosecution may properly argue that the particular facts do not warrant sympathy; the defense may properly argue the opposite.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 840.) Again, counsel was not incompetent for failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the three murders were not \u201cclose\u201d cases. Rather, the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. Any reasonable jury would have reached the same verdicts in the absence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct. <em>(People v. Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 214 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">5. <em>Instructional Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjN2\">a. <em>Duress instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">At trial, defendant claimed that he struck Weeden with a rock under duress because he feared that Morris would shoot him if he did not do so. The trial court instructed that \u201cA person is not guilty of a crime when he engages in conduct, otherwise criminal, when acting under threats and menaces under the following circumstances: [f] 1. Where the threats and menaces are such that they would cause a reasonable person to fear that his life would be in immediate danger if he did not engage in the conduct charged and [^j] 2. If such person then believed that his life was so endangered.\u201d (See CALJIC No. 4.40 (5th ed. 1988).) The court also instructed that such threats are not a defense \u201c[w]here a person commits a crime punishable with death\u201d and that \u201c[a] first degree murder with a special circumstance is a crime punishable with death.\u201d (See CALJIC No. 4.41 (5th ed. 1988).)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendant contends that the limitation in CALJIC No. 4.41 deprived him of a duress defense to the Weeden murder, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and his right to due process. He argues that the multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation permitted classifying the Weeden homicide as a crime punishable by death under section 26 and that, had he been tried separately on that charge before the deaths of Berryhill and Stark, he would have been entitled to a duress defense without limitation. However, duress is not a defense to <em>any </em>murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 767, 770, 780 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 587, 50 P.3d 368].) Because the instructions were unduly <em>favorable </em>to defendant, he cannot complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Although duress cannot reduce murder to manslaughter by negating malice <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 770, 781-784), the court nevertheless gave instructions that authorized the jury to consider the effect of threats on the mental states requisite to murder and manslaughter. The jury was told that to establish that a killing is murder, the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the \u201cact which caused the death was not done . . . in a killing punishable by death, in the honest belief in the necessity to protect oneself against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, whether or not that belief was reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d It was farther told that \u201cthere is no malice aforethought in a killing punishable by death if the killing occurred in the honest belief in the necessity to protect oneself against imminent peril to life or great bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>injury, whether or not that belief was reasonable or unreasonable\u201d and that, in such instance, the offense is voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. Again, because the instructions were unduly <em>favorable </em>to defendant, he cannot complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Although defendant was deprived of the complete defense of duress, he was permitted to use the same underlying facts to mitigate the crime. Thus, in finding defendant guilty of murdering Weeden, the jury necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s duress defense. <em>(People v. Beardslee </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 86-87 [279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311]; <em>People v. Sede\u00f1o </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 721 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913], overruled on other grounds <em>in People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 149 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">b. <em>Unanimity instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court was required to instruct sua sponte in the language of CALJIC No. 17.01 that, before finding defendant guilty of the murder of Weeden, the jurors had to agree unanimously on the act or acts that caused her death. He claims that the instruction was mandatory because the evidence reflected that Weeden\u2019s death could have resulted from either strangulation or being hit on the head with a rock, or from the combination of both injuries. We reject that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The medical examiner testified that Weeden\u2019s death was caused by strangulation, a blow to the head, or a combination of both injuries. Initially, defendant called the Secret Witness program and told Landreth that \u201cBob\u201d strangled Weeden with a nylon clothesline on a trail and dragged her body to the location where it was found. In a later telephone call to Landreth, defendant repeated that information, but added that she had been hit with a rock to ensure her death. Defendant later told the police that Morris strangled Weeden to death with a rope, that Morris dumped her body in the woods, and that he threw rocks at her body even though she was already dead. Still later, defendant told the police that although Morris strangled Weeden, he forced defendant to strike her on the head with a rock. Defendant was not sure if Weeden was dead when he struck her. The prosecution\u2019s theory was that defendant killed Weeden by strangulation or a combination of strangulation and a blow to the head. The defendant\u2019s theory was that he did not strangle Weeden, but, under duress, merely struck her with a rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">A requirement of jury unanimity typically applies to acts that could have been charged as separate offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1025 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]; <em>People v. Beardslee, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>53 Cal.3d at p. 92.) A unanimity instruction is required only if the jurors could otherwise disagree which act a defendant committed and yet convict him of the crime charged. <em>(Beardslee, supra, </em>at p. 93.) Here, the evidence did not reflect multiple independent acts, any of which could have led to Weeden\u2019s death. Rather, the evidence showed that the ligature strangulation contributed, at least in part, to her death. The prosecution contended that defendant committed both acts and that Weeden\u2019s death was caused by strangulation or strangulation in combination with the blow to the head. Defendant did not contest that Weeden\u2019s death was caused, at least in part, by the strangulation. Instead, he claimed that a man named Morris strangled her and that Morris forced him to throw a rock at her. Thus, the two theories were based on a continuous course of conduct, whose acts were so closely connected in time as to form part of one transaction. <em>(People v. Crandell </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 833, 875 [251 Cal.Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Crayton </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 346, 364-365 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 580, 48 P.3d 1136]; <em>People v. Dominick </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1174, 1208 [227 Cal.Rptr. 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Defendant argues that a unanimity instruction was necessary because some jurors might have decided that defendant strangled Weeden, while others might have determined that he inflicted a death blow to the head without strangling her. However, even if some of the jurors believed that defendant strangled Weeden, they would have concluded that he was the actual perpetrator. If some jurors believed that defendant only threw a rock at Weeden\u2019s head after she was already dead, they would have found no causation. But if some of the jurors believed that defendant only threw a rock at Weeden while she was still alive, while rejecting a duress defense, they would have concluded that he was an aider and abettor. Thus, defendant\u2019s conduct as an aider and abettor or as a direct perpetrator could result only in one criminal act and one charge. <em>(People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1025.) \u201cUnder these circumstances, \u2018[j]urors need not unanimously agree on whether the defendant is an aider and abettor or a principal even when different evidence and facts support such conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1025-1026; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 931 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93] [two theories that defendant was the actual perpetrator and aider and abettor were based on a single course of conduct]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beardslee, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 93 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">c. <em>Reasonable but mistaken belief in consent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct, sua sponte, on the defense of reasonable and good faith mistake of fact regarding a person\u2019s consent to sexual intercourse (CALJIC No. 10.65; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>People v. Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 153-158 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337]). Our review of the record shows no substantial evidence to trigger a sua sponte obligation to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u201cThe <em>Mayberry </em>defense has two components, one subjective, and one objective. The subjective component asks whether the defendant honestly and in good faith, albeit mistakenly, believed that the victim consented to sexual intercourse. In order to satisfy this component, a defendant must adduce evidence of the victim\u2019s equivocal conduct on the basis of which he erroneously believed there was consent. [|] In addition, the defendant must satisfy the objective component, which asks whether the defendant\u2019s mistake regarding consent was reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, regardless of how strongly a defendant may subjectively believe a person has consented to sexual intercourse, that belief must be formed under circumstances society will tolerate as reasonable in order for the defendant to have adduced substantial evidence giving rise to a <em>Mayberry </em>instruction.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 354, 360-361 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 841 P.2d 961], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">A trial court\u2019s duty to instruct, sua sponte, on particular defenses arises \u201c \u2018only if it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense, or if there is substantial evidence supportive of such a defense and the defense is not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 195 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531], citing <em>People v. Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 716; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhoades </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1362, 1367 [238 Cal.Rptr. 909]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1156 [215 Cal.Rptr. 634].) Here, defendant concedes that he did not rely at trial on the defense of mistake of fact. Rather, defendant contends that the prosecution\u2019s evidence supported such a defense and that the defense was consistent with his theory of the case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed that Jacqueline H. agreed to accompany defendant only after defendant tricked her by saying that her friend was having a party and offering to take her there. After defendant drove her to a deserted area, Jacqueline H. became scared and asked defendant to take her home. Defendant then placed and tightened a rope around her neck, and demanded that she take off her clothes. Defendant then ordered her to lie down and raped her. A defendant relying on a <em>Mayberry </em>defense must produce some evidence of the victim\u2019s equivocal conduct that led him reasonably to believe she consented to the act. <em>(People v. Bruce </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1099, 1104 [256 Cal.Rptr. 647]; <em>People v. Romero, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 1156.) However, here, we see <em>no </em>substantial evidence of the victim\u2019s \u201cequivocal conduct that would have led a defendant to reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and in good faith believe consent existed where it did not.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Moreover, defendant offered <em>no </em>evidence showing he believed that Jacqueline H. had consented to sexual intercourse. To warrant a court\u2019s giving CALJIC No. 10.65, the record must contain evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, of the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time the offense was committed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Simmons </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 573, 581 [261 Cal.Rptr. 760]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhoades, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1369.) Defendant did not testify. He presented neither circumstantial evidence of his state of mind at the time of the offense nor evidence that controverted the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the circumstances of the offense. Instead, defendant presented only evidence of Jacqueline H.\u2019s dishonest character, drug addiction, and motive to lie. During closing argument, he argued that Jacqueline H. lied about the rape and surrounding events, and suffered from drug-induced paranoia at the time of the offense. Indeed, defendant never admitted that he engaged in sex with Jacqueline H., consensual or otherwise. <em>(See People v. Gonzalez </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 786, 793 [190 Cal.Rptr. 554] <em>[Mayberry </em>instruction need not be given sua sponte if defendant does not testify and the \u201conly \u2018evidence\u2019 concerning his belief was his counsel\u2019s theory [mistake of fact] in closing argument\u201d].) Thus, an instruction on the defense of reasonable but mistaken belief in consent would have been inconsistent with defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Accordingly, under these circumstances, the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on the <em>Mayberry </em>defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhoades, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1369 [no sua sponte duty to give <em>Mayberry </em>instruction where \u201c[defendant\u2019s counsel never suggested he was relying on the mistake of fact defense, tendered no evidence to support such a defense, and did not request the instruction defendant now claims it was error to withhold\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">d. <em>Reasonableness of fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Defendant claims that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct sua sponte on an \u201cessential element of the rape charge,\u201d that Jacqueline H.\u2019s fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury had to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">We rejected a similar claim in <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366]. There, the defendant argued that the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury as to the requisite force or fear as necessary elements of the crime of robbery. We responded as follows: \u201c[Defendant] does not, however, challenge the content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>robbery instructions given, nor did he request any additional instructions at the trial, [f] Defendant\u2019s contention essentially is that the instructions given needed amplification or explanation; but since he did not request such amplification or explanation, error cannot now be predicated upon the trial court\u2019s failure to give them on its own motion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Similarly, here, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the general principles of law governing the rape charge. In giving CALJIC No. 10.00 (5th ed. 1988), the trial court instructed on the specific elements of rape, including the requirement that the act of sexual intercourse \u201cwas accomplished by means of force, violence, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since the instruction given did not omit or withdraw an element from the jury\u2019s determination, defendant was required to request an additional or clarifying instruction if he believed that the instruction was incomplete or needed elaboration. <em>(People v. Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 669 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351]; <em>People v. Bell </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 502, 550 [262 Cal.Rptr. 1, 778 P.2d 129].) This he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Moreover, the failure to give a clarifying instruction could not have affected the outcome. Given Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony that she was alone and \u201cscared to death\u201d when defendant tightened the rope around her neck and forced her to disrobe and lie down, it is inconceivable that the jury would have determined that Jacqueline H.\u2019s fear, before and during the sexual assault, was unreasonable. In addition, the evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding that the rape was accomplished by the other alternative means of force and violence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">e. <em>Variance between information and rape instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The amended information charged defendant with \u201cFORCIBLE RAPE, in violation of Section 261(2) of the Penal Code, a felony\u201d and alleged that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>committed the willful and unlawful act of sexual intercourse \u201cby means of force and fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d The jury was instructed that it could find defendant guilty of rape by determining that he had accomplished the act of sexual intercourse \u201cby means of force, violence, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d Defendant claims that his Sixth Amendment right to notice and his right to due process were violated because the jury might have convicted him of an uncharged offense, rape by means of violence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">First, defendant has forfeited his right to object to an alleged variance between the pleading and the proof by failing to raise the objection in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 60, 66 [228 P.2d 835], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Collins </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 57, 60 [4 Cal.Rptr. 158, 351 P.2d 326].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Second, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, rape by means of violence is <em>not </em>a different offense from rape by means of force or fear; these terms merely describe different circumstances under which an act of intercourse may constitute the crime of rape. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Third, defendant has failed to show or even assert that he was prejudiced by the variance. <em>(People v. Thomas </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 818, 828, 830 [239 Cal.Rptr. 307, 740 P.2d 419].)  \u201cThe test of the materiality of variance in an information is whether the pleading so fully and correctly informs a defendant of the offense with which he is charged that, taking into account the proof which is introduced against him, he is not misled in making his defense.\u201d <em>(People v. Guerrero </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 183, 187 [137 P.2d 21].) Here, the information charged defendant with forcible rape in violation of former section 261, subdivision (2). That section defined rape in 1987 as \u201can act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] [w]here it is accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u201d (As amended by Stats. 1986, ch. 1299, \u00a7 1, p. 4592.) Thus, defendant was put on notice by the information that he was being charged with an offense that could be accomplished \u201cby means of force, <em>violence, </em>or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.\u201d Moreover, Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing gave defendant notice of the particular circumstances of the offense, i.e., that her testimony could support a finding of rape by means of violence, as well as by means of force or fear. <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>at pp. 829-830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Finally, the variance was not of such a substantial character as to have misled defendant in preparing his defense. <em>(People v. Collins, supra, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Cal.2d at p. 60.) Here, in finding defendant guilty of rape, the jury found Jacqueline H.\u2019s testimony credible. That evidence equally supported findings of rape by means of force, violence, or fear. It is inconceivable that the jury would have found defendant guilty of rape by means of violence, but not by means of force or fear. Under these circumstances, the variance was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">f. <em>Reasonable doubt issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Without objection, the trial court gave the standard instructions on (1) circumstantial evidence (CALJIC Nos. 2.01 [sufficiency of circumstantial evidence-generally], 2.02 [sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove specific intent], 8.83 [sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove the special circumstance], and 8.83.1 [sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove mental state]); (2) the credibility and weight of the evidence (CALJIC Nos. 2.21.2 [witness willfully false] and 2.22 [weighing conflicting testimony]); and (3) the definition of reasonable doubt (CALJIC No. 2.90). Defendant claims that those instructions given, singly and collectively, impermissibly diluted the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Regarding the instructions on circumstantial evidence, we have repeatedly rejected defendant\u2019s argument. Those instructions, which refer to an interpretation of the evidence that \u201cappears to you to be reasonable\u201d and are read in conjunction with other instructions, do not dilute the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 346-347; <em>People v. Osband, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 678-679; <em>People v. Ray, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 347-348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Regarding CALJIC No. 2.21.2, defendant argues that it lowers the standard of proof for conviction by permitting the jury to assess the testimony of prosecution witnesses under a \u201cprobability of truth\u201d standard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have rejected a similar claim that the instruction, as applied to the defendant\u2019s testimony, increases the burden of proof from raising a reasonable doubt to meeting a \u201cprobability of truth.\u201d <em>(People v. Beardslee, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 94.) \u201cThe qualification attacked by defendant as shifting the burden of proof (\u2018unless from all the evidence you shall believe the probability of truth favors his testimony in other particulars\u2019) is merely a statement of the obvious\u2014that the jury should refrain from rejecting the whole of a witness\u2019s testimony if it believes that the probability of truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>favors any part of it. [\u00b6] \u2018Thus CALJIC No. 2.21 does nothing more than explain to a jury one of the tests they may use in resolving a credibility dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Beardslee, supra, </em>at p. 95.) Although defendant here attacks the instruction as applied to prosecution witnesses, the same rationale applies. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1493, 1502-1503 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 407]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493-1494 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 645]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 766, 772-776 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 633].) When CALJIC No. 2.21.2 is considered in context with CALJIC Nos. 1.01 (consider instructions as a whole) and 2.90 (burden of proof), \u201cthe jury was adequately told to apply CALJIC No. 2.21.2 \u2018only as part of the process of determining whether the prosecution had met its fundamental burden of proving [defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Foster, supra, </em>at p. 775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Regarding CALJIC No. 2.22, defendant argues that it impermissibly dilutes the reasonable doubt standard because it allows the jury to resolve conflicting testimony by weighing \u201cthe convincing force of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Again, when this instruction is considered with CALJIC Nos. 1.01 and 2.90, \u201c \u2018 [I]t is apparent that the jury was instructed to weigh the relative convincing force of the evidence (CALJIC No. 2.22) only as part of the process of determining whether the prosecution had met its fundamental burden of proving [defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clay </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 433, 461-462 [200 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salas </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 151, 157 [123 Cal.Rptr. 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Finally, with respect to former CALJIC No. 2.90, we have repeatedly held that the phrases \u201cdepending on moral evidence\u201d and \u201cto a moral certainty\u201d correctly define reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 203 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 385-386 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009].) Because the instruction, individually, correctly defines reasonable doubt, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that this instruction, when considered together with the other complained-of instructions, was improper. <em>(People v. Osband, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 678-679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>g. <em>Alleged Carlos error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In <em>Carlos v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], we incorrectly held that intent to kill was a necessary element of the felony-murder special circumstance, and in <em>People v. Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669], we extended the <em>Carlos </em>holding to the multiple-murder special circumstance. In <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1987) 43 .Cal.3d 1104, 1149 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], we overruled both <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Turner, </em>dispensing with the requirement of an intent to kill by the actual killer. Because the murders here occurred during the \u201cwindow period\u201d between <em>Turner </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the intent to kill requirement of <em>Turner </em>applies to the multiple-murder special circumstance charged in connection with those murders. <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 45 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In accordance with <em>Turner, </em>the trial court instructed on the multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201cTo find the special circumstance, referred to in these instructions as multiple murder convictions, is true, it must be proved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201c1. The defendant has in this case been convicted of at least one crime of murder of the first degree and one or more crimes of murder of the first or second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201c2. That the defendant <em>intended to kill a human being or intended to aid another in the killing of a human being </em>in one first degree murder of which you have found him guilty and in at least one other murder of which you have found him guilty.\u201d (Italics added; see CALJIC No. 8.81.3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Regarding the above instruction, defendant does not claim that the trial court incorrectly instructed on the intent requirement for the actual killer. Rather, he contends that the court erroneously instructed on the intent requirement with respect to aider-and-abettor liability. He argues that the instruction did not necessarily require the jury to find that the aider and abettor intended to kill, because one may intend to aid another who happens to kill someone but not intend to kill that person. However, based on the instructions given and the evidence presented, we conclude that, if the jury predicated murder liability on an aiding and abetting theory, it necessarily found that defendant intended to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Of all three murders, the evidence supported an aiding and abetting theory only on the Weeden murder count. That evidence consisted solely of defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements to the police that he happened to come upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Morris as he was strangling Weeden. Initially, defendant stated that he believed Weeden was dead after Morris strangled and dropped her, but later stated that he was not sure if she was dead at that time. He also related that Morris forced him at gunpoint to strike Weeden on the head with a rock so no one would know how she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On the remaining murder counts, there was no evidence that defendant aided and abetted another in the killings of Berryhill or Stark. Based on the evidence, the jury could only find defendant guilty of murder as the actual killer of those victims. Yet the jury was properly instructed that the actual killer must have <em>intended to kill a human being </em>as an element of the multiple-murder special circumstance. Thus, if the jury predicated its multiple-murder special-circumstance finding on the Berryhill or Stark murder conviction, it was correctly instructed that intent to kill was an element. Indeed, as defendant concedes, the jury expressly found that the first degree murder of Berryhill was \u201cperpetrated by a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing\u201d and thus necessarily determined that defendant intended to kill Berryhill.  Because the multiple-murder special-circumstance finding required the jury to have found at least two intentional killings and we are not sure which two murder convictions the jury used to support that finding, we examine whether the jury could have determined that defendant intended to aid and abet Morris in the killing of Weeden without intending to kill her, as defendant asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The jury was instructed, in the language of CALJIC No. 3.00, that \u201cThe persons concerned in the commission of a crime who are regarded by law as principals in the crime thus committed and equally guilty thereof include: [\u00b6] 1. Those who directly and actively commit the act constituting the crime, or [\u00b6] 2. Those who aid and abet the commission of the crime.\u201d The trial court further instructed, in the language of CALJIC No. 3.01, that \u201cA person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he (1) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and (2) with the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the crime, by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates the commission of the crime.\u201d The challenged instruction told the jury that a multiple-murder special-circumstance finding required that defendant \u201cintended to kill a human being <em>or </em>intended to aid another in the killing of a human being.\u201d But in the context of all of the instructions given, the jury was also told that to find aider and abettor liability, it must find both that defendant intended to commit the \u201caiding\u201d act of tilling Weeden and that he did so with knowledge of the perpetrator\u2019s criminal purpose, i.e., to till her. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1242 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Moreover, there was no evidence to support a finding that defendant aided Morris in tilling Weeden without knowing that Morris intended to till her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>According to defendant\u2019s story to the police, Morris forced defendant to strike Weeden on the head with a rock to mask the cause of death. Thus, if the jury believed defendant and found that he intentionally aided and abetted the actual killer, as required by the challenged instruction, it necessarily found, under the instructions and evidence given, that he knew he was aiding in an intentional killing. The jury could not have found that defendant \u201caided\u201d the killing only accidentally or unintentionally. <em>(People v. Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 192-193 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 790-791 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419].) On the other hand, if the jury found defendant was the actual killer of Weeden, it was properly instructed on intent to kill. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the jury necessarily found defendant intended to kill in at least two of the murders. <em>(People v. Marshall </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 852 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280]; <em>Hardy, supra, </em>at pp. 192-193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Even if error had occurred, it was harmless. <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, 6 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 44-46.) Given defendant\u2019s admissions, his many inconsistent statements, and his attempts to capitalize financially from the killings, overwhelming evidence existed of his intent to kill all his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">D. <em>Penalty Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">1. <em>Admissibility of Polygraph Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of the polygraph result regarding Weeden\u2019s death violated his right, under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to have relevant mitigating evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">At trial, defendant argued that evidence that he \u201cpassed\u201d the polygraph test regarding Weeden\u2019s death was admissible as a factor in mitigation and to establish lingering doubt. The trial court denied the request to admit the evidence, relying on Evidence Code sections 351.1 and 352. It found that any \u201cpossible probative value\u201d of the polygraph evidence was outweighed by its \u201cdoubtful reliability\u201d and the fact that its admission would be \u201cpotentially cumbersome and time-consuming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The Attorney General argues that \u201cthe unambiguous language of Evidence Code section 351.1, subdivision (a), prohibits the admission of the polygraph results in the present case.\u201d He asserts that <em>United States v. Scheffer, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pages 309-316 [118 S.Ct. at pages 1264-1268], disposes of defendant\u2019s claim. Relying on <em>Paxton v. Ward </em>(10th Cir. 1999) 199 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>1197, defendant responds that a state court\u2019s rule of evidence may not be mechanically applied to infringe on a defendant\u2019s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to present mitigating evidence in a capital case. <em>(Paxton, supra, </em>at p. 1214; but cf. <em>Goins v. Angelone </em>(4th Cir. 2000) 226 F.3d 312, 326, fn. 7 [\u201c \u2018 [U]nder current controlling precedent, the Constitution does not mandate admission of polygraph results in capital sentencing proceedings\u2019 \u201d].) <em>Paxton </em>ruled that <em>Scheffer </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve a capital defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present mitigating evidence. <em>(Paxton, supra, </em>at p. 1215.) Unlike <em>Paxton, </em>here the trial court did not deny admission of the polygraph results based on a mechanical application of Evidence Code section 351.1. Rather, the court exercised its discretion under Evidence Code section 352, finding that any \u201cpossible probative value\u201d of the polygraph evidence was outweighed by its \u201cdoubtful reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">If Evidence Code section 351.1 permits a defendant to make a <em>Kelly/Frye </em>showing (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 414), as in the guilt phase, defendant failed to present an offer of proof that polygraph evidence was generally accepted in the scientific community. Because such an offer of proof is necessary to preserve the issue for appeal, defendant cannot assign error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(People v. Fudge, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1122; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 870 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1].) Without the threshold showing of reliability, polygraph evidence is not \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the question of proper punishment. <em>(Fudge, supra, </em>at pp. 1122-1123 [polygraph evidence was not \u201chighly relevant\u201d mitigating evidence demonstrating good character or supporting a lingering doubt of guilt].) In addition, defendant failed to show that the particular polygraph test results being proffered were reliable. Unlike this case, in <em>Paxton, </em>the reliability of the excluded polygraph evidence in that individual case was demonstrated by the fact that the state relied on it in dismissing an earlier charge against defendant. <em>(Paxton v. Ward, supra, </em>199 F.3d at p. 1214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Defendant claims that the polygraph evidence was relevant mitigating evidence on the issue of relative culpability. He argues that some jurors, at the guilt phase, could have based their first degree murder verdict on the finding that defendant did not kill Weeden, but only aided and abetted Morris in the commission of felony robbery during which Weeden was killed. Thus, he argues, the polygraph test results showing that defendant did not kill Weeden would support his lack of culpability. However, there was no evidence that defendant aided and abetted Morris in the commission of a robbery, but only evidence that he aided and abetted Morris in the commission of murder, i.e., defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement that Morris forced him to throw a rock at Weeden. Although there was evidence that Morris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>took Weeden\u2019s truck, there was no substantial evidence that Weeden\u2019s killing was committed to take her truck. Thus, exclusion of the polygraph test results was not \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the question of proper punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">2. <em>Denial of Mistrial Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial after the jury foreman was replaced with an alternate juror during the penalty phase. On appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>(People v. Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 756 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485].)  The decision whether to investigate possible juror bias, incompetence, or misconduct, as well as the ultimate decision whether to retain or discharge a juror, rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(People v. Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1351.) If any substantial evidence exists to support the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion, the court\u2019s action will be upheld on appeal. <em>(Ibid.) </em> Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On Thursday afternoon, August 24, 1989, the jury returned its guilt phase verdicts and special circumstance findings. On the following day, the jury foreman, Jimmie K., informed the clerk that he had concerns about the trial. On Tuesday, August 29, the trial court questioned Jimmie K. about his concerns. The foreman related that after the proceedings had been adjourned on Thursday afternoon following the guilt phase verdicts, he overheard a female bartender telling someone that she knew defendant. When Jimmie K. asked how she knew defendant, the bartender responded that defendant had choked and attempted to rape her in 1984 or 1985. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s challenge of the foreman. Jimmie K. then informed the court that another juror, Annette S., was present during part of his conversation with the bartender. Because he left without discussing the conversation with Annette S., he did not know if she overheard it. Jimmie K. assured the court that he had not discussed the bartender incident with any of the other jurors, including Juror Annette S.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On Wednesday, August 30, 1989, defendant moved for a mistrial on the penalty phase, which the trial court denied. Later that day, the court examined Juror Annette S. The juror informed the court that she overheard the bartender say that she had a \u201crun-in\u201d with defendant and that \u201che was supposed to have choked her.\u201d When asked how that discussion affected her, Annette S. replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d Defendant challenged Annette S. The prosecutor opposed the challenge and proposed that the court inform her that the prosecution investigated what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>bartender had related and determined it was not true. When the juror returned to the courtroom, the court told Annette S. that the prosecution determined that defendant was not the person that the bartender had been talking about. Annette S. assured the court that she accepted the fact that defendant had not been involved in that incident and could disregard the information she overheard. The court admonished Annette S. not to discuss the bartender incident with any of the other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On the following day, the trial court deferred ruling on the defense challenge of Annette S. After the parties had rested, but before the penalty phase deliberations, the defense renewed the challenge to Annette S. The court granted the motion and replaced Annette S. with an alternate juror. .</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Defendant now argues that the trial court should have granted a mistrial because Jurors Jimmie K. and Annette S. might have spoken to the other jurors about the bartender\u2019s statement that defendant choked and attempted to rape her. Defendant argues that Jimmie K. told the court that he had discussed \u201cthis matter\u201d in superficial ways with the other jurors and that \u201cthis matter\u201d was a reference to the bartender\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The People respond that defendant misreads the record and point out that, after the guilt phase verdict, the trial court adjourned the proceedings and the jury did not return to court for the penalty phase until Thursday, August 31, 1989. Because the bartender\u2019s remark occurred after the guilt phase verdicts and adjournment and the jury did not return to court until after the court had questioned Jimmie K. on August 29, the juror\u2019s reference to <em>this matter </em>must have been to the guilt phase portion of trial, which had just been completed before the jurors\u2019 separation on August 24. For the same reasons, the People state that Juror Annette S. could not have spoken to the other jurors about the outside information because the court questioned her on August 30, a day before the jury returned to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In his reply brief, defendant concedes that the People\u2019s chronology is correct and that the evidence reflects that the two jurors could not have related the bartender\u2019s statements to the other jurors in the courthouse. Nevertheless, he maintains that the trial court\u2019s failure to ask Annette S. if she had already spoken to other jurors about the outside information and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>make similar inquiries of the remaining jurors was prejudicial error. He argues that since Jimmie K. and Annette S. socialized at the bar, they may have socialized and spoken with the other jurors outside of court about the incident. In light of the record, this argument is speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Second, defendant complains that, because the 10 remaining original jurors had already found him guilty of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and were so \u201centrenched\u201d in their views of guilt, the two replacement jurors could not freely deliberate and express opposing views of the evidence. We fail to see how that argument supports his claim that the substitution of two jurors denied him a fair and impartial jury. Indeed, if his premise is true, that the 10 guilt phase jurors could not fairly and impartially deliberate as to the appropriate penalty, defendant would be better off with two replacement jurors who were not so \u201centrenched\u201d in their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Third, defendant contends that the 10 remaining original jurors, who had found defendant guilty of the charged offenses, could not possibly have disregarded past guilt phase deliberations and begun deliberations anew as related to the issue of lingering doubt. In light of the instructions given, that argument is simply speculative. Because deliberations on the guilt phase of trial were complete and verdicts of guilt had been returned, the jury was instructed that \u201cyou are not required to again render verdicts as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant nor truth of the special allegations. Those verdicts have already been rendered in the guilt portion of the trial.\u201d However, as to the deliberations relevant in determining penalty, the jury was instructed that \u201cThe People and the defendant have the right to a verdict reached only after full participation of the 12 jurors who return the verdict. This right may be assured only if you begin your deliberations again from the beginning. You must, therefore, set aside and disregard all past deliberations and begin deliberating anew. This means that each remaining original juror must set aside and disregard the earlier deliberations as if they had not taken place.\u201d The jurors were further told that they were to consider the \u201ccircumstances of the crimes of which defendant was convicted\u201d and \u201call of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial.\u201d As to lingering doubt, the jurors were instructed that \u201c[t]o the extent that you have any lingering or residual doubts as to the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes of which he has been convicted in this case, or the existence of any circumstances found to be true in this case, you may consider such lingering or residual doubts as the basis for determining that life imprisonment without possibility of parole is the appropriate penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Thus, \u201cthe instructions made clear not only that lingering doubts as to guilt could be considered in mitigation, but also that the penalty phase jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>was to deliberate on this question as an integrated whole, to set aside any previous discussion on the question, and to review in its common deliberations any relevant guilt phase evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, <em>Cl </em>[40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224].) In other contexts, we have rejected defendant\u2019s underlying premise that jurors, who had previously returned guilty verdicts in the guilt phase of trial, could no longer be impartial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1354-1355; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1029 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017].) If we were to accept defendant\u2019s argument, substitution of jurors at the penalty phase could never occur under any circumstances, resulting in automatic mistrials. We decline to do so because, as in this case, \u201cunforeseen circumstances may require substitution of a juror at the penalty phase of a capital trial, even though the alternate did not take part in the guilt phase deliberations.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 351, in. 9 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, defendant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">3. <em>Factor (a) Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Defendant claims the trial court erred in instructing the penalty phase jury that before considering section 190.3, factor (a) (circumstances of the crime), as a circumstance in aggravation, each \u201cjuror must be <em>satisfied </em>beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, <em>in fact, </em>committed such charged crime or crimes.\u201d (Italics added.) He argues the instruction precluded full participation in penalty deliberations by any substitute juror who did not participate in the guilt verdict because that juror might have had a doubt about defendant\u2019s guilt. The claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The trial instructions specifically directed each juror to \u201cdecide the matter for yourself after a careful discussion of the evidence and the instructions with the other members of the jury.\u201d The jury was also informed that \u201c[t]he People and the defendant have the right to a verdict reached only after <em>full participation of the 12 jurors who return the verdict.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Viewed as a whole, there is no reasonable likelihood the jury misconstrued or misapplied the instructions, and therefore no federal constitutional violation occurred. (See <em>People v. Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p.. 1161; <em>People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 833 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2]; <em>People v.

The jury in this case unanimously returned a verdict in favor of death. It is unimaginable that a penalty phase juror who entertained a reasonable doubt about a defendant\u2019s guilt would favor death over life imprisonment, or that the challenged instruction could somehow have increased the likelihood of a death verdict. Under any standard of harmless error, no prejudice is discemable.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">4. <em>District Attorney\u2019s Discretion to Charge Capital Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Defendant contends the judgment should be reversed because the district attorney improperly exercised his discretion to seek the death penalty against defendant for reasons contaminated by bias and conflict of interest arising from the district attorney\u2019s personal and emotional involvement in the case, and \u201cmotivated purely by his own self-interest.\u201d The available remedy, which defendant did not seek below, is provided under section 1424, governing motions to disqualify the prosecuting attorney for conflict of interest or other evidence of overriding bias. (See <em>People v.

He raises no basis for reconsideration of those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Specifically, a jury\u2019s finding of aggravation based on the circumstances of a crime under section 190.3, factor (a), does not impermissibly permit consideration of a factor that is vague and overbroad, or allow guilt phase crimes to be counted more than once as aggravating factors, thereby unfairly weighting sentencing deliberations in favor of death. <em>(People v. Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 404-405; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 1179; <em>People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 156.) In itself, introduction of evidence of unadjudicated criminal activity under section 190.3, factor (b), does not offend the federal Constitution. <em>(People v. Samayoa, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 863; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 457, 478 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 862 P.2d 808].) Application of the words \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d in section 190.3, factors (d) and (g), does not impermissibly limit consideration of mitigating factors in violation of the federal Constitution. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 1178-1179; <em>People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 276 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1227-1228.) Because the jury was instructed on miscellaneous sympathy evidence under section 190.3, factor (k), \u201c[t]he temporal language in section 190.3, factors (d) and (h) (consideration of any extreme mental or emotional disturbance or impairment from mental disease or defect or the effects of intoxication <em>at the time of the offense), </em>[does] not preclude the jury from considering any such evidence merely because it did not relate specifically to defendant\u2019s culpability for the crimes committed.\u201d <em>(People v. Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 405, fn. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Even when requested, there is no error in the trial court\u2019s failure to delete as inapplicable mitigating factors (e) (whether victim participated in crime) and (f) (moral justification for crime) of section 190.3 from the standard statutory instructions, if the jury, as in this case, was properly instructed to consider and be guided by all the factors \u201c \u2018if applicable,\u2019 \u201d since \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>assume the jury properly followed the instruction and concluded that mitigating factors not supported by evidence were simply not \u2018applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

Samayoa, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 852-853, 862.) Sentencing instructions are not unduly vague because they fail to identify which factors are aggravating and which are mitigating, or to explain to the jury how to treat any inapplicable factors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 207-208.) Because the appropriate penalty is not presumed and is a question for each individual juror, no presumption exists in favor of life or death in determining penalty in a capital case.

Finally, defendant\u2019s claim that this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>appellate review process is impermissibly influenced by political considerations is rejected for the reasons explained in recent cases addressing the same claim. <em>(People v.

The claim rests in part on the contention that he murdered his victims because the government provided him with reward money for turning in their bodies, thereby effectively making the government the instigator. He also relies on the mitigating evidence presented to the jury during the penalty phase relating to his family background, mental condition, and marijuana abuse.  Although we decline to conduct an intercase proportionality review <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1029; <em>People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 476 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388]), we do undertake an intracase review to determine whether the penalty is disproportionate to defendant\u2019s personal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">That process requires us to \u201cexamine the circumstances of the offense, including its motive, the extent of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime, the manner in which the crime was committed, and the consequences of the defendant\u2019s acts. The court must also consider the personal characteristics of the defendant, including age, prior criminality, and mental capabilities. [Citation.] If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is \u2018grossly disproportionate to the defendant\u2019s individual culpability\u2019 [citation], or, stated another way, that the punishment \u2018 \u201c \u2018shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [citation], the court must invalidate the sentence as unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1078 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Even assuming the validity of defendant\u2019s contention that the government bears responsibility for what he did because it enabled him to make money murdering people (a contention we find dubious), intracase proportionality review examines \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether [a] <em>defendant\u2019s </em>death sentence is proportionate td <em>his </em>individual culpability, irrespective of the punishment imposed on others.\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(People v.

On this record, the sentence of death is not disproportionate to defendant\u2019s personal responsibility and moral guilt. (See <em>Marshall, supra, </em>at p. 938.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">7. <em>Effect of Delay Between Sentence and Execution; Constitutionality of Lethal Injection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Defendant argues that his sentence must be vacated because of (1) unconstitutional delay in the length of time his automatic appeal has been pending, and (2) the method used in carrying out the death sentence (lethal injection). These claims have been raised and rejected in other capital cases. <em>(People v.

No reason appears for revisiting those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">8. <em>Other Challenges to Penalty Phase Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury sua sponte on the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for \u201cother crimes\u201d that were not directly alleged under section 190.3, factor (b), but implicitly raised as aggravating circumstances by the prosecution. Defendant points to the prosecution\u2019s closing argument asking the jury to base its penalty decision on the evidence presented <em>in both the guilt and the penalty phases. </em>The prosecution also characterized defendant as a serial killer and inferentially referred to Adolf Hitler and Adolf Eichmann. Defendant contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>result may have been that the jury considered section 190.3, factor (b), aggravation from defendant\u2019s various statements, reported in the guilt phase, suggesting he committed more than the three killings for which he was charged and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The claim fails. First, in the absence of a request, the trial court is under no duty to give an instruction at the penalty phase regarding evidence received at the guilt phase. <em>(People v. Anderson </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 588 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 575, 22 P.3d 347]; <em>People v. Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1039 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627].)  Even when section 190.3, factor (b), criminal activity is expressly alleged, which was not the case here, \u201cthe rule absolving the court of a sua sponte duty to instruct on the elements of crimes introduced under [section 190.3,] factor (b) \u2018 \u201cis based in part on a recognition that, as [a] tactical matter, the defendant \u2018may not want the penalty phase instructions . . . [to] lead the jury to place undue emphasis on the crimes rather than on the central question of whether he should live or die.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>at p. 588.) If a trial court need not instruct a jury sua sponte as to the elements of alleged other crimes, given the possible undue emphasis which the defense may fear the jury will place on them <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 963-964), a trial court is obviously under no sua sponte obligation to instruct the jury on the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving other crimes that are not clearly introduced under section 190.3, factor (b). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lang, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 1040; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rich </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1036, 1121-1122 [248 Cal.Rptr. 510, 755 P.2d 960]; <em>People v.

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 1161.) In doing so, we conclude there was no reasonable likelihood the jury considered or relied on \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, which it was expressly told not to consider unless directed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Defendant also contends that the failure to label each factor as either aggravating or mitigating rendered the factors unconstitutionally vague because the jury was left without guidance about their meaning and application, allowing the jury to consider in aggravation such factors as intoxication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and mental impairment, which may be considered only in mitigation. The claim does not survive the United States Supreme Court ruling in <em>Tuilaepa v. California </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 975-979 [114 S.Ct. 2630, 2636-2639, 129 L.Ed.2d 750], upholding section 190.3, factors (a), (b), and (i), against a challenge that the factors were unconstitutionally vague because the sentencer was not instructed on how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision.  \u201cIndeed, we have repeatedly held that \u2018trial courts are not required to identify particular sentencing factors as aggravating or mitigating and that the 1978 death penalty law is constitutional despite the absence of such a requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 208; see also <em>People v. Pinholster, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Defendant adds that the penalty phase instructions in his case allowed the jury to consider previous guilt instructions on voluntary intoxication (CAL-JIC Nos. 4.20, 4.22), which informed the jury that intoxication did not negate the criminality of defendant\u2019s actions for the purpose of determining guilt. Defendant argues that, notwithstanding <em>penalty </em>instructions to the jury that it could consider whether intoxication impaired defendant\u2019s mental capacity in determining penalty, the jury could still view intoxication as one of the circumstances of the crime, and therefore treat it as aggravating, despite case law identifying intoxication as mitigating. But the mitigating nature of section 190.3, factors (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (k), \u201cis clear even in the face of contrary argument.\u201d <em>(People v. Montiel </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 944 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277].) Here, it should be noted, the record reflects no argument by the prosecution that intoxication, whether from alcohol or marijuana, or any mental or emotional disturbance, should be considered as anything but mitigating. No reasonable likelihood appears that the jury misunderstood or misapplied the penalty instructions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 857-858 [despite trial court error in failing to instruct jury to consider evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining penalty, prosecution argument did not misdirect jury from considering relevant evidence of defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol prior to offense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">9. <em>Cumulative Prejudice in Guilt and Penalty Phases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defendant concludes his challenge to the penalty judgment by asserting that the cumulative effect of the errors he raises mandates reversal. Our review of the record leads us to a different conclusion. No errors are discemable. No reasonable possibility exists that the sentencing jury would have reached a different result absent any of the alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>III.

Several minutes later, when it was \u201calmost dark,\u201d defendant drove off on his maroon Yamaha motorcycle.

Although Hancock did not know anyone by the name of Dawn Berryhill, defendant further related that the police had spoken to defendant about her disappearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> The defense claimed that the writing \u201cNick\u201d on the back of Stark\u2019s address book was a reference to Nick Pinada, who was married to Cheryl Stapley. Before their marriage, defendant had lived with Stapley during the first three months of 1987. The telephone number on the back of Stark\u2019s book was Stapley\u2019s telephone number. Pinada testified that he had never met anyone named Belinda Jo Stark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> On rebuttal, Koeller explained that he did not identify defendant\u2019s photograph because he did not want to be a snitch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> At the suppression hearing, defendant argued that the Secret Witness program acted as an agent of law enforcement. For purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, the trial court adopted that assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> Section 633.5 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNothing in Section 631, 632, 632.5, 632.6, or 632.7 prohibits one party to a confidential communication from recording the communication for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party to the communication of the crime of. . . any felony involving violence against the person. . . .

Consequently, he has forfeited his claim that evidence of the other two murders and one rape could not be used to prove identity. Because the evidence was admissible to prove identity, intent, and motive, we reject defendant\u2019s incompetence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>counsel claim. <em>(People v.

Defendant argues that the \u201clight odor\u201d and stain are conclusive evidence of the presence of decomposition fluid, which establishes that Stark\u2019s pants were removed after her death. Not so. There was no scientific evidence linking the \u201clight odor\u201d and stain to decomposition fluid. The jury could reasonably conclude that they were caused by something other than human decomposition fluid. Moreover, defendant\u2019s argument that the pants were removed after Stark\u2019s death is not dispositive; the jury could still reasonably conclude that Stark had been assaulted while alive and that defendant intended to rape her during the assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Although there were no promises made, defendant received three years\u2019 probation on a felony conviction of possession of stolen property without a county jail commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> Defendant also alleges that defense counsel were incompetent for failing to object to his \u201cinvoluntary\u201d statements to Detective Ashmun that Weeden had been strangled and hit in the head. As with the November 21, 1985, interview, no promises were made in exchange for information on the Weeden case. Detective Ashmun simply said he <em>might </em>help defendant on the unrelated case. Because the claim lacks merit and because his statements formed the basis for his defense, counsel cannot be faulted for failing to object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We reject defendant\u2019s claim that there were \u201cunacknowledged\u201d agreements that Jacqueline H. testify in a certain manner. Although bail had been reduced and the preliminary hearing had been delayed in Jacqueline H.\u2019s criminal cases, defendant fails to establish any causal connection between these events and her testimony in this case. The fact that the district attorney filed criminal charges against Jacqueline H. <em>after </em>her preliminary hearing testimony indicates that Jacqueline H. did not receive \u201cunacknowledged\u201d benefits in exchange for her trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Although this claim involves both the guilt and penalty phases, we consider the entire claim here because the arguments are related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In addition to the forfeited prosecutorial misconduct claims, defendant contends that the Secret Witness program\u2019s payment to him for information on the location of the victims\u2019 bodies constituted outrageous government conduct in violation of his due process rights because it provided the incentive for murder. Because defendant failed to raise this claim or present evidence to support it, the claim is forfeited. In any event, it would fail. Even assuming the Secret Witness program acted as a government agent, its conduct fell far short of government conduct \u201c \u2018so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Restrepo </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 930 F.2d 705, 712.) There was no direct and continuous government involvement in the <em>creation and maintenance </em>of criminal operations. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 915 F.2d 521, 525-526 [due process prevents conviction where undercover agents engineer and direct the criminal enterprise from start to finish].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\"> The trial court read to the jury the fifth edition of CALJIC No. 10.00 (1988), which did not include amplifying language regarding the reasonableness of the victim\u2019s fear. CALJIC No. 10.00 (6th ed. 1996) now adds: \u201c[The fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances [, or if unreasonable, the perpetrator must have known of the victim\u2019s fear and taken advantage of it].]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> Defendant argues that the jury could have believed part of her testimony, that she became afraid that defendant was going to kill her during the motorcycle ride to the Happy Valley area, but disbelieved that defendant forced her, with a rope tied around her neck, to submit to sexual intercourse. If so, it could have further determined that the fear of being killed during the motorcycle ride was unreasonable and was the sole reason Jacqueline H. submitted to sexual intercourse. Aside from being speculative, defendant\u2019s argument ignores the defense theory of the case at trial. Defense counsel argued that Jacqueline H. may have experienced drug-induced paranoia causing her to \u201csee things different than reality\" and think \u201cthat she\u2019s being raped.\u201d Counsel never conceded that an act of sexual intercourse ever took place between defendant and Jacqueline H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> CALJIC No. 2.21.2 provides: \u201cA witness, who is willfully false in one material part of his or her testimony, is to be distrusted in others.

Thus, while a \u2018conflict\u2019 exists whenever there is a \u2018reasonable possibility that the DA\u2019s office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner,\u2019 the conflict is disabling only if it is \u2018so grave as to render it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eubanks </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 580, 594 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 927 P.2d 310], fn. omitted; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 123.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b482-5\"> Defendant appears to characterize factors (e) and (f) of section 190.3 as potentially applicable in aggravation.
