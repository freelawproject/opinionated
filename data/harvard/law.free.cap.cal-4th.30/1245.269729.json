J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amn\">In this case we interpret Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, subdivision (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 170.6 permits a party in civil and criminal actions to move to disqualify an assigned trial judge on the basis of a simple allegation by the party or his or her attorney that the judge is prejudiced against the party. Various restrictions on the timing of the motion are imposed by this statute, and a party may exercise such a challenge only once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>during the trial of an action or a special proceeding. A motion that conforms to all the requirements of section 170.6, however, must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Historically, a challenge could not be filed for the first time after a reviewing court remanded the matter to the trial court. In 1985, however, the Legislature amended section 170.6 to add the following language: \u201cA motion under this paragraph may be made following reversal on appeal of a trial court\u2019s decision, or following reversal on appeal of a trial court\u2019s final judgment, if the trial judge in the prior proceeding is assigned to conduct a new trial on the matter.\u201d (\u00a7 170.6, subd. (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">It is the quoted language that we interpret in this case. We must determine whether a party may challenge a trial judge pursuant to section 170.6, subdivision (2) after an appellate court partially reverses a criminal judgment and remands the matter to the trial court for <em>potential </em>retrial of the reversed count and for resentencing, in a case in which the prosecutor determines <em>not </em>to retry the charge in the reversed count. We conclude that the language of section 170.6, subdivision (2) does not permit a challenge when, following such a remand, the sole task left for the trial court is to resentence the defendant. We reach this conclusion because of the meaning of the statutory term \u201cnew trial\u201d in the context of criminal proceedings, and because of the nature of sentencing hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">A jury found petitioner guilty of two felonies that were committed in Fresno in 1996: reckless driving while eluding a police officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2) and being a felon in possession of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)). In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true the allegations that petitioner had two prior strike convictions (for robbery and burglary). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.12.) The court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to strike the prior convictions and sentenced petitioner to a term of 25 years to life in prison for the offense of reckless driving while evading a police officer, and to a concurrent term of 25 years to life for the offense of possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">Petitioner challenged the convictions on appeal. Among other contentions, he claimed that the trial court had erred under <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>U.S. 436 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] by admitting into evidence a statement made by petitioner to the police. The Court of Appeal determined that the error required reversal of petitioner\u2019s conviction for reckless driving while evading a police officer, but found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the firearm possession count. The court\u2019s opinion decreed the following disposition; \u201cThe conviction for evading a police officer is reversed. The matter is remanded for retrial on that count, if the prosecutor so elects, and for resentencing. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peracchi </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 353, 364 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">The case was remanded to the superior court and was assigned to the Honorable Lawrence Jones, the judge who had presided at trial. On May 18, 2001, pursuant to section 170.6, petitioner filed a written declaration of disqualification challenging Judge Jones. At a hearing held on May 24, 2001, Judge Jones announced that if the prosecution determined that the reversed count should be retried, the challenge would be granted. If, on the other hand, the prosecution determined not to retry the reversed count and the matter merely required a new sentencing hearing, the challenge would be denied. After the prosecutor stated that the charge of reckless driving while evading a police officer would not be retried, Judge Jones denied the challenge and set the matter for a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">On June 4, 2001, petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal, contending that Judge Jones should have been disqualified from presiding at the resentencing hearing. The Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ directing respondent court to vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s disqualification motion or show cause why relief should not be granted. When real party in interest elected to show cause, the Court of Appeal stayed the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">In a divided decision, the Court of Appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate the order denying the disqualification motion and to enter a new order granting the motion. We granted the petition for review filed by real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">The majority below relied in great part upon two Court of Appeal decisions that assigned a broad meaning to the term \u201cnew trial\u201d in the context of <em>civil </em>trials. (See <em>Hendershot v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 860 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 645] [a \u00a7 170.6 challenge lay when a judgment in a contract action was reversed in part and remanded for readjudication on a contested issue of fact]; <em>Stegs Investments v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 572 [284 Cal.Rptr. 495] [same, in partnership dissolution action].) Employing the broad reading of the term \u201cnew trial\u201d outlined by these decisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>Court of Appeal in the present case declared that \u201cthe proper approach is to focus on the function the judicial officer is to perform upon remand, rather than simply the nature of the hearing at issue. Such an approach requires a case-by-case analysis.\u201d Because it found that the trial judge would have significant discretion at the resentencing hearing and would have an opportunity to \u201crehear evidence regarding the appropriate sentence for petitioner and . . . have the opportunity to exercise his discretion in regard to such matters as striking a prior serious or violent felony,\u201d the Court of Appeal concluded that \u201c[t]he policy behind section 170.6, to avoid possible bias by a trial judge who has been reversed on appeal, will best be served by interpreting \u2018new trial\u2019 to encompass this resentencing.\u201d The Court of Appeal majority emphasized that its holding \u201cis based on what decisions the trial court judge in this case is going to make on remand and not on the general nature of resentencings on remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">The dissenting justice, however, criticizing the <em>Hendershot </em>and <em>Stegs </em>decisions, asserted that \u201cnothing in the history of the 1985 amendment. . . suggests] the Legislature intended to permit what would essentially amount to bifurcated trials of limited issues.\u201d In addition, the dissenting justice concluded, the term \u201cnew trial\u201d has a more restrictive meaning in the criminal context than in the civil context. Although section 170.6 applies in both civil and criminal cases, the dissent continued, as applied in the criminal context, a resentencing hearing does not constitute a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">As noted, we granted the petition for review filed by real party in interest. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">Litigants who establish good cause may disqualify the judge who is assigned to preside over a case. The grounds for disqualification of a judge for cause are set out in detail in the Code of Civil Procedure (see \u00a7 170.1), and the procedure to be followed for such a disqualification is set out in section 170.3. As we have observed: \u201cStatutes governing disqualification for cause are intended to ensure public confidence in the judiciary and to protect the right of the litigants to a fair and impartial adjudicator . . . .\u201d <em>(Curie v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1057, 1070 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 16 P.3d 166].)  In addition to the challenge for cause, another available procedure serves the same goal. Without establishing cause pursuant to sections 170.1 and 170.3, a party may secure the disqualification of a judge on the basis of an affidavit asserting that the party believes the judge is biased. This constitutes the peremptory challenge of a judge set forth in section 170.6. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number><em>(People v. Superior Court (Jimenez) </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 798, 806 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 50 P.3d 743].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">This court described the basic outline of section 170.6 in <em>Solberg v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182 [137 Cal.Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148], The statute \u201cprovides in substance that any party or attorney to a civil or criminal action may make an oral or written motion to disqualify the assigned judge, supported by an affidavit that the judge is prejudiced against such party or attorney or the interest thereof so that the affiant cannot or believes he cannot have an impartial trial. As hereinafter appears, there are strict limits on the timing and number of such motions; but if the motion is timely and in proper form, the judge must recuse himself without further proof and the case must be reassigned to another judge.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 187.) We also explained that the statute reasonably serves the Legislature\u2019s evident purpose of \u201cmaintaining the appearance as well as the fact of impartiality in the judicial system: the business of the courts . . . must be conducted in such a manner as will avoid even the \u2018suspicion of unfairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Section 170.6 requires the challenge to be brought early in the proceedings and declares that \u201c[i]n no event shall any judge . . . entertain the motion if it be made after the drawing of the name of the first juror, or if there be no jury, after the making of an opening statement by counsel for plaintiff, or if there is no such statement, then after swearing in the first witness or the giving of any evidence or after trial of the cause has otherwise commenced.\u201d (\u00a7 170.6, subd. (2).) It adds: \u201cIf the motion is directed to a hearing (other than the trial of a cause), the motion shall be made not later than the commencement of the hearing.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>If the motion under section 170.6 is presented in a timely fashion and in the proper form, however, a new judge must be assigned \u201cto try the cause or hear the matter,\u201d without any requirement of \u201cany further act or proof.\u201d (\u00a7 170.6, subd. (3).) Except as otherwise provided by the statute, a party may not file more than one motion under section 170.6 \u201cin any one action or special proceeding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">As we acknowledged in <em>Solberg v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 182, the peremptory challenge created by section 170.6 presents the potential for abuse and judge-shopping\u2014on the part of either or both parties. In response to this danger, we pointed out, \u201cthe courts of this state have been vigilant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>enforce the statutory restrictions on the number and timing of the motions permitted. . . . \u2018We cannot permit a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense and thereby to become an obstruction to efficient judicial administration.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Solberg, </em>at pp. 197-198, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Despite the statutory provisions requiring that the challenge be brought at an early stage of the proceedings and directing that a party may not bring more than one challenge, in 1985 the Legislature added the language that we must construe in the present case: \u201cA motion under this paragraph may be made following reversal on appeal of a trial court\u2019s decision, or following reversal on appeal of a trial court\u2019s final judgment, if the trial judge in the prior proceeding is assigned to conduct a <em>new trial </em>on the matter.\u201d (\u00a7 170.6, subd. (2), italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The specific question we must answer is whether a sentencing hearing that is conducted on remand after a partial reversal on appeal constitutes in itself a \u201cnew trial\u201d within the meaning of section 170.6, subdivision (2).  We undertake this task acknowledging that \u201c[t]he fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].) As with any question of statutory interpretation, the best indication of legislative intent appears in the language of the enactment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Farell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 381, 386 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 48 P.3d 1155].) Further, \u201cwe do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is a part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 899; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">The Penal Code defines a new trial as \u201ca reexamination of the issue in the same Court, before another jury, after a verdict has been given.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1179.) Penal Code section 1180 explains that \u201c[t]he granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had. All the testimony must be produced anew, and the former verdict or finding cannot be used or referred to, either in evidence or in argument. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>The court\u2019s function at sentencing, however, ensures that resentencing cannot occur \u201cas if no trial had been had.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1180.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Far from being a proceeding at which the trier of fact resolves the issues raised in the case, the sentencing hearing\u2014or resentencing hearing\u2014follows the entry, of the verdict and the discharge of the jury, and constitutes the occasion on which the court pronounces the judgment <em>arising from, the verdict. </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 1191, 1202; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.433(c)(5); see also <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 479, fn. 4 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2356].)  At sentencing, the court\u2019s function may include resolution of certain factual issues that relate to the choice of appropriate sentence (subject, of course, to the limitations of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466), but the court resolves those issues in light of what occurred at trial, including its own impressions of matters such as the defendant\u2019s demeanor and conduct at trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 978 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171]; see also <em>In re Lewallen </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 274, 281 [152 Cal.Rptr. 528, 590 P.2d 383, 100 A.L.R.3d 823] [\u201cLegitimate facts may come to the court\u2019s attention . . . through the personal observations of the judge during trial\u201d]; 22A Cal.Jur.3d (2000) Criminal Law: Post-Trial Proceedings, \u00a7 293, p. 201.) Because of the significance of the trial record and the court\u2019s observations at trial, the usual procedure is for the person who served as the trial judge to preside at the sentencing hearing, and this procedure generally is followed in the situation where resentencing is to occur following remand. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Strunk </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 265, 275 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gulbrandsen </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1547, 1562 [258 Cal.Rptr. 75]; 6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Criminal Judgment, \u00a7 155, p. 183.) The trial court is considered to be in the best position to conduct the resentencing hearing. The preference for a judge who is well informed about the case serves the interests of both parties, and an alternative practice would impose heavy burdens on scarce judicial resources. Further, in some cases, an express or implied term of a plea agreement may dictate that resentencing take place before the judge who accepted the plea. (See <em>People v. Arbuckle </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 749 [150 Cal.Rptr. 778, 587 P.2d 220, 3 A.L.R.4th 1171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">As a procedural matter, a remand for resentencing does not necessarily constitute, and is not equivalent to, an order for a new trial. On the contrary, when an appellate court determines that error has occurred below, Penal Code sections 1260 and 1262 grant the reviewing court the authority to select among several dispositions, including but <em>not limited to </em>reversal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>the judgment and the granting of a new trial. A reviewing court\u2019s remand for resentencing pursuant to Penal Code section 1260 is but one of these available dispositions and does not necessarily involve (or itself constitute) a reversal of the judgment or order for new trial. Under these statutes, a remand for resentencing is permitted \u201cwithout the necessity of affording a new trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 164, 176 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 502]; see also 6 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Criminal Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 167-168, pp. 413-415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">As a matter of practice, when a reviewing court identifies error relating solely to sentencing, it ordinarily does <em>not </em>reverse the judgment of conviction or remand for a new trial. Rather, typically, it simply remands for resentencing. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Fuhrman </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 930, 944 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 941 P.2d 1189]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGarry </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 644, 653 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 475]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trapps </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 265, 273 [204 Cal.Rptr. 541].) Even when reviewing courts have found error requiring the reversal of some part of the judgment of conviction, they frequently\u2014as in this case\u2014issue an order that calls for a new trial <em>if </em>the prosecutor determines to retry the reversed count or, in the <em>alternative, </em>that calls simply for a resentencing hearing in the event the prosecutor decides not to retry the reversed count. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Edwards </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 107, 118 [216 Cal.Rptr. 397, 702 P.2d 555]; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 693, 720 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 506]; <em>People v. Landis </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1247, 1255-1256 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Such a routine order remanding for resentencing does not necessarily operate even to vacate the original sentence, let alone constitute an order for a new trial\u2014that is, a proceeding at which \u201cthe parties [are] in the same position as if no trial had been had\u201d and in which \u201c[a]ll the testimony must be produced anew.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1180.) We have explained that when a reviewing court determines that resentencing is necessary, it may remand the matter for resolution of factual questions without requiring that the defendant once again be arraigned for imposition of judgment and sentencing. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 258 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 949 P.2d 31].) We also have explained that if, after a limited remand involving the sentence, \u201cthe trial court decidefs] not to exercise its discretion to modify the original sentence, that sentence would remain in effect, and the defendant need not be resentenced but should be remanded to continue serving the term previously imposed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buckhalter </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 20, 35 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 25 P.3d 1103], italics omitted.) Even when the trial court on remand exercises its discretion and modifies the sentence, the original sentence is not viewed as void <em>ab initio </em>and the defendant\u2019s incarceration in state prison under the original sentence is not considered presentence custody. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 36.) Accordingly, a remand for resentencing\u2014a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>limited order that does not disturb the verdict or even necessarily disturb the judgment and the sentence previously pronounced\u2014is merely one among several alternatives to the granting of a new trial, and does not itself constitute the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Moreover, once an actual new trial is granted, such constitutional issues as the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and to the protection of the double jeopardy clause are implicated. (See, e.g., <em>Burks v. United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1, 18 [98 S.Ct. 2141, 2151, 57 L.Ed.2d 1]; <em>People v. Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165].) When an ordinary sentencing determination is reconsidered in a noncapital case, on the other hand, these rights are not involved and the ensuing proceeding has not been considered as constituting a new or second trial that would be barred by the double jeopardy protection of the state and federal Constitutions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 835, 840, 842-843 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 968 P.2d 465] [also noting the existence of constitutional protection from \u201cfundamentally unfair sentencing proceedings, including vindictive reconsideration of sentencing issues\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">There is no indication that, despite the procedural and practical distinctions between a new trial and a resentencing hearing explained above, and the constitutional implications of denominating a hearing a \u201cnew trial,\u201d the Legislature nonetheless intended that a sentencing hearing on remand be considered a new trial for the purpose of the language added to section 170.6, subdivision (2) in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">We also deem it improbable, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature intended to disturb our reviewing courts\u2019 practice of remanding cases for resentencing on the assumption that the trial judge would again preside\u2014and would conduct the resentencing without bias. As noted, just as the trial judge is considered best suited to preside at the initial sentencing hearing, so too is he or she viewed as best situated to perform the function of sentencing on remand, by selecting the appropriate sentence in light of the circumstances established at trial and in light of the defendant\u2019s record. Even though reviewing courts possess authority to specify that proceedings on remand be conducted by a judge other than the one who imposed judgment, they rarely do so. With respect to sentencing error in particular, \u201cthe statutory power of appellate courts to disqualify sentencing judges should be used sparingly and only where the interests of justice require it.\u201d <em>(People v. Gulbrandsen, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 1562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">As the court explained in the <em>Gulbrandsen </em>case, \u201c[disqualification may be necessary where the sentence of the original judge indicates an animus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>inconsistent with judicial objectivity. It may also be called for where the judge\u2019s failure to follow the sentencing rules suggests a whimsical disregard of the sentencing scheme that is incompatible with a judicial effort to comply with its complex terms. But mere sentencing error, given the complexity of the determinate sentencing scheme, does not justify removing the trial judge; a mere failure to comply with its requirements cannot be said to reflect a lack of objectivity implicating the interests of justice. Nor would sentence reversal in such a case be likely to cause the sentencing court to lose its objectivity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gulbrandsen, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 1562, fn. omitted.) Another court has agreed that \u201cmere judicial error is not conclusive evidence of bias or grounds for disqualification [for cause], and this has been held particularly true in cases of sentencing error . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Dorsey) </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1231 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 165] [rejecting the prosecution\u2019s request that the case not be remanded to the trial judge, who had placed the defendant on probation]; see also <em>People v. Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 287 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892] [stating the preference that the trial judge rehear the application for modification of verdict occasioned by this court\u2019s remand in a capital case]; <em>People v. Crew </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1608, fn. 13 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] [rejecting the request of the prosecution that a case remanded for reconsideration of an automatic motion to modify the jury\u2019s verdict of death be remanded to a judge other than the trial judge].) We do not find any indication in the language of section 170.6 that the Legislature intended to alter this practice when it amended the statute in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">In sum, unlike the situation in which a new trial is ordered, when resentencing is all that is required, the parties are not placed in the same position as if there had been no trial. The criminal charges need not be refiled. The parties at an ordinary resentencing hearing do not, as Penal Code section 1180 provides with regard to the granting of a new trial, proffer new evidence on the issues decided by the verdict, nor does the court disregard the original verdict. Rather, unlike the situation of a new trial, where a resentencing hearing is ordered the original trial judge is in the best position to preside, because he or she must exercise sentencing discretion on the basis of the preexisting trial record and verdict. The potential for bias is not great, and in any event is restricted by state constitutional limits on the imposition of an aggregate sentence lengthier than that originally imposed. (See <em>People v. Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355, 357, 360 &amp; fn. 3 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650].) Taking into consideration the applicable statutes, prior court practice, the function of a sentencing hearing, and the limited effect on the judgment of a reviewing court\u2019s order remanding for resentencing, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>conclude that resentencing is not a \u201cnew trial\u201d within the meaning of the Penal Code or Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeal majority in the present case relied upon two civil cases. In one of these cases, the trial court, determining that the defendants had breached a partnership agreement in several respects, entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment in part, but reversed in part because the trial court had erred in admitting certain evidence. The appellate court remanded the matter with directions \u201c \u2018to afford defendants ... an opportunity to present evidence as to the circumstances under which the parties entered into the written partnership agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stegs Investments v. Superior Court, supra, 233 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">On remand, the matter was assigned to the original trial judge. Pursuant to section 170.6, subdivision (2), the defendants moved to disqualify the judge, who rejected the disqualification motion on the ground that the matter had been remanded only to address a single issue and not for a complete new trial. The Court of Appeal disagreed and issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the court to vacate its order. The appellate court explained that section 170.6, subdivision (2) had been amended in 1985 specifically to permit a challenge when a trial judge has been assigned to retry a case that has come before him or her on remand after the judgment was reversed. The Court of Appeal declared: \u201cThe concern expressed by the proponents of the 1985 amendment was that a judge who had been reversed might prove to be biased against the party who successfully appealed the judge\u2019s erroneous ruling at the original trial.\u201d <em>(Stegs Investments </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 233 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 575-576.) The court quoted a legislative committee analysis that described the amendment as \u201c \u2018intended to permit a party to challenge a judge who had been assigned to conduct the \u201cnew trial\u201d of the case in which his or her decision was reversed on appeal. The term \u201cnew trial\u201d is intended to cover situations where <em>the case is to be re-tried </em>and not merely remanded with instructions to perform some specific task (e.g., recalculate interest).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 576, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">The appellate court in the <em>Stegs </em>case determined that a section 170.6 challenge may lie on remand even if the case is to be retried on a limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>issue. \u201cThe legislative history of the 1985 amendment suggests that the applicability of that section does not turn on whether the issue(s) to be resolved on remand are limited, but what the court must do to resolve them.\u201d <em>(Stegs Investments </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 576.) The court contrasted mere ministerial duties on remand with \u201can actual retrial,\u201d concluding that a 170.6 motion would lie as to the latter \u201ceven if that trial involves only one issue . . . .\u201d (233 Cal.App.3d at p. 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">The other case relied upon by the Court of Appeal majority in the present case is <em>Hendershot v. Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th 860. In that case, after a court trial, a $35,012 judgment was entered against a corporation and an individual. The court also awarded punitive damages against the individual defendant. On appeal, the reviewing court reversed the judgment as to the individual defendant but affirmed the judgment against the corporation. The individual defendant sought restitution from the plaintiff because that defendant already had paid the amount of the judgment against him. The Court of Appeal declined to act on the application for an order of restitution and remanded the case to the trial court for decision, noting that \u201c \u2018[tjhere are questions of fact to be resolved by the trial court, including whether amounts paid by [the individual defendant] were on his own behalf or on behalf of [the] Corporation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hendershot v. Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 862.) The individual defendant made a motion for restitution in the trial court and, learning that the matter would be assigned to the original trial judge, filed a challenge pursuant to section 170.6. The trial court rejected the challenge as untimely and \u201c[t]he case was set for trial on the remanded issues.\u201d <em>(Hendershot </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 862.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The Court of Appeal determined that its remand order contemplated a \u201cnew trial\u201d as that term is used in section 170.6, subdivision (2). <em>(Hendershot v. Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 863.) That court joined the court in <em>Stegs </em>in finding that the apparent purpose of the 1985 amendment was to reach cases \u201cin which the trial judge might be perceived as holding a bias against the party that had successfully pressed the appeal that led to reversal of the earlier judgment.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 864.) The appellate court examined the meaning of the term \u201cnew trial\u201d in section 170.6, subdivision (2), noting that the statute itself does not define the term. The court\u2014presented with a civil case\u2014turned to the Code of Civil Procedure for a general definition of the term \u201cnew trial.\u201d That code defines a new trial as \u201ca re-examination of an issue of fact in the same court after a trial and decision by a jury, court, or referee.\u201d (\u00a7 656.) The quoted statute has been construed quite broadly. (See <em>Carney v. Simmonds </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 84, 88-91 [315 P.2d 305].) Pointing out that its remand order involved \u201ca contested issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>which trial court discretion or fact determination is involved,\u201d as well as retrial of one of the contested issues in the original trial, the Court of Appeal in the <em>Hendershot </em>case liberally construed section 170.6 to permit the challenge. <em>(Hendershot v. Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The Court of Appeal majority in the present case distilled from these two cases the principle that when, in a particular case, a remand order vests discretion in the trial court and includes a potential for factfinding, the order contemplates a new trial and the parties should be permitted to challenge the trial judge pursuant to section 170.6, subdivision (2). Petitioner, like the Court of Appeal majority, agrees with the decisions in the <em>Stegs </em>and <em>Hendershot </em>cases and argues that, for the purpose of determining whether a remand is for the purpose of a \u201cnew trial\u201d within the meaning of section 170.6, subdivision (2), the critical issue is the function of the court on remand. Sentencing, petitioner observes, is not a ministerial duty. The particular resentencing decision in his own case, he urges, calls for the exercise of discretion and the determination of disputed factual issues. He points out that at his original sentencing hearing, witnesses testified over a period of two days, and he asserts he intends to present additional evidence at the resentencing hearing in support of his position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">We do not believe that the <em>Stegs </em>and <em>Hendershot </em>cases support the conclusion that, in a remanded criminal case in which resentencing alone remains to be performed, the authority to exercise a section 170.6 challenge should hinge upon a case-by-case analysis of the level of discretion to be exercised by the judge and the degree of factfinding in which the judge will be engaged. We believe it is clear that a resentencing hearing in a criminal case does not constitute a new trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Penal Code contains its own definition of the term \u201cnew trial\u201d\u2014a definition that, as we have seen, does not encompass a remand for resentencing. Section 170.6 certainly applies both to civil and criminal cases, and we do not consider current practice in civil and criminal courtrooms in order to \u201cselectively apply the various provisions of section 170.6, depending on whether a case is criminal or civil.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Lavi) </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1164, 1184 [17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 815, 847 P.2d 1031].) On the other hand, we do not believe that the Legislature contemplated that what constitutes a new trial in a criminal case for the purposes of section 170.6 would be defined by the law in civil cases\u2014especially when a specific Penal Code section defines the term \u201cnew trial.\u201d We do not perceive any anomaly in the Legislature\u2019s intent that the term \u201cnew trial\u201d be applied for disqualification purposes as that term is defined either by the Code of Civil Procedure or by the Penal Code, depending on the nature of the case\u2014particularly when new trials in criminal cases implicate constitutional and other issues that normally are not present when a new trial is ordered in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">In addition, a defendant\u2019s interest in a full and fair sentencing hearing usually is best served when the hearing is presided over by the same judge who heard the evidence at trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Strunk, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 275; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gulbrandsen, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 1562.) A conclusion contrary to the one we reach today actually could harm defendants, should the prosecution be permitted to challenge a judge it regards as too lenient. Further, it may be an implied term of a plea agreement that the judge who accepted the plea also preside at sentencing\u2014and at any resentencing hearing. (See <em>People v. Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 756-757.) We have not discovered any indication in the language of section 170.6, subdivision (2) or in the legislative history of the 1985 amendment that the Legislature intended to permit the prosecutor to defeat this interest of the defendant by challenging the judge under section 170.6 when the reviewing court has remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Petitioner and the majority in the Court of Appeal both refer to the asserted purpose of the language added to section 170.6, subdivision (2) by the 1985 amendment and conclude that the Legislature intended to protect, in <em>all </em>circumstances, parties who have prevailed on appeal from the presumed ire or potential bias of trial judges whose rulings have been reversed. Petitioner relies on <em>Stags, Hendershot, </em>and other civil cases for the proposition that a section 170.6 challenge should be permitted at any hearing in which there is <em>any </em>potential for bias. He quotes a relatively recent civil case: \u201cAssuming, as the Legislature did, that a judge may react with a certain pique to the negative treatment of his or her decisions by an appellate court, this situation [partial reversal of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment] is obviously one in which the potential for bias exists.\u201d <em>(Stubblefield Construction Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 762, 766 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 121], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">The legislative history of the 1985 enactment does not support the assertion that the Legislature intended to permit a section 170.6 challenge at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>hearing on remand in a criminal case that calls for the exercise of trial court discretion. Even the <em>Stegs </em>decision and the legislative history it quotes describe the term \u201cnew trial\u201d as referring to \u201c \u2018situations where the case is to be re-tried\u2019 \u201d\u2014a situation that is not presented when the court\u2019s only function on remand is to conduct a new sentencing hearing. <em>(Stegs Investments </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 576.) Petitioner\u2019s assertion also is incompatible with the evolution of the 1985 amendment as it passed through the Legislature. Initially, the language of the proposed amendment apparently would have applied to any hearing on remand, but that language was amended to refer instead to cases in which the trial judge was assigned to conduct a <em>new trial. </em>(Compare \u00a7 170.6, subd. (2), with Assem. Bill No. 1213 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Mar. 4, 1985, \u00a7 1 [stating that following reversal of a trial court\u2019s decision, a challenge may be made \u201cupon assignment of the trial judge in the prior proceedings to rehear the matter\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Like other appellate courts, we anticipate little risk that a trial judge whose order has been reversed on appeal will perform the resentencing function in a biased manner in reaction to the reversal. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Gulbrandsen, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1562-1563.) As noted, if the reversal is required by reason of sentencing error, the technical and complex nature of the sentencing law renders the error understandable and not particularly embarrassing to the judge. Moreover, in another circumstance that distinguishes criminal from civil trials, it is very significant that the state Constitution greatly circumscribes the power of the trial judge on remand to impose a harsher aggregate sentence at the resentencing hearing. (See <em>People v. Hanson, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 357, 360 &amp; fn. 3.) We also observe that the reviewing court has authority, either on its own motion or at the request of a party, to order that sentencing take place before another judge when the defendant\u2019s interest in sentencing by the trial judge is outweighed by the potential that the trial judge will be biased. (\u00a7 170.1, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Protecting parties from the bias that a trial judge might exhibit after a reversal is a laudable goal, but one that does not take precedence over every other element of a fair trial. There is no indication that the Legislature intended section 170.6, subdivision (2) to permit a peremptory challenge whenever there exists even a <em>potential </em>for bias arising out of a judge\u2019s reaction to being reversed on appeal, especially when permitting such a challenge would contravene other statutory provisions. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Superior Court (Jimenez), supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 806 [applying the Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (p) requirement for remand to the original trial judge, despite the filing of a \u00a7 170.6 challenge in that case].) Accordingly, we cannot agree with petitioner and the Court of Appeal majority that a section 170.6 challenge will lie whenever the potential exists that a judge who is called upon to exercise discretion might react adversely to a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>Petitioner also urges that section 170.6 is to be liberally construed and that \u201cthe trend is to grant relief unless absolutely forbidden by statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Maloy) </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 391, 395 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].) He refers specifically to a recent decision holding that a peremptory challenge will lie to disqualify a trial judge on remand when the Court of Appeal has reversed the judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaint on the basis of the expiration of the statute of limitations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In reaching this decision, the Court of Appeal relied primarily upon a <em>civil </em>case that held that a section 170.6 motion will lie on remand following the reversal of a grant of summary judgment, and on the <em>Stegs </em>and <em>Hendershot </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Without examining the correctness of the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Maloy), supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 391, we observe that the appellate court in that case placed undue reliance on civil law and failed to recognize the significant differences between civil and criminal law as they relate to new trials. Further, <em>Maloy </em>contemplated a proceeding in which the trier of fact eventually would resolve the issues without reference to any previous verdict, clearly distinguishing that case from a case involving a resentencing hearing. Finally, with respect to the assertion that section 170.6 must be given a liberal construction, our own cases have observed that because of the dangers presented by judge-shopping\u2014by either party\u2014the limits on the number and timing of challenges pursuant to this statute are vigorously enforced. (See <em>Solberg v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 197.) We do not believe that the 1985 amendment of section 170.6, subdivision (2) was intended to eliminate all restrictions on the challenge or to counter every possible situation in which it might be speculated that a court could react negatively to a reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">Our conclusion avoids entangling courts in constitutional questions that are unique to criminal trials and that could arise if a resentencing hearing were to be considered a new trial. The conclusion we reach also avoids the obvious practical difficulties that would be imposed by the decision of the Court of Appeal\u2014a mandatory case-by-case analysis of the question whether a particular sentencing hearing on remand will involve the exercise of trial court discretion sufficient to qualify the proceeding as a new trial within the meaning of section 170.6, and a burdensome requirement that a new sentencing judge reexamine the factual basis for the verdict in order to perform his or her sentencing function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Kennard, J., Werdegar, 1, Chin, J., Brown, J., Moreno, J., and Perluss, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied September 10, 2003.
