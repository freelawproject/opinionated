First, when an employee who has suffered an industrial injury returns to work following a determination the injury has become permanent and stationary, is the employee entitled to temporary disability indemnity (TDI) to compensate him for time off from work while pursuing continuing medical treatment for that permanent injury? Second, does an employer discriminate against the injured employee within the meaning of Labor Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 132a if it requires the employee to use sick and vacation leave when away from the workplace seeking treatment for his permanent injury? We answer both questions in the negative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">Applicant Ronald Lauher had worked as a rehabilitation counselor for petitioner Department of Rehabilitation (employer) for 25 years when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on work-related stress and depression. Dr. Donald Houts submitted a report stating Lauher suffered from Gerstmann\u2019s Syndrome, i.e., a brain lesion causing Lauher to experience learning disabilities, but that he had responded to a number of medications, and his condition was permanent and stationary. Based on this medical report, Lauher entered into a stipulation with his employer and the employer\u2019s adjusting agency, State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF), concluding he had suffered a compensable industrial injury to his psyche causing temporary disability, and that this injury produced a permanent disability of 23 percent, compensable at $140 per week, to a total of $11,970. The stipulation further stated that \u201c[tjhere IS a need for medical treatment to cure or relieve from the effects of said injury. As specified in the report of Donald Houts, M.D., dated 05/12/97.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) thereafter accepted the stipulation and denied Lauher\u2019s additional claims for penalties under section 132a based on allegations that his supervisor had made harassing telephone calls to Lauher and his family, and that employer, before agreeing to the stipulation, had discriminated against Lauher by requiring that he use accrued sick and vacation time for absences to attend medical appointments. The WCJ denied a petition for reconsideration, as did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB or the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">After agreeing to the stipulation, Lauher returned to work. He also continued to see Dr. Houts for treatment. Dr. Houts was available for appointments only during regular business hours. Lauher\u2019s round-trip journey from his office to Dr. Houts\u2019s office is 58 miles. Depending on the traffic, it took Lauher between two and one-half hours to four hours to drive to Dr. Houts\u2019s office, have a session with him, and return to Lauher\u2019s place of employment. Employer informed Lauher he would not be paid his full salary unless he took sick leave or vacation time for time spent away from his office seeing Dr. Houts. Lauher used close to 200 hours of either sick leave or vacation time to cover his medical appointments with Dr. Houts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">Lauher then filed the petition that forms the basis of this case, seeking reimbursement for the sick and vacation leave his employer docked him for time he spent seeing Dr. Houts for poststipulation treatment, as well as penalties for discrimination pursuant to section 132a. SCIF responded and explained that it had paid Lauher industrial disability leave and TDI for- his period of temporary disability, but that he was not entitled to receive either benefit in the future because his industrial injury had become permanent and stationary. Because, according to the stipulation, Lauher was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>\u201cfuture medical treatment,\u201d SCIF alleged that employer \u201ccontinues to provide\u201d for such treatment and denied any discrimination: \u201c[Employer] has not discriminated against the applicant regarding non-reinstatement/reimbursement of leave time. The Employer\u2019s policy in this regard is based on good faith business necessity and has been universally applied in industrial and non-industrial injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">The WCJ ruled that Lauher \u201cestablished a nexus between his industrial injury and [his employer\u2019s] conduct of requiring him to take sick leave to attend doctor\u2019s appointments.\u201d Specifically, citing section 4600, the WCJ ruled that Lauher was \u201centitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the form of medical treatment\u201d and that includes \u201c \u2018all reasonable expenses of transportation, meals and lodging\u2019 and \u2018one day of temporary disability indemnity for each day of wages lost. . . .\u2019 The worker\u2019s permanent and stationary status has no bearing on his entitlement to receive treatment. Labor Code \u00a7 4600 does not say that the worker will be considered temporarily disabled on the day that he goes for treatment, but it says that the worker will be entitled to receive temporary disability indemnity for each day of lost wages. If a worker goes for treatment and must miss time from work, the worker should not be assessed sick leave but, rather, should be paid at the temporary disability rate for the time lost.\u201d Further, the WCJ held employer had not established that a good faith business necessity justified docking Lauher\u2019s sick leave under these circumstances and concluded employer had unlawfully discriminated against Lauher. Accordingly, the WCJ ordered employer to pay a penalty of 10 percent \u201cof the cost of all past, present and future medical treatment in this case\u201d and also ordered employer to pay Lauher $10,000 for violating section 132a. The WCJ thereafter denied a petition for reconsideration; the WCAB, over one dissent, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">The Court of Appeal disagreed with the WCAB, finding Lauher had not met his burden of presenting a prima facie case of discrimination under section 132a. Accordingly, the appellate court annulled the WCAB\u2019s decision. We granted Lauher\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">More than 90 years ago, our Legislature was directed to \u201ccreate and enforce a liability on the part of all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by the said employees in the course of their employment irrespective of the fault of either party.\u201d (Cal. Const., former art. XX, \u00a721, added Oct. 10, 1911.) This language was modified by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>amendment adopted on November 5, 1918,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is in the current state Constitution, as renumbered, without substantive change. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) The Legislature complied with this directive by enacting various provisions of the Labor Code. This statutory scheme \u201crest[s] on the underlying notion that the common-law remedy [for industrial injuries to workers], with the requirements of proof incident to that remedy, involves intolerable delay and great economic waste, gives inadequate relief for loss and suffering, operates unequally as between different individuals in like circumstances, and that, whether viewed from the standpoint of the employer or that of the employee, it is inequitable and unsuited to the conditions of modem industry.\u201d <em>(Western Indemnity Co. v. Pillsbury </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 686, 693 [151 P. 398].)  \u201c[T]he theory of [the workers\u2019 compensation] legislation is that the risk of injury to workmen in the industries governed by the law should be borne by the industries, rather than by the individual workman alone. As the ultimate result, the burden imposed in the first instance upon the employer, will, it is said, be distributed, as part of the cost of production, among the consuming public.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">\u201cThis system attempts to assure employees of an expeditious remedy both adequate and certain, independent of any fault on the part of employees and employers. At the same time, it provides the employer with a liability which is determinable within defined limits. It represents a philosophy that industry, as a cost of doing business, should provide for the care and rehabilitation of workers disabled by work injuries. In this way, society supports the program as a[n] integral element of commerce and industry, rather than through tax-supported plans.\u201d (1 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (6th ed. 2001) \u00a7 1.01 [4], p. 1-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">In creating and maintaining a system of workers\u2019 compensation, the people of this state made an important public policy decision and transformed how we address workplace injuries. It should be remembered, however, that the purpose of an award under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme \u201c \u2018is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability. ... In short the award transfers a portion of the loss suffered by the disabled employee from him and his dependents to the consuming public. . . . Complete protection is not afforded the employee from disability because this would constitute an invitation to malinger or to be careless on the job as he would then lose nothing in assuming a disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>status.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Universal City Studios, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worker\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 647, 660 [160 Cal.Rptr. 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Once an injured worker is awarded compensation for an industrial injury and that award is affirmed by the Board, our review of that decision is limited. As to findings of fact, we defer to the Board\u2019s findings if supported by substantial evidence. (\u00a7 5952;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Braewood Convalescent Hospital </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 159, 164 [193 Cal.Rptr. 157, 666 P.2d 14].) While we accord \u201c \u2018significant respect\u2019 \u201d to the Board\u2019s interpretation of statutes in the area of workers\u2019 compensation <em>(Avalon Bay Foods v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1165, 1174 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 552, 959 P.2d 1228] <em>(Avalon)), </em>we subject the Board\u2019s conclusions of law to de novo review <em>(Barnes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 679, 685 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 2 P.3d 1180]; see <em>Western Growers Ins. Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 233 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26] [\u201cQuestions of statutory interpretation are, of course, for this court to decide\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">The Legislature, by enacting section 3202, has helped frame the issue of review by an appellate court. That section provides that issues of compensation for injured workers \u201cshall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d Thus, \u201c \u2018[although the employee bears the burden of proving that his injury was sustained in the course of his employment, the established legislative policy is that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act must be liberally construed in the employee\u2019s favor . . . , and all reasonable doubts as to whether an injury arose out of employment are to be resolved in favor of the employee. [Citation.] <em>This rule is binding upon the board and this court.\u2019\u2019\u201d (Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 280 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978].) Moreover, whether an employee\u2019s injury arose out of his employment is not the only question subject to this rule: \u201cAll aspects of workers\u2019 compensation law ... are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker.\u201d <em>(Save Mart Stores v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number><em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 720, 723 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">With this standard of review in mind, we turn to the first issue posed in this case: Was Lauher entitled to TDI to reimburse him for wages lost while pursuing medical treatment for a permanent and stationary industrial injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">B. <em>Entitlement to TDI to Replace Wages Lost Attending Medical Appointments for Treatment of a Permanent and Stationary Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">Lauher contends that \u201cas a necessary means to the end of ensuring prompt medical treatment [pursuant to section 4600], [an] employee is entitled to temporary total disability indemnity for the time lost from work while attending necessary medical treatment.\u201d As we explain, because his industrial injury had become permanent and stationary, he was no longer entitled to receive TDI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Two of the types of benefits available to the worker injured on the job are temporary disability indemnity, or TDI, and permanent disability indemnity, or PDI. Although both take the form of financial benefits, \u201c[i]t must be remembered that temporary disability indemnity and permanent disability indemnity were intended by the Legislature to serve entirely different functions. Temporary disability indemnity serves as wage replacement during the injured worker\u2019s healing period for the industrial injury. [Citation.] In contrast, permanent disability indemnity compensates for the residual handicap and/or impairment of function after maximum recovery from the effects of the industrial injury have been attained. [Citation.] Permanent disability serves to assist the injured worker in his adjustment in returning to the labor market. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Maples v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 827, 836 [168 Cal.Rptr. 884]; see also <em>Nickelsberg </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 288, 294 [285 Cal.Rptr. 86, 814 P.2d 1328].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">That TDI is intended as wage replacement is inferable from section 4653, which requires temporary total disability be calculated as \u201ctwo-thirds of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability, consideration being given to the ability of the injured employee to compete in an open labor market.\u201d Because \u201c[t]emporary disability indemnity is intended primarily to substitute for the worker\u2019s lost wages, in order to maintain a steady stream of income\u201d <em>(J. T. Thorp, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 327, 333 [200 Cal.Rptr. 219]; <em>Braewood Convalescent Hospital </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 168), an employer\u2019s obligation to pay TDI to an injured worker ceases when such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>replacement income is no longer needed. Thus, the obligation to pay TDI ends when the injured employee either returns to work <em>(Huston v. Workers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 856, 868 [157 Cal.Rptr. 355]; see also \u00a7 4651.1) or is deemed able to return to work <em>(Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1942) 54 Cal.App.2d 585, 586-587 [129 P.2d 737]), or when the employee\u2019s medical condition achieves permanent and stationary status <em>(Industrial Indem. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 99 [202 P.2d 850]; see generally <em>Kopitske v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 623, 631 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 216]; <em>Ritchie v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1179 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 722]; 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed., Peterson et al. edits., 2002) \u00a7 7.02[1], p. 7-7 (Hanna)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">By contrast, section 4650 provides that the first permanent disability payment must be made by the employer within \u201c14 days after the date of the last payment of temporary disability indemnity.\u201d From this, we may infer the Legislature anticipates an employer has.no legal obligation to pay PDI until the obligation to pay TDI has ceased. Accordingly, we held in <em>LeBoeuf v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 234 [193 Cal.Rptr. 547, 666 P.2d 989] that \u201c[t]he right to permanent disability compensation does not arise until the injured worker\u2019s condition becomes \u2018permanent and stationary.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238, fn. 2.) \u201cA disability is considered permanent after the employee has reached maximum medical improvement or his or her condition has been stationary for a reasonable period of time.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 10152; see <em>Gee </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1422, fn. 3 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 105]; 1 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.03, pp. 8-16 to 8-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">That Lauher\u2019s industrial injury was permanent and stationary is undisputed. Lauher\u2019s physician, Dr. Houts, so reported, and Lauher entered into a stipulation with SCIF to that effect. That Lauher had returned to work is also undisputed. Under these circumstances, we conclude he was not entitled to any further TDI payments to compensate him for wages lost due to his attending medical appointments during the workday. \u201cAn injured employee cannot be temporarily and permanently disabled at the same time; thus, permanent disability payments do not begin until temporary disability payments cease.\u201d <em>(City of Martinez v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 601, 609 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 588]; see also <em>Ritchie v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180 [same]; <em>New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 502, 507 [238 P.2d 1046] [same]; 1 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.02[1], p. 7-8 [same].) Here, Lauher had passed out of the healing period (for which TDI serves as a wage replacement) and had agreed to a stipulation compensating him for his diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>ability in the workplace due to a permanent and stationary injury. Because Lauher had begun collecting PDI, he was no longer entitled to TDI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">Lauher\u2019s counterarguments are not persuasive. As did the WCJ, he first relies on section 4600, which relates generally to medical and hospital treatment for an injured worker. That section provides in pertinent part that \u201cMedical, surgical, chiropractic, acupuncture, and hospital treatment, including nursing, medicines, medical and surgical supplies, crutches, and apparatus, including orthotic and prosthetic devices and services, that is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of the injury shall be provided by the employer.\u201d He contends that section 4600 should be liberally construed to include replacement of lost wages occasioned by an employee\u2019s medical treatment. Although he is correct that \u201c[t]he Legislature intended that section 4600 shall be liberally interpreted in favor of the employee\u2019s right to obtain reimbursement\u201d <em>(McCoy </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 82, 86 [48 Cal.Rptr. 858, 410 P.2d 362]; <em>Rodriguez v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1747, 1758 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 93]), he is incorrect that even a liberal interpretation of section 4600 will extend so far as to authorize the payment of <em>temporary </em>disability indemnity to replace lost wages when an injury has become <em>permanent </em>and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">Lauher apparently would have us analogize the right to reimbursement for sick and vacation leave used for seeking continuing treatment for a permanent and stationary industrial injury to the right to reimbursement for transportation costs. Citing <em>Avalon, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 1165, <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 372 [257 Cal.Rptr. 240], and <em>Bundock </em>v. <em>Herndon and Finnigan </em>(1923) 10 I.A.C. 32, Lauher contends that because section 4600 has been construed liberally to compensate an injured worker for transportation costs associated with obtaining medical treatment, we similarly should conclude he is entitled to TDI to compensate him for wages lost while seeking treatment with Dr. Houts. We disagree because the two situations are not comparable. In <em>Avalon, </em>we observed that although section 4600 \u201cdoes not expressly refer to medical treatment transportation expenses as an aspect of medical treatment benefits, they have consistently been so regarded under the workers\u2019 compensation laws. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Avalon, supra, </em>at p. 1173.) \u201cThe board\u2019s practice . . . of awarding medical treatment transportation expenses,\u201d we observed, \u201cis of long standing,\u201d noting that such benefits have been paid \u201c[a]s early as 1923.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1174.) No comparable precedent exists for compensating an injured employee for his wage loss once his injury becomes permanent and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">Nor is Lauher\u2019s claim for TDI to offset the associated wage loss he would incur should he fail to use his sick and vacation leave during his appointments with Dr. Houts supportable as a conceptual matter. Lauher argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>\u201c[i]t necessarily [follows] that if an injured worker <em>loses wages </em>from attending necessary and mandated . . . medical treatment, there is a resultant chilling effect on the injured worker\u2019s ability to obtain medical treatment.\u201d (Italics added.) We disagree and reiterate that although TDI is intended as a wage replacement while the injured worker is healing from his injury, once the injury becomes permanent and stationary and/or the employee returns to work, any future benefits authorized by the workers\u2019 compensation scheme are not intended as wage replacement. The worker is provided medical benefits, including reimbursement for transportation costs <em>(Avalon, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 1165), during the healing period in order to enable him to return to productive employment and to prevent him from becoming a public charge. Once he returns to work, in addition to the wages he earns, he is also compensated in the form of PDI for the permanent diminution of his abilities caused by his industrial injuries.  The system of workers\u2019 compensation is not intended to provide full and total recompense for any and all consequences of a worker\u2019s injury, but instead represents a compromise between the interests of workers and those of employers. As the Court of Appeal reasoned below, quoting <em>Mead v. Diamond International Corporation </em>(1974) 39 Cal.Comp.Cases 1, 4; \u201c \u2018[I]n compensation practice day in and day out employees are totally uncompensated for wages lost while attending to medical treatment during their work day. It has long been considered that in exchange for that blanket coverage of compensation without regard to fault, the employee bears some of the burden.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting the trial referee in <em>Mead.) </em>We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">Although Lauher relies on specific language in section 4600 mentioning reimbursement for transportation expenses, such language applies to a specific and discrete situation not present in this case. Thus, the second paragraph of section 4600 provides in part: \u201c <em>Where at the request of the employer, the employer\u2019s insurer, the administrative director, the appeals board, or a workers \u2019 compensation judge, </em>the employee submits to <em>examination </em>by a physician, he or she shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other benefits herein provided all reasonable expenses of transportation, meals, and lodging incident to reporting for the examination, <em>together with one day of temporary disability indemnity for each day of wages lost in submitting to the </em>examination.\u201d (Italics added.) Contrary to the views of both Lauher and the WCJ below, this specific statutory benefit is not a broad obligation to pay TDI to replace an employee\u2019s wages for time away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>work while pursuing medical treatment for a permanent and stationary injury. Rather, this benefit is in the nature of a medical-legal benefit, reimbursing the employee for his time when requested to submit to a medical examination to resolve a compensation claim. Lauher cannot take advantage of this benefit, both because his semi-regular treatment with Dr. Houts is not undertaken at the request of one of the enumerated entities, such as his employer or SCIF, and because his appointments with Dr. Houts are for continuing treatment, not for an \u201cexamination\u201d connected with resolving an application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Finally, Lauher argues the Schedule of Administrative Penalties, Administrative Director Rule 10111.1 (a)(4), which is codified in California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 10111.1, subdivision (a)(4) (hereafter rule 10111.1), indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent that section 4600 be interpreted broadly enough to authorize payment of TDI to reimburse an employee for time away from work seeking medical treatment even though the employee\u2019s injury has become permanent and stationary. The Board accepted this argument as further support for awarding TDI to reimburse Lauher for time spent out of the office seeking treatment with Dr. Houts, but, with due respect to the Board, we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">Section 129, subdivision (a) provides in part: \u201cTo make certain that injured workers, and their dependents in the event of their death, receive promptly and accurately the full measure of compensation to which they are entitled, the administrative director shall audit insurers, self-insured employers, and third-party administrators to determine if they have met their obligations under this code.\u201d In connection with this auditing procedure, section 129.5, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe administrative director may assess an administrative penalty against an insurer, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator for [enumerated failings].\u201d Finally, section 129.5, subdivision (b) requires the administrative director to \u201cpromulgate regulations establishing a schedule of violations and the amount of the administrative penalty to be imposed for each type of violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">Pursuant to this legislative delegation, the Labor Department\u2019s administrative director promulgated rule 10111.1(a)(4). That provision sets forth a schedule of graduated financial penalties for failures to pay enumerated benefits. In particular, rule 10111.1(a)(4) provides: \u201cThe penalty for each failure to pay mileage fees and bridge tolls when notifying the employee of a medical evaluation scheduled by the claims administrator, in accordance with Labor Code Sections 4600 through 4621; or to pay mileage fees and bridge tolls within 14 days of receiving notice of a medical evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>scheduled by the administrative director or the appeals board; or to object or pay the injured worker for any other transportation, <em>temporary disability, </em>meal or lodging expense <em>incurred to obtain medical treatment </em>or evaluation, within 60 days of receiving a request, is: [f] $25 for $10 or less in expense; [If] $50 for more than $10, to $50, in expense; [f| $75 for more than $50, to $100, in expense; [f] $100 for more than $100 in expense.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Lauher contends this administrative rule, with its specific mention of \u201ctemporary disability,\u201d supports his view that the Legislature intended section 4600 be interpreted to authorize the payment of TDI as a replacement for wages an employee loses while pursuing medical treatment for an industrial injury that has become permanent and stationary. No basis for such a conclusion exists. Read as a whole, rule 10111.1(a) addresses several distinct situations. For example, rule 10111.1(a)(1) addresses the failure to pay the self-imposed penalty for a late indemnity payment pursuant to section 4650, subdivision (d). Rule 10111.1(a)(2) addresses the failure to begin paying permanent disability indemnity in a timely fashion. Rule 10111.1(a)(3) addresses the failure timely to reimburse a worker for self-procured medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">At issue here is rule 10111.1(a)(4). That subsection addresses the failure to pay transportation and associated costs in certain enumerated situations. Thus, it first prescribes an administrative penalty for failing to pay mileage and tolls \u201cwhen notifying the employee of a medical <em>evaluation </em>scheduled by the claims administrator.\u201d (Italics added.) Such an evaluation would typically occur during the healing period when a worker would claim entitlement to TDI, but it could also occur at other times, for example, when the employee\u2019s ability to return to work is undisputed but disagreement exists over the degree of the permanent injury, in which case further medical evaluations may be necessary. Nevertheless, although Labor Code section 4600 specifically provides for payment of transportation expenses and temporary disability when the evaluation is performed at the request of, for example, the employer or the employer\u2019s insurer, neither this clause of rule 10111.1(a)(4) nor Labor Code section 4600 authorizes TDI or wage replacement where, as here, an employee seeks medical treatment for a permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">The second clause of rule 10111.1(a)(4), which sets forth the administrative penalty for failure to pay mileage and tolls \u201cwithin 14 days of receiving notice of a medical evaluation scheduled by the administrative director,\u201d similarly fails to mention wage replacement. Here, too, the medical evaluation referred to would typically occur during the healing period to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>the nature and extent of a worker\u2019s injury in connection with an application for benefits. In the less frequent situation of a medical evaluation conducted after an injury is permanent and stationary, the requirement that the evaluation be \u201cscheduled by the administrative director\u201d would bring the case within the specific language of Labor Code section 4600, which provides for payment of transportation expenses and TDI when submitting to an \u201cexamination\u201d at the \u201crequest\u201d of \u201cthe administrative director.\u201d Again, there is no mention in this clause of TDI or wage replacement where the employee seeks medical treatment on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">Finally, rule 10111.1(a)(4) prescribes a penalty for the \u201cfailure ... to object or pay the injured worker for any other transportation, temporary disability, meal or lodging expense incurred to obtain medical <em>treatment </em>or <em>evaluation, </em>within 60 days of receiving a request.\u201d (Italics added.) This clause of rule 10111.1(a)(4) differs from the first two clauses in two respects. First, unlike the two previous clauses, this clause refers to both \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201cevaluation.\u201d Second, it specifically mentions \u201ctemporary disability.\u201d Although the mention of \u201ctreatment\u201d could refer to medical care after a worker\u2019s industrial injury becomes permanent and stationary, it seems unlikely the administrative director, exercising delegated legislative powers, intended to authorize payment of TDI to replace wages an employee loses while pursuing medical treatment for a permanent and stationary injury, absent any statutory authorization for such a benefit. Moreover, the mere mention of \u201ctemporary disability\u201d in rule 10111.1(a)(4) is insufficient to create a benefit untethered to any statutory authorization. In short, rule 10111.1(a)(4) does not speak at all to the question whether an injured worker is entitled to TDI to compensate him for wages lost while seeking medical treatment <em>once his injury has become permanent and stationary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">In sum, we find no authority for the proposition that an injured worker is entitled to payment of TDI to reimburse him for wages lost while pursuing medical treatment for an industrial injury once that injury has become permanent and stationary. On the contrary, once the employee\u2019s injury is permanent and stationary and, as here, the employee returns to work, he is no longer entitled to TDI. Exercising independent review on this legal question <em>(Barnes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 685), we find the Board erred in ruling otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">C. <em>Discrimination Pursuant to Section 132a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">Lauher next claims that his employer discriminated against him within the meaning of section 132a because he had suffered an industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>injury. This discrimination, he claims, took the form of his employer\u2019s insistence that he use his accumulated sick and vacation leave for the time he was out of the office seeing Dr. Houts for treatment of his injury. Lauher claims he was thus \u201ctreated differently than other employees who had not sustained a work-related injury . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Section 132a provides: \u201cIt is the declared policy of this state that there should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment, [f] (1) Any employer who discharges, or threatens to discharge, <em>or in any manner discriminates </em>against any employee because he or she has filed or made known his or her intention to file a claim for compensation with his or her employer or an application for adjudication, or because the employee has received a rating, award, or settlement, is guilty of a misdemeanor and the employee\u2019s compensation shall be increased by one-half, but in no event more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000),'together with costs and expenses not in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250). Any such employee shall also be entitled to reinstatement and <em>reimbursement </em>for lost wages and <em>work benefits </em>caused by the acts of the employer.\u201d (Italics added.) No criminal penalty is at issue in this case; we address only the Board\u2019s imposition of a $10,000 administrative penalty on Lauher\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">\u201c[T]o warrant an award [pursuant to section 132a] the employee must establish at least a prima facie case of lost wages and benefits caused by the discriminatory acts of the employer.\u201d <em>(Dyer </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1376, 1386 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 30].) The employee must establish discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence <em>(Western Electric Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 629, 640 [160 Cal.Rptr. 436]), at which point the burden shifts to the employer to establish an affirmative defense <em>(Barns v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 524, 531 [266 Cal.Rptr. 503]). Although we defer to the Board\u2019s determination of facts if supported by substantial evidence, we review the Board\u2019s legal decisions de novo, for \u201c[i]t is for the court to decide whether the facts found by the Board constitute a violation of section 132a.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 530-531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">To decide the merits of Lauher\u2019s claim, we must decide what section 132a means when it refers to \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d As one appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>court has noted, \u201c[n]either the Legislature nor the courts have fashioned a clear rule for distinguishing those forms of discrimination which are actionable under section 132a and those forms which are not.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1108 [199 Cal.Rptr. 881] <em>(Smith).) </em>Nevertheless, some boundary markers have been delineated. Under its express terms, an employer may not \u201cdischarge^, or threatenf] to discharge\u201d an employee because, like Lauher, he has filed a claim for compensation. Moreover, citing the prefatory statement that \u201c[i]t is the declared policy of this state that there should not be discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment\u201d (\u00a7 132a), we have explained that the type of discriminatory actions subject to penalty under section 132a is not limited to those enumerated in the statute. Instead, we have interpreted section 132a liberally to achieve the goal of preventing discrimination against workers injured on the job. <em>(Judson Steel Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 666-669 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564].) We immediately cautioned, however, that \u201c[sjection 132a does not compel an employer to ignore the realities of doing business by \u2018reemploying\u2019 unqualified employees or employees for whom positions are no longer available.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">Noting this last passage, the court in <em>Smith, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 1104, held that \u201csave for the two exceptions just described [i.e., reemploying employees who are unqualified or for whom no position is available], action <em>which works to the detriment of the employee </em>because of an injury is unlawful under section 132a.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1109, italics added.) This test of \u201cdetriment\u201d to the employee was accepted as the applicable standard in <em>Barns v. Workers \u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at page 531 (\u201ca worker proves a violation of section 132a by showing that as the result of an industrial injury, the employer engaged in conduct detrimental to the worker\u201d) as well as by at least one commentator (1 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10.11 [1], p. 10-20 [\u201c[t]he critical question is whether the employer\u2019s action caused detriment to an industrially-injured employee\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">The Court of Appeal in this case, however, found the <em>Smith </em>formulation \u201canalytically incomplete.\u201d The court explained that, although Lauher had clearly suffered a detriment by having to use his accumulated sick leave and vacation time for his visits to see Dr. Houts, he never established he \u201chad a legal <em>right </em>to receive TDI and retain his accrued sick leave and vacation time, and that [his employer] had a corresponding legal <em>duty </em>to pay TDI and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>refrain from docking the sick leave and vacation time.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, said the court, \u201c[t]o meet the burden of presenting a prima facie claim of unlawful discrimination in violation of section 132a, it is insufficient that the industrially injured worker show only that. . . he or she suffered some adverse result as a consequence of some action or inaction by the employer that was triggered by the industrial injury. The claimant must also show that he or she had a legal right to receive or retain the deprived benefit or status, and the employer had a corresponding legal duty to provide or refrain from taking away that benefit or status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">We agree that for Lauher merely to show he suffered an industrial injury and that he suffered some detrimental consequences as a result is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of section 132a. As we explained, <em>ante, </em>our system of workers\u2019 compensation does not provide a make-whole remedy.  \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is intended to award compensation for <em>disability </em>incurred in employment. \u2018The purpose of the award is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Worker\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 659-660.) \u201cThe purpose of workmen\u2019s compensation is to rehabilitate, not to indemnify, and its intent is limited to assuring the injured workman subsistence while he is unable to work and to effectuate his speedy rehabilitation and reentry into the labor market.\u201d <em>(Solari v. Atlas-Universal Service, Inc. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 587, 600 [30 Cal.Rptr. 407].) Consistent with this view, for example, section 4653 provides that payment for temporary total disability is only \u201ctwo-thirds of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">An employer thus does not necessarily engage in \u201cdiscrimination\u201d prohibited by section 132a merely because it requires an employee to shoulder some of the disadvantages of his industrial injury. By prohibiting \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in section 132a, we assume the Legislature meant to prohibit treating injured employees differently, making them suffer disadvantages not visited on other employees because the employee was injured or had made a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Lauher claims he was subjected to discrimination within the meaning of section 132a because he \u201cwas treated differently than other employees who had not sustained a work-related injury and were not under the mandates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>the Labor Code.\u201d He claims \u201c[t]he employer\u2019s actions were directly related to the work injury and the resultant time the injured employee had to miss from work because of the medical appointments to cure or relieve the effects of the work injury.\u201d Lauher\u2019s argument fails to appreciate that, although his injury was industrial, nothing suggests his employer <em>singled him out for disadvantageous treatment because of the industrial nature of his injury. </em>We assume that employees with nonindustrial injuries must follow the same rule and use their sick leave when away from the office attending medical treatment. Certainly nothing Lauher alleges suggests otherwise. For example, he does not allege he alone is being singled out for the requirement that he use his sick leave, or that other employees are permitted to leave the office for medical appointments related to nonindustrial injuries and are not required to use their sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">Because Lauher does not allege that other employees are permitted to be away from their workplace for medical care yet need not use their sick leave if they wish to be paid their full salaries, we conclude Lauher fails to demonstrate he was the victim of discrimination within the meaning of section 132a. To hold otherwise would elevate those who had suffered industrial injuries to a point where they enjoyed rights superior to those of their coworkers. Nothing in the history or meaning of section 132a\u2019s anti-discrimination rule supports such an interpretation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">The decision of the Court of Appeal annulling the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-15\"> All further statutory references are to' the Labor Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1328-16\"> Because we find employer did not discriminate against its employee, we need not decide the third issue raised, which concerned whether the Court of Appeal improperly disregarded the factual findings made below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1331-8\"> The 1918 amendment provided in part that the Legislature should \u201ccreate, and enforce a complete system of workmen\u2019s compensation, by appropriate legislation . . . .\u201d (Cal.

In any event, as we find he was not entitled to TDI once his industrial injury became permanent and stationary, SCIF cannot be found to have discriminated against him by failing to pay TDI in this circumstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1342-7\"> As noted, <em>ante, </em>Lauher no longer claims he is entitled to a penalty under section 132a due to his employer\u2019s failure to pay TDI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1343-10\"> Because we find Lauher failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of section 132a, we need not address SCIF\u2019s contention that employer had a legitimate business reason for requiring Lauher to use his sick leave and vacation time when away from the office seeing Dr. Houts for treatment. For the same reason, we also decline to address the argument by amicus curiae California Employment Law Council that we should reexamine and discard the holding of <em>Judson Steel Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>supra, 22 Cal.3d 658, that section 132a should be liberally construed in favor of injured workers. We also decline to address the invitation to reinterpret section 132a to require proof of discriminatory intent. These arguments are not necessary to resolve the present matter and, in any event, were not raised by any party or amicus curiae before the WCJ, the WCAB, or the Court of Appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
