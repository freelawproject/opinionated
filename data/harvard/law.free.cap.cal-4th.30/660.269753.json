J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">After an earlier joint trial on first degree murder indictments ended in mistrial as the result of the prosecution\u2019s intentional misconduct, defendants Tracy L. Batts and Terrance McCrea were retried and convicted of those same charges. The Court of Appeal reversed the convictions, holding that the trial court erred by failing to grant defendants\u2019 pretrial motions to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and remanding with directions to enter judgments of dismissal as to each defendant. We granted review to consider the circumstances under which a prosecutor\u2019s intentional misconduct <em>that results in a mistrial </em>precludes retrial on double jeopardy grounds under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, and under article I, section 15, of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">With regard to th <em>$ federal </em>constitutional double jeopardy issue, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 667 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416] (Kennedy) that under the federal double jeopardy clause a retrial is prohibited following the grant of a defendant\u2019s mistrial motion only if the prosecution committed the misconduct <em>with the intent to provoke a mistrial. </em>Applying this standard and deferring, as <em>Kennedy </em>instructs, to the factual findings of the trial court, we conclude that the prosecution in the earlier trial in this matter had no such intent, and that the Court of Appeal accordingly erred in concluding that the trial court should have granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under federal double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">As we shall explain, however, the standard adopted by the federal high court in <em>Kennedy </em>has been widely viewed as unduly narrow and as not fully protective of the interest that the double jeopardy clause was intended to safeguard, and in the two decades since <em>Kennedy </em>was decided a number of state courts have interpreted the double jeopardy guarantee of their own state constitutions as embodying a broader protection. Although the standards adopted in these more recent decisions vary somewhat from one another and, in our view, have their own shortcomings, we agree with the basic conclusion of these courts that instances in which a prosecutor commits misconduct with the intent to provoke a mistrial do not exhaust the circumstances in which a prosecutor\u2019s intentional misconduct improperly may defeat the interest that the double jeopardy clause is intended to safeguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Accordingly, with regard to the state constitutional double jeopardy issue, we conclude that when prosecutorial misconduct results in a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>successful motion for mistrial, the double jeopardy clause of the California Constitution bars retrial in two circumstances. First, as under the federal Constitution, retrial is barred by the state double jeopardy clause when the prosecution intentionally commits misconduct for the purpose of triggering a mistrial. Second, the state double jeopardy clause also may bar retrial when the prosecution, believing (in view of events that occurred during trial) that a defendant is likely to secure an acquittal at that trial, knowingly and intentionally commits misconduct in order to thwart such an acquittal. In the latter circumstance, however, retrial is barred under the state double jeopardy clause only if a court, reviewing all of the circumstances as of the time of the misconduct, finds not only that the prosecution believed that an acquittal was likely and committed misconduct for the purpose of thwarting such an acquittal, but also determines, from an objective perspective, that the prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of a reasonable prospect of an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In other words, we conclude that when the prosecution in a criminal case commits misconduct that results in a mistrial, the double jeopardy clause of the state Constitution bars retrial in some circumstances in which the federal Constitution, as construed in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, does not. It is important to recognize, however, that although we conclude that the state double jeopardy standard is properly protective of a broader range of double jeopardy interests than the standard set forth in <em>Kennedy, </em>as a practical matter retrial is likely to be barred under the state double jeopardy standard only in exceptional circumstances, because the standard we adopt requires not only that the prosecutor subjectively believe that an acquittal was likely when he or she intentionally committed misconduct, but also that a court determine <em>from an objective perspective </em>that the misconduct <em>actually </em>deprived the defendant of the reasonable prospect of an acquittal. The state double jeopardy standard is appropriately stringent, because the normal and usually sufficient remedy for the vast majority of instances of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct that occur at trial is provided under the federal and state <em>due process </em>clauses, and calls for either a declaration of mistrial followed by retrial, or a reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction on appeal followed by retrial. The remedy mandated by the double jeopardy clause\u2014an order barring retrial and leading to the dismissal of the criminal charges against the defendant without trial\u2014is an unusual and extraordinary measure that properly should be invoked only with great caution. As we shall explain, we further conclude that, under the applicable standard, in this case retrial was not barred by the state double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Because we conclude that retrial of defendants was not barred under either the federal or state double jeopardy clause, we reverse the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Court of Appeal, which set aside defendants\u2019 subsequent convictions on double jeopardy grounds. In light of the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion on the double jeopardy issue, it did not reach or resolve the additional issues raised by defendants on appeal regarding the conduct of their subsequent trial, and we shall remand the matter to the Court of Appeal to permit it to address those remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">This case was tried three times: in 1998 (a trial in which Batts was the sole defendant, following which a new trial was granted); in late 1999 (a joint trial of both defendants, Batts and McCrea, ending in mistrial); and finally in 2000 (again, a joint trial of both defendants). The first and third trials resulted in first degree murder convictions. Events at the second trial, which as noted ended in a mistrial, give rise to the double jeopardy claim in the present appeal from the convictions and judgment rendered in the third trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Brothers Benczeon Jones and Brian Jones were young members of the Atlantic Drive Crips, a criminal street gang in Compton. On September 12, 1997, Benczeon was washing his car in front of an apartment building when defendants Tracy Batts and Terrance McCrea (both older members of the Atlantic Drive Crips gang) and a third man approached him and told him to leave the area, \u201cor something gonna happen.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brian came out of his apartment and, together with Benczeon, argued with defendants, who then departed. But defendants soon returned, Batts with a gun in each hand, and McCrea with a single weapon. They fired several shots, killing Brian and wounding Benczeon in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Brian\u2019s girlfriend, Sonique Steward, from her apartment, saw Batts arrive. When she heard shots she ran outside and saw Brian dead and Benczeon prone and bleeding. She testified that Benczeon told her that \u201cTracy\u201d had shot him, and that she immediately telephoned 911 and reported that Tracy had shot her boyfriend. Two men came upon the scene and dragged Benczeon toward the back of a building. Benczeon told them that defendants were the shooters.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Within hours of the shooting, Batts entered a hospital seeking treatment for a gunshot wound to his right shoulder. Batts was evasive with the officer who interviewed him, stating that he did not know where he had been when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>he was shot, and that he did not know who shot him. He later told another officer that he had been shot in Long Beach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">When interviewed at the hospital, Benczeon told the police that defendants had shot him. Benczeon also identified Batts from a photographic lineup, but further stated that he was afraid for his family and did not want to testify or otherwise cooperate with the police. Thereafter, Batts\u2019s brother paid a visit to Benczeon in the hospital, leaving Benczeon upset and crying. Benczeon stated that Batts\u2019s brother had told him not to testify and impliedly had threatened Benczeon\u2019s family. In November 1997, Benczeon\u2019s 10-year-old brother received a telephone call threatening Benczeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Several weeks after the shooting, Benczeon attended a photographic lineup and identified McCrea and again identifed Batts. In January of 1998, McCrea\u2019s wife, Leslie Jones, contacted police to report a domestic assault. She informed an officer that McCrea had told her that he had killed persons before\u2014including a \u201ccousin in Compton\u201d\u2014and that she was afraid of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In January of 1998, Benczeon was shot and wounded by an unknown person. Benczeon believed that the shooting was related to his brother\u2019s killing and to his own involvement in the case against defendants. Nevertheless, Benczeon testified against defendant Batts in the first trial in this case in June 1998, implicating both Batts and McCrea in the September 12, 1997, shootings. (At that time, McCrea had not yet been apprehended, and thus the prosecution had proceeded to trial against Batts alone.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Defendant Batts was convicted at the first trial of murder, but subsequently was granted a retrial based on newly discovered evidence\u2014a confession of guilt from one Richard Nava, who at that time was awaiting sentencing on another gang-related murder and was housed in the same county jail module as defendant Batts.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">In March 1999\u2014nine months after the 1998 trial\u2014Benczeon was brutally murdered after being chased and shot by assailants in two vehicles and then struck several times by traffic on a Compton street, in territory controlled by the Atlantic Drive Crips. No link between Benczeon\u2019s murder and defendants ever was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Meanwhile, defendant McCrea had been apprehended. The People then went forward with a second trial, this one a joint proceeding against both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>defendants, held in late 1999. Benczeon\u2019s testimony from the first trial was read to the jury at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Benczeon\u2019s testimony was admissible against Batts under two provisions of the Evidence Code: section 1291, permitting former testimony offered against a party to the earlier proceeding, and section 1231, which under certain circumstances allows admission of a decedent\u2019s sworn statements regarding gang-related crimes. Because McCrea was not a party to the first trial, Benczeon\u2019s testimony was admissible against McCrea under only the latter provision, section 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">One of the requirements for admissibility under Evidence Code section 1231 is that the decedent must have perished from <em>other than </em>natural causes. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).) Section 1231.4 further provides: \u201cIf evidence of a prior statement is introduced pursuant to this article, <em>the jury may not be told that the declarant died from other than natural causes, but shall merely be told that the declarant is </em>unavailable.\u201d (Italics added.) Consistent with this statutory mandate, the trial court issued an order tracking the statute\u2019s directive and emphasized several times before and during the trial to both the prosecution and the defense that counsel were not to mention Benczeon\u2019s death in front of the jury, and instead were to approach the bench should any such issue arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The events that led to termination of the second trial are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Prosecution witness Detective Marvin Branscomb, who had testified at the first trial, recounted on cross-examination that he had interviewed Benczeon shortly after the September 12, 1997, shooting, while Benczeon was in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds to his leg, and that at that time Benczeon was \u201cnoncooperative,\u201d frightened, and concerned for his mother and other family members. Branscomb explained that he advised Benczeon of the district attorney\u2019s \u201cwitness relocation program,\u201d and told him \u201cthat we could see to it that he was part of that.\u201d Benczeon did not respond to the offer, but Branscomb advised him that he would discuss the possibility of the witness protection plan with Benczeon\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Branscomb further testified that he did \u201ceventually\u201d give Benczeon $1,500 in cash from the witness protection program, to be used for first and last month\u2019s rent for a new apartment. But, Branscomb stated, he gave Benczeon that money on October 6, 1998\u2014four months <em>after </em>Benczeon testified at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Counsel for Batts, Stanley Granville, proceeded during the course of further cross-examination to ridicule Branscomb\u2019s testimony. Granville\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>questions highlighted the absence of documentary evidence that the cash actually was used for relocation rent, and emphasized the four-month gap between Benczeon\u2019s earlier testimony and the relocation payment. Finally, Granville asked Branscomb whether the funds truly were just a \u201cpayoff\u2019 for Benczeon\u2019s testimony. Granville also emphasized in his examination the circumstance that, after the payment, Benczeon \u201cnever showed up\u201d at various preliminary hearings that were held in defendants\u2019 cases. Of course, pursuant to article I, section 30, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution (added by Proposition 115 in 1990), Benczeon\u2019s hearsay statements made to Detective Branscomb were admissible through the detective, and hence he was not required to testify at those preliminary hearings. And in any event, as to one of those hearings, it was impossible for Benczeon to attend, because he had been murdered\u2014a fact that, pursuant to the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling, was to be kept from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The two trial prosecutors were concerned that in light of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination, the jury may have been left with the impression that the prosecution had \u201cpaid off\u2019 Benczeon for his testimony and then had made sure that Benczeon was not available to testify at subsequent preliminary hearings and before the jury in the second trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Seeking to rebut that implication, and deliberately ignoring the trial court\u2019s order that counsel not elicit testimony concerning the reason for Benczeon\u2019s unavailability without first discussing that matter with the court, the trial prosecutors took the following action. They met with Detective Branscomb during a recess, advised him that he would be asked on redirect examination why Benczeon did not appear at a specific preliminary hearing, and that in reply Branscomb \u201cshould tell the truth.\u201d The prosecutors also cautioned the detective, however, that prior to answering their question, he was to \u201cmake a significant pause,\u201d in order to afford defense counsel an opportunity to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">During the ensuing redirect examination, one of the deputy district attorneys, Phillip Stirling, referred to the May 10, 1999 preliminary hearing that had been held for defendant McCrea, and inquired whether Benczeon had testified at that hearing. Detective Branscomb answered, \u201cno.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d Branscomb answered, \u201cHe was murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The court called a recess and, outside the presence of the rest of the jury, questioned a juror who, the bailiff reported, had broken down in tears in response to Branscomb\u2019s answer. Both defendants moved for a mistrial. Thereafter the trial court held an extensive hearing on those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Deputy District Attorney Larry Droeger argued that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Branscomb deliberately had misled the jury concerning the reason for Benczeon\u2019s absence from the prior proceedings and the trial, by suggesting that the prosecutors had paid off their witness after the first trial and then had taken further action to ensure that the witness remained unavailable, all so that the present jury would hear peijured testimony without subjecting Benczeon to cross-examination. Droeger argued that the message inherent in the cross-examination, \u201cif accepted by the jury,\u201d would \u201cdevastate\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d the credibility of both Benczeon and Branscomb, and that it had impugned both prosecutors. Droeger continued: \u201cHow do we respond to that? Do we sit there and allow our credibility, our reputation to be attacked, the witness\u2019 credibility to be destroyed when it is a lie? I can\u2019t imagine what else we\u2019re supposed to do and what else any lawyer would expect us to do after that kind of attack.\u201d Finally, Droeger asserted that Detective Branscomb had been instructed to pause, and that \u201cthere was a significant pause,\u201d and yet there was no objection. From that, Droeger argued, it might be inferred that \u201cthey wanted this situation. They wanted the opportunity to ask for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In response, defense counsel argued that there was no reason to object, because defendants had a right to rely upon the trial court\u2019s prior rulings, and counsel had no reason to suspect that that the prosecutors or the witness would violate the court\u2019s explicit orders that the reason for Benczeon\u2019s absence not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In ruling upon defendants\u2019 motions for mistrial, the court observed that defense counsel\u2019s questioning \u201ccertainly could be interpreted as unfair questioning and unfair inferences. The People argued that that did, in fact, provide to the jury an unfair picture. And I\u2019m inclined to think that it did.\u201d But, the court continued, even conceding that the prosecutors \u201cdid appropriately feel [that] they had been boxed in to an extent and perhaps been taken unfair advantage of,\u201d the prosecutors could and should have approached the bench and asked to work out a solution, and that \u201c[t]here were other ways to make that jury absolutely clear that Benczeon Jones did not testify as a result of being paid off and lacking interest but rather that there were other good, legitimate legal reasons why Benczeon Jones wasn\u2019t there.\u201d The court noted that it was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by both the prosecutor\u2019s question and the answer. The court found that under the circumstances there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>reasonable opportunity for defense counsel to object, and that the prosecutors had acted in \u201creckless disregard [of] the rights of the defendants in posing this question under the circumstances without it being screened.\u201d The court concluded that the prosecution \u201ccommitted misconduct in presenting the question at issue. And knowing what its response would be, the error caused by such conduct is too serious to be corrected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The trial court granted the motions for mistrial and then explained to the jury that it had done so, and the basis for its ruling. The court advised the parties that the matter later would be assigned to a court for further proceedings, possibly back to himself. Eventually the case was reassigned to the same trial judge\u2014Honorable Jack W. Morgan\u2014for retrial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Five weeks after the mistrial, and prior to the start of the third trial in this matter, Attorney William Ringgold, new counsel for defendant Batts, moved to dismiss on the basis that retrial was barred on double jeopardy grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The motion was based exclusively upon <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2089-2090], in which the high court held that retrial is barred following a defendant\u2019s successful motion for mistrial if the prosecution <em>intended </em>to cause a mistrial. At a hearing conducted by Judge Morgan, Ringgold argued that retrial was barred because, in counsel\u2019s view, the prosecution had intended, by its misconduct, to cause a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Although Ringgold\u2019s motion relied upon only the federal Constitution, Attorney Cedric Payne, McCrea\u2019s counsel, in joining Ringgold\u2019s motion, stated that he was moving for dismissal under the double jeopardy provision of the California Constitution as well as under the federal Constitution, and he asserted that he assumed Ringgold would agree that the motion should be considered under both constitutional provisions. Payne further asserted that the approach set out in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, \u201cencompasses what the rules are not only [under] the United States Constitution but I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>California has somewhat adopted that position, as well.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] And [that approach requires a trial court to focus upon] whether or not, in the court\u2019s view,\u201d the prosecution intended to cause a mistrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court proceeded to resolve the dismissal motion by determining, under <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, \u201cwhether or not the misconduct that occurred was in the view of the court caused by [the] prosecution\u2019s desire to cause a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After hearing defense counsel\u2019s arguments, the trial court called upon trial Prosecutor Larry Droeger. (Prosecutor Stirling was absent.) Droeger commenced by noting that he was \u201cin a position of arguing . . . something of which I have personal knowledge,\u201d namely his and Stirling\u2019s respective intent when they met with Detective Branscomb at the recess during the second trial, directed him to \u201ctell the truth,\u201d and then proceeded to ask the detective, on redirect examination, why Benczeon had not been present at a certain preliminary hearing proceeding. Droeger offered to give his testimony under oath, but also added that any representation that he would make to the court would be made \u201cas if it were under oath.\u201d Neither defense counsel asked that Droeger actually take an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Droeger told the court that when he and Stirling made their decisions concerning their examination of Detective Branscomb, mistrial was \u201cthe farthest thing\u201d from their minds. Droeger asserted that in their private discussions preceding the misconduct, the prosecutors had felt personally attacked, causing them to \u201clet our emotional response overcome our rational response to the circumstances.\u201d He explained their belief that the defense had opened the door to inquiry concerning the true reason for Benczeon\u2019s absence at trial, and that simply asking Branscomb the question, rather than first proceeding to a sidebar discussion with the court and opposing counsel, was the appropriate way to \u201cseize the moment.\u201d But, Droeger acknowledged, \u201cthat is where we made our mistake.\u201d Droeger further explained: \u201c[The] one thing we thought we should do [was] tell the detective don\u2019t answer the question right away. They\u2019ll object. And then we\u2019ll go argue it at sidebar at that time .... And that was really the way we felt it was going to go down. We were perhaps as shocked as the court when the answer came out and when they didn\u2019t object. . . . [I]n our minds, we felt we were absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sure that they were going to object when [Prosecutor Stirling] asked that question. . . . So in terms of our intention, . . . neither of us intended that we obtain a mistrial. Neither of us expected that a mistrial was going to be, in fact, granted until the court made its ruling. And it wasn\u2019t until then that we then started looking at it a little more rationally and in hindsight realized that we did make a tactical mistake in how we proceeded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The trial court stated that, pursuant to its reading of <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, it would consider \u201cthe conduct and the circumstances and everything . . . that was involved in the trial . . . [i]n order to . . . make a determination as to whether or not, in fact, the District Attorney not only committed misconduct . . . but [also] whether or not that misconduct, in fact, was designed to cause a mistrial or whether it arose out of other circumstances justifiable and unjustifiable.\u201d The court noted it had observed the events leading up to the mistrial and that it had \u201ca reasonable recollection of what was said and done.\u201d The court stated that in determining whether the district attorney intended to cause a mistrial, it would \u201clook at the circumstances at [the time of the mistrial] in their totality . . . [a]nd from that, try to reason and judge whether the District Attorney would, in fact, want a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Following that approach, the trial court first asserted that, until the time of the mistrial, the case was \u201coverall. . . going very well for the People.\u201d The court recalled, \u201cwhen I was evaluating this for several hours the night before I made the ruling ... I was perplexed for among other reasons as to how this could occur when the District Attorney had things going, in this court\u2019s view, reasonably well from the People\u2019s point of view a strong case, strong evidence that had already been presented.\u201d The court stated that its \u201chonest evaluation\u201d was that \u201ca District Attorney sitting in the circumstances that they were sitting in at the time would want to proceed and have a decision.\u201d The court acknowledged that the cross-examination suggesting that the People had paid off Benczeon, <em>\u201cif left without </em>rebuttal. . . would have been a potential negative.\u201d (Italics added.) But, as the court previously had observed at the hearing on the mistrial motion, the prosecution <em>had </em>offered rebuttal testimony, explaining \u201chow [the witness protection] process worked and how and why the money was given.\u201d The court also acknowledged that the defense cross-examination that immediately preceded the trial-ending misconduct unfairly suggested that the prosecution had allowed Benczeon to absent himself from later proceedings, but again noted, as the court had reasoned at the hearing on the mistrial motion, \u201cthere was available to the District Attorney a procedure for handling the problem\u201d\u2014specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>prosecution could have approached the bench in order to work out acceptable means of correcting the false implication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Based upon these considerations, the court concluded that a reasonable prosecutor would not have felt that the case would be lost merely because of the defense cross-examination. Nor, the trial court added, did it believe that the prosecutors here actually thought that, based upon the cross-examination, the case had been lost.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The trial court mused that in attempting to discern the prosecutors\u2019 intent, \u201cthe only way to do it is circumstantially. We can\u2019t open their minds. . . . And I have attempted to do it that way. I do believe that I have objectively reviewed the situation and . . . although as I have said their conduct was perplexing to me . . .1 honestly do not believe that their conduct occurred because they wanted a mistrial. I think their conduct occurred because they let their emotions run far beyond where they should have [run]. And I think they realize that.\u201d Having found that the prosecutors did not <em>intend to provoke a mistrial, </em>the trial court concluded that under the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Kennedy, supra, 456 </em>U.S. 667, a retrial was not precluded, and hence the court denied the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Defendants did not seek writ review of the trial court\u2019s ruling on their double jeopardy claim, and instead proceeded to another joint trial\u2014the third trial for Batts, and the second for McCrea. At that trial, Richard Nava, whose earlier assertion of his own guilt in the underlying crimes had led to the vacating of Batts\u2019s first murder conviction, and who at the time of the third trial was serving a prison term of more than 130 years to life for an unrelated murder, testified that on the morning of September 12, 1997, the Jones brothers had robbed him of a kilo of cocaine, and that he later had returned with his \u201chomeboy\u201d (whom he refused to name) to Jones\u2019s apartment. Nava further testified that at that time, <em>he, </em>and not defendant Batts, engaged in a shoot-out with the Jones brothers. Nava\u2019s testimony, however, was thoroughly and compellingly impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Defendants were convicted at the third trial of first degree minder and attempted murder, various charged sentencing enhancements were found true, and they were sentenced to terms of 88 years to life and 90 years to life respectively. On appeal from <em>that </em>judgment, defendants contended in the Court of Appeal that the trial court lacked authority to conduct the third trial, because the trial court assertedly had erred by failing to grant defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the charges based upon double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In the Court of Appeal, all parties argued the double jeopardy issue by focussing exclusively upon the federal Constitution and the intent-to-cause-mistrial test set out in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667. No party discussed whether the state provision (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) requires an analysis different from the high court\u2019s intent-to-cause-mistrial test.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">After reviewing the record, the Court of Appeal found the trial court\u2019s factual findings unsupported, and determined from its own reading of the record that the prosecutors did indeed intend to cause a mistrial by their misconduct at the second trial. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal concluded that retrial was barred and that the third trial should not have occurred. The Court of Appeal reversed defendants\u2019 convictions and ordered dismissal of the charges with prejudice. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">We initially address two procedural issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">First, the People observe that Penal Code sections 1016 and 1017 include, among those defenses that should be specifically pleaded, a claim of \u201conce in jeopardy.\u201d The People suggest that because defendants in this litigation never entered such a plea, they have forfeited their double jeopardy claims. Courts long have observed, however, that \u201ca claim of double jeopardy is most appropriately raised by way of a pretrial motion to dismiss the accusatory pleading or portion thereof allegedly barred by double jeopardy.\u201d <em>(Stone v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 509, fn. 1 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">We reject the People\u2019s claim and agree with the Court of Appeal, which observed that although an affirmative plea of \u201conce in jeopardy\u201d apparently was not entered, defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, which were made on double jeopardy grounds and fully litigated by the parties in the trial court, nevertheless \u201cadequately covered this procedural requirement\u201d and preserved the issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The Court of Appeal on its own raised a second procedural issue: \u201cA more troubling question is why the defense did not seek a writ of prohibition after denial of the motions to dismiss. Prohibition is the preferred remedy, rather than putting everyone through the useless exercise of another trial. . . .\u201d The Court of Appeal concluded, however, that under existing case law, defendants were permitted to proceed as they did and raise their double jeopardy claims on appeal, even though defendants did not first seek writ review to address those claims. (See <em>In re Lozoya </em>(1956) 146 Cal.App.2d 702, 704 [304 P.2d 156] [double jeopardy issue may be raised on appeal]); <em>In re McNeer </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 530, 531-534 [343 P.2d 304] [double jeopardy issue may be raised on habeas corpus].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Consistent with the Court of Appeal\u2019s comment, we directed the parties to brief the following issue: \u201cWhen a trial court denies a defendant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy, should the defendant be required to seek timely review of th\u00e9 denial by a petition for extraordinary writ as a condition to raising the double jeopardy claim on appeal?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The People argue that a defendant must timely seek a writ of prohibition in order to preserve for appeal the issue of being placed twice in jeopardy. Defendants, on the other hand, contend that although a writ of prohibition often may be the more appropriate means of protecting a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights, the timely filing of a petition seeking such a writ should not be a <em>prerequisite </em>to raising the double jeopardy issue on appeal. Defendant McCrea argues that a requirement that an extraordinary writ be sought would burden the Courts of Appeal and defense counsel, \u201cwithout any increase in judicial economy\u201d; defendant Batts argues that long-standing authority permits review of a ruling on a double jeopardy claim by writ or by appeal, and that good reasons exist for retaining that flexible approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Both defendants rely upon <em>People v. Memro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 658 [214 Cal.Rptr. 832, 700 P.2d 446] <em>(Memro). </em>In that case we thoroughly discussed and rejected a similar procedural requirement\u2014whether review of the denial of discovery is available on appeal when the defendant fails to seek writ review on that same question. We declined in <em>Memro </em>to impose a procedural condition to raising that issue on appeal, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">\u201cWhile respondent correctly notes that pretrial review is appropriate in discovery matters [citations], he fails to cite any authority for the proposition that such review is a prerequisite to review of discovery error on appeal. Indeed, several courts on direct appeal have entertained claims of erroneously denied discovery motions of the type involved in this case. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s argument also fails to recognize the unwarranted consequences which might result from a pretrial writ requirement. In addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>unnecessary delay and added expense [citation], such a requirement would limit the exercise of this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in death penalty cases. [Citation.] This court\u2019s constitutional responsibility in such cases should not be so easily circumscribed by procedural barriers, especially where the people of this state have not clearly spoken on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\u201cIt is also noteworthy that in analogous contexts California courts have declined to impose barriers to appellate review where important rights are involved. For example, the courts have sanctioned review on appeal of speedy trial rulings <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 139, 150 [32 Cal.Rptr. 44, 383 P.2d 452]), have held that no certificate of probable cause is required in juvenile appeals <em>(In re Joseph B. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 952, 959-960 [196 Cal.Rptr. 348, 671 P.2d 852]), and have rejected a pretrial writ requirement as a condition to review of an unsuccessful <em>pro se </em>motion on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>[(1977)] 76 Cal.App.3d [302,] 310-311 [142 Cal.Rptr. 806]). Since discovery rights are equally important, this court declines to impose a pretrial writ requirement as a condition to review on appeal.\u201d <em>(Memro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 658, 675-676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Upon reflection, we agree that similar considerations apply here. In reaching this conclusion, we also find persuasive the circumstance that, of the scores of federal and out-of-state cases that we have reviewed (including <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667), addressing in the same or analogous procedural posture the identical type of double jeopardy claim that we face here, we have not found <em>any </em>case suggesting that a defendant must seek writ review as a condition to raising the double jeopardy issue on appeal. We conclude that imposing such a procedural condition would be both unwarranted and unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Accordingly, we proceed to discuss the merits of defendants\u2019 double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Benton v. Maryland </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 784, 793-796 [89 S.Ct. 2056, 2061-2064, 23 L.Ed.2d 707]), protects defendants from repeated prosecution for the same offense (see, e.g., <em>United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 117, 130 [101 S.Ct.'426, 433-434, 66 L.Ed.2d 328] <em>(DiFrancesco); United States </em>v. <em>Jorn </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 470, 479 [91 S.Ct. 547, 554, 27 L.Ed.2d 543] (lead opn. of Harlan, J.) <em>(Jorn)), </em>by providing that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. . . .\u201d We proceed to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>whether the motions to dismiss should have been granted because, as defendants assert, retrial is barred under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">It is well established that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause bars reprosecution following a defendant\u2019s acquittal. <em>(Ball </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1896) 163 U.S. 662, 669 [16 S.Ct. 1192, 1194, 41 L.Ed. 300].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It follows that a criminal defendant who is in the midst of trial has an interest, stemming from the double jeopardy clause, in having his or her case resolved by the jury that was initially sworn to hear the case\u2014and in potentially obtaining an acquittal from that jury. (See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1949) 336 U.S. 684, 689 [69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974] [noting a defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u201d].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It also follows that in certain circumstances, conduct by the prosecution or the court that results in mistrial, thereby terminating the trial prior to resolution by the jury, may impair that aspect of a defendant\u2019s protected \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The remedy for a violation of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment double jeopardy right is strong medicine\u2014dismissal of the charges and a permanent bar to retrial. <em>(Burks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1, 11, fn. 6 [98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1].) Over the years, the high court has developed case law defining the circumstances in which a claim to such a remedy may be raised, and the standards for establishing a double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In the event of a mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant, double jeopardy principles bar retrial unless the mistrial was justified by \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d\u2014for example, a hung jury. <em>(DiFrancesco, supra, </em>449 U.S. 117, 130 [101 S.Ct. 426, 433-434]; <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. 470, 480-487 [91 S.Ct. 547, 554-558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">In the event of a mistrial declared at the urging of the defendant, however (the situation we face in the case before us), the general rule is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial constitutes consent that waives any double jeopardy claim, and hence there is no bar to retrial. <em>(DiFrancesco, supra, </em>449 U.S. 117, 130 [101 S.Ct. 426, 433-434]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toteo </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 463, 467 [84 S.Ct. 1587, 1589-1590, 12 L.Ed.2d 448].) The exception to <em>this </em>general rule is addressed in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant in <em>Kennedy </em>was. charged with stealing a rug. The state called an expert witness to testify concerning the value and identity of the rug. On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s counsel impeached the witness by revealing to the jury that the witness had filed a criminal complaint against the defendant, alleging fraudulent advertising. On redirect examination, the prosecutor attempted to reveal the reasons why the witness had filed a complaint against the defendant, but the trial court\u2014perhaps erroneously\u2014barred such inquiry. Thereafter, the prosecutor asked the witness whether he had \u201cever done business with [the defendant].\u201d The witness responded that he had not, and the prosecutor immediately asked: \u201cIs that because he is a crook?\u201d The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s subsequent request for a mistrial. <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 669 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2086]; see also <em>State v. Kennedy </em>(1980) 49 Or.App. 415 [619 P.2d 948, 949].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The defendant moved under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause to bar the state\u2019s subsequent attempt to retry him. \u201cAfter a hearing at which the prosecutor testified, the trial court found as a fact that \u2018it was not the intention of the prosecutor in this case to cause a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 669 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2086], fn. omitted.) On that basis, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s federal double jeopardy challenge and denied the motion to dismiss. The defendant was retried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">On appeal from the resulting conviction, the defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion to dismiss. The Oregon Court of Appeals agreed, found a Fifth Amendment double jeopardy violation, and barred retrial. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>619 P.2d 948, 949.) That court observed that it was \u201cbound\u201d to accept the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor did not intend to cause a mistrial. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But, relying on prior high court <em>authority\u2014United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 600, 611 [96 S.Ct. 1075, 1081-1082, 47 L.Ed.2d 267] <em>(Dinitz), </em>which stated that retrial is barred when a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct is \u201cundertaken to harass or prejudice\u201d the defendant, and <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485 [91 S.Ct. 547, 557], which suggested that retrial would be barred if prosecutorial or judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>misconduct amounted to \u201coverreaching\u201d\u2014the Oregon appellate court concluded that retrial was barred under the federal double jeopardy clause because \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case meets one of the other forbidden criteria, viz., overreaching.\u201d <em>(State v. Kennedy, supra, </em>619 P.2d at p. 949.) Upon review, the United States Supreme Court in turn reversed the Oregon appellate decision, concluding that the federal double jeopardy clause did not bar a retrial. <em>(Kennedy, </em>supra, 456 U.S. 667, 679 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2091].) The high court\u2019s conclusion was unanimous; its reasoning, however, was closely divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">As suggested by the Oregon appellate court, prior high court decisions had stated that retrial in such circumstances should be barred when a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was intended to (i) cause a mistrial, <em>or </em>(ii) result in harassment or overreaching sufficient to prejudice a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 23, 34 [97 S.Ct. 2141, 2147-2148, 53 L.Ed.2d 80]; <em>Dinitz, supra, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611 [96 S.Ct. 1075, 1081-1082]; <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485 [91 S.Ct. 547, 557].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority in <em>Kennedy </em>determined that the alternative standards under which retrial would be barred in circumstances in which the prosecutor did not intend specifically to cause a mistrial but instead intended merely to \u201charass\u201d or \u201coverreach,\u201d were improperly overbroad and unworkable in practice. <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 674-679 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2088-2091].)  Instead, the majority in <em>Kennedy </em>held that when a defendant has moved for a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct and the mistrial motion has been granted, the <em>sole </em>basis for barring a retrial is a narrow one: retrial is barred only if the prosecutor intended by his or her misconduct to produce a mistrial. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 679 [102 S.Ct. at p. 2091].) Applying that test, the majority reversed the judgment of the state court of appeals, thereby upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Four members of the court signed Justice Stevens\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Kennedy, </em>maintaining that the majority unnecessarily had abandoned the \u201charassment/overreaching\u201d aspect of the standard that it had articulated and applied in the prior cases cited above, none of which resulted in the barring of a retrial. <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 681-684 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2091-2094] (conc. opn. of Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.).) The concurring justices asserted that the majority\u2019s narrow standard, focussing solely upon the prosecutor\u2019s subjective intent to cause a mistrial, failed to address and protect interests at the core of the double jeopardy clause <em>(id., </em>at p. 689 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 2096-2097]), and these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>justices maintained that in order to invoke the exception to the general rule permitting retrial after the defendant successfully moves for mistrial for \u201coverreaching\u201d by the prosecutor, \u201ca court need not divine the exact motivation for the prosecutorial error. <em>It is sufficient that the court is persuaded that egregious prosecutorial misconduct has rendered unmeaningful the defendant\u2019s choice to continue or to abort the proceeding.'\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) The concurring justices agreed, however, that this broader standard was not met on the facts of the <em>Kennedy </em>case itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Under the rule adopted by a majority of the high court in <em>Kennedy, </em>the federal Constitution bars retrial if, but only if, the prosecution intended to cause a mistrial. (E.g., <em>U.S. v. Gonzalez </em>(10th Cir. 2001) 248 F.3d 1201, 1203-1205.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We proceed to apply that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In reviewing the record in order to assess evidence of intent by the prosecution to induce a successful mistrial motion, we are mindful of the high court\u2019s observation in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, that it is to be expected that appellate judges \u201cwill not inexorably reach the same conclusion on a cold record at the appellate stage that they might if any one of them had been sitting [on the matter] as a trial judge,\u201d and that \u201cappellate judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>[should] defer to the judgment of trial judges who are \u2018on the scene\u2019 in this area.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 676, fn. 7 [102 S.Ct. at p. 2090].)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Consistent with that approach, our appellate courts have upheld trial court findings of a lack of intent on the part of the prosecution to induce a successful mistrial motion. In <em>Barajas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d 30, the court noted that although it had \u201csome discomfort with the trial court findings,\u201d and suspected that the trial court \u201cmay have had an overly benign view of the prosecutor\u2019s naivete,\u201d it nevertheless determined that \u201cbecause we are precluded from weighing the facts, we conclude [that] substantial evidence supports the findings made by the trial court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 33, fn. <em>4; </em>accord, <em>People v. Valenzuela-Gonzales, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 728, 736 (Valenzuela-Gonzales) [noting that the trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings on the issue are supported by substantial evidence, and, therefore, dispositive\u201d].) In light of the holding in <em>Kennedy, </em>we shall apply the same deferential approach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">As observed earlier, the Court of Appeal determined from the cold record that the prosecutors had intended to induce a successful mistrial motion. The court reasoned that by advising Detective Branscomb during the recess to \u201ctell the truth,\u201d and then, upon resumption of redirect examination, asking him why Benczeon did not testify at prior hearings, the prosecutors must have intended to cause a mistrial. Defendants embrace this view, arguing, among other things, that (i) under the circumstances the prosecutor\u2019s serious misconduct could have been intended only to terminate the second trial; (ii) the record does not support the trial court\u2019s findings that the prosecution\u2019s case was, at the time of mistrial, \u201coverall . . . going very well for the People\u201d and that \u201ca District Attorney sitting in the circumstances that they were sitting in at the time would want to proceed and have a decision\u201d; (iii) the planning that occurred during the recess proves that the prosecutors wanted to terminate the second trial; and (iv) the prosecutors\u2019 initial assessment, articulated during the mistrial motion hearing, that the credibility of Benczeon and Detective Branscomb had been \u201cdevastated\u201d by the defense cross-examination, shows they believed that they were losing the case, and intended to abort the trial in order to begin anew. Defendants also assert (v) that Prosecutor Droeger\u2019s accusations made during the dismissal hearing \u2014that defense counsel had baited the prosecutors and thereby forced the successful mistrial motion\u2014demonstrated instead that the prosecutors were \u201cprojecting\u201d their own motives upon the defense, and in so doing revealed their own intention. Finally, defendants stress (vi) that the prosecutors gained various strategic advantages for the third trial by ending the second trial, and defendants discount the prosecutors\u2019 suggestions that retrial would have been risky for the prosecution because of various problems with the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>We conclude that the Court of Appeal failed to accord proper deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Indeed, a key passage of the Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis rejecting the trial court\u2019s findings is itself based upon a misreading of the reporter\u2019s transcript. The Court of Appeal stated: \u201cOur review of the record persuades us that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to the prosecutors\u2019 intent. Indeed, the record persuasively establishes their desire to cause a mistrial. <em>In reaching this conclusion, we agree with an earlier assessment by the trial court: </em>T think as soon as those words were uttered, it was clear that a mistrial was going to occur. It wasn\u2019t so much, hey, let\u2019s try to somehow gloss it over. Let\u2019s try to somehow get to a point where we can make a corrective ruling or make some type of statement to the jury to somehow cure this mistake. It was obvious. And it was clear that when the district attorney, through their actions, through their plan, had Detective Branscomb state that he was murdered that meant that the case would be over.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) The <em>trial </em>court, however, never uttered the quoted words; they were instead <em>defense counsel\u2019s </em>argument to the trial court, and as noted above, the trial court ultimately reached the opposite finding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Granting appropriate deference to the trial court\u2019s <em>actual </em>findings based upon its firsthand observations, we conclude that those findings\u2014that the prosecutors did not intend to cause a mistrial\u2014 are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The prosecutors instructed Detective Branscomb to provide a significant pause before answering their fateful question. Prosecutor Droeger stated that he and Prosecutor Stirling expected an objection prior to Branscomb\u2019s answer, and that they were surprised when no objection was made and the answer ensued. The record does, in fact, reflect that Detective Branscomb paused significantly before giving his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Although defendants assert that inconsistent testimony by various prosecution witnesses at the 1999 trial rendered the prosecution\u2019s case weak and that the cross-examination of Detective Branscomb further weakened the prosecution\u2019s case, the trial court\u2019s contrary assessment of the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case is supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the former testimony of Benczeon identified both defendants as the shooters, and he also positively identified the shooters from photo arrays. Benczeon\u2019s former testimony was corroborated by (i) Sonique Steward (Brian Jones\u2019s girlfriend), who stated that she saw defendant Batts arrive just prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>shootings and that Benczeon told her that Batts was one of the shooters; and by (ii) testimony that McCrea\u2019s wife, Leslie Jones, stated that she was afraid of McCrea because he had killed persons before, including a cousin (Brian Jones) in Compton.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Viewed as a whole, the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that, immediately prior to the declaration of mistrial, the evidence pointing to defendants as the actual killers of Brian Jones on September 12, 1997, was quite strong, and that the cross-examination of Detective Branscomb was not of a nature that would have left a reasonable prosecutor with the belief that the case was lost and beyond rehabilitation. This evaluation by the trial judge supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutors did not intend to induce a successful mistrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In sum, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the prosecutors did not intend to cause a mistrial, and we defer to that factual finding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It follows that the Court of Appeal erred by declining to defer to the trial court\u2019s supported findings. The trial court properly concluded that retrial is not barred under the federal Constitution, pursuant to the standard set out in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S 667. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">We turn to the state double jeopardy clause, article I, section 15, which, in language similar to but still somewhat different from the Fifth Amendment, provides: \u201cPersons may not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) The People ask us to \u201cclarify\u201d that the \u201cintent-to-cause-mistrial\u201d standard adopted by the high court in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, also applies to and disposes of defendants\u2019 state constitutional double jeopardy claim. Defendants note that the scope of protection afforded by the state constitutional provision was not addressed in the trial court or in the Court of Appeal, but argue that if it becomes necessary to reach the issue (that is, if\u2014as we have concluded\u2014their Fifth Amendment claim does not entitle them to relief), we should conclude that article I, section 15, is more protective of double jeopardy rights than the Fifth Amendment as construed by the high court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">When the double jeopardy clause was made part of the 1849 California Constitution (1849 Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8), it provided: \u201cNo person shall be subject to be twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.\u201d (Browne, Rep. of Debates in Convention of Cal. on Formation of State Const. (1850) appen., p. IV.) This language, which was borrowed from the New York Constitution (see Browne, p. 31), was endorsed by the drafters of the 1849 Constitution without debate. <em>(Id., </em>pp. 30-31, 41.) Subsequently, the drafters of the 1879 Constitution adopted similar language (\u201cNo person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense\u201d)\u2014again, without debate. (Cal. Const., art. I, former \u00a7 13, now \u00a7 15; see 3 Willis &amp; Stockton, Debates and Proceedings, Cal. Const. Convention 1878-1879, pp. 1188-1189, 1425-1426, 1491, 1509.) The parties have not cited, nor have we discovered, any indication in these materials suggesting that the drafters, or the electorate that adopted these provisions, considered the meaning of the double jeopardy guarantee in the context presented in this case. Nor have we discovered any evidence that the drafters of the 1974 constitutional revision of article I (the current incarnation of the double jeopardy clause, article I, section 15)\u2014or the electorate that adopted it\u2014considered the issue of the application of the double jeopardy guarantee in the context presented.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We must, nonetheless, determine the appropriate interpretation of article I, section 15 (\u201cPersons may not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense\u201d) as applied to the circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">As defendants observe, whereas the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution, as construed by <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, establishes the minimum standards of double jeopardy protection for criminal defendants, the California Constitution may provide a higher level of double jeopardy protection. <em>(Stone v. Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 503, 510; see also <em>Raven </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 336 [276 Cal.Rptr. 326, 801 P.2d 1077].) Indeed, in some double jeopardy contexts our court has interpreted the double jeopardy safeguard in article I, section 15, of the California Constitution as providing greater protection than the double jeopardy clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>of the federal Constitution. (See <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 707, 716 [87 Cal.Rptr. 361, 470 P.2d 345] [construing state double jeopardy provision to bar retrial after the granting of a mistrial on the trial court\u2019s own motion and without the defendant\u2019s consent, but for the defendant\u2019s benefit, and declining to adopt the applicable federal constitutional rule of <em>Gori </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 364, 369 [81 S.Ct. 1523, 1526-1529, 6 L.Ed.2d 901]]; <em>People v.

In other circumstances, however, we have construed the state double jeopardy provision consistently with its federal counterpart. <em>(People v. Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 844-845 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] <em>(Monge) </em>(lead opn. of Chin., J.) [neither state nor federal double jeopardy clause applies to retrial of a prior conviction allegation that previously was reversed on appeal for insufficient evidence].) The question is, which approach is appropriate in the case now before us? As we observed in <em>Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at page 844, \u201c \u2018 \u201ccogent reasons must exist\u201d \u2019 \u201d before we will construe the double jeopardy clause of the state Constitution differently from its federal counterpart. We proceed to explore whether such reasons exist under the circumstances presented by the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Sister state jurisdictions that have determined the proper interpretation of their own state Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause under similar circumstances have divided between following the narrow <em>Kennedy </em>test, and a broader, more expansive test.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We examine those two lines of cases below.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Based in large part upon its clarity and perceived ease of application, the narrow \u201cintent-to-cause-mistrial\u201d test set- out by the majority in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, has been adopted by the high courts of six states as the appropriate test under the double jeopardy clause of each jurisdiction\u2019s constitution. <em>(State v. Bell </em>(Iowa 1982) 322 N.W.2d 93, 94; <em>State v. Chapman </em>(Me. 1985) 496 A.2d 297, 300; <em>State v. Diaz </em>(R.I. 1987) 521 A.2d 129, 133; <em>State v.

The <em>Kennedy </em>test also has been endorsed as the appropriate standard under California Constitution, article I, section 15, in one California Court of Appeal decision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Nevertheless, the intent-to-cause-mistrial test has been viewed as inadequate because it protects only a very narrow range of a defendant\u2019s legitimate double jeopardy interests. (See Henning, <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct and Constitutional Remedies </em>(1999) 77 Wash.U. L.Q. 713, 803-808 <em>(Constitutional Remedies); </em>Ponsoldt, <em>When Guilt Should Be Irrelevant: Government Overreaching as a Bar to Reprosecution Under the Double Jeopardy Clause After Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>69 Cornell L.Rev. 76, 94-99 <em>(Government Overreaching); </em>Rosenthal, <em>Prosecutor Misconduct, Convictions, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>Double Jeopardy: Case Studies in an Emerging Jurisprudence </em>(1998) 71 Temple L.Rev. 887, 892-895, 909-917, 961 <em>(Emerging Jurisprudence); </em>Thomas, <em>Solving the Double Jeopardy Riddle </em>(1996) 69 So.Cal. L.Rev. 1551, 1563-1564; Reiss, <em>Prosecutorial Intent in Constitutional Criminal Procedure </em>(1987) 135 U.Pa. L.Rev. 1365, 1425-1428 <em>(Prosecutorial Intent).) </em>For example, as noted by Professor Reiss in <em>Prosecutorial Intent, supra, </em>135 U.Pa. L.Rev. at page 1426: \u201cWhen a defendant\u2019s \u2018valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u2019 is threatened by serious prosecutorial misbehavior at trial, <em>Kennedy </em>does much to deny any protection of the right . . . [because it] eliminates any double jeopardy concern with prosecutorial overreaching prompted by improper motives other than the intent to provoke a mistrial. Thus, a defendant faced with a prosecutor who is willing to commit reversible error for other improper reasons . . . has no redress under the clause.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The federal test\u2019s application to the facts of this case (see <em>ante, </em>pt. III.C) illustrates the narrow scope and limitations of that test. Had the prosecutors intentionally committed their misconduct <em>not </em>to cause a mistrial, but instead to improperly prejudice the jury to convict in order to avoid a likely acquittal, the prosecutors\u2019 misconduct clearly would implicate defendants\u2019 double jeopardy interests, which, as we have seen, include a defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018 \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Marshall </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 824 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280] [construing federal and state double jeopardy clauses]; see also <em>Government Overreaching, supra, </em>69 Cornell L.Rev. 76, 81.) And yet <em>that aspect </em>of a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests lies outside the high court\u2019s narrow test, and is unprotected by it.  Because the state double jeopardy clause is implicated when a prosecutor, believing that a particular jury is likely to return an acquittal, intentionally commits misconduct in order to improperly prejudice the jury and obtain a conviction\u2014and because the majority\u2019s narrow test in <em>Kennedy </em>fails to protect that aspect of a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests\u2014we conclude that the federal test, standing alone, is insufficient to protect interests that our state Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause is intended to safeguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Competing tests designed to more fully protect double jeopardy interests have been adopted by the high courts of six states. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1983) 295 Or. 260 [666 P.2d 1316, 1326] <em>(Kennedy II); Pool v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 139 Ariz. 98 [677 P.2d 261, 271-272] <em>(Pool); Com. v.

Rogan </em>(1999) 91 Hawaii 405 [984 P.2d 1231, 1249] <em>(Rogan).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">These broader tests, however, have been subject to criticism as well. The standards adopted by Pennsylvania in <em>Smith, supra, </em>615 A.2d 321, and by Hawaii in <em>Rogan, supra, </em>984 P.2d 1231, for example, bar reprosecution not only when prosecutorial misconduct is intended to cause a mistrial, but also when a prosecutor\u2019s conduct is \u201cintentionally undertaken to prejudice the defendant to the point of the denial of a fair trial\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>615 A.2d at p. 325)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or is \u201cso egregious that, from an objective standpoint, it clearly denied a defendant his or her right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Rogan, supra, </em>984 P.2d at p. 1249, fn. omitted).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These standards appear to blur inappropriately the line between (i) the \u201cnormal\u201d species of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct that violates a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial and hence warrants the granting of a mistrial or the reversal of any conviction and a retrial of the offense, and (ii) the exceptional form of prosecutorial misconduct that warrants not only a mistrial or reversal of any resulting conviction, but also dismissal of the charges and a prohibition of any reprosecution of the defendant for the offense.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The standards adopted in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas exhibit similar problems. The Oregon Supreme Court, in <em>Kennedy II, supra, </em>666 P.2d 1316, construed the Oregon Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause as barring retrial \u201cwhen improper official conduct is so prejudicial to the defendant that it cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial, and <em>if the official knows that the conduct is improper and prejudicial and either intends or is indifferent to the resulting mistrial or reversal.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 1326, italics added.) The Arizona Supreme Court has adopted a similar standard, finding retrial barred under the Arizona Constitution \u201cwhen a mistrial is granted on motion of defendant or declared by the court under the following conditions: flj] 1. Mistrial is granted because of improper conduct or actions by the prosecutor; and ft[] 2. such conduct is not merely the result of legal error, negligence, mistake, or insignificant impropriety, but, taken as a whole, amounts to <em>intentional conduct which the prosecutor knows to be improper and prejudicial, and which he pursues for any improper purpose with indifference to a significant resulting danger of mistrial or reversal; </em>and [^[] 3. the conduct causes prejudice to the defendant which cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial.\u201d <em>(Pool, supra, 611 </em>P.2d 261, 271-272, italics added, in. omitted.) The New Mexico Supreme Court has adopted a modified version of the Oregon standard, finding retrial barred under the New Mexico Constitution \u201cwhen improper official conduct is so unfairly prejudicial to the defendant that it cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial or a motion for a new trial, and if <em>the official knows that the conduct is improper and prejudicial, and if the official either intends to provoke a mistrial or acts in willful disregard of the resulting mistrial, retrial, or reversal.\u201d (Breit, supra, </em>930 P.2d 792, 803, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In our view, each of these tests (and a similar formulation from Texas)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is less than satisfactory, because none articulates explicitly the precise <em>double jeopardy basis </em>for a conclusion that the principles underlying a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interest have been violated. Accordingly, as applied to different factual settings, each test improperly may mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>double jeopardy </em>relief (that is, barring any trial) for instances of prosecutorial misconduct that more appropriately should be remedied by reversal and retrial. (See <em>Constitutional Remedies, supra, </em>77 Wash.U. L.Q. 713, 813 [criticizing application of the New Mexico standard as affording a double jeopardy remedy for a due process violation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">As noted above, we have concluded that a narrow test, focussing solely upon whether the prosecutor intended to induce a successful mistrial motion, fails to protect fully the legitimate interest of a defendant in securing a resolution (and possible acquittal) in the pending trial, and hence inadequately protects double jeopardy interests set out in California Constitution article I, section 15. Accordingly, we conclude that \u201ccogent reasons . . . exist\u201d for construing the double jeopardy clause of the state Constitution differently from its federal counterpart <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 826, 844) and that a broader test is required in order to more fully protect double jeopardy interests guaranteed under our state Constitution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">At the same time, the standard that we adopt should not be so broad as to lead to the imposition of the double jeopardy bar\u2014with its drastic sanction prohibiting retrial\u2014in circumstances in which such a sanction is unwarranted. What is needed is a standard that sufficiently protects double jeopardy interests, but also retains and enforces a distinction between \u201cnormal\u201d prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct that violates a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial and warrants reversal and retrial, and the form of prosecutorial misconduct that not only constitutes a due process violation but also a double jeopardy violation, and hence warrants not only reversal but dismissal and a bar to reprosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">In formulating such a standard, we find helpful a line of decisions stemming from the decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Wallach, supra, </em>979 F.2d 912 <em>(Wallach II), </em>a decision that considered the double jeopardy consequences not of <em>a mistrial </em>based upon prosecutorial misconduct, but instead of <em>a reversal of a conviction on appeal </em>because of prosecutorial misconduct at trial. The decision in <em>Wallach II </em>followed the Second Circuit\u2019s earlier decision in <em>U.S. v. Wallach </em>(2d Cir. 1991) 935 F.2d 445 <em>(Wallach I), </em>and we begin with a brief summary of the first <em>Wallach </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>At the criminal trial at issue in <em>Wallach I, supra, </em>935 F.2d 445, a key prosecution witness, who previously testified that he had forsworn gambling after a certain time, was impeached with documentary evidence (gambling markers) suggesting that, during the relevant time, the witness in fact had continued to engage in gambling. This impeachment was wholly collateral to the case against the defendant (Wallach), but it clearly reflected on the witness\u2019s credibility. On redirect examination by the prosecution, the witness offered an innocent explanation for the gambling documentation, asserting, for example, that in fact he had obtained $50,000 in chips but had given them to a friend and had not used them himself. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 453-456.) Wallach was convicted, and thereafter additional evidence surfaced, making it clear that the prosecution witness indeed had lied concerning his own gambling. At that point the government prosecuted and convicted the witness for perjury. Wallach\u2019s subsequent motion for a new trial was granted, his convictions were reversed on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct (the court concluding that the government \u201cshould have known\u201d that the witness was committing peijury when he claimed to have stopped gambling), and a new trial was ordered. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Prior to the commencement of retrial on reduced counts, Wallach moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, asserting that retrial was barred. The district court denied that motion, and upon review the Second Circuit, in <em>Wallach II, supra, </em>979 F.2d 912, affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling, concluding that retrial was not barred. Addressing Wallach\u2019s contention that under the rationale of the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, the federal double jeopardy clause \u201c \u2018bars a second prosecution when the prosecutor engages in serious misconduct <em>with the intention of preventing an acquittaV </em>\u201d <em>(Wallach II, supra, </em>979 F.2d at p. 915, italics added), the circuit court agreed that \u201cthere is force to Wallach\u2019s argument for some sort of extension\u201d of <em>Kennedy </em>in the context before it, but reasoned that \u201c[ejvery action of a prosecutor in the course of a trial is taken \u2018with the intention of preventing an acquittal.\u2019 [Citation.] If the rationale of <em>Kennedy </em>were as broad as claimed by Wallach, the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar retrial of every defendant whose conviction is reversed because of intentional misconduct on the part of a prosecutor. For example, knowing use of peijured testimony that \u2018could have affected the judgment of the jury\u2019 would result not only in reversal of a conviction, [citation] but also in a bar to retrial on jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court could not possibly have mandated that result in <em>Kennedy. </em>Such a result would obliterate the precise distinction drawn in <em>Kennedy </em>between misconduct that merely results in a mistrial and misconduct undertaken for the specific purpose of provoking a mistrial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The court in <em>Wallach II </em>continued: \u201cIf any extension of <em>Kennedy </em>beyond the mistrial context is warranted, it would be a bar to retrial only where <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>misconduct of the prosecutor is undertaken, not simply to prevent an acquittal, but to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed at the time was likely to occur in the absence of his misconduct. </em>\u201d <em>(Wallach II, supra, </em>979 F.2d 912, 916, italics added.) The court explained: \u201cThe prosecutor who acts with the intention of goading the defendant into making a mistrial motion presumably does so because he believes that completion of the trial will likely result in an acquittal. That aspect of the <em>Kennedy </em>rationale suggests precluding retrial where a prosecutor apprehends an acquittal and, instead of provoking a mistrial, avoids the acquittal by an act of deliberate misconduct. Indeed, if <em>Kennedy </em>is not extended to this limited degree, a prosecutor apprehending an acquittal encounters the jeopardy bar to retrial when he engages in misconduct of sufficient visibility to precipitate a mistrial motion, but not when he fends off the anticipated acquittal by misconduct of which the defendant is unaware until after the verdict. There is no justification for that distinction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The court in <em>Wallach II </em>concluded, however, that even under this broader standard, no double jeopardy violation was demonstrated in that case, because \u201c[t]he evidence against Wallach and his co-defendants was quite strong,\u201d giving the prosecution \u201cevery reason to anticipate a conviction\u201d <em>(Wallach II, supra, </em>979 F.2d 912, 916), and because the record supported the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutors did not know of the perjury. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 917.) Accordingly, the court determined, \u201cthe factual predicate\u201d for finding a double jeopardy violation\u2014\u201cdeliberate prosecutorial misconduct undertaken to avoid an acquittal that the prosecutors believed was likely in the absence of their misconduct\u2014is totally lacking.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Because we need consider in the present case only the proper standard under the state double jeopardy clause for prosecutorial misconduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s successful <em>mistrial </em>motion, we need not, and do not, determine whether <em>Wallach II </em>articulates a proper test\u2014under <em>either </em>the federal or state constitutional double jeopardy clauses\u2014for misconduct that results in <em>reversal on appeal </em>or in relief on habeas corpus. (See <em>ante, </em>fns. 15 &amp; 19.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Our sole concern in this case is the proper test under our state Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause for intentional prosecutorial misconduct that produces not a reversal on appeal, but a mistrial. In formulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>such a test, we find the decision in <em>Wallach II </em>to be helpful because it illuminates a double jeopardy interest beyond the narrow one recognized in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 557. <em>Wallach II </em>recognizes that a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights are implicated not only when a prosecutor intends to and does provoke a mistrial, but also when a prosecutor intentionally commits misconduct in order to deprive the defendant of an acquittal that the prosecutor believed, in light of the events at trial (including reactions and demeanor of the jury), was likely to occur in the absence of the misconduct. Because we believe the decision in <em>Wallach II </em>accurately identifies the scope of interests that the California double jeopardy clause is intended to protect, we find that opinion useful in crafting an appropriate state double jeopardy standard. (See <em>Emerging Jurisprudence, supra, </em>71 Temple L.Rev. 887, 909 <em>[Wallach II </em>test \u201copen[s] the way to a double jeopardy/misconduct jurisprudence that is far more satisfactory than the narrow holding of <em>Kennedy,\u201d </em>because it is \u201ctied directly to the principles and rationale underlying the double jeopardy protection in the first place\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Without attempting to articulate a double jeopardy test that will be applicable in all circumstances, we conclude that the double jeopardy clause of California Constitution article I, section 15 bars retrial following the grant of a defendant\u2019s mistrial motion (1) when the prosecution intentionally commits misconduct for the purpose of triggering a mistrial, and also (2) when the prosecution, believing in view of events that unfold during an ongoing trial that the defendant is likely to secure an acquittal at that trial in the absence of misconduct, intentionally and knowingly commits misconduct in order to thwart such an acquittal\u2014and a court, reviewing the circumstances as of the time of the misconduct, determines that from an objective perspective, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in fact deprived the defendant of a reasonable prospect of an acquittal. (See <em>Kennedy II, supra, 666 </em>P.2d 1316, 1326; <em>Wallach II, supra, </em>979 F.2d 912, 916-917; <em>Emerging Jurisprudence, supra, </em>71 Temple L.Rev. 887, 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In our view, the latter aspect of the test, which requires a court to find, as an objective matter, that the prosecution\u2019s misconduct in fact deprived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>defendant of a reasonable or realistic prospect of acquittal, is appropriate to guard against an unwarranted imposition of the double jeopardy bar. If, despite a prosecutor\u2019s subjective belief that an acquittal was likely to occur in the absence of misconduct, the court determines that, <em>from an objective perspective, </em>an acquittal was not a realistic prospect, a bar of retrial, permanently relieving such a defendant of any criminal responsibility for his or her charged conduct, would constitute a windfall for the defendant. In our view, when such prosecutorial misconduct has not deprived a defendant of a reasonable prospect of an acquittal, double jeopardy interests are not unfairly compromised if a defendant who successfully moves for a mistrial remains subject to retrial.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Applying the foregoing test to the present case, it is apparent that the misconduct was intentional, and that its prejudicial impact was sufficient to justify the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a mistrial. As noted <em>ante, </em>part III.C, however, the trial court\u2019s findings amply support its conclusion that the misconduct was not committed with the intent to induce a mistrial. Accordingly, in this case, the state constitutional double jeopardy guarantee would bar retrial only if the deliberate misconduct was intended by the prosecution to prevent an acquittal that the prosecution subjectively believed at the time was likely to occur in the absence of the misconduct, <em>and </em>acquittal was, in fact, an objectively reasonable prospect absent the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although the trial court did not have in mind the subjective intent standard that we now articulate, and hence did not expressly consider whether the prosecutors\u2019 deliberate misconduct was intended by them to prevent an acquittal <em>that they believed at the time was likely to occur in the absence of the misconduct, </em>the trial court did find that, despite the negative impact of the cross-examination upon the People\u2019s case, the prosecutors never actually believed the case was lost. The court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t see that it rises to a level that ... a reasonable evaluation of the case would be that you\u2019re going to lose because of that, in the District Attorney\u2019s point of view. <em>Nor do I believe that they thought that.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Based upon these findings, we conclude that the prosecutors did not subjectively believe at the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>time that, absent their misconduct, an acquittal was likely to occur\u2014and hence we need not remand for a further hearing to resolve that factual question.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Furthermore, even if the record were viewed as ambiguous on the question of the prosecutors\u2019 subjective intent, we would find no violation of defendants\u2019 state constitutional double jeopardy rights here, because we conclude that the objective component of the test is not satisfied. As explained in part III.C, <em>ante, </em>the record demonstrates that even after the defense cross-examination of Detective Branscomb (in other words, immediately prior to the misconduct that induced a successful mistrial motion), the People\u2019s case still was quite strong and, from an objective perspective, the prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive defendants of a reasonable prospect of an acquittal. It follows that the trial court did not err in denying defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss on state double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">We wish to emphasize that we agree completely with the trial court\u2019s finding in the 1999 trial that the misconduct of the prosecutors during that trial was indefensible and violated defendants\u2019 due process rights to a fair trial. The proper remedy for such a due process violation was, and remains, the declaration of a mistrial, followed by a retrial. For the reasons set out above, we conclude that neither defendants\u2019 federal nor their state double jeopardy rights were violated in this case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court for resolution of the remaining issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"><em>In </em>this case, we have no occasion to address the proper application of the federal or state double jeopardy clauses in the related but distinct circumstance in which prosecutorial misconduct results not in a mistrial, but rather in the reversal of a conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">There is evidence suggesting that Batts and Benczeon may have been engaged in a territorial dispute concerning the sale of illegal drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Benczeon denied that he or Brian were armed during the attack.

Second, Justice Stevens reasoned, \u201cbecause the defendant\u2019s option to abort the proceeding after prosecutorial misconduct would retain real meaning for the defendant in any case in which the trial was going badly for him, normally a required finding would be that the prosecutorial error virtually eliminated, or at least substantially reduced, the probability of acquittal in a proceeding that was going badly for the government.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">An extension of the <em>Kennedy </em>standard has been recognized by some lower courts that have addressed the related issue of the proper application of the federal double jeopardy clause in the context of prosecutorial misconduct that results not in a mistrial, but instead in an appellate reversal of a tainted conviction.

Indeed, this court itself has previously noted, and declined to resolve, a related issue. In <em>In re Martin </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 1 [241 Cal.Rptr. 263, 744 P.2d 374], a habeas corpus proceeding in this court, the petitioner successfully argued that his convictions for conspiracy to commit extortion, and second degree murder, should be set aside because at the petitioner\u2019s trial the prosecution interfered with the petitioner\u2019s right to present the testimony of three of his witnesses. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 52.) The petitioner in <em>Martin </em>also asserted that in view of the misconduct, retrial\u2014which, we observed, is the normal consequence when it is determined on habeas corpus that a judgment is void\u2014should be barred, under the circumstances, by federal and state double jeopardy principles. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 53.)

Later, however, the prosecutor asked another witness whether the defendant \u201chas any problems with drugs.\u201d The defendant objected and moved for a mistrial, which the court granted, based upon the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 732.)

See generally <em>Emerging Jurisprudence, supra, </em>71 Temple L.Rev. at pages 926-933.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We recognize, of course, that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, attached no similar objective component to its standard barring retrial whenever the prosecution commits misconduct with the intent to produce a mistrial, and we similarly have not included such an objective component in the first (intent-to-provoke-mistrial) prong of the state constitutional standard articulated here. When the prosecution acts for the specific purpose of provoking a mistrial, and thereby intentionally and directly subverts the defendant\u2019s right not to be subjected to repeated prosecutions for the same offense, we believe that prohibiting retrial is an appropriate and proportional sanction, whether or not acquittal was a realistic prospect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">The Los Angeles District Attorney, appearing as amicus curiae, argues that \u201ca jeopardy defense premised upon a prosecutor\u2019s intent presents a question of fact for the jury.\u201d In support, amicus curiae relies upon the concluding sentences of an extensive footnote in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 503. After mentioning that \u201c[t]he determination of the validity of a claim of double jeopardy is a matter for the trial judge in the first instance,\u201d the footnote continues: <em>\u201cIf there is no material issue offact, the judge rules on the double jeopardy claim.

We have no occasion to decide that issue in the present case, however, because none of the parties raised the issue in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>MORENO, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">I join in the majority\u2019s holding that the double jeopardy clause of the California Constitution provides slightly broader protection than its federal counterpart. I write separately because, in my view, the Court of Appeal was correct that retrial is barred in the present case under the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 667 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416], the high court held that when a defendant successfully moves for a mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment bars a retrial only if \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 679 [102 S.Ct. at p. 2091].) Despite the trial court\u2019s contrary finding, I agree with the Court of Appeal that there is no doubt the prosecutors knew their intentional misconduct would provoke a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">As the majority opinion recounts in greater detail, defendant Tracy Batts was tried in 1998 for the murder of Brian Jones in a gang-related shooting. The victim\u2019s brother, Benczeon Jones, was wounded during the attack and identified the shooters as Batts and Terrance McCrea, who had not been apprehended. Batts was convicted but was granted a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Prior to the retrial, Benczeon was murdered in March, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Also prior to the retrial, McCrea was apprehended. At the second trial against both defendants, Benczeon\u2019s testimony at the first trial was admitted as to Batts alone under Evidence Code section 1291, which permits the former testimony of an unavailable witness to be admitted against a party to the earlier proceeding. Benczeon\u2019s former testimony also was admitted as to both defendants under Evidence Code section 1231, which under specified circumstances allows admission of a decedent\u2019s prior statements in a gang-related prosecution if the decedent \u201cdied from other than natural causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Evidence Code section 1231.4 provides: \u201cIf evidence of a prior statement is introduced pursuant to this article, the jury may not be told that the declarant died from other than natural causes, but shall merely be told that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court instructed the attorneys on several occasions prior to and during trial that the jury would not be informed that Benczeon was dead. Instead, the jury would be told only that he was unavailable. The prosecutors were told to instruct their witnesses not to mention that Benczeon was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Prosecution witness Detective Marvin Branscomb testified on cross-examination that he visited Benczeon in the hospital hours after Benczeon had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>been shot and his brother had been killed. Benczeon was reluctant to cooperate with the police out of fear for the safety of his family. Detective Branscomb told Benczeon that the witness relocation program would pay the cost of the first and last month\u2019s rent if his family wished to relocate to a residence in another neighborhood. Defense counsel established that Benczeon testified on June 8, 1998 at Batts\u2019s first trial. Four months later on October 6, 1988, Detective Branscomb gave Benczeon a check for $1,500 under the witness relocation program. Cross-examination included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel] Well, you didn\u2019t give him this money, is that correct, until October 6th, 1998, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201c[Detective Branscomb] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cQ . . . It is after he already testified then, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\u201cQ That is the only time he testified in connection with any of these cases, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\u201cQ He never showed up and testified at Tracy Batts\u2019 preliminary hearing, right? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">\u201cQ He didn\u2019t show up and testify in Terrance Me Crea\u2019s first preliminary hearing. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-15\">\u201cQ And he didn\u2019t testify in Terrance Me Crea\u2019s preliminary hearing on May 10, 1988. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-16\">\u201cA Correct, m . . . ffl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">\u201cQ At the time you give him this $1500 cash he testified just one time, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-18\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-19\">\u201cQ And then four months after he testifies you pay him $1500 cash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201cA Yes. [1] . . . m</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cQ Isn\u2019t it trae that you guys gave him this $1500 as a payoff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor returned to the subject of the witness relocation program. After having Detective Branscomb describe how the program operates, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor] . . . Before I go on, why relocate a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\u201c[Detective Branscomb] Because witnesses get murdered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u201cQ Relocation has some affect upon that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">A short time later, following a brief recess, the crucial exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor] ... On May 10th, 1999, there was another preliminary hearing; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">\u201c[Detective Branscomb] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-15\">\u201cQ On that date, did Benczeon Jones testify? Did he testify? Simply that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-16\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-17\">\u201cQ Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-18\">\u201cA He was murdered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-19\">Defense counsel asked to approach the bench and suggested that the jury be excused for the day. After the jury had left the courtroom, the bailiff reported that one juror \u201cbroke down,\u201d saying \u201cthis is too much for her.\u201d This juror was examined outside the presence of the other jurors and said she had cried because of the \u201ccomment that was made about the death or the murder of Benczeon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>After all the jurors had left for the day, the following proceedings took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Now, let me ask, first of all, just preliminary of the district attorney when you asked that question, did you expect that answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yes, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: The answer\u2014I said if I ask you this question, I want you to tell the truth as to why he was not there. I said before he answered the question, make a significant pause to see if counsel wanted to object to the question. If they don\u2019t object to the question, then answer truthfully as to why it was he was not there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">When asked by the court for any other reason the information about Benczeon\u2019s death was elicited, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[Defense counsel] opened the door and specifically implied that Benczeon did not show up and . . . that it was intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Defendants moved for a mistrial and, the following day, one of the prosecutors argued that they had been forced to respond to defense counsel\u2019s implication that Benczeon had been paid for his testimony and then intentionally failed to appear to testify because \u201cthis attack essentially if accepted by the jury completely devastates any credibility that Benczeon Jones\u2019 testimony has. It destroys any credibility of this detective in testifying in this matter, and it impugns both of us as prosecutors in this case suggesting that we have not only paid the witness off in the first trial but then are taking further actions to present the jury that is perjured testimony that is bought and paid for testimony and making sure the witness isn\u2019t here.\u201d Reiterating that the detective was instructed to, and did in fact pause before answering, the prosecutor argued that defense counsel did not object because \u201c[t]hey wanted the opportunity to ask for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">In granting defendants\u2019 motion for mistrial, the court observed that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Branscomb might have given the jury the mistaken impression that Benczeon had chosen not to appear to testify, but the prosecutors easily could have addressed this problem by approaching the bench and asking the court to instruct the jury. The trial court then stated: \u201cNow what is most perplexing of all in this analysis as I went through it for hours last night and hours this morning, I kept asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>myself one thing. Why? Why? Why on earth\u2014why on earth would the district attorney in this circumstance not come before the court and follow that procedure? Although I painfully struggled with that question, I have absolutely no insight into that as I sit here today. None. I can\u2019t imagine that such a thing could have happened under any reasonable scenario. ... I was shocked. I sat there stunned when I heard it. ... I have come to the conclusion that there was reckless disregard to the rights of the defendants in posing this question under the circumstances without it being screened. . . . That is where it went wrong and irretrievably wrong, defying the order of the court, specifically defying the orders of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Prior to the retrial, defendants moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds before the same judge that had presided over the mistrial. One of the prosecutors who had represented the People at the mistrial argued his \u201ctactical decision\u201d to instruct the witness to reveal that Benczeon had been murdered was a \u201cmistake\u201d and admitted he had acted emotionally, but asserted that causing a mistrial was \u201cthe farthest thing from [his] mind.\u201d He believed the trial had been going \u201cextremely well\u201d and the prosecution \u201chad a good chance of obtaining a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, noting that \u201cthe case was going very well for the People.\u201d The court added: \u201c[Although as I have said their conduct was perplexing to me . . .1 honestly do not believe that their conduct occurred because they wanted a mistrial. I think their conduct occurred because they let their emotions run far beyond where they should have ran. And I think they realize that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, footnote 7 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2090], recognized that appellate courts should grant deference to a trial court\u2019s findings concerning a prosecutor\u2019s intent, stating: \u201cIt seems entirely reasonable to expect, therefore, that appellate judges will continue to defer to the judgment of trial judges who are \u2018on the scene\u2019 in this area, and that they will not inexorably reach the same conclusion on a cold record at the appellate stage that they might if any one of them had been sitting as a trial judge.\u201d The majority in the present case acknowledges this standard, but then erroneously relies upon two Court of Appeal decisions that apply a far more stringent standard. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 682-683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The court in <em>Barajas v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 30, 33, footnote 4 [196 Cal.Rptr. 599], without citation to authority, admitted to \u201csome discomfort with the trial court findings\u201d that the prosecutor had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>intended to cause a mistrial, but held: \u201cNonetheless, because we are precluded from weighing the facts, we conclude substantial evidence supports the findings made by the trial court.\u201d Relying upon this footnote in <em>Barajas, </em>the court <em>in People v. Valenzuela-Gonzales </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 728, 736 [241 Cal.Rptr. 114], stated that the trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings on the issue are supported by substantial evidence, and, therefore, dispositive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The Courts of Appeal in <em>Barajas </em>and <em>Valenzuela-Gonzales </em>misstate the standard of review established in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, footnote 7 [102 S.Ct. 2083, 2090]. As the high court held, we must defer to the trial court\u2019s findings but, as we have noted in other contexts, deference is not abdication. <em>(People v. Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 541 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In the present case, as the Court of Appeal correctly noted, there is no doubt the prosecutors knew their misconduct would provoke a mistrial. Several factors make this case unusual. First, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was deliberate and calculated. This was not a rash decision or improper question blurted out in the heat of battle. During a recess, the prosecutor instructed a police officer witness to disregard a direct court order that had been reiterated several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Second, the prosecutor\u2019s deliberate misconduct violated not only a direct court order, but a statute. Evidence Code section 1231.4, of which the prosecutor was aware, requires that when a decedent\u2019s statement is admitted under Evidence Code section 1231, as was Benczeon\u2019s prior testimony, \u201cthe jury may not be told that the declarant died from other than natural causes, but shall merely be told that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Third, it was obvious that this revelation would be a bombshell. The trial court stated it was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201csat there stunned.\u201d A juror broke down in tears upon hearing that Benczeon had been murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Finally, although the trial court concluded that the prosecutor did not intend to cause a mistrial, it admitted that it could not understand the prosecutor\u2019s intentions. Before granting the mistrial, the court questioned why the prosecutor did not approach the bench to discuss the issue, rather than instruct the witness to disobey the court order, stating: \u201cWhy? Why? Why on earth\u2014why on earth would the district attorney in this circumstance not come before the court and follow that procedure? Although I painfully struggled with that question, I have absolutely no insight into that as I sit here today. None. I can\u2019t imagine that such a thing could have happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>under any reasonable scenario. . . Prior to denying the motion to dismiss, the court repeated that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u201cwas perplexing to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Under these circumstances, I have no doubt that the prosecutor intentionally violated both the trial court\u2019s order and Evidence Code section 1231.4 knowing it would provoke a mistrial. Accordingly, retrial is barred by the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The petition of appellant Tracy L. Batts for a rehearing was denied July 30, 2003. George, C. J., and Brown, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
